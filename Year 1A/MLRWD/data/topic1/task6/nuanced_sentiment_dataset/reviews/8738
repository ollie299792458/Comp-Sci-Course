Dark Days, like the first film in the series, loosely follows the plot of the "30 Days of Night" graphic novels, about vampires and humans killing one another against a thematic backdrop of despair and nihilistic vengeance.  In this installment, Stella, the heroine of the first movie (played with robotic melancholy by Lost's Kiele Sanchez, who was doubtless chosen for her resemblance to the actress from the first film) is transplanted from Alaska to LA, where she takes the fight to the night-stalking predators.  Dark Days, like its graphic novel inspiration, eschews the romance of immortality by emphasizing that vampires are not role models.  Here they resemble Romero zombies with fangs rather than cultured aristocrats.

Stella and some young attractive pals (including Matrix Reloaded's Harold Perrineau) hop from one ghoulish underground battle to another, sparing no opportunity to splatter blood and spray gunfire.  But as much as the movie wants to be Blade or Dawn of the Dead, it compromises too much between macho cool and psychological horror to truly succeed at either.

The performances, special effects, and direction are competent, but all these suffer a little from a smaller budget than the first film's.  They couldn't even rope in Josh Hartnett to reprise his role in a five-second cameo, replacing him with another look-alike.  But these faults are forgivable in a direct-to-disc feature, and this format in fact addresses the frustrating lack of gratuitous vampire kills and vampire lore that plagued the original.  Even the making-of featurette feels like satisfying fanservice.  This dark action flick will doubtless lure fans of the series to, um, try a bite.
