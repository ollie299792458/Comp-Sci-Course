...is what Withnail &amp; I is all about. We follow the self-destructive Withnail on a never-ending bender of booze and drugs, as 'I' (Marwood) gets dragged along for the ride. The film follows these two as they confront their horror at the ending of the 70s and decide to get out of London and head "to the country". Two less-suited country dwellers than these could not be found in all of England, and their misadventures and eventual return to the city make up the plot.
Plot isn't where the genius of this film lies, however. The best moments come from the caustic tongue of Withnail, along with the befuddled willingness of Marwood, and the rampant campiness of Uncle Monty. All three have their weaknesses and peccadilloes, and these are revealed through some of the most wondrously amusing, creative scenes and lines of dialogue ever recorded. Quotes from the film stick in the mind as moments of sadness, illumination, hippy-wonder and humour. No "Three best lines from Withnail &amp; I" lists would contain the same line.
As a comedy, a 'turn of an era' documentary and as a character-study (based on real people), this film succeeds on every level. To watch it is to love it.
