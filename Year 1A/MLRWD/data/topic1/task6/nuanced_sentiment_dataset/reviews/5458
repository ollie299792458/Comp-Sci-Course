Take Name of The Rose, A Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel and put it in soap opera format and this what you get.  There was entirely too many characters in this movie, and too much going on to really get into this movie. Also, I found many of the charaters to be flat stock characters who really had no backstory what so ever. The script was stiff and the acting was strange, especially at times coming from F. Murray Abraham who generally in such a genuis of an actor. Would the viceroy of Peru really break down into a fit of tears? Another actor I just could not understand in the movie was Robert Deneiro. I just couldn't Goodfellas and Analyze This out of my head to get used to him as a 18th Century Archbishop of Lima. They might as well cast Al Pacino. Another actor that I was a bit disappointed by was Gabriel Bryne, he is so passionateless in this movie, when he is generally a genius of an actor. One of the only good parts of this movie is the costumes/settings, but beyond that, I just couldn't get in to it.
