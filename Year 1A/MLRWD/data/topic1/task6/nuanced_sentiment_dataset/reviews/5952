First let me start by confessing: I can watch some very eccentric slow moving foreign films with subtitles and I can be as cynical as I can be romantic-sometimes disgustingly sentimental (as in getting misty over a few tv commercials.) But this one bombed in the first 10 minutes for me. In a word:BORING. Where do people get off giving it 5 stars!!!!!! Even 4????  The end was an unforgivable and UN-swalowable deus ex machina (forced ending) And the premise that an exit was available with the eyes of the law encircling (escape or not you'll have to watch the film)...very doubtful at best--and really I'm okay with suspension of disbelief I'm a registered voter.

I can enjoy fantasy and mythology as much as the next eternal child, let's start with Splash or the original 60's Twilight Zone, Whale Rider, Blade Runner, 2001, Flash Gordon...  For Romantic: the original Cyrano de Bergerac Jose Ferrer),  King of Hearts(romantic and improbable), The Other Sister...  I could go on for two pages but who's got time? The people that loved Ondine loved it...you might love it also--professionally done melodrama starring selkie lore(variation on mermaid) with two actors as attractive as the setting, bon appetit, il monstro

p.s.
As far as Colin Farrell's performance see him In Bruges for a real treat.
