I TURNED DOWN THE CHANCE OF SEEING THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT LOOKED BORING. HAVING NOW SEEN IT ON VIDEO, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! I LOVED WOODY'S EARLY COMEDIES SUCH AS SLEEPER AND LOVE AND DEATH AND I HAD GOTTEN TIRED OF HIS RECENT MORE SERIOUS MOVIES. SMALL TIME CROOKS IS REFRESHING, FUNNY AND VERY MEMORABLE. JUST LOVE THE CAST, THE STORY, THE MANY UNEXPECTED PLOT-TWISTS, AND THE SETS ARE TERRIFIC TOO. ALSO LOVE THE TACKY ART AND DECOR FAVOURED BY FRENCHY AND RAY IN HIS CHEESY WHITE SUITS IS A CRACK-UP. TRACY ULLMAN IS OH SO PERFECTLY CAST, AND I JUST LURVE THE CHEMISTY THAT BUBBLES BETWEEN HER AND DAVID, THE SNOBBY ART CRITIC, AS WELL AS THE ACIDIC RELATIONSHIP THAT BLOSSOMS BETWEEN RAY AND MAE (POSSIBLY MAE'S PERFORMANCE IS THE MOST OUTSTANDING ONE IN THE WHOLE FILM). ALL IN ALL A VERY ENJOYABLE ROMP, A VISUAL FEAST, WITH A WITTY, HONEST AND ASCERBIC SCRIPT. IT MIGHT BE COMEDY, BUT TO ME IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH INTERIORS, ANNIE HALL AND CRIMES AND MISDEAMEANOURS. THANK YOU MR ALLEN, THE WORLD WOULD BE A POORER PLACE WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR INGENIUS FILMS. SEE IT!
