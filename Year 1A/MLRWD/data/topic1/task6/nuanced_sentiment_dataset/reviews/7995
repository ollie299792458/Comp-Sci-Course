As a man in my twenties I had many fond memories of watching it when it first aired.  I had many of the action figures, clothes, and comic books in addition to it being the one show I must watch on Saturday.  I thought it instilled in me a good sense of the environment and how we must be accountable to it.

That said, after revisiting the series via Youtube a few months ago I must confess like many of my boyhood heroes, it has fallen.  Particularly disturbing is the episode in season one entitled "Population Bomb" which actually promotes birth control.  Regardless on where one stands on the issue, the fact that a cartoon is taking an active stand on an issue that really should be made by adults seems a bit disturbing.  I know I have no desire for my six-year-old to watch any program that says "when it is your turn to have a family, keep it small."  We don't need to have a conversation as how him having a new sister is not going to do irreparable harm on the environment.  Needless to say I don't think this series will be added to the DVD rack at home.
