I am an Agatha Christie Miss Marple fan, but Margaret Rutherford took Miss Marple to new heights.  Totally enjoyable, she had Miss Marple going undercover, fighting with swords, dancing the twist, besides being cerebral at discovering the murderer of each mystery.  She may be older and as one reviewer said wore outfits in plus size, but she was very active and wasn't afraid to use a bit of comedy along with solving mysteries.  An added treat was Miss Marple's friend and sidekick, Stringer Davis, who in real life was Margaret's husband.

Her four Miss Marple mysteries was done in the sixties and all in black and white.  I thought this would take away from the stories, but instead was impressed with just how clear the black and white was, especially on an HD television.  And, I dearly loved the packaging of the 4 dvds, using cartoon like drawings, did not take away from the fun and seriousness of the stories.  The actors in these stories were excellent and the music!  So bright and cheery and using a harpsicord most the time, it just fit perfect.

I have this Miss Marple movie collection sitting out for all to see because it makes me smile to see it and I don't mind watching the four movies again and again and wish there had been more.  Margaret Rutherford certainly added to our Miss Marple and I'm so glad I found the collection on Amazon and bought it.
