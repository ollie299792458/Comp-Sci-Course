Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search "melies flicker alley" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too. The DVDs actually look better than the color version here.
