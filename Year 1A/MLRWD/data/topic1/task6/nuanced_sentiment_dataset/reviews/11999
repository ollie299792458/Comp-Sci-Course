This film is so incredibly well made I don't know where to begin. I was so touched and emotionally ravaged by this movie that it almost left me speechless. The performances are top notch. The realism is on point. Its brutal and bleak, but beautiful at the same time. The story is frighteningly simple: a man, just starting a wonderful life with his gorgeous wife and child, winds up having to defend his family from an intruder who breaks into his home in the middle of the night. In the adrenaline-fueled moment, he chases the intruder on his front lawn with a baseball bat and swipes, accidently killing him. Because he was the one doing the chasing, the homicide detectives charge him with murder. The man winds up in prison with the most brutal criminals around: Nazi lowriders (hoping to get "promoted" to Aryan Brotherhood), Latino gangsters, black gangbangers, etc etc. The guards, we soon learn, are just as if not more sadistic than the inmates (led by a chillingly awesome performance by Harold Perrineau, some may remember him as Augustus Hill on OZ -this role is an obvious nod) as they love to stage gladiator fights on the yard. Our hero is clearly in a world that he is alien to but soon starts to succumb to the violence as the White inmates take advantage of him. Future clearly doesn't look good, until he becomes cellmates with older, prison-wise lifer Val Kilmer (in his best performance since 'Heat', in my opinion) who schools him on prison politics and teaches him the ropes.

Shocking, realistic story should be watched by every single American male regardless of race, creed, ethnicity. A wake up call - the scary part is its all so terribly true.

I'll shut up now. Just do yourself a favor and watch FELON. ASAP.

5 Stars.
