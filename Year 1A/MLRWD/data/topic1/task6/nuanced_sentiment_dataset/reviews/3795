I bought this dvd based on all the 5-star reviews and because of Ravi Singh whose Yoga for Life video I enjoy immensely.  The yoga/breathing segment is good, and the dancing, while much too unstructured for my liking, did give me a decent workout.  But I found the production to be quite cheesy and ultimately distracting.  First, the voiceovers.  I saw no good reason why both Ana and Ravi had to do them, especially since they often spoke at the same time and over each other.  It should have been just Ravi speaking, while Ana did the demonstrating.  Second, the round pink shag rug she used instead of a yoga mat and the flower pattern on the floor was simply ridiculous.  Who decorated the set?  A ten year old girl?  Finally, my biggest complaint was the fact that Ana kept changing into different outfits (which was really just underwear) throughout the length of the video.  She even changed her hairstyle a few times.  This just felt too much like a vanity piece for Ana and had none of the authenticity you would want from an exercise dvd.
