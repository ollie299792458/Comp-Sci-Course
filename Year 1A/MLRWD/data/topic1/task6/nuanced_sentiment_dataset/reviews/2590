Five stars for the show; one star for the video quality. The video on this DVD set is blurry and of very poor quality. Compared to my other TV show DVDs I own or have seen (Jericho, Firefly, and The Office), I literally feel like I'm watching a VHS tape version of Primeval, which is a shame because the show is really good. I've been watching recorded episodes of Primeval on my (non-HD) Dish Network DVR and didn't like how the video was blurry and lacked detail, so I ordered the Primeval DVD set on Netflix. I excitedly put the first DVD in my nice Sony upscaling Blu-ray/DVD player and was very disappointed to find the exact same awful video quality as my recorded shows. Both the DVDs from the first season were the same. I haven't yet received the second season, but I don't have much hope for that one either.

The show is still very good and worth watching, but its not worth the 40 bucks it costs in the store, or even the 35 bucks they want want for it here, unless you don't mind watching VHS quality video.

I was hoping to find this series on Blu-ray, but apparently the video master is so poor I doubt they will ever be able to produce a 1080p or even a 1080i transfer.
