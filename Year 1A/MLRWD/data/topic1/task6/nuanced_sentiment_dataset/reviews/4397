As a depiction of history, this film of "The Charge of the Light Brigade" is considerably more accurate than the Errol Flynn film of the late 1930's.  The costumes are, for the most part authentic, and the military material is drawn from real events, even if there are some alterations (such as the actual victim in the "black bottle" incident) made evidently for the sake of brevity and drama.  Once nice touch is that the actual number of men and horse (670) who actually participated in the Charge were in fact used in this re-creation of the event, so the viewer does have some sense of how things actually looked.  Where the film most flagrantly departs from history is in the interaction of some of the characters, depicting for example a sexual liaison between Lord Cardigan and Fanny Duberly, something which never happened.  Made in the late 1960's the film had a very definitely anti-imperialistic ideological agenda, but is still a worthwhile depiction of the mid-Nineteenth Century British Army at war.  Trevor Howard is excellent as a blockhead Lord Cardigan.
