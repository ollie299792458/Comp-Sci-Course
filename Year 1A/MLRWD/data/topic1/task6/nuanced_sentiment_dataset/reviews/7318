There was a missing element in this supposed thriller.  The mystery was all but completely obvious, and even then our heroine, Ruby, goes mainly on suspicion and eavesdropping.  Her sleuthing skills are minimal and I felt the process of discovery was forced, random, and left much to be desired.  A thriller slowly and steadily reveals the predicament the victim is in rather than have it, literally, walk right through the front door.  You basically dislike and suspect the antagonists from the beginning so it's no shock when things start to go downhill.
Much of the story is predictable, but the suspense is still exciting.  I wish the back story of the Glass' was developed better.  The culmination of multiple threads at the end is satisfying and creative.
My criticism out of the way, the acting was actually very good and the suspense had me on the edge of my seat.  So for pure entertainment value, this was acceptable.  And Leelee is excellent as the moody teenage heroine playing Ruby with the right amount of suspicion, arrogance, and ignorance.
