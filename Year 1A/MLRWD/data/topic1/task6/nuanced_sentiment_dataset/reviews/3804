We got this movie because my mom always talked about having seen it as a child (born in 1916).  She loved it then, and wanted so badly to see it again.  So we purchased it on Amazon - even got the special edition so it might have better audio & video, since her sight &  hearing aren't what they used to be.  We excitedly put it on for her, and proceeded to be bored out of our skulls (all of us, including her) for the entire duration of the movie!  I'm sure this might be great for a silent movie afficionado, but we couldn't wait for it to get over.

The "bonus short feature" however was hilarious.  It too is a silent movie, but even now, nearly a century after it was made, it is still very funny.  Unfortunately, it does have some very blatently racist scenes, typical of the times in which it was made.  But even those few scenes managed to be humorous, despite the distasteful racist stereotyping and patronization.  I believe that even most African Americans whom I know would find them comical (and it doesn't hurt that in at least one scene the black butler is the only one with any common sense, while the po' white folk run around in histerical terror).

If you're looking for a scare, or even an enjoyable look into the past, I would pass on this one unless you're a silent movie buff.  That is, of course, unless you're willing to pay the full price for the short feature.  Enjoy!
