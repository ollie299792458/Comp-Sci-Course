(8/21/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray release, 4 stars for the movie) What gives with Olive Films? I was very disappointed to see them release two of my favorites of American cinema, The Mountain and High Noon, with no English subtitles or closed captions, and now they've done the same with this classic sci-fi/psychological thriller. Whether Olive Films opts to produce Blu-rays with few or no extras is a business decision on their part. But closed captions are a necessity for millions of cinephiles with impaired hearing, and the lack of captions is probably a deal-breaker for countless others like me who often watch movies at low volume with the captions turned on or who are non-native English speakers. If for no other reason than solidarity with those having impaired hearing, I won't knowingly purchase DVDs without closed captions, and I hope that these bad Olive Films releases won't discourage other studios from entering the market with decent releases of their own that include subtitles/closed captions.
