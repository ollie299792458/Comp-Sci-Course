I will start by saying that I have never heard of the book, but after watching the film I think I shall have to read it.  Yes, this is one of those rare movies that makes you say such a thing - simply wonderful.  Now then, on to the review (without giving away the plot)...

This film has a little bit of something for everybody.  It contains a classic fairytale formula - royalty, a beautiful girl, and of course some ugly villains!  It's a fantasy to be sure - swords and sorcery, horses and castles, surrealy-beautiful landscapes.  And it is a rollicking adventure that spans land, air and sea.  Top it all off with some very heartwarming romance and a kind of ephemeral beauty, and you've got a most unusual - and surprisingly enthralling - film of surprisingly good depth.

This is a beautiful film.  It is well suited to couples, but I strongly suspect that any thoughtful individual will find it to be an enchanting experience that will haunt their thoughts for quite some time.  There are comments on humanity in general and love in particular in this film that transcend the screen.  Perhaps a wee bit heady for the very very young - but certainly appropriate for teenagers and up.

In short - this is a gem of a film.  Do yourself a favor: make 2 hours of time in which you won't be interrupted, settle down on a comfortable couch, and savor the experience of a film that doesn't feel like it was made in Hollywood.
