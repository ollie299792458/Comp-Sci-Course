Mildly disappointed at the same ol' same ol' treatment of anyone with conservative views as mean, stupid, or hard hearted, I did like the examination of the funeral industry, mores about death and dying, and the lives of funeral directors. The very course language, free-wheeling sexual escapades, extreme drug use serve to remind everyone that this funeral home is a product of its California culture..... where all things that smack of 'alternative' are good and all things traditional are bad. The main characters---Nate and Brenda are the sanest of them all thanks to Brenda's counter-culture hippy therapist parents (and her degrees in social work). The mother and father of the family are caught in some kind of time warp.....the father looks like a throw back to the rat pack and the mother from June Cleaver's 50's. I realized with a start that these two--the matriarch and patriarch of the family are MY AGE when they briefly mentioned the father's three year tour as a medic in Vietnam and his collection of 60's psychedelic music on vinyl mixed with big band sounds. I don't know one Vietnam Veteran who wears a Fedora Hat.
The part of David, the gay brother who runs the funeral home, is juciest of all--- conflicted, self-loathing, religious yet doubtful, and yet all-too-adventurous leads the viewer to inevitably worry about David's sanity and safety. Yet, by the end of the season, the viewer must see that the one who seems so healthy and sure might be the next one to end up dead in a box without really knowing the fulfillment of life. Mildly preachy, we see alternative life styles and personalities with free and easy mores and values as somehow superior to deeply held beliefs. Even Ruth, the mom, becomes a wildcat.
My favorite character is Federicko---as he sees life as a whole and enjoys his work. Very refreshing these days. He carries this show and is the only person on it with whom I can relate.
Only in California.
