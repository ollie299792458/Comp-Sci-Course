Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this superb sequel to the great "Bourne Identity*.This movie starts pretty much where the previous one left off, with Bourne trying to live a simply life in the quiet village of Goa, India with Marie (Franka Potente of "Run Lola Run", "Blow", and "Anatomy"). and trying to piece together his nightmares and memories of his still mostly forgotten life. But shortly thereafter he is found by an assassin resulting in the death of a loved one, so now true to his word that "if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep." from the previous film, he again must take up arms and see to it that the people responsible must pay.

Whereas while going into the first film wondering and slightly hesitant to know if Matt Damon could pull an action film role off, I want into "Supremecy" knowing that this was one part Damon was born to play and he didn't disappoint. In fact all the actors, from Brian Cox all the way down to Franka Potente played their parts with equal aplomb. And the game of cat and mouse was both thrilling as well as captivating, if there was one major flaw in this film, it would have to be the way that certain fight sequences were filmed, at times borderline incomprehensible, it almost took me out of the film. Shame because the rest of the film is truly fantastic.
