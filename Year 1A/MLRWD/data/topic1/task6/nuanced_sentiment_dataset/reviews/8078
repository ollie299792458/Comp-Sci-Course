Deep Space Nine is great space opera in every sense of the word. Characters large and small, issues religious and profane, technology overarching and absent... Deep Space Nine has it all, and more.  I really like this show, and seeing it again after so many years--and in back to back batches--only serves to shine a brighter light on the deep and continuous character development, political maneuvering, and violence that exists outside flat Earth.

And speaking of Earth, it's only now, seeing this show again, do I get a sense of how bored I might be living on Earth in their 24th century!  With 99% of the problems solved, what's left to live for?  Maybe all that's really left is exploring (and proselytizing), and perhaps rather than being full of idealists, Starfleet actually attracts a sizeable chunk of the disaffected? Think about it: No money needed; no poverty or hunger; diseases are often surmountable, population numbers under control, etc., etc. For any Earth-born human who doesn't want to "push papers" or don the uniform, all the good stuff is somewhere else. We get the Starfleet senior officers or alien officials, but they're in it for the long haul, so what about everyone else?

That's where Deep Space Nine shows us more of the real life on the frontier, the lives of merchants and traders, life in the colonies, and with the Maquis. By gradually constructing a picture of the many peoples involved over time, Deep Space Nine demonstrates that although it may float in the cold black of space, it's teeming with life.
