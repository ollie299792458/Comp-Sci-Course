There were once two scripts.  One really wonderful script that examined how we become who we are and what it would be like to share our very essence with another person.  And, oh yeah, there was this other script that called "Seven Shining Silences as the Clock Ticks". The second script was approved for production, but in a valiant but failed effort to avoid making a complete formulaic abomination, the producers did the following:
1. Took key concepts from the great script and included them as one-line sound-bytes buried in the produced script.
2. They hired Tarsem to direct.
3. They hired Jennifer Lopez to star.
Unfortunately, their hamburger surgery did nothing at all to save this formulaic loser.
It is a beautiful loser, though.  Tarsem rips off Stanley Kubrick decently, and the production design is interesting and colorful.  Much of the imagerey in the "internal" sequences is really neat. 
Actingwise, Lopez can actually act well enough to make me look forward to seeing her in a really substatial film.
Vince Vaughn fans - he's in straight "character actor" mode (no fault of his own - except for one minor conversation with Lopez, he's got zippo decent dialog) so don't get your hopes up. His character is part of the formula-thriller script, and so has a hard time functioning as a supporting character, especially since his story arc is MUCH less interesting than Lopez' (and hers isn't that great either). Vincent D'Onofrio is, unfortunately, not really given a whole lot to work with.  His character is so over-the-top that he never becomes really menacing.  The script relies on the "weird" production design way too much to tell the audience we should be scared. Hollywood needs to relearn what "atmosphere" is all about.
I really wanted to like this flick, but alas - it was not to be. Definitely worth a rental on a slow night, though.
