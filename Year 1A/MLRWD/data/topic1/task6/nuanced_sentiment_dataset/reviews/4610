I should've known not to order this version.  Alice In Wonderla?  The transfer is the worst in my DVD collection.  Horrible picture quality (reminds me of a reel-to-reel projector) and only slightly better sound.  It's a shame too.  I remember this little gem of a musical from my childhood.  I was about 6 years old when it came out.  For me, Fiona Fullerton became the definative "Alice".  She really is wonderful...with that lilting little voice.  In fact, the entire cast stands out.  I love every minute of it.  I hope this gets re-re-released someday with total restoration in widescreen and dolby-whatever!  I'll buy it again.  In the meantime I'll watch this version regardless of how crappy it's presentation.  I do think I will avoid any DVDs by Platinum Disc Corp.  Do I smell somebody looking to make a quick buck?  At least I expect the picture quality to be better than a bad EP VHS recording!  I'd be interested in knowing if the quality of the VHS is better.  Anybody? 
Anyway, DVD gets 1.5 stars...the movie itself is 4.5 stars (if you didn't grow up with this sort of thing then avoid this movie at all costs.  For me, "Alice" is up there with Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and The Chocolote Factory).  By the way, children should love the manic pace.  It's a blast!  
Another note:  watching this I was reminded of the shows I used to watch at the time.  Sid and Marty Krofft (Pufnstuf) and so forth must have been inspired by this...or the other way around.
