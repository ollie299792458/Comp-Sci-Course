I know alot of critics and reviewers here haven't been kind to this movie but I saw it in the theater and bought a copy of the DVD and I really liked it. You have to take the movie for what it is...a romantic comedy not a potential Oscar winner.

This is basically a Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez movie. I'm not a huge fan of either actress but they were both good in their roles. You could tell that Fonda really enjoyed playing the part of the crazy mother-in-law to be. Michael Vartan as Kevin is very handsome and charming but like I said this movie as basically about Fonda and Lopez so he isn't given alot to do. Wanda Sykes as Ruby is hilarious.

It's worth purchasing the DVD for just the extra's. The gag reel is hilarious and they do some entertaining "featurettes" on each actor. Some of the deleted scenes were actually very good and should have been left in the movie.

I would definitely recommend buying this movie...it's one you can watch over and over again.
