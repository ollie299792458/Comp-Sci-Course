One of the more frustrating blu rays that I've ever purchased.

I have had the DVD version of the film for a few years, and had gotten the DVD from my collection and was comparing the features listed on the backs of both boxes. I put the blu ray in and settled in to see what kind of improvement in picture and sound quality that the blu ray was going to have.

When the film started, I actually had to get up and make sure that I had, in fact, inserted the blu ray into my player, and not my old DVD version. I literally could not tell a difference in quality. This went on for a few minutes, and then the picture became very clear and had a slight improvement in quality...then it went back to DVD quality. I am about 45 minutes into the film and it keeps doing this. It honestly looks like an upscaled DVD in image quality.

After only 45 minutes, however, I have seen enough scratches and specks in the film to tell myself that this was not worth upgrading to blu ray from DVD. It doesn't appear that the film was restored or remastered for a blu ray release. The only thing I can really say that I noticed is that it seems to be a bit brighter than the DVD, which isn't necessarily a good thing because it makes the low budget makeup effects stand out more...you can see where the makeup stops and the real flesh begins.

The blu ray has nothing additional in the line of extras from the DVD that I already had, and the sound and picture quality are not enough of a difference to warrant an upgrade. If you have the special edition DVD that was released by Anchor Bay, this really is no improvement. If you have the Millennium Edition DVD that was put out prior to the Anchor Bay release, it has features that were not carried over to the blu ray.
