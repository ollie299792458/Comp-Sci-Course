This movie GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES , is so enjoyable, it never

let's you down. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell make a perfect

combination. The scene where they take off the pants of Malone

is hilarious. What I really enjoyed most is Marilyn reciting her

poem, which goes like this:

  I once knew a man called Sidney,

  Who drank 'til he ruined a kidney,

  he drank and he drank,

  and it shrank and it shrank,

  he had his fun doing it,

  now didnt't he?

The Diamonds are a girl's best friend number with Marilyn is pure

glamour. One can not stop looking at her. Her beauty is unique.

I hope that one day they will release a soundtrack CD of this

movie with all the music, including the instrumental music. And

please include Marilyn's poem "I once knew a man called Sidney.."

Her singing is most enjoyable. And to Jayne Russell, to quote

from the movie, " Dorothy, you were also good. - Thanks Gus, said

Dorothy ( Jane Russell)". Enjoy it.
