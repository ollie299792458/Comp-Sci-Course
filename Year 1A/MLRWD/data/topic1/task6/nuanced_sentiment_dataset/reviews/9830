The legend of Fa Mulan was one of my favorite stories as a Chinese-American growing up in San Francisco some decades ago. I now live abroad and generally make it back to the Bay Area every summer. The year that "Mulan" was released, I didn't get to San Francisco until after its initial theatrical run. I did find it at a smaller neighborhood theater and my father immediately agreed to see it with me. To my great surprise, what we saw was a special version dubbed in Cantonese. My Chinese wasn't good enough to catch most of it, but I could understand enough to not have to pester my father with questions throughout the movie. About halfway through, he asked if I could recognize the voice of the captain. I couldn't, and with a smile he told me it was Jackie Chan. My father passed away almost three years ago, so that is now a very cherished memory. However, leaving it at that would diminish the impact that the movie had on me on its own merits: I was very impressed by its depiction of the rite of passage against enormous odds of a conflicted protagonist who just happened to be a non-Caucasian. Eddie Murphy was outstanding, Jerry Goldsmith contributed one of his last great scores, and my father didn't complain TOO much about the watering down of the original story. As entertaining as "Kung-Fu Panda" is, it absolutely pales in comparison to the style and grace of "Mulan." And Jackie Chan's part is much meatier anyway!
