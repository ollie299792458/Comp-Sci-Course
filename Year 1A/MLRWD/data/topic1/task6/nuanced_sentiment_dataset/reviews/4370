Did anyone notice the similarities between Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes to Bridget's time in Thailand?  I found the wonderbra scene particularly inane and it seemed to downplay the seriousness of the imprisoned women's condition while Bridget unrealistically skips out of prison like a Catholic schoolgirl.  It just tried too hard to be humorous in the wrong places and didn't capitalize on what could have been genuinely funny.  It seemed to be one of those sequels that plays off of the funny moments from the first movie instead of creating new humor.  Also, while Daniel Cleaver was a likeable cad in the first movie, he comes off as a genuine fool in the second.  Bridget was adorable in the first movie, but just plain dumpy in this one - I couldn't figure out what Mark saw in her.  Like another reviewer said, she failed as an "everywoman."  I could identify with her in the first movie, but if I could identify with her in this one, I would be embarrassed to admit it.  Further, Rebecca was unrecognizable (from her book character) and what kind of horrible friend is Shaza?

That being said, this movie wasn't unwatchable as far as entertainment value goes.  Mark Darcy was still great though the fight scene was silly and forced.  Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant were tolerable.  Renee seemed to be a bit more of a poseur and not as "real" as her original Bridget character, but she wasn't terrible.  I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Bridget fanatic and who liked the first movie.  I am a big fan of the first movie and book, and so found this movie disappointing.
