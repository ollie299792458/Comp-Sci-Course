I saw Food, Inc. several days ago and many of the images still haunt me.  The essence of this movie is how food production in America has gone from being locally produced to being controlled by multi-national corporations.  The upside of this is that food is cheaper and more plentiful.  This movie examines the downside, which is horrifying.

All livestock (including fish) are now fed some sort of corn meal, regardless of whether this is what the would eat under ordinary circumstances.  For example, cows eat grass.  If they eat something else, it causes extra bacteria, including e-coli to grow in its stomach.  To treat this they are given antibiotics.  Milking cows are fed hormones to speed up milk production.  Chickens are fed so much corn to fat them up many cannot walk and they break their legs trying.  Or the legs get infected and they are given antibiotics.  One chicken farmer showed a "typical" day in the coop where she would go in and scoop up a dozen dead birds and through them on a gargabe heap. Lest it sound one sided, the large corporations were invited to participate in the movie and declined.

While parts of this movie are difficult to watch, ultimately it ends on a high note that we, as the consumer, have the power to change food production processes.  As one farmer pointed out, you wouldn't buy the cheapest car or the cheapest clothes, so why apply the same philosophy to the purchase and consumption of food.

Simply put, this movie will change your life.
