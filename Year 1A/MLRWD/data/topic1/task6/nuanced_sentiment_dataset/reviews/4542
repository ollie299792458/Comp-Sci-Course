Julieanne Moore is a woman who is on the brink of insanity. She can't get over the thought of losing her son who died in a plane crash years ago. Still, she has pictures of him and other parafanilia from his room to keep reminding her. Then one day, it's all gone. She blames her husband, then she consults her shrink, and when she starts getting closer to the truth,  things really get wierd.

I won't spoil the punchline to the whole movie, but after knowing what it was since the trailer came out it seems like an episode of the X-files all over again. Still, it's not too bad.

If you're looking for a psychological thriller, don't look here. If, instead, you're the kind of person who likes to jump out of your seat when the DTS sound crashes a car or sucks people into the air with sonic booms, this is for you. If anything, this may be considered a scary film, if you're actually scared by that sort of thing. Otherwise, it may just be considered exceedingly loud.

While I'm personally not into those sort of films, the directing of this is a pretty nice piece of work. The cinematography tells you just how the protagonist feels, especially as she walks across the bridge, and there's a unspoken thing going on between Telly and Ash, but nothing is actually shown. Maybe they're secret lovers, maybe they are really married, who knows. However, Joseph Ruben has come a long way from Money Train and The Forgotten is at least worth seeing.
