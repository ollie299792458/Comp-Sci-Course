i first saw this movie at a birthday slumber-party when i was twelve years old. the parents of the birthday girls (twins) actually picked it out for us because they didn't want us watching something "too scary" (like the infamous freddy or jason flicks).
first of all, its not that sleepaway camp doesn't measure up to these movies in terms of freakyness. in fact, i found sleepaway camp to be even creepier. but the fact remains that the movie box looked harmless, and the film was virtually unknown.
the plot seems simple. at first. two cousins go off to summer camp, the pair meet with conflict from other campers/councellors, largely due to little angela's anti-social nature, and killings start to happen, one after another.
complexities: the mysterious begining, with TWO fathers and two children killed in a boating accident. the creepy aunt, who seems like the perfect serial killer. the fact that the identity of the killer remains unknown throughout the film. the back-flashes which become more frequent near the very end, scenes with the aunt, and the two fathers in bed together. and finally, the shocker ending. which blew my socks off when i was twelve years old. an image very difficult to remove from ones mind. in my opinion, one of the creepiest endings ever created.
sleepaway camp is cheesy, yes. but it is also creepy, which is hard to come by in this genre of film. i recommend this movie to anyone who loves 80's horror and who is looking for something a little different.
