What can one say about a good movie? Quality is quite good, picture elements have been restored as best as they can be, which is not too bad.

My main gripe with this film (as I have with most other silent films on DVD) is that they are projected AT THE WQRONG SPEED! This speeded-up action really does take away from the quality of the film, as well as the seriousness of the drama. (This film was recorded at 20 frames per second [fps] but is shown at 24 fps, thereby lousing up the rhythm of this near-masterpiece!!)

There are two versions in this set: the American version, which runs 116 minutes, and the German version which runs only 106 minutes. The German version has subtitles in the intertitles, which can be bothersome to watch. (The quality of the German version is slightly less than the American version.)

The music for the American version is heroic indeed, performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra; the German version is performed -- I think -- very blandly by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Music-wise, the American version's music is vastly superior!

So, all in all, I really can recommend this film, despite the shortdomings of too-fast projection. The acting is good, and the "special effects" work is nicely done, too. A worthy addition to any cinephile's library!
