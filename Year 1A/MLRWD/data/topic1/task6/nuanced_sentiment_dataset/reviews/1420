I was tremendously disappointed with this movie. I expected so much more from a cast that includes Tom Hanks, Emily Blunt, and John Malkovich. I found all the road trips Troy (Colin Hanks) and Buck (John Malkovich) were on to be very tedious and the magic shows were very tedious as well. You only see Tom Hanks in this movie for a grand total of 5 minutes it seems. I wanted to see more of the father-son storyline of real life father and son Tom and Colin Hanks. And not enough Emily Blunt in this movie either. The storyline of the romance between her character and Troy didn't seem realistic and had no build up to it. Emily Blunt did however rebound with the hidden gem Sunshine Cleaning and the very awesome 2010 hit movie The Wolfman. The only part of this movie I really like is John Malkovich playing a different role for once. I mean he plays a terrific bad guy in movies like Con Air and Knockaround Guys. But to see him playing a washed up mentalist is a good change of pace. And I laughed out loud every time he talked out the words to the song "What The World Needs Is Love". The change of pace performance for Malkovich and the "What The World Needs Is Love" scenes are the only reasons I'm giving this film 2 stars and not 1 star. There is a scene in the movie where the writer has an article entitled "The Not So Great Buck Howard." Truer words could have not been spoken!
