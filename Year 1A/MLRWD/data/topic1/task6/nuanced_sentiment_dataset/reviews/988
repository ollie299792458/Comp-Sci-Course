Buio Omega is sick, twisted, and just plain weird. Itâ(tm)s also highly corny, complete with lame dialogue (â~Make love to me before I die!â(tm)), funny looking cars and a stereotypical 1970s synthpop soundtrack that contrasts the gore. Despite this, itâ(tm)s highly effective in evoking fear. Eccentric Cinema states in the opening of its review: "Folks, this one may make you barf," and indeed, it might. 1 Most of its themes are taboo (cannibalism, necrophilia), but it is a fun, if not for the weak-stomached, ride. It should be advised that a viewer should not eat before, after, or during this one unless a given person has a Herculean stomach of steel.
This Italian slasher from 1979 tells the tale of a very demented 22 year old orphan named Frank, who after the sudden death of his fiancÃ©e, Anna (by heart failure after a voodoo curse was put on her by Frank's jealous housekeeper), steals her corpse from her grave and preserves it in his mansion, a-la Norman Bates. (Frank did a better job.) Similarly in Psycho, Frank lures attractive women into his home- and later slaughters them. Though Norman Bates isnâ(tm)t seductive enough to even attempt scoring with Marion Crane (while Frank gets his freak on), he does win the lunatic award, and Frank is the reigning champion of sadism.
Norman Bates doesnâ(tm)t have any help with his bloodbath, unlike Frank. Iris, Frankâ(tm)s housekeeper, is his partner-in-crime. She assists him in keeping the girls from getting too close to his beloved creep-doll upstairs- with the exception of a suspicious detective who meets Frank in a funeral parlor. Mini-spoiler: Thereâ(tm)s a not-so-sexy wannabe Romeo & Juliet double murder in the end.
Perverse enough? One would think not. Included in the viscerally grotesque scenes are acid baths, disembowelment, de-fingernailization (is there even a real word for that?), cannibalism (including sounds that will make viewers gag) and (implied) necrophilia. Gross enough yet? Horror fans, eat your heart out.
How far can one director push the horror limits? Apparently Joe Dâ(tm)Amato, the creator of this blood-pumping masterpiece, attempts to- as no scenes are left to the imagination. He presents the gore on the screen at all times. He states in an interview with Projecta, âaeWhen itâ(tm)s fantasy, you can do all the special effects you want to doâ. 2
It's no wonder that he testified in court to prove that the scenes depicted in the film were simulated and not snuff. Because of this, disclaimers are thrown into the beginning credits informing watchers that the events were not real. Good thing he won his case, because otherwise it would remain on the ban list, like it is in countries such as Germany and Italy.2
While some horror-lovers may be poked by a funny stick while watching, others maybe fearful that dear old Iris will kill them in the night (the author confesses that she was one of the latter). As Buio Omega focuses on the visceral and Psycho on the psychological, they both successfully scare their audiences. Buio Omega is the all out champion of the blood and guts fest, but Psycho will disturb the psyche more in the long run. Shower, [...]
