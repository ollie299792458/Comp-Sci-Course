...it ruined my whole evening. And I paid $9.99 for it based on the actors. What a waste.

1. What were they trying to do? They were trying to do a movie based on a book that I never read by some guy who's a novelist/math PhD that got away with writing a story attempting in vain to integrate math with a murder mystery. A lot of it looked to me like it was meant to be a chance for Elijah Wood to look smart and heterosexual. Hell, I don't know what they were trying to do. I really tried to see what it was, but I have no clue.

2. How well was it done? Well, despite the fact that I really don't know what they were trying to do, it held my interest for well over an hour. Wondering how far Wood would go to show he's heterosexual kept me going, but he didn't go far enough. As for the rest of the actors in the movie, I have no idea why they bothered to learn lines and show up for filming.

3. Was it worth doing? No. If the book was better, it's hard to believe this movie won't kill further sales of the book. There were parts of this story that were very interesting, but every time you get interested, the plot subverts your interest with a nearly incomprehensible twist that's not just unbelievable, it's also neither sad nor inspirational. Not hard to believe that the point of the story is to leave it's audience flat and confused.
