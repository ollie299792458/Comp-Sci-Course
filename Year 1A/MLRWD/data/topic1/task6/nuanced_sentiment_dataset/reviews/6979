Firstly, I would like to address those criticizing the film for inaccuracies. Many of these people have cited their experience in the Orthodox community. If this is the case then these people should know better than anyone else, that Orthodox Judaism is a very broad term. Your experience may not be remotely like the experience of someone from the Haredi sect. Also, if you were remotely close to being as conservative as the Charedi you wouldn't be writing a review on Amazon.

Having said that, this is not a documentary. I'm sure some of it is sensationalized but, I'm not convinced that parts of it aren't true. Men like Meir, Meir's Rabbi father and Yossef exist in all facets of life. Ultra-conservative religious practices have a history of binding women and turning them in baby-makers. Those quotes from the torah weren't made up. The movie itself is interesting but, I personally failed to understand Meir and Rivka. I definitely did not understand what happened to Rivka at the very end. That turn of events ruined it the whole movie for me. The only identifable character to me was Malka. I gave the movie three stars because it was thought provoking.
