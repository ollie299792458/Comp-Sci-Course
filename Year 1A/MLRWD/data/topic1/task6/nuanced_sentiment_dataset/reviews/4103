The cover art of this movie sold it to me. Very reminiscent of Close Encounters, but the movie really did not live up to it.
One thing that really bothered me with this movie was the whole "lets make a cartoon that looks like real people" thing. I say if you're going to make a cartoon then make one, that actually looks like a cartoon, there's nothing wrong with that. If you want it to look real then why not just do a live action movie? I Remember watching The Polar Express and thinking that they all looked eerily freaky and I could not get past that. Here it's more the same thing.
But if you don't mind that then here is a synopsis: Milo's mom is kidnapped by aliens in order to suck out her mom-essence so it can be programmed into Mom-bots to raise alien babies. Why don't they just raise them themselves? I really have no idea. Why don't they use the male aliens to raise them? I really have no idea. Why can't they just program the Mom-bots to be better moms? I really have no idea. Why do the Mars aliens need oxygen masks on their own planet? I really have no idea. Why don't.....Well you get the picture. It's not a horrible movie it's just not that good. Is it worth a buck rental at Redbox? Sure.
