I was very impressed with this film right up until the point, about mid-way into the production, when it suddenly turned into a Christian propaganda film. Needless to say, I was very upset and and put off when I saw this. The producers of this film should be ashamed of themselves. Their interjection of blatently Christian imagery and symbolism along with repeated prayers in the film (which has absolutely NOTHING to do with the storyline of the film series) was incredibly offensive and down right repulsive. This film should come with a warning lable that says something to the effect of "WARNING: Right-wing, fundamentalist, Christian indoctrination film". Personally, I am amazed that the actors in this film ever agreed to be part of it knowing that is was just a very thinly veiled Christian religous recruiting film. I can't believe that those who put the money behind this production ever allowed this film to be shot this way. It really is an embarrassment. They should be ashamed of themselves and this film should have never been allowed to be taken in the religious direction that it was. It really spoils the entire Starhip Troopers series. Unless you are a right wing, fundamentalist, evangelical Christian, you will be incredibly offended and upset with this film. Shameful. It really should be re-classified as a religious brainwashing film instead of a Sci-Fi production.
