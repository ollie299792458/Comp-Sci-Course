If only I could rate this stinker much lower.

So it was family movie night, and my Mom unwittingly picked this to be our movie because it was in the Halloween pile at Walmarts.  I was ready for fun and adventure, so what did we actually see?

It starts out like Desperate House Witches who don't know they have powers, and they all sit around in a house talking about their lusts, fantasies, and what size they prefer.  Right from that moment I started feeling uncomfortable watching this with mom and dad.  I asked to not watch anymore, but they wanted to ride it out.

Then, their lusts bring in this freak played by Jack N. who nobody knows who he is, except for this one Christian lady who said his name and then was tossed down a flight of stairs (later on, she dies in a malevolent way).  I again asked for it to be stopped, but Mom was interested to find out if the witches will discover their power.

Then each of the three witches sleep with this guy one at a time and all end up living in the huge mansion.  Absolutely disgusting!

Then more happens of this same nature, but I will reveal no more as I may reveal crucial plot points.  HA HA!  As if there was one.  Hardly a plot and very bad acting from actors who I KNOW have ecclectic acting abilities that were definitely not exploited!

And the swearing/slang was downright annoying in this movie.  And for you Christians out there, there was over 50+ times the Lord's name was used in vain and abused as well.

On the box it said this movie was [PG-13], but seeing it here, it turns out it is indeed [R].  After the movie ended, I was appauled.  Anyways, this certainly isn't a movie for those who have families out there, and how anyone can give this movie more than 1 star is beyond me!  To bad Wal-marts doesn't let you return movies after they have been opened.
