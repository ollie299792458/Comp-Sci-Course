If there were 1/2 ratings, I would have granted an extra half-star if only for the moxie and flair for fun acting that Reese Witherspoon displays in Legally Blonde.  An absurd storyline is carried by the actress in a script that fits Ms. Reese tighter than the designer outfits made into a running joke in the film.
Though ably directed and acted by a supporting cast including Luke Wilson and a chihuahua, 5 star storyline it is not.  This movie is for fun, not for keeps.  Yet, as weak as the foundation may be in Legally Blonde, I found myself smiling at the antics of Elle Woods (Reese W.), a grown up version of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless character.  The sorority depictions were frightenly parallel to the one's I recall in college, which only made the stereotype more humourous.  And Elle's college entrance video submitted to the Harvard Admission Committee makes the film almost worthwhile on its own.
Men, be not afraid to rent this film with your girlfriend, wife, or boyfriend.  Whatever your fancy, Legally Blonde has enough tom-foolery of the collegiate level to keep you laughing.  Women, you will only solidify your stature as the significant other who can pick out a movie even your Marine Corp. boytoy will enjoy.
