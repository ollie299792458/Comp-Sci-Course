On a rare occasion I'm excited enough or disappointed enough about a film to compose an Amazon review. I kept expectations extremely low - never have been able to see the talent that would make Samberg be a successor to Will Ferrel or Adam Sandler.  The film underscores his average ability as a comedic actor and the cliched content here severely hinders his effort. Sometimes one is up for a mindless silly popcorn comedy.  This film is just plain painful to sit through.  Absolute crap and I don't think I laughed once. It's almost like Samberg purposely tries not to be directly funny in his work, and perhaps that's his point, is that it's not directly funny, and that's supposed to be the humor, but it's just plain painfully dull and stupid.  I try to be an objective writer with balanced point of view, but this one makes that effort extremely difficult.

That this guy is potentially being set up to be the successor to Adam Sandler, David Spade, Rob Schneider,..., Steve Martin, etc. is an absolute insult to those fine comic actors.

The pros: Fun 80s soundtrack that had me nostaltic with so many reference to Europe's The Final Coundtown album - at least of the tracks had a moment in the film. Secondly, it kept our 12 year olds entertained for 90 minutes.

If you are amused by this type of comedy, I recommend renting. Not a purchase - I would have to be paid to put this DVD in my collection.
