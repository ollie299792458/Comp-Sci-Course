So young Jim Halsey tells the mysterious man he picks up from a deserted stretch of highway.  If only Jim had listened to Mom.
All you have to do is watch this movie once to understand why it's become a Cult Classic since  its release in 1986.  The story tells of the ultimate cat-and-mouse game  between a mysterious hitchhiker and an innocent he chooses to terrorize on  a cross country trip to California.  What happens along the way are events  that will keep you from EVER picking up a stranger!
This IS the movie  that launched Rutger Hauer's career.  His performance as the evil  hitchhiker (listen for his name towards the end of the movie) could not  have been played better by anyone else. C. Thomas Howell as Jim Halsey also  turns in a great performance.  Add the excellent directing style of Robert  Harmon's direction with the deserted stretches of Texas as the background,  and you've got a movie that still stands up as a timeless movie.
The  picture quality on the DVD is the best ever for this movie.  Color fidelity  and shadows are crisp and pleasing.  The DD soundtrack, on the other hand,  is quite disappointing.  Though the movie was released in Dolby Surround,  that is surely no excuse.  The rear channels are hardly ever used  effectively, and the entire movie sounds more like a 2 channel mix instead  of 5.1.  Still the movie sounds more defined than from a VHS source.  Also,  the extras are rather sparse.  A theatrical trailer and some cast  biographies are all you'll get.
Overall, I consider The Hitcher to be one  of the best movies of its genre.  If the DVD release had a better DD  soundtrack, I would have undoubtedly given it 1 more star.  After all,  isn't a Digital discrete soundtrack one of the joys of DVD?
