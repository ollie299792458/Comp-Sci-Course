Released Christmas Day 1963, Walt Disney's "The Sword In The Stone" is the studio's "in-between" film in its "London cycle" (six UK-set films over 20 years, 1952-1972). It retells King Arthur's (here called Wart) apprenticeship under Merlin the Magician and his path to the throne, drawn from T.H. White's 1938 fantasy novel.

The film, re-released on DVD in a 45th Anniversary edition, zigzags through British folklore and character while name-dropping out-of-place modern touches. (Merlin anticipates airplanes and steam locomotives, yes. Merlin in Bermuda shorts calling movies "TV without commercials," no.)  It lacks the historic focus, whimsy or cheeky humor of "101 Dalmatians" or "Mary Poppins." Those films preceded and followed "Stone" in release, romanticizing modern-day and Victorian Britain and staying beloved in theater and video re-releases. They, unlike "Sword," stayed cohesive and, well, sharp.

But despite lack of critical praise at release and relative low standing in Disney's canon, "The Sword In The Stone" isn't a total stick in the mud. It features some fine animated sequences (Mad Madam Mim's delightfully cruella solo to young Wart as a sparrow, and her clever, multi-colored wizard's duel with Merlin.) Disney regulars Sebastian Cabot and Thurl Ravenscroft join Alan Napier (remember Alfred the butler from the 1960s "Batman" show?) in a uniformly fine voice cast. Richard and Robert Sherman (honored in a humorous DVD extra) contribute some catchy, nonsensical compositions (led by Merlin counting off like Lawrence Welk and including some trademark bubbles)!

Other DVD extras include medieval-themed shorts (the better being Mickey Mouse's "The Brave Little Tailor"), a DVD art scrapbook and game, "Merlin's Magical Academy" (yours truly's son played it and said, "It was all right.") Overall, "Sword In The Stone" is nowhere near the roundtable of Disney's classics, modern or otherwise. But it's a solid choice for Disney completists wanting a fun video knight.
