Boy was this a huge disappoinment.  I am a big fan of the two previous versions of the novelette by Richard Matheson but I don't think that even Jerry Bruckheimer could have made a bigger of a mess out of this storyline.

  Why was Neville a legend and to whom was he a legend?  He was a legend among the still-half-humans (the ones who hadn't gone full-blown vampire yet) as the daystalker who goes around and kills them in their sleep.  He wasn't a legend because he found 'the cure' as this movie states at the end.  In the two previous films, the Neville character spent the daytime hours hunting and killing the vampires totally unaware that there was a small population of infected humans who weren't eating people yet.  In this latest remake they even show a scene of Neville marking off on a map the buildings that he had checked but this is NEVER explained in the film.  They completely removed the vampire hunting aspect from the story which makes the 'marking-off-buildings-checked' scene totally nonsensical.

  This movie is yet another example of Hollywood signing a big star and casting him in an expensive CGI spectacular where he can run around doing amazing things before ultimately saving the day.  Well, they should have tried to save this story first.  It stinks.
