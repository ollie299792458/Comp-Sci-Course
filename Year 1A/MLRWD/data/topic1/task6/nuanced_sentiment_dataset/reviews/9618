I had high hopes for this movie - the trailer looked pretty slick, Clive Owen is an awesome actor and the story line seemed a step above the usual boogyman, candyman, ghost-lurker-child-stealer mish-mash out there. I really thought it would be an intelligent thriller because of Owen. But alas, the plot was the equivalent of a five car pileup. First off, you can kinda guess that there is nothing supernatural going on after about 30 minutes. Turns out the "twist" wasn't what I thought but I wasn't that far off. What really irked me though is this is one of those movies that introduces characters and includes scenes that are completely useless, you think they're going to be part of the plot or be of use later in the movie but no, that was just an 8 minute scene that meant nothing whatsoever. Also, I'm not the type that needs a movie spelled out for me, I like a little left to the imagination or up to my own interpretations but this movie explained NOTHING. NADA. ZIP. ZILCH. and that was just annoying. When you build up to an ending the way this movie did, there needs to be a background flashback or an explanation of some sort - you are literally left with nothing.
Total waste of $3.99 for instant viewing. I do not recommend.
