In the fifth installment of the Bond movie series the script no longer stays near to the plot of the novel. Since YOLT only In Her Majesty's  Secret Service stays close to the original plot. After Goldfinger and  Thunderball Bond had become an icon and certain ingredients were considered  needed in a Bond film. However, this caused the plot to suffer heavily as  the film makers have to make the story up from scratch with limited time on  their hands. If it wasn't a Bond movie I'd have to give 2 stars only. On  the plus side we have the first look at villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The  way he was introduced in the previews movies, up until the end of YOLT,  when we get to see his scarred face, is outright brilliant. Another Bond  classic is Little Nellie, the one-man helicopter. Also, the Ken Adam sets  are more impressive than ever, with SPECTRE's volcano lair and the japanese  ninja camp. All in all, for a Bond film it's not very exciting, not that  funny, but as part of the whole series it does the job.
