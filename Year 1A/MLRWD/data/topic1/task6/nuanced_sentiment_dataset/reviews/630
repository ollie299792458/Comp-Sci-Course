--excellent performance by Bjork

--beyond that, Von Trier not only fails his Dogme, but offers a critique of an American he really doesn't understand save through stereotype and rumor.  One can feel watching this film what Von Trier has proudly admitted: he's never been to the States.  I'm no big nationalist and invite insightful critiques of American culture, or any culture, none of which should be exempt from criticism.

--it seems to me that Von Trier is continually pandering.  His Dogme rules were an attempt to suggest that when he made films cheaply-and I've no problem with that, think, in fact, it is a lovely idea-they were somehow more artistic, and since he'd further adhered to his silly rules, they were even a cut above other independent films.  At best, it was a ploy for attention, and it worked.  His films sold more than they should have and his name grew bigger based on the buzz over Dogme.  Smart businessman.  With Dancer, he abandons the rules, and panders to a mostly European audience that wants to look down on America based on the stereotypes Von Trier embraces.

--he's really a sort of Emperor who probably knows he's quite naked, though it may be that he really believes in his robes.  In any case, I've seen few if any Von Trier films that really worked.  Breaking the Waves has an interesting concept but really is quite a mess.  Character is interesting but melodramatic.  I won't bother with Dogville.
