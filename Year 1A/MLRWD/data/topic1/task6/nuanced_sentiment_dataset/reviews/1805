I must say that it is my opinion that all previous reviewers have given this production to much credit.
I am embarrassed for Adrian Paul, Peter Wingfield, and Jim Byrnes.  They must be living in truly hard times to stoop to this lowest of levels.
If someone out there is debating between watching this "show" and having multiple root canals done I would suggest the root canals to be the more pleasant option.  There is just not enough disappointment in the would for me to find something to compare to this so that I may have a viable description for prospective viewers to prepare them for this looser.  I truly would have been happier to see James Horton kill Duncan McLeod so that he would have been spared the indignation of being associated with this story.

Now just so there is not a chance of misunderstanding.
I do not like this show. I think it is crap. I feel as if I need, after watching this dung fest, to wash my eyes out with a mixture Clorox Bleach and 91% Isopropyl alcohol using a wire brush no less. As it is I am thinking of filing a class action lawsuit against the makers of this movie to try and reimburse at least a wee bit for the countless hours of nightmarish agony, pain and suffering caused by the abortion.  But I most likely will not because the negative effects of this pig are most likely eternal and the makers I know do not have the means to cover even the wee tiniest degree of what it is truly worth.

Did I mention that this show is really bad?
Please live without it.
