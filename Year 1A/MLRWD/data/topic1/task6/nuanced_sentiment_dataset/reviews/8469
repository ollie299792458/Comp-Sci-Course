The picture of the DVD (and the widescreen VHS video and probably the Laserdisk) are from the Cinemascope version patched together around 1963 or 1964 so the film could be shown in cities without Cinerama 3-projector theatres.  As such the 2.7 Cinerama (or so) ratio was cut down to Cinemasope's 2.35.  As is evident this was not a pan-and-scan job, the center of the picture was transferred.
I theorize that the Dolby Surround sound is a mix from the 4 channel Cinerama print.  Others here state that the mix is different from before so this may not be true.
While I, like the others, would love the see the film restored and sound remized, we must realize that this is all custom format material (film and sound).  The sound could still be easily digitized and remixed (regardless of the print).  However the print would require a lot of custom transfer and editing just to get to the color correction part.  This may not be an economically viable project.
Some artifacts can not be removed: obvious ones like the bent bridges during the closing sequence, plus others that I haven't tought about.
I saw this in Cinerama in Dayton during its brief revival in the late 90's.  The experience was fabulous!
