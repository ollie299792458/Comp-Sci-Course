I own an HDTV set and a copy of the two disk edition of Robin Hood. It was such a well done project that when I saw a Blu Ray version was available I decided to buy it also to see if the image quality improved even more. I was greatly disappointed.

While the feature was a bit sharper many of the extras on the disk are not in 1080 format resulting in picture quality that is less than what you get with the 2 disk special edition. Also the disk is set to start the film on loading bypassing the menu system so you don't have the opportunity to choose to view just the feature or Warner's wonderful NIght at the Movies program.

Using the menu buttons on my remote I found the main menu and discovered it was a terrible mess. Instead of bringing over the well designed menus from the 2 disk edition, there is one huge screen full of words presented. You have to look closely to see the cursor pointing to the choices.

But perhaps the worst thing about the blu ray version is the gallery material. On the 2 disk edition these archival artworks, posters, and photographs almost fill my 50 inch screen. On the blu ray copy the screen is screaming yellow with the artwork appearing as a tiny, almost thumbnail picture in the center of the screen. Result - tiny images that are hard to see against the brilliant yellow background.

It is hard to believe that Warner Bros created this blu ray and the 2 disk edition. Blu Ray is supposed to be the superior format but Warner's Blu Ray release diminishes the wonderful work they did in the restoration of this classic film.

It would be great if Warner redid the packaging of their Blu Ray edition so that it was a better showcase for this film  That's not likely to happen so my advice to anyone who wants to own a copy of this classic film is to ignore the blu ray edition and buy the 2 disk special edition instead.
