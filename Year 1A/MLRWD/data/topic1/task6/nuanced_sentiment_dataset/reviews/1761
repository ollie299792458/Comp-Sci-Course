Okay folks listen.  This gets a 5 star rating for the fact that I actually found a copy of it and for guitarist Adrian Smith alone.  But those of you that have managed to view this, take a good look at what I feel is happening throughout the entire DVD concert. From the moment the cameras roll, the lights come on and the band hits the stage....the editing is like a high speed slide show.  I get it, there were at least 10 cameras there to catch it all, but for at least the first 3-5 songs I counted no shot on the screen more than 2 seconds long.  You can't get a feel for each individual for more than a fraction of 2 seconds.  Literally at one point I thought I might slip into an epileptic fit from all of the camera switching.  I just couldn't enjoy the stage show.  I remember reading on the Maiden website that "Steve Harris is painstakingly working on the editing and the 5.1 surround mix for days on end".  Well Steve, try some de-caff pal.  It's not that I have a short attention span but geez!  He did a better job with the Rio DVD at least.  And even though I think it's great that they have a triple guitar section (mixed excellently by the way),  I really don't need to see Janick Gers hopping around and spinning in circles virtually messing up the solos while doing his best Eddie Van Halen pose (that's the guitar neck pointing straight up at 90 degrees).  You've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  Maybe I'm just partial to Adrian Smith.  So yes friends, find it, buy it, add it to the library arsenal...just don't blink (seriously!)
