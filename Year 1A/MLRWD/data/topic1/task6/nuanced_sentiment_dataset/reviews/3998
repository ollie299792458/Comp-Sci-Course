I saw this movie in the theater as a kid and absolutely LOVED it.  I had a VHS copy of it quite a few years ago, but I probably only watched it once.  It's a shame when you remember a movie so fondly, but when you revisit it, you wonder to yourself, "why did I like this movie?"  The animation that was so good way back when this was made looks pretty silly now.  But the worst part is how dirty the film is.  It looks like the source film was stored on the floor of a garage in the Sahara.  There is so much dirt on just about EVERY frame of the film that it becomes VERY distracting.  Did they not even try to clean up the original print?

There is a 15 minute "making of" documentary that is even more laughable.  Before the documentary starts, there is a screen that explains that they could not find any of the original "making of" material.  So they resorted to transferring the personal VHS copy of Ralph Baskshi.  I guess it's better than nothing, but the quality is so bad that it's pretty hard to watch.

Overall I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this movie.  I would say only people that are HUGE fans of this movie should bother buying this.  Even then, I'm pretty sure you'll be disappointed.
