This film won Academy Awards for Best Screenplay and Best Actor for Robert Duvall as Max Sledge, a down-and-out country singer.  It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Song and Best Director.  It was what is known in the movie business as a "sleeper".  While not up to par with my other favorite Foote's works (the screenplay author) like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Trip to Bountiful" this movie more than holds its own.  Duvall is quietly fine as a man trying to find himself again.  Tess Harper as Rosa Lee, the woman he marries, is perfect in her role.  The little boy who plays Sonny, Rosa Lee's son is a talented youngester.  Betty Buckley gives a tour-de-force performance as Dixie, Duvall's ex wife who holds a severe grudge against him.  Ellen Barkin plays Duvall's grown up daughter with touching poignancy.  The film also boasts a fine musical score with traditional country music.  The DVD is in widescreen, has scene selection and has a 32 minute documentary on the making of the film called "Miracles and Mercies" with interviews with Duvall, Harper and a grown up Sonny, who has become a talented guitar player in his own right.  Horton Foote and the film's director are also featured.  The other extras are Biographies of Duvall, Foote and the film's director.  It would have been nice to have biographical snippets of Harper, Buckley, Barkin and "Sonny".  At 92 minutes the film moves along with very few lulls.  The only reason I don't give this film 5 stars is because this is not my favorite "Horton Foote" film.  It is still a fine film and one which will disappoint no one.
