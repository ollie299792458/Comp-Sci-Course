23. MANIAC (horror, 1980) A killer stalks the streets of New York City. He brutally kills women and takes their scalps (along with other articles) as souvenirs. The Maniac (Joe Spinell) uses the scalps to put on mannequins he  has all over his dingy, claustrophobic apartment. His fixation with these  lifeless puppets is the only real link between him and the outside world.  He nonetheless meets, on a friendly basis, a beautiful photographer  (Caroline Munro). Just when you think he has reformed, the maniac turns  against her in a psychotic rage. 
Critique: A truly gruesome, sick  picture makes other of its kind pale in comparison. The film creates a  terribly real, decadent look of what evil beings are really up to. The  locales of rubbish infected alleyways, deserted parks, stations and so on  is truly nerve-wracking. This study into the mind of a serial killer is  given 'weight' by Joe Spinell's considerable performance. His sweaty,  sex-obsessed pervert can't help himself from committing such horrid murders  (after each kill he laments and moans for not being able to sedate his sick  urges). Like others of his ilk, he suffers constant mental disillusions and  schizophrenic flashbacks. Film is very disturbing even when it's trying to  be natural, and definitely not for the faint minded.
