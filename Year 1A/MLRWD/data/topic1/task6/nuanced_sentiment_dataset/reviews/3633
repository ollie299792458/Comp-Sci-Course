First of all, this documentary refers to, but does not really plumb the depths of leadership at the highest levels between the release of Disney's lowest achievement in animation, "The Black Cauldron" and their work in digging out of that hole, culminating in the hits "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty and the Beast", and "The Lion King".

Most of the footage used in the film is very home-movie-ish.  There are lots of hand-held shots, the footage quality is often poor to exceedingly poor, and it's virtually impossible to keep trach of who is who as the narration and footage winds a tortuous course through part of Disney's history.

It's amazing what happened to the animation branch of Disney's corporate team, being moved off of Disney's main campus to low-rent digs elsewhere.  They, nevertheless, pulled out of their tailspin and regained a good measure of Disney's earlier movie magic.  That part was interesting.

But, with all things considered, this documentary is JUST ok.  Am I glad I watched this?  Yes.  Will I ever watch it again?  No.  Did I check my watch multiple times during the screening?  Yes.

3 stars.
