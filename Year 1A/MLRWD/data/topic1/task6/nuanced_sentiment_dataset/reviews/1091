This movie runs pretty close to violent classics like, I Spit On Your Grave.  While Gillian Anderson plays her role well, as a tough-minded, good-looking business woman, the story is too graphic for my taste.  The basic premise is that Anderson is a successful business woman who picks up a younger man and takes him to a party.  Some of the scenes really seemed unnecessary, like a guy in a wheel chair, at the party coming on to her, her having sex on the lawn with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cranking himself when alone.

On their way home from the party, a truck full of drugged up men brutalize the couple.  Anderson is brutally raped and her boy toy is severly beaten.  She quickly sets up in a cabin which just happens to be easy access to the home of one of the rapists.  With a silenced rifle she looks for targets and sends her boyfriend on errands, like retrieving a dead dog and installing a movie camera inside of the rapist's home.  This dude plays her little helper monkey without taking any initiative on his own.  They catch one of the rapists and violate him in a gruesome fashion.  I had to fast forward through this movie hopeing that it would make some kind of sense.  While it might appeal to people who want to see a hard revenge flick, I found it hard to watch.
