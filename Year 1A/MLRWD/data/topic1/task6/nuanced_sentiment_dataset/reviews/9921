Forget the X-Files, CSI, Kolchak the Night Stalker.. you want to see the Creepiest show on television.. you got it right here. I've tried my damndest to get into this show, being somewhat of a lewd male myself, but even I can't get passed the idea that for every case they take on there should be equal or greater the number of sexual harrasment suits during every single episode! That's not what makes it "creepy".. granted, a little sexual tension is amusing when it's portrayed by attractive actors or actresses that show a good deal of "CHARISMA".. the characters that Spader and Shatner play are not only visualy repulsive in their bloated forms, they also portray their characters as stuffy, Nueotic and flat out Weird.. which doesn't make it appealing when they molest a client or two, it simply makes them Creepy! You can almost imagine this is how Ted Bundy must've appealed to his contacts. In one episode they actually had Shatner and another partner played by Robert Wagner simultaneaously feeling up Jeri Ryan as she squirmed helplessly in the courtroom as a defendant (DURING A CASE) And exactly HOW in God's name is this suppose to be funny?? Especially to families that have any idea of what good taste is??? (I've read reviews were people talk about their kids ejoying it... great, you're raising future molestors - of COURSE they're interested!) Of course getting back to that scene, even though Jeri squirms for her life in the defendant's chair between two disgusting bloated old farts, she accepts the attention of Spader instead.. who always has the look on his face like he just slaughtered three co-workers, drank their blood and is trying to get the one he's talking to not to look down because he's wearing their skull as a Jock strap... How in God's name did a show get people this addicted when the leads are complete psychotics? At least they have Julie Bowen to drool over.. if you can take the creepy shivers the rest of the cast gives you.
