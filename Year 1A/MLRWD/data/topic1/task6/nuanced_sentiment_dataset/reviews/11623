I rented this movie because I like Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was a waste of time. Granted, the two characters play off each other in a somewhat entertaining manner, and supposedly "weighty" (and sometimes humorous) statements are made about life, death, and faith, but, in the end, I realized the sentiments expressed in this script were nothing new and have been put forth by other writers going right back to Montaigne. A few times you can't even make sense of what is being said because the logic is so convoluted and the dialogue so rapid-fire. Without spoiling the ending, two polarized views of the world so adamantly defended leave us with nothing in the middle. We are well aware life is grim at times, and that faith is perhaps an illusion - but a more thoughtful writer would have given us something more than these truisms which, in the end, do not cover the subject entirely. There IS more to life than this kind of bleak objectivism. What can we do to make life worthwhile? What are the things worth standing up and being thankful for? In what ways are we nevertheless motivated to live right in what, for some, may be a godless universe? A more intelligent and courageous writer would address these questions too, rather than just showing us how to surrender and give up to the inevitable.
