Strengths:

Frank Langella, who really made the movie. He was extremely charismatic and had the looks for the type of character that was intended. Kate Nelligan, who is truly believable as an unleashed victorian woman. The score by John Williams is very entertaining, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T BUY THE SOUNDTRACK FOR LESS THAN $80.00!!

Weaknesses:

Just about everything else, from the very silly Renfield, to the cringe-worthy script. It even had a laser show love scene that was kind of a gothic take on the truly evil Superman/Lois Lane romantic flying sequence, and every bit as painful. Then there's the costume design for Dracula that suffered the ancestry of the vampire as gothic paperback foreign sophisticate ala Bela, which like Dracula...will never seem to die. Please, enough with the black cape and the red lining! Jonathan Harker was played as very whiny and petulant, like a morose, jilted lover...and the character never even got the benefit of the Castle Dracula scenes at the beginning of the book!

If you want to see the best version of Dracula, see Count Dracula, made in the same year by the BBC with Louis Jourdan. Definitely creepier, definitely less cliches, and definitely closer to the spirit of the book. It was made, I'm sure, with far less money than the hollywood production and outclasses it in every respect. Of course, you can't get the US version on DVD yet!

without Frank and Kate, it would have been 2 stars.
