This movie presents the lives of lesbians, all of whom have lived in the same house, in three seperate "chapters".  The movie spans over 40 years.  The first piece is about two older lesbians and is set in the early 1960's. One of the women dies and you see how people outside the relationship deal with the surviving partner.  It is touching, yet a reminder of why we need to be so vigilant.

The second piece is set in the 70's.  While it is interesting to see the development of the consciousness of the young women, it is a bit sterotyped.

The final pice is set only a few years ago.  It is current, funny (after all Ellen Degeneres is in it) and sexy (Sahron Stone is in it).  It deals with modern issues in serious and light-hearted ways.  Taken all together the three pieces tell a very interesting story of lesbians and how their lives haved changed over the decades.  I think it is especially important for younger women who need to know about the lives of the women who came before them.
