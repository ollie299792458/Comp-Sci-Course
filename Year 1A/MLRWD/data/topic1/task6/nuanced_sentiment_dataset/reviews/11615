After 25 years of marriage and complaining why my husband had to go to the hanger and see his "Cub" all the time, one man made me understand my husband. That man is Brian J. Terwilliger. After driving our motor home to the Annual West Coast Piper Cub Fly in (yep family vacation involving the Cub) I saw bits of the movie and my 19 year son ordered it on our return. I have to say I was so touched by the essence of how Brian captured flying. It is amazing that a young man, age 32, on his first film could teach me a lesson on the "love of aviation" to the lay person. This is not a story about an airport as I thought, it is a love story about humans and science. When my five year old son has seen the movie six times this week, I finally sat down with the family and have now seen One Six Right and the companion disc, oh and the soundtrack is now in my car.  Thank you Brian for showing those that "tolerate" flying by a spouse, that it is a love affair that they don't have to be jealous of. I might even take flying lessons after 25 years of marriage because of you.  Our Piper L4J Cub has been in the family since 1976 and is now a welcome member because of this film.

Thanks Brian and everyone involved in this movie.
