"Love Me If You Dare" is a film about two people who play a childish game of dares over a period of about thirty years and in the process do not care who they hurt in the process, even each other. Whereas the characters in, say, "Cruel Intentions" (itself based on "Liaisons Dangereuses") were deliciously manipulative, the characters in this film can't even be called evil. While the children were a times charming, no time is taken in the early stages of the film to engage the viewer and to evoke any warmth towards the characters and as a result, you end up not really caring what happens to them. There are huge chronological gaps of ten years at a time, which makes it hard to envisage how there can be any on-going relationship between the characters at any level. Whereas "Amelie" was a film with both warmth and humour, this film has little of either. And the way the film ends just confuses things further...is it supposed to show what might have been? I don't know. I generally love French film but this one just left me cold.
