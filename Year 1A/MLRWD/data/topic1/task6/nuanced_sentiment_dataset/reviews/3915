....and with those words, an odyssey of terror is about to unfold, as young Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) ignores the wisest advice ever given and stops to pick up a hitchhiker. Jim is doing a job for a drive away company, driving a car cross country from Chicago to California, when he does this. John Ryder (Rutger Hauer), the hitcher of the title, quickly admits to dismembering the last guy who picked him up, with this exchange.
RYDER:He didn't walk very far though.
JIM: Why?
RYDER: Because I cut off his legs. and his arms. and his head. and I'm going to do the same to you.
Of course, Jim manages to kick Ryder out of the car. He thinks the terror is over, but it is only just beginning, as Ryder starts a game of cat-and-mouse with Jim, forcing him to take desperate measures to stop this lunatic....
All actors turn in good performances, including Hauer, in one of his early movies. Once again, HBO releases a bare bones release of a good movie. Video is watchable, but the first 20 minutes or so seem to be projected out of a screen door. It's not as bad as it sounds, and night scenes are not a mess, as you may hear, but it's irritating for HBO to do this. Audio fares better than video. Much better. Extras. Well, does cast bios, menus, and a creepy trailer sound good? Yes to the trailer, no to the rest. HBO, us fans of old Johnny Ryder want a special edition, seeing as how the sequel is coming out on video soon. Anyway, good until a special edition is released.
