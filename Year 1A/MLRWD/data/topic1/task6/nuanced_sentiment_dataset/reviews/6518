I know I'm probably in the minority of guys who saw this movie and actually enjoyed it, but what the heck. it really is brilliant! I didn't have too high expectations when my mum dragged me along to see it in the theatre, I thought it would be just another desperate cheesy attempt from Hollywood to make money, having run out of original movie ideas, all they could think of was to make a movie out of a stage musical. Boy was I proven wrong big time! Not only were there a cast of well-known great actors, but the thing that surprised me the most was that Meryl Streep had an amazing singing voice, as did her "daughter" Amanda Seygfried whom to me was not heard of until I saw this movie. Starting off with the first pure, beautiful lines of "I Have A Dream" sung to perfection by Seygfried, we're off to a greek island with breathtaking scenery and the party is on, going from one Abba hit song to another, helping to run the story and you'll find yourself tapping your feet along to the beat, singing along to some of Abba's biggest hits being performed in this movie, surprisingly well-sung by a talented cast of actors (all except for Pierce Brosnan, who, in my opinion, should stick to acting). I bet they all must've had a lot of fun shooting this movie and it definitely shows by their great performances. Streep and Seygfried were the ones that stood out the most for me and I can now see why Meryl has gotten so much praise in the past, she definitely shows what an amazing actress she is in this movie and this has made me want to see other movies she's been in as well. As for Seygfried, she's a talent to watch out for, she is onto big things in her career.

I promise you won't regret it if you see this movie, if you are an Abba fan or just into musicals in gneneral, you will certainly enjoy it.
