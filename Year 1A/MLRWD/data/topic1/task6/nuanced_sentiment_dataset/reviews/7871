During 1953, Marilyn Monroe's star was rising, Betty Grable's popularity was waning, and 20th Century Fox was struggling financially due to TV competition. Fox came up with an idea to save ITS skin: they cast the new fame Monroe and the old fame Grable in a romantic comedy spectacular "How to Marry a Millionaire". To give the film an extra sparkle, Grable garners top billing, Monroe second, and other co-star Lauren Bacall receives thrid. Ironicaly, Bacall is truthfully playing the lead role. The movie recieves a three star from me because there isn't enough of Miss Monroe. I enjoy Miss Grable's performances (and others as well in other films), but I'm not to crazy about Bacall. Her husky, deep, and somewhat manish look about her makes her unattractive to me. Fox could've cast someone else in this movie with Monroe and Grable, like Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Linda Darnell, or maybe even Susan Hayward. I guess if you like romantic comedies, this would be the one to see; however, don't go searching for much Monroe/Grable screen time.
