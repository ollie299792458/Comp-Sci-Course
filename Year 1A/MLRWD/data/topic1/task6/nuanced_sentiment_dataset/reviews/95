When I first saw this film, I was a bit disappointed to find that Boris Karloff had only one scene, rather than being the main villain.

But I still liked the film...well enough that, when I accidentally messed-up the VHS copy I'd already bought some time ago (through Amazon.com I think), ...that I almost immediately shopped (at the same place;) for another.
(The least pricey version was a DVD...with Korean subtitles! --Funny!:) The audio, luckily for me, is in English though.)

Even though I was initially disappointed about Boris Karloff's limited time in it, I wound up liking it well enough, as I said.

It's a classic-looking and enjoyable old B&W flick about an American showgirl (Lucille Ball) residing in London, a rather fiendish "mystery"-serial-killer who smugly informs Scotland Yard (and the Chief Inspector, played by Sir Cedric Hardwick(sp?)) of his plans through anonymously-sent poems, a "naughty but basically goodhearted" playboy (George Sanders) and a lot of other well-known old-time actors.

"Sandra Carpenter" (Lucille Ball) is asked by Scotland Yard to help "Lure" the mystery killer into a trap (he only goes after young pretty women), and...well, let's just say she meets some rather interesting suspects (one is Boris Karloff, a demented fashion-designer-- hence, the outfit that Lucille is wearing on the front cover of the VHS and the DVD:).

Altogether, it's a rather neat atmospheric "international-intrigue" type of "whodunit" that I liked ... well enough to replace my older VHS copy with a DVD which couldn't so easily be partially demagnetized accidentally!
