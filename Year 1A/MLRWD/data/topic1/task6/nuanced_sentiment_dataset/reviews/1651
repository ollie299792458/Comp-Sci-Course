I purchased this movie on blu-ray because it was cheap and I never owned the DVD.  As I was opening the package I noticed an unfamiliar name: Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.  If what I saw with this release is indicative of their other releases, do yourself a favor and steer clear.  If you want this movie with a decent quality transfer and NOTHING else, then this may work well for you.  However, know that it really has nothing else going for it.  The disc looks cheaply made and actually has the UPC on it (never seen that one before).  The menu is very minimalistic, just like the rest of the disc.  The only two options are to play the movie and select scenes (the scene selector is painfully slow, by the way).  There are no special features whatsoever (not even a trailer, which was considered pathetic even for a DVD).  There aren't even subtitles or other languages.  And these remain the same two options during movie playback, just play and scene selection.  Plus the menu is so poorly designed that if you hit play again during the movie, where common sense says the movie would pause, it actually starts all over; first taking you back to the unskippable MPAA rating info and Miramax logo.

All in all, it's safe to say that Echo Bridge did not put any effort into this release, and personally I feel if some kid was making a bootleg of this movie, he'd do a better job.
