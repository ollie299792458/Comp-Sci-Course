I remember when this film came out in 86, I wanted to see it, but didn't actually see it until it first came out on video. I always liked it better than most 80's horror films. Marc Price does a good job playing a metalhead who is picked on by the other kids. Gene Simmons and Ozzy have small roles. Simmons as a dj and Ozzy as a tv evangelist. Yes, the story is cheesy, but it moves along at a good pace and most of the acting is good. Fastway does the soundtrack and it is the best album they ever did. I saw some reviews criticizing the cover, dvd quality and lack of extras. Anyone who had seen the movie knew Simmons and Ozzy had bit parts and you can tell they are not the stars if you just read the description of the movie on the back of the case. As for the lack of extras and movie quality, well the quality is better than the vhs tape was and I saw a used copy of the vhs tape going for twenty dollars on ebay like a year and a half ago, so I am just glad it is out on dvd at all. You also cannot argue with the price.
