Well, I wanted to see if this film was as bad as legend has it.  Sadly, it is and incredibly disappointing, especially considering the talent involved.  John Wayne, who had done a pretty good job directing THE ALAMO seven years before and was a very underrated actor;  Winton Hoch, one of the finest cameramen of the sound era and who won Oscars for two of the most beautifully photographed films ever-SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and THE QUIET MAN;  David Janssen, Jim Hutton, Bruce Cabot, Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques were no pikers in the acting department;  Batjac, Wayne's production company and run by his son Michael, had produced some very good films in the past (MCLINTOCK!, THE ALAMO).

This, however, is a piece of junk-plain and simple.

The script is full of howlers and cliches that were out-of-date when the film was made, the photography is second-rate, the acting is all-around amateurish and for a studio film of that period, it looks like it was thrown together more haphazardly than a Roger Corman film of the early 60's.  The classic example:  the ending shot is supposed to be on the east coast of Vietnam, with the sun setting...in the east!  I still find it hard to believe that not one person on this film noticed this gaffe-pitiful.

The main reason I purchased this Blu-Ray is that I wanted to see the film anamorphically, which the latest remaster on DVD does not do.  Fortunately the price was right and I should have this film in my collection being a fan of Wayne, but how often I take it out to watch is going to be problematical.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004ZBVE">The Alamo</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599NK">She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANVPPQ">McLintock!
