When I was in the 4th grade I saw this movie at Wal-Mart and thought,"That looks scary".Then people told me about the movie and I wanted to see it but I was sort of too scared to watch it but finally in 6th grade(two years ago) someone bought it for me & I watched it.It wasn't terrifying but I think Pennywise looks scary.I still cover my ears and close my eyes when Laurie Ann sees him behind the closeline.I think the movie would be better if they didn't do the stupid Stan's head in the fridge and the bugs and gross stuff in the fortune cookies.Ok well enyways the movie is about a small New England town in 1960.A demon? keeps attacking kids who come to a creek in the woods and the demon takes form of a clown to attract clowns and he will only hurt you if you are afraid of him.7 friends decide to take a stand and fight him but 30 years later(1990) several kids are killed and when Mike(one of the principle characters) is at a crimescene he finds a pic. of a character named George(Goergie) and then knows that it is Pennywise(the demon) he calls his friends and only 5 show up instead of 6 and they decide to have a final showdown.It is a very good movie.I liked it very much.
