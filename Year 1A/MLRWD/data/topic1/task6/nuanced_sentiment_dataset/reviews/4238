Seems like if Scorsese isn't making a film about criminals waving guns then nobody wants to notice.  But this is definitely one of his best movies, and one of the best films of the last 10 years.  Nick Cage is a paramedic and we follow him around for two hours, over a few days.  But it's so much more than that.  The movie goes inside his head, outside his soul, over the top, and under the sewer.  You see characters who are unclassifiable as good or bad, crazy or sane, provider or thief, on all sides.  People say Scorsese stopped making personal movies, but the only more personal movie I can think of that he made is "Mean Streets", which is practically auto-biographical (and great).  But what the two movies have in common is Scorsese's unique relationship with New York Gritty, something that usually gets shown only as white knight cops confront worthless scum in back alleys.  But in both movies Scorsese goes beyond the facade and into the humanity underneath the hoods and dope peddlers, exposing pain and its treatment as the chief motivator for unpleasant human behavior.  So, in some respects, this movie is a response to "Mean Streets", as we see a man coming to those streets not as judge or participant, but as healer - a healer overwhelmed with pain, from within and without.  And yet Scorsese isn't afraid to still be messy and heavily stylized, merging the real and the unreal - my favorite moment is when the skewered drug dealer turns sparks into fireworks.  It's completely unnecessary and absolutely essential at the same time.  Sums it up really.
