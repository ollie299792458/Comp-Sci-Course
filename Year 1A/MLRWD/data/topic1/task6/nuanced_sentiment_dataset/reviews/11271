Five Stars???  People actually gave this movie five stars???  What film were they watching?

The is the first movie, in my memory, that made me cringe because it was so campy. I guess that's to be expected considering how bad the book was.  Who was the brain trust that thought a hack writer like Stephenie Meyer would make a good producer? If she had been a good producer, she would have had the studio hire Catherine Hardwicke to direct.  At least Hardwicke kept the story moving along in the original film.  If Bill Condon had been smart, he would have let them use the name Alan Smithee on the credits.  (Look it up.)

The biggest problem with Breaking Dawn is there isn't enough material in the entire book to make one movie, let alone two. The dialogue is bad; the story is weak; and the teenage angst factor has been overplayed to the __nth degree. Kristen Stewart is a good actor but you'd never know it from watching this ilk.

I'm grateful that I didn't pay money to see this in the theater, and even more grateful that I didn't pay for the DVD.  Too bad I still had to pay to watch it on pay per view.

Save your money.  If you really want this DVD, wait for it to hit the discount rack.  I'm sure you won't have to wait long.
