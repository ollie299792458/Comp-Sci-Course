Overall: plain weird.

Generally: very boring.

Occasionally: pretty funny.

There is a lot of odd stuff in this movie that does not make much sense. The story is very weak. It's not an original concept and retold in a way that totally misses what might otherwise make it a compelling story. The strongest aspect is that the CGI is quite good.

This movie is not suitable for kids under 10. I'm convinced that no person involved in the making of this movie is a parent of a young child. If any of them do have kids then they didn't stop to consider the mindset of a child as a viewer. This movie totally fails as entertainment for kids. I'm so disappointed about this movie that I don't even want to bother writing up a detailed criticism.

I only wish that I could return it to the store I bought it from. The first thing I did after watching (most) of this movie was to offer it for sale to coworkers at my work (we have 1000+ employees on an internal email list for this kind of thing... hopefully one of them is interested because we certainly are not).

If you want a fun animated movie with talking animals that kids and adults will both enjoy then get one of the many other choices: Over The Hedge, Madagascar, etc. Even the Disney knock-off of Madagascar (The Wild, which is a little weak) is far better than Barnyard. Or, wait for the DVD release of "Open Season"... that one was quite fun in the theater.
