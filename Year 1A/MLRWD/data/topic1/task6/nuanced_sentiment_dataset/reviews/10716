Long Way 'Round.... paying for stuff.  This show is great, if you like motorcycles and a little adventure.  What you may not like is reflecting on the show's realism, and the sheer expenditure that was made for these wealthy movie stars to do this trip.  Ewan McGreggor, for instance, is going to have a constant multi-million dollar revenue stream for the rest of his life, over Star Wars alone.  Yet, most of what these guys got for this trip was paid for by sponsors, wanting to get their products on TV.  So, the star power exerted on this show allowed these guys to do an unheard of trip around the world, for nothing or almost nothing, out of pocket.  Great advertising space for the sponsors, though, as the BMW adventure bikes have exploded in popularity since the show's release.

Sure, movie stars live a glamorous life, but these guys didn't seem skilled enough to be deserving of a trip like this.  I'm sure that's what added to the entertainment and adventure, but gobs of money were poured into training for the trip that you or I will likely never be able to afford.  Not to say that realism or being deserving of something is ever what we see on TV, but this show tries to make this sort of trip look feasible to the semi-common guys.  It's not.

All in all, it's television, so realism or budgetary considerations can't really be made.  That said, after spending the last 10 years as a skilled motorcyclist, it was kind of difficult to watch this show without some envy for the thousands upon thousands of dollars that were showered upon these guys for this trip, even though they're wealthy movie stars.

Oh, and the show's intro and theme song was really pop-gooshy-sticky.  It should have been Tom Petty's 'Learnin' to Fly', or something a little more motorcycle-worthy.
