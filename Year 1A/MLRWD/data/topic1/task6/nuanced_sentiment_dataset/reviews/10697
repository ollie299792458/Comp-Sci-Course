It seems as if the anime films most apt to seduce the Western film critics are... the ones most like Western films.

  Perfect Blue pays homage to Hitchcock and others of that genre.  In pursuit of that, it lacks a lot of what makes anime pleasurable.  And to what ends?  If you make a Hitchcock film into a cartoon, you would, rightfully or not, border on the ridiculous.  While Hitchcock may not have been quite Tolstoy, imagine "War and Peace" made into a cartoon and you have the work somewhat belittled.

  But that's not the problem.  The male characters are almost all grotesque.  The cityscapes of Tokyo are ugly.  Little is revealed of most of the characters except their worldly ambitions.

  But that may be excused.  What's not excuseable are the scenes of horrible, sadistic violence.  While violence is integral to the plot, it most assurably did not have to be so shocking and graphic. Scenes such as these may be par for the course for a Hollywood film these days, but they traumatized me, and are a significant part of the reason why I am mostly a refugee from Hollywood films.

  But to look at it as an auteur film you could ignore even that.  What can't be excused is that it might not even, when viwed from beginning to end, be coherent.  While with a bit of reflection you can understand the filmakers' intent, the scenes, taken one after another, might not actually add up.  This is confusing, and violates a primary requirement, at least, ironically, of a Western film.

  I give this film a firm 2Â½ stars for the moral courage given to the main character, Mima.  (It is the kind of courage that Fundamentalist America would hate [although it might love the violence]).  All told, however, the film is not a pleasant experience.  Be forewarned.
