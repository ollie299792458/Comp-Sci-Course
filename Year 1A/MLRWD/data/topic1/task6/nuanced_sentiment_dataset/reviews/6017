Ella Enchanted is one of the best books I have ever read. The movie? Not quite. There are a lot of differences and departures from the original, although most of it was simply expansion on a sentence or two from the book, like Ella's fear that if she marries Char, one of his enemies will discover her curse and force her to kill him. Some things, though, had me blinking and saying something like,"Where did THAT come from?" Example. What inspired the stupid animated snake? To my mind, if someone had simply squaushed the thing while it was hidden in the saddlebag, the movie could have progressed quite happily without it. Also, the dance number at the end was, I admit, amusing, but what purpose does it serve? Moving on, I actually liked most of the modern quirks, like the party in Giantland(such an original name, by the way!), Dame Olga's unfortunate reaction to her Batox injectons, Prince Char's fan club, and the mall opening in Frell. I have to say, the casting was really well done, to the point where one can't imagine anyone better for the parts than the actual actors. Although I still think if they had stayed true to the book, the movie would have gone beyond good to great. My personal opinion is that it's a cute little film taken on it's own, but it hovers in between the original story, and Shrek, and as a result doesn't quite measure up to either.
