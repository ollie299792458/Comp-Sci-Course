First off, for those of you born after 1990, today's date, may not appreciate what I am about to say.  But for those of you like me who grew up with the real Amazing Spider-man and even the series on Fox, seeing this movie will less than amaze you.  Granted, it's better than Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, but then again, what isn't??  The fact that Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are an actual item off the screen doesn't help, since there are too many romantic scenes.  Spoiler: realistically, no girl would ever french a guy who spent his night swimming in doodie cookie water.  The story is too long, considering it takes a good hour and some change for Peter to finally dawn the costume.  And when he does, he stalks his suspects from atop gargoyles and rooftops.  It felt more like a Bruce Wayne on a budget hero than a "oh wow, that was Spider!!".  Honestly, he spends most of the movie twitchy and being angry than being the quick-witted sarcastic Spidey of the comics.

The highly anticipated Lizard, fairly done.  He is grizzly and terrifying, but when you finally see him it's rather underwhelming.  Oh, and I should mention, for a Spider-man film, you would expect web-slinging since that is his trademark.  Yeah, not so much since that part of his character seems to have been written out.  Not too mention the yellow eyes threw me off a bit, but that's just me.  My wife and I love comics and were greatly dissappointed in this film.  If you want a real Spidey, then go watch Spider-man 2, and if you feel the need, rent this movie.  But even that would be a waste.
