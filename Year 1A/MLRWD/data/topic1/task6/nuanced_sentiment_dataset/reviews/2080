The film opens by showing you some unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. It continues to do so throughout the entire length. It gives you flashbacks to a film that never existed and pretends that the first Ghost Rider is entirely different, or was just never made. Hence it being a "pseudo-sequel". It tries to recap a back-story that nobody is familiar with.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance continues to add new characters and plot-lines while not giving you time to really care about any of it. It goes from plot to plot too rapidly to allow for time to make  sense of the story, not that it would be all that easy to do so with loads more time. It seems to care too much about the action to even try to build up any kind of depth to the characters, leaving them all very dull and lifeless. The directors of the film, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, seemed to throw all cares away and aim this film at a non-existent audience of mindless zombies who want nothing but mediocre action and second-rate 3D. They seem to think that audiences have forgotten that true cinema is made up of deep, coherent stories and characters.

Many people, such as myself, went to see this film because of the entertainment that the first film brought. Many expected a sequel of some sort. We expected the film to continue the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his quest to use the rider for the good of mankind. Instead we got a story about a man hiding out in Eastern Europe, feasting on the evil deeds of people, and trying not to go insane. While people wanted something that was even slightly reminiscent of the first film, they got a reboot that just used the same lead actor and confused the masses.
