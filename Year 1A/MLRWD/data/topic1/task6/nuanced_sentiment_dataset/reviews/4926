Well, we ended up seeing this movie because 'Ocean's Eleven' was sold
  out. So we didn't go in with too many expectations, which ensured that
  we didn't end up disappointed.
  The basic plot is this : Owen Wilson's character, a disillusioned Navy
  pilot who wants to quit, strays into the enemy territory and is shot
  down. He loses his partner, and must now reach the enemy lines for
  his commanding officer (Gene Hackman) to try and save him.
  The rest of the movie is about the game of cat and mouse that ensues
  as our hero's pursued by two foes : the forces of the enemy, as well
  a mercenary employed by them. Also, rescue plans are repeatedly
  thwarted by 'complicated international policies'  and 'navy decorum'.
  Plus points - Owen Wilson's performance. He brings a likeability to
  his character that makes you root for him (even if he seems to do
  some rather silly things at times!). Gene Hackman's good, too - but
  given his calibre and experience, he can do these roles in his sleep.
  There's also some great camerawork and a few good action sequences.
  Minuses - The Bosnian situation seems to be treated rather superficially,
  and the enemy are almost caricature like 'bad guys'. Also, there are
  several sequences which stretch credibility a fair bit, eg the way the
  man on the run keeps dashing off in broad daylight and nothing ever
  happens to him; similarly a senior office like Hackman's character going
  off in person with the rescue team.
  All in all, average fare.
