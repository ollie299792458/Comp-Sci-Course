OK,  this  is  an  example  of  a  cult  horror  movie  that  you  shouldn't  see.  I  mean  never,  not  even  to  widen  your  viewing  horizons.  This  movie  is  so  horribly  terribly  terrible  that  if  I  had  ever  found  a  magic  lamp,  one  of  my  three  wishes  would  be  to  regain  the  time  of  my  life  I  lost  while  watching  this  [garbage].  I  know,  supid  analogy,  but  that  is  the  best  one  I  could  come  up  with  right  now.  Don't  get  me  wrong,  I  love,  I  mean  love  horror  movies.  Even  ones  that  are  sometimes  hated  like  the  cult  classic  Last  House  on  the  Left  that  happens  to  be  one  of  my  all  time  favorite  horror  movies.  If  whoever  reading  this  hates  Last  House  on  the  Left  and  has  never  seen  Sleepaway  Camp,  it  is  like  comparing  The  Shawshank  Redemption  to  Joe  Vrs.  The  Volcano(  now  that  was  a  bomb!  ).  I  think  you  get  the  idea  of  how  much  I  loathe  Sleepaway  Camp.
  Now  for  the  movie  itself.  Well,  it  is  about  a  psycho  mom  that  wants  her  son  to  look  more  like  a  girl.  So  then  the  transvestite  teen  goes  to  camp,  gets  made  fun  of,  and  kills.  The  he  she  then  makes  out  with  this  other  boy  and  reveals  herself  by  the  end  of  the  movie.
  If  you  thought  that  Nightmare  on  Elm  Street  2  was  [dumb],  this  one  is  ten  times  as  bad.  Well,  not  ten,  but  you  get  what  I  am  trying  to  say.  I  cannot  urge  you  enough  not  to  see  it.  
  Oh,  and  it  has  two  sequels  aswell.  Number  2  is  okay,  and  the  third  is  the  charm  of  the  series.  I  would  recommend  those  two  instead,  they  are  the  funny  exploitation  kind.  Just  watch  the  third  one  if  any  but  please  keep  your  distance  from  this  thing.
