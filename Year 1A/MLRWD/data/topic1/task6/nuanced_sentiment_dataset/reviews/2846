Its that time of the year again just as the summer is hurricane season its also that time of the year for hollywood to throw out its recent remakes. I must admit i had my doubts after seeing the fiasco that was Burton's Planet of the Apes but Burton proves himself in this movie and despite being a ardent fan of the origional it won me over. Its ending is sure to the please better than the original, and despite what people said about Johnny Depp's performance he was my favorite part of the movie. His Wonka was weird and socially awkward as any man who had been locked away for so long would have. In general they improved a lot, added backstory, dropped slugworth and the terrible tunnel scene but i still couldn't help myself waiting for those choice lines from the first movie by Gene Wilder that were never said in the remake. The "stop, wait, comeback", "no i won't hold you responsible" and "you stole fizzy lifting drinks!" which goes to show the strength of the original and the hold which Gene Wilder had over the movie and the story.

All in all it wasnt bad and will please most people, however if they could just get rid of those dreadful oompa loompa songs....
