I'm a pretty big Halo fan, having played all the games and read most the books. So when Legends was released I was pretty excited. But unfortuanteley it's not anything near the quality and calibur I've come to expect from the Halo brand. Some of the stories are well done, with good animation and sound. But many are just wierd, and don't fit into the rest of the Halo mythos at all. The opening story is a two part episode, I don't know why they cut it in half, but it's almost the same as the history story on Animatrix. It's rather well done, and in my opinion the best part of the disc, documenting the history of the Halo universe and giving us our first views of the Forerunners.

The rest of the films are rather, meh. Some have poor cinematics and even wierder stories. The japanese influence on the series went way overboard. One feature was the story of an elite rebel, with the Elite culture depicted as a samurai one. Another film featured an emo anime soldier on a mission to destroy a prototype mech robot to keep it from falling into Covenant hands.

The only other mini film I liked was the last one, a fast paced CG animation work that features Master Chief and several other Spartans on a rescue mission. Again, it's plagued by inconsistancies with the books, and leaves you wondering when there was ever a fat simoan spartan. But over all it's pretty good. It really shows off the elite combat skills the spartans are well known for.

In the end, I'd say you should just rent or borrow this movie.
