I just want to say off the bat, that I don't find anything attractive about 6-foot chicks. At ALL. How is that sexy? How? HOW? The ideal woman should be shorter. Cute. Petite. Athletic. You know the deal.
With that said, this movie is a train wreck. A sheer train wreck. I'd rather stab myself in the eye than watch this (...) again. How did this lame(...) story even get the title of "Heavy Metal"? The characters are ugly and unappealing. The plot is a bigger mess than my workbench. The animation is decent- the HAND-DRAWN animation. The computerized stuff is ugly and jarring. It looks totally out of place- especially during the oh-so-confusing ending. The action is stupid and repetive. The dialogue is a joke ("You fools! You FOOLS! HAHAHAHAAHA). Everything is a joke. The people who even enjoyed this movie are sad, pathetic jokes. (...)This "cartoon" isn't even worth using as toilet paper. Buy drugs instead, they're better for you. 
The people who made the original 1981 classic should be ashamed.
