Just about everyone knows the Die Hard movie, it's one of the all time classic American action movies, so I'm not going to waste time reviewing the movie, I'd rather talk about the Blu-Ray transfer quality of this film.

First off, just for reference, my Blu-Ray player is a Playstation 3, and I had no trouble at all playing the movie on it.  The film quality of the movie is very very good.  A bit grainy at times, and sometimes there seems to be slight distortion at the edges of the film, but these truely are minor and only occur a few times (and if you're not looking for them, then you probably wouldn't notice at all.  Kinda the differece between what I see in a movie vs. my wife, I'm much pickier than she is), and I'm sure they are due to the fact that this is a 1988 film!

Audio quality is excellent, but I was hoping for a little stronger punches from the low end (I like to make my subwoofer work!).  I was hoping the dramatic scene when John throws the C-4 down the elevator shaft would have shaken the house, but it never quite delivers.  It's excellent, but not outstanding.

However, play the movie on original DVD, then play it on Blu-Ray, and it is truely a quality upgrade!  If you're a fan of the movie and have a BR player, I would highly recommend this purchase.
