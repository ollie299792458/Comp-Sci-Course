This movie is difficult to categorize. It is is happy, sad, funny, etc. so it is hard to know where to start and what to write about. Ultimately I think it is about growth and triumph. The story is about two young men.

These two young men, Michael and Rory, happen to be disabled.  Michael has been institutionalized from birth, and except for financial support, he has no dealings with his family. He is an innocent who knows nothing of the world. Rory arrives at the home early in the movie. He is from a poor family, but has a dad who cares. Rory is not quite so innocent. :-)Michael is meek & Rory is full of attitude.

Rory is a free spirit who is trapped in an immobile body. When he arrives at the facility Michael knows Rory will be 'trouble'. Michael soon discovers Rory can understand his speech (which is illegible to most), and the two become friends. They complement & need each other. Most of the movie follows them as they try to live on their own away from the institution & all the joys and sadness which come with that experience.

The movie is fairly upbeat, until the end the movie. There is sadness and tragedy in the movie, too. But ultimately the movie is about growth & triumph.

Very good performances by the 3 lead characters in this movie.
