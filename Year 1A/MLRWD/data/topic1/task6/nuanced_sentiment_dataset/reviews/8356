I can't really give this more than two stars, for several reasons. For one thing it gratuituously tells us repeatedly that a romantic couple who are its subject didn't get along, not to mention that how their romance started in the first place is improbable and hokey to the hilt. It even throws in some disappointing scens of ugly fighting to prove its gratuitous point that the couple didn't get along. But the main reasons why this movie is overall disappointing relate to a central secret, concealed for a while. But the secret becomes all too obvious by at least halfway through the movie. Then the movie becomes overlong, ponderous, and sourly sentimental.

But the silver lining to this cloud is how the movie brilliantly showcases the stunning talents of Rachel McAdams. May she go on to exercise those talents fruitfully in many a movie, unlike all to many contemporary actresses! She puts herself so completely into her role herein as to resemble in no way her villainous but equally well-acted Regina George. How refreshingly versatile in an age when we have actresses like Ashley Judd, who seems to insist on always playing essentially the same obnoxious "ball-buster" in all her movies! I can't remember another case of a performer taking on such divergent roles as Rachel McAdams has in her last two movies, so as to challenge audiences to believe they are actually watching the same actress in both. I hope the movie-making world fittingly values her talents and does not let them be wasted. But that is iffy in a world and age where an actress such as Kirsten Dunst can go from a performance that should have won an Oscar in DROP DEAD GORGEOUS to being so gratuitously and egregiously de-flowered in THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and then to doing little else than fluff in anything since. May Rachel fare much better than that!
