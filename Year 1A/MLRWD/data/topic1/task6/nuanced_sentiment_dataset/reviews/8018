The Blues Brothers is my all time favorite movie. It was released the year I was born and Ive grown up watching it to the point that I know it word for word, scene for scene, sound effects and all.
I was so eager to get this blu ray but disappointed when I watched it to find that what Universal has done is they have overlapped the theatrical version and the extended version so it is meant to run "seamlessly". I have a huge problem with this because when watching the Theatrical cut (the only cut in my opinion) it now has many things different. The extended cut didn't just have extra scenes, the soundtrack was vastly different too and song pieces were different versions and sometimes had added verses. James Browns song is very different in the extended cut as was Cab's Minnie the Moocher.  So to me I can really notice when a scene is not in sync as it should be when "seamlessly" skipping past an extended cut scene. This is probably a very minor issue for most people but to me it is a big deal and lazy on Universals behalf.
The video quality is amazing here and the sound quality is decent but I just can't get past the butchered theatrical cut and can see myself going back to the dvd version the next time I watch it.
Of course as soon as universal release the 35th anniversary blu ray with all this fixed and a 7.1 mixed soundtrack then I'll be buying it day one.
