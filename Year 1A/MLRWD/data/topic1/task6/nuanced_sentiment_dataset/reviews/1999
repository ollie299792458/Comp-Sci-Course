OH MY GOD! DEAN MARTIN SOBER!!!!!
He didn't appear inebriated at all in  this film, and he really showed that he could be a damn fine actor. This  film started the ball rolling on what would soon becalled "The  Disaster Genre".
Produced in 1969, Jennings Lang could not have even  imagined what he was getting into. The film was one of Hollywoods shining  moments and usherd in the modern era of action/adventure/disaster films.  The effects were top notch, now a little cheezy, but I am sure that those  like me love it either way.
I did notice a few pilot tech flubs, such as  reaching for the flap handle by way of the gear lever(!). The flap actuator  was next to the thottle quads in the 707, not on the front panel where the  gear actuator is located.
Even from a pilots point of view, this film is  a must see. I would really like to see the directors cut of this film, as I  read somewhere a few years ago that the DC was 40 minutes longer than the  edition we see now. 
Oh well, time will tell!
Excellent Filmmaking
