I am crushed because I LOVED this book, and looked forward to the movie since I read it when it came out!  I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...  The director destroyed the heart and soul of this book by taking the MAIN story line out, and lightening it up! I am surprised J.K. Rowling did not step in and say NO you ruined my book!  I am severly upset about this!  They need to be forced to fix this!
