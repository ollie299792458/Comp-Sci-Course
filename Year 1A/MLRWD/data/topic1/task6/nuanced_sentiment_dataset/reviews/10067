This film unlike the first one failed to live up it's potential.
The plot of this film is what I really liked. Here we have three super villians against one superman and that was one of the films highpoints. So what went wrong to Superman 2 Basically this film is missing three important things.
No. 1 Marlon Brando. Why hasnt he come back for this film? Besides his scenes were COMPLETED for this movie but why removing him over some petty profit law suit (check Amazon's quote and trivia).
No. 2 Richard Donner. He was really good with the first one. Salkind should have let him finish this one off. Also why did the give this one to Lester? Lester is more into comedy and it destroyed the film. Although some comedy would not have hurt, but this was too much.
No. 3 John Williams. Here we have one of the greatest composers of our era. But sadly he did not return. He always writes new musical notes for sequels hence making the movie more refreshing. Instead we have his music from the first one recomposed from an unknown composer (they should just have just pasted his first music for this film if they  wanted to save money). Then again he was busy composing for the Empire Strike Back (one of his best works).
If you love the first superman and if you are over 21. Then you will be dissapointed.  But if you just want to have a good time then by all means Enjoy.
