This movie should have been restored before it's release.  The casting is so off kilter, what was Selznick thiking???  Claudette Colbert playing Jennifer Jones mother.  Colbert looks the same age.
Shirley Temple still acting cutesy and petulant like the child actress she once was.  Joseph Cotton playing the best friend of Colberts missing husband in the war.  Cotton so handsome in his Navy uniform...please in real life he and Colbert would be loves instantly.  This is the story of UPPER MIDDLE class american certainly no relations to the actual lives of the working people who worked and slaved in the factories and shipyards and all the rationing and the hardships made on them.  When the War was declared young men were drafted and the women and draft exempt men came into the cities to work in the factories most of them from the farms.  There were no places for them to live.
So people rented out rooms in their houses. This would have made an more interessting story of the actual lives of real people.
