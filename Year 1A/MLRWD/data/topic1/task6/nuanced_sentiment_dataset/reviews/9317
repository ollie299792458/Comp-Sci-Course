A friend told me to rent this, but I bought it instead.  I tend to accumulate a lotta late fees, so I figured a purchase was a better idea.

I think I made a good choice.  This is a decent little thriller.

It starts off A LOT like a Dean Koontz's novel INTENSITY.  I was able to tell my wife item by item what was coming next up through the first half or so of the movie.

But, hey.  You can't copyright a plot.

Besides that, they changed the story significantly in the second half.

A young female college student visiting her friend's family's country home.  A killer breaks in, kills everyone but the friend and takes her hostage.  Our heroine pursues to save the other young woman.

There is a major twist at the end... but I didn't find it particularly surprising.  There are some other events in the movie that have greater shock value.

The heroine and her friend are beautiful.

I also have to commend the continuity department.  They did a great job of making sure that bloody wounds didn't suddenly disappear in subsequent scenes (we've all seen bad movies-even big budget ones!-in which the hero is hurt in one scene and fine in the next!)

My wife was bothered by the use of French in some scenes.  Because this is a VERY visual movie... with relatively little dialogue, I don't think this really takes away from the film.
