I purchased the movie after reading the other reviews, and overall, I found the movie disappointing. I really wanted to like the film. I first read Rosemary Sutcliff's book on the legend in middle school and have a copy of Joseph Bedier's version, and I've always had an interest in it. It's a story of powerful passion that defies conventional norms. Perhaps my knowledge of the story set up expectations that the movie couldn't fulfill.

Let me say that the cinematography in the movie is excellent, particularly the recurring water imagery. The first part of the movie, when Tristan lands wounded on the Irish seashore and is nursed back to health by Isolde, is good and memorable in that the sea imagery effectively underlines the primal passion that is at the heart of the story. It was very romantic. Sophie Myles is also talented as Isolde. Rufus Sewell does a great job as King Marke, and is handsome (poor Isolde having to choose between him and Tristan).

My big criticism is James Franco's performance. I found it wooden and unconvincing. Other reviews have stated that his acting is subtle and restrained, but the point that is that the story is about unrestrained passion. He doesn't have to overact to play the part of a man who puts love above his loyalty to his uncle, who also happens to be his king, but more passion would have been convincing. I would have thought a reader like James Franco, with his English and writing degrees, would have given a better interpretation of Tristan. It was disappointing. I also didn't appreciate the inaccuracies in the storyline. It sounds more like Hollywood's idea of twisting things to make for a more macho, action-filled plot. The emphasis seemed less on the relationship than the swashbuckling and the fighting. The original story is so much more romantic than what I saw in the film.

There was another version I saw once that I liked better, but for the life of me, I can't find it.
