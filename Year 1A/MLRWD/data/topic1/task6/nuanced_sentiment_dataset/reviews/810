Although director Ki-Duk Kim redeemed himself from his indescribably bad film "The Isle" with this effort, I still can't recommend it for anything more than a rental and one time viewing.

I enjoyed the minimalist nature of the film and the beautiful scenery as much as everyone else, but I did not enjoy the story overall nor the characters.  The extreme of the young boy's fall from being guilt ridden over his role in killing various animals to ultimately killing a human being as an adult is a stretch.  And the manner in which the teacher, completely cut off from civilization, finds out that his former pupil killed is equally far fetched.

Another shortcoming was the actors chosen to represent the boy at various stages in his life.  The actor chosen for Fall looked nothing, and I mean nothing, like either the late teen/early adult version of the protagonist or the slightly later in life version of himself in Winter.  The selection of the Fall actor was all the worse for the film in that the guy couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.

Also, if you are among those who are titillated by warnings of strong sexual content then let me give you a warning myself.  The sexual scenes consist of nothing more than repeated showings of a naked man's behind thrusting up and down on a woman who looks like she is about 13 years old.

For a similarly beautiful but better Korean film, I would recommend passing this up and purchasing "Chihwaseon" instead.
