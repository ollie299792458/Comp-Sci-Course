Has anyone noticed that Hakkai's injured eye has suddenly gotten better and his eyepiece is nolonger opaque? Or that the fighting has become more simplified?  Or the costumes more simplified? Or that the group is now the "Sanzo Party"?  It's like the Geneon "party" read a review and started from there instead of watching the previous series and reading the support details.  I mean I thought it was funny the way Sanzo was always threatening to kill his cohorts and POINTED his gun at them.  Reload seems to be a watered down version of of the first two seasons.  Perhaps for US sales?

In all fairness, as the series progresses, Geneon does try to repair these mistakes in thier poor planing in subsequent volumes and the series get better and is worth buying.

I paid $39.95 for an English dubbed perfect collection.  I wouldn't want to have paid more though.  I hope Gunlock is better because I plan to buy it too.  Why?  Because I like it and the improvements in the Reload series as it progressed give me optimism that Gunlock will be a better collection.
