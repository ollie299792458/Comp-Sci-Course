This is a very well done DVD by Disney. The art looks great, and sound is wonderful.  If you're thinking of buying this, though, get this for the extras: all are dated and easily recall the era of the late 50's that the movie was released in. "4 Artists Paint 1 Tree" and "The Peter Tchaikovsky Story" are especially enjoyable and add another dimension to the viewing of the film.

The commentary, on the other hand, is nothing special.  Yes, there are a couple of songs thrown in that got cut out of the final production.  But there is also quite a bit of buttering up of the final production as well as of Walt Disney himself.  The commentary is also almost completely disembodied from the film itself - it sounds like they carried out separate interviews with those involved on a few major topics (background art, overall design, Walt Disney) and simply rearranged clips with the voice of a narrator, while in large part ignoring the action of the film.

Get it if you really need to complete the collection.  Otherwise, an extremely entertaining rent from your local library thanks to the extras they decided to include.
