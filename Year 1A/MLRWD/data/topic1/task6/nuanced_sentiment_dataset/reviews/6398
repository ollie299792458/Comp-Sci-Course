Beyond the stunning cinematography and the always welcome Toni Collette, Japanese Story is such a badly conceived, culturally illiterate film that it is a wonder that it was ever greenlighted.

Freelance geologist (Collette) is enlisted to play wilderness tour-guide for a visiting VIP from Japan on behalf of her most important client - a multi-national Australian mining company. No matter that she is reluctant to participate and completely ignorant of the male-dominated, ritualistic business protocols practiced by the Japanese, she ultimately manages to overcome her many (unintentional) slights and insults to fall inexplicably in love with her charge, The World's Least Interesting Man, Tachibana-san - played with mordant sterility by Gotaro Tsunashima. I am almost certain that businesses worldwide have industrial robots from Japan with more charm than this stiff.

One minute the opposites-attract leads are spitting fire at each other, the next they're horizontal. No development or justification, it just happens - not withstanding the surprise revelation that he's married (and she's betrayed) their relationship hardly misses a beat.

The conceit of the story is Tachibana's sudden death that not only short-circuits their impossible love but sends Collette's Sandy careening into a recrimination-soaked sleep walk for the remainder of the film that reminded me more of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead than anything approaching inconsolable, believable grief. I just hate it when bad scripts happen to great actors - Collette certainly deserved better. All I know is that for the film's final 30 minutes, I was also in a desperate sleep walk for a blade sharpener and a Hari-Kari how-to-guide. At best, Japanese Story is a visually stunning, chemistry-free, snorer.
