Buying DVD's, when you already own the VHS version, can sometimes feel like a waste of money.  However, added footage can always be the selling point.  That's exactly the case with Rocky.  When you have seen this movie as often as I have - it's gotta be in the hundreds - it's refreshing to finally get some insight into the making of this classic.  The commentary by Stallone is very funny and gives you a fresh look at how this film came to light.  Sadly, Stallone has never kept his edge -or eye of the tiger- with many of his later films.
My favorite feature of this DVD is the commentary track that goes of the entire film!  Comments from the directors, producers, and actors (Shire, Young, and Weathers - but no Stallone!) are continuous as you watch the film.  That is perfect for the big fan who has seen the movie many times but wants to know more about the fight sequence, for example.  
Special features sell DVD's.  Stallone figured this out and released Rocky again.  Sadly, I don't think 2 -5 have special features.  Otherwise, I would already own the boxed set.
Rocky, by itself, is a must-own DVD.
