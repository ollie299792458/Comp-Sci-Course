The film approach to this musical was a smart move-- the "we'll tape a performance" approach is kinda cheesy.  The sets were great, especially the desert scene, and the costumes were imaginative.  The songs  were very nice; they go from a catchy jingle-type advertisement for  "Jacob and Sons" to a Western theme ("One More Angel in  Heaven"), to a somewhat 1920's approach in "Potiphar," to a  1960's Austin Powers-ish "Go Go Joseph", to the bluesy  Elvis-themed "Song of the King", and to the Jamaican  "Benjamin Calypso."
Donny Osmond shines as Joseph: he can  really sing!  Richard Attenborough was very good as Jacob, who sang a few  lines and was actually pretty good at it!  Mrs. Potiphar (Joan Collins) was  hilarious, as was Robert Torti as Pharaoh "The King."  (He was my  dad's favorite character; he's watched the Pharaoh's song about a million  times.)  The eleven brothers are really funny, too!  The only character I  have a minor problem with is the Narrator, played by Maria Friedman.  She  has great facial expressions, but her singing voice is  less-than-stupendous.  (Listen to some of the cast recordings, particularly  the 1993 LA cast; you'll hear the difference.)
PS - As for the supposedly  pornographic scenes with Mrs. Potiphar, they happen so quickly and the plot  moves to Joseph in jail so fast there hardly isn't any time for questions  of any sort.  I'm a Christian, and I've seen worse things on network  television.
All I can say is, Go, Go, Go, Joseph!
