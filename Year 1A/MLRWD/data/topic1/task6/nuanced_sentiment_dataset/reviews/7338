As I have been reading these recent reviews of the movie and all the sniveling about Tom Cruise should have been Lestat. I have read every Anne Rice book she has ever written and of course I was disapointed with tis adaptation. I would of loved to see a trilogy done on all three of the books like Lord of the Rings because there is so much back story that is left out and this movie didn't do it justice. The only thing I like as I pretty much disliked all the actors except Stuart Townsend.They could have made his hair blond as they did with Cruise but as far as capturing his character he was great with the scipt he was given. Now when I think of Lestat he will always look like Stuart Townsend. Also I read on Anne's web site that she spoke with him for six hours so I think he captured the character. The other characters were awful. The Queen, Marius, Jesse, Armand,Pandora were awful. Maharet and David were OK. One last thing that really bothered me was that Marius made Lestat in the movie. Now that is just wrong.
