I broke down and ordered this dvd since I have all the other Ray Harryhausen films that Columbia Pictures have released on dvd as well and I wished in certain ways that I didn't,especially since I have a hell of a lot better video of the movie that I bought 10 years ago,when they remastered it from the older video that preceded it.That video has great color and a killer soundtrack that is not only fantastic in sound,but also separates with surroundsound,something the video box never said it had until it was released again with the cover that the dvd has as well and claims it as a pristine remaster.Not only was the sound not up to snuff,but the color looks alittle more faded than the video as well.In fact the only thing going for the dvd is the little booklet that the Harryhausen fantasy films seem to have with the dvd case with some pictures from the film that haven't been shown a hundred times before,such as the small one of the dragon coming out of the cave to fight the cyclops.Then again,maybe thats the real reason I got the dvd in the first place,as one other reviewer also had complained that it was not in stereo as the laser disc used to be,and the vhs video obviously still is recorded in.For a really great sounding harryhausen dvd,check out,"First Men In The Moon",the remaster of this is great,and ,Three Worlds Of Gulliver",as well.In fact I also got along with "7th Voyage",the dvd to ,"Jack The Giant Killer"which is a great remastered edition in sight and sound and cost only(a few dollars) for a greater looking and sounding dvd.
