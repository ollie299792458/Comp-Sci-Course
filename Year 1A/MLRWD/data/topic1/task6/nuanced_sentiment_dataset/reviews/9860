i think this is one of the worst packaging i have ever seen. they put both dvds in the same slot, overlapping each other... wtf ? they couldn't add one those swivel slots like they have for toy story three or any blu rays with more than 2 disk... disappointed with the packaging mainly because with prolonged use it has the potential of being scratched.

review for fox and the hound: 4/5 stars
great film, remains a classic in my eyes. vivid colors, good story and a nice moral. maybe a sad and depressing movie for children but disney had a good portrayal of relating common ethic issues to how we perceive things.

review for fox and the hound 2: 2/5 stars
i really have no opinion of this movie. never drew me in nor made me care for the characters. more of a ploy to make money from disney is the only thing i can really think of. pretty to look at, especially in blu ray but still, stick with the first fox and hound

blu ray review (quality and audio)

fox and hound:
image:3.5/5 stars. decent restoration of the colors, more vibrant and worth buying if your a fan of fox and the hound and want to transition from dvd to blu ray, if you didn't care much for this film, its a good rental
audio: 4/5 stars. crisp and clear. very nice and well done with the transfer

fox and the hound 2:
image: 4/5 stars. since this film was more recent, the transfer to blu ray kept a lot of the colors and made it pop. very satisfied with the quality
audio: 4/5 stars. same as the first fox and the hound
