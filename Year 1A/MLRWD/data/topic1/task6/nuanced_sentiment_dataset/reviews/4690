Believe me, you want me to spoil this plot and save you the time.  Here it: british sailor joins race to be first or fastest round the world single handled. cut to the chase, his boat "sucks" and rather than take it into rough waters, the old boy cheats but because he knew he wouldn't get away with it, he takes the spineless route, and jumps overboard.  it is worth noting that this man has few redeaming features and is nearly unremarkable.  far from a human interest story, it is really the posterchild for human disinterest.  awful!

I truly cannot glean why this has so may excellent reviews.  It is not particualrly well formed or put together and the subject is only remarkable in that it is a poor commentary on failed huiman spirit - who needs that!  It is a drull documentary, with interviews from even more drull persons.  His wife sounds like an old cat being strangled, I could barely stand to listen.

the one thing i could not get over was the evident willingness of the man's family (wife and son) to take part in this.  i would think any right minded person would be so shamefully embarrassed they'd avoid taking part.

If you are you looking for some "bed time" stuff to put you to sleep though, this will work, just beware the interview with the wife (strangled dead cat, mark my words).
