The "Renegade Version" of Highlander 2 is promised as having corrected all the things that made the film as orginally released such an abomination. In particular, they remove all references to the "dreaded  planet Zeist." Well, thank heavens for small favors! Yes, the words  "planet Zeist" are deleted, but that's about all you can say for  it. The scenario they used as a substitute is no more coherent, it still  doesn't fit into the rest of the Highlander universe, and it _still_ leaves  this a gawdawful film. 
  The only real reason to see the Renegade  Version--and this applies only to the DVD--is to hear the commentary track  by a number of the movies' makers. This is interesting to Highlander  afficianados mainly because it quickly becomes clear that THEY STILL DON'T  GET IT. It's truly amazing that these people who engineered a marvelous  first film, and a very good tv series, never actually understood what the  elements were that appealed to the fans. 
  Don't view this movie as a  Highlander experience. View it as an object lesson in filmmaking and the  entertainment industry as a business.
