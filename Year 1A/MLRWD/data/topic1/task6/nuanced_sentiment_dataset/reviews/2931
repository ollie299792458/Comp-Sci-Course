"Triangle" was a mini-series with Eric Stoltz and Bruce Davidson.  It tried to explain what the Bermuda Triangle was and what caused it.  The first part was excellent; lots of suspense and interesting "suggestions", but it fell totally apart at the end (another government-conspiracy-malfunction thing.  *Yawn*).  Lou Diamond Phillips had a part in it, and it was the best thing I'd ever seen him do.  He played a Greenpeace warrior who lost his comrades when their boat sank in the Triangle.  Her gets back home, and finds out he has a second son he couldn't remember ever being born; then the truck he remembers as being blue is tan; and one of his friends who he saw drown at the Triangle shows up alive...  He starts freaking out; thinking he's going crazy.  He finally comes to decide that it must just be memory loss caused by the trauma of the boat sinking incident, and he tries to make of things.  Just as he's getting used to this new environment, he comes home to find that his second son doesn't exit again...  Then he comes home again another day and finds the house empty with a For Sale outside...  Now, he ready to kill himself because he doesn't understand what's going on.  Each "environment" was caused by a "wave" projected out of the Triangle (which is expanding).  It disrupts time and space, letting people slip from one multi-verse to another without realizing it at first... Because the first part and some of the twists and performances were good, I'm giving it a C+.  It would have got a higher grade, but the "explanation" of the Triangle and the "re-pairing" of it were stupid and thoroughly unoriginal.
