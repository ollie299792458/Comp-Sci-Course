For this viewer, the film starts to gain momentum when Ledger tries to fake his identity on the phone and cash in on someone else's credit cards. Then, the miscarriage scene gives some force. But there is way too much predictability in the script, and fairly two-dimensional acting from the two leads. Given the girl's interest in painting and drawing, it seemed a bit inconsistent, at the scene of her breakdown, that she chose to scrawl volumes of highly charged prose poetry(far superior to her doodlings and indebted to the C19th French Symbolists) on the house walls. Her acting in these moments of heightened intensity just don't convince.I've now seen Cornish in three recent films where she plays very similar loser/confused adolescent types. Hopefully more directorial skill will lift her stakes. I've never been a Ledger enthusiast, apart from Brokeback Mountain(and not having seen his post-humously awarded role), where his inarticulateness, and internalised dilemnas were perfectly married to the intent of Ang Lee's film. That said,the parting of ways in he final cafe scene was poignantly satisfying
