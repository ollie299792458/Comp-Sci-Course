I admit I was suckered into purchasing this DVD because another site said it was "reference quality" audio.  The audio, while good, doesn't make this movie a disc you throw in to impress your friends.  I am  impressed that both DTS and DD5.1 audio is included, along with a few extra  features.  For that, Universal is commended.  The video is sharp also; it's  good enough that you wonder if Angeline Jolie's lips have been augmented  with collagen.
However, the problem with this movie is that it just isn't  very suspenseful or scary.  The cast is good, but it can't help the fact  that script is sub-par and the dialogue forced.
Denzel Washington  ("Lincoln Rhymes") stars as a former forensic expert who has been  paralyzed in the line of duty.  He becomes involved in a case anyway when a  young NYPD cop ("Amelia Donaghy", Angeline Jolie) stumbles onto a  gruesome murder scene.
The movie doesn't draw in the viewer into caring  about the serial murders being committed because it focuses more on Rhymes  tutoring Donaghy in the art of forensics rather than the victims or crimes  itself.  The movie doesn't bother to develop the murderer's character, so a  viewer doesn't fear him nor really feel interested in the case.
To make  matters worse, the sappy character development made me roll my eyes a  couple of times.  In fact, there isn't any other that of Rhymes or  Donaghy's character and even that seems awkward.  For example, it's just  not believable when Donaghy suddenly is enamored of and friendly with  Rhymes when until then Donaghy had no respect for Rhymes at all.
This  movie might be worth a rent, but definitely not a buy.  Try Silence of the  Lambs or Seven instead.
