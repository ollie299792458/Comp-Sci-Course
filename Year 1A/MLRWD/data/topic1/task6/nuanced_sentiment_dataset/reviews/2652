Waltz with Bashir was trumpeted as the final word on the "first Lebanon war" of 1982, and having lived in Israel for a little while and knowing how traumatic that war had been for the Israeli psyche, I braced myself for something earth-shattering.  I need not have worried.  It's a beautiful piece of animation, breathtaking at times, but in terms of message -- blah.  It's not even that the author's platform is so relentlessly Leftist; it's that he fails to make much of a point at all.  Many reviewers have already noted the various bits he might have tossed in to put the thing in context, but from the film, and even more from the interview with the filmmaker that was included as a special feature on my DVD, I understand that teaching history was not his intent.  Rather, the message, if there is one, is that war is hell, people die and survivors suffer; this is an important message but one that is neither new nor is done particularly well in the film -- if you want to see what art can do with it, read Remark's "All Quiet on the Western Front."
