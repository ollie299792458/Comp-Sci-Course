Herzog has never made a bad film. Well, okay, that really pedestran documentary about Tibetan monks doing a sand painting wasn't much, but that's more the exception that proves the rule. Herzog is at his best looking at human drives up close and ugly, in storms of chaos, and that's what he gives us here. Cage has made some, eh, less than  steller choices but he was absolutely perfect for this role; taking the strained humanity he showed he was capable of in Matchstick Men, he is one of the most memorable characters I've seen in years. Not a gruff cop with a heart of gold but a genuinely messed up, disconnected and horrible human being who nonetheless is capable of deeply caring for others in his own way. The scenes where he turns down sex in favor of scoring dope, does another guy's girlfriend in front of him while she shotguns him crack, and regrets ruining his expensive underwear while saving another man's life were all burned in my memory from the first viewing. Watching him connect with his dad's boozehound wife watching TV was genuinely affecting, as was his odd working relationship with, well, everyone. My one gripe is the ending, which I think was some kind of Herzog commentary on Hollywood or something, but it's still an engaging piece.
