Casino is probably the best movie of the 1990's.  The three main characters are grotesque but sympathetic due to the superb performances of DeNiro, Stone and Pesci.  The story is how the mob took over Las Vegas and eventually lost it as told from the point of view of its footsoldiers.  Casino takes an intriguing story and wraps it around three fascinating characters.  The result is pure cinematic genius.

Sharon Stone plays a frighteningly realistic slut with a grudge to settle.  Her character maims the royal scam that the men are perpetrating.  She serves as the Helen in this film - so powerfuly desireable, that she destroys the men in her path.
Pesci is the muscle man unafraid of anyone or anything.  But subject to all man's temptations.  His weaknesses of flesh are the eventual undoing of the main characters and serve as an admonition to all viewers.
The morality of this film is not the issue.  The relative morality is.  We are driven to contemplate our own values and how our hubristic tendencies force us to compromise our values.  We are left to question not wether we do, but to what extent and how that affects our lives.  Our most human dramas are writ large in this hyperbolic tale.  Its triumph is in the mirror that it holds to us.
