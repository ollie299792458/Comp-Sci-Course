Frank loves his parents. He loves the way they love each other. His heart breaks when he realizes that one of them is `cheating' on the other. He starts masquerading. They are now divorcing. He has to choose to live with one or other parent. He is 16. He chooses but is traumatized. (I was not traumatized not knowingly anyway; I was five). His deceptions increase. He continues to love his chosen parent. His grip on reality lessens as his masquerades become more outlandish. He is now travelling extensively but still writes `home'. He keeps wanting his parents to be together again but by now, his other parent has remarried. He finds out. He is in disbelief; simply not acceding to the possibility. More deceptions lead eventually to capture. He even escapes that process briefly to see his other parent. His looking through the window... is so poignant. It ends with his new parent figure. For me, this is a very moving story (with some personal resonance). The film is beautifully acted and paced. John Williams' music is perfect. Love of parents and one in particular, permeates this entire film.
