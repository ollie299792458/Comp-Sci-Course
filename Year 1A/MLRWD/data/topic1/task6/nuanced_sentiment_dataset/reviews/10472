I ran across this one while creating a new catalog of my movie library, which is heavy with horror and comic horror.  I wasn't able to recall much about it at the time, so I plugged it in.  I couldn't finish it.  For me, it is simply not watchable - for two main reasons.  First, the small band of "civilian" survivors did not carry weapons of any kind!  They just blundered around a huge hospital complex looking for food and medicine, fighting bare-handed when they were (frequently) attacked.  I can usually suspend disbelief when some aspect of a marginal but watchable movie defies logic, but this one exceeds my capacity.  For a while I tried to keep watching, accepting that the characters were just too stupid to live and that I might at least derive some satisfaction from seeing them get killed off.  Alas, the second flaw proved too great for me.

Second, there are frequent long breaks between the action scenes that are filled with inane (attempts at) dialogue.  I guess that someone thought they could write interesting personal history and commentary fiction.

I had to write a review of this stinkfest.  It's the only way I could salvage a little something from the time I wasted trying to watch it - by warning others away from repeating my mistake.
