Egads! This is an awful movie.  Even by 80s standards it's possibly one of the worst, slow moving, jaw yapping so called horror films I have ever seen and I've seen some doozies.

The movie is nothing but one long scene of inane boring dialogue after another with perhaps a split second of monster "scares" thrown in between.  An entire hour and fifteen minutes goes by before any kind of excitement happens and it's pretty mediocre when it does.  There isn't a single scare throughout, not a moment of suspense and subplots that go nowhere.  Who cares that the photographer's girlfriend is pregnant, it had nothing to do with the story at all.

And the extended shower scene that shows up if you click on the C.H.U.D.'s glowing eyes during the menu is identical to the scene in the movie, the only difference is you get to see the T&A that was cut out of the theatrical release.

Stay away, stay far far away from this awful movie or watch it on high speed fast forward like I did.

C.H.U.D is a D.U.D.
