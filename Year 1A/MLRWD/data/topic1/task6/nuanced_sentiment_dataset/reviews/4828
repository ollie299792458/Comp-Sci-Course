Dreadful patched-together thing, assembled from a Russian movie which was cut up to include el-cheapo Roger Corman style sequences featuring Faith Domergue (who appears almost comatose) and Basil Rathbone (who leans on things a lot).  The rest of the cast is Russian, and the rest of the movie is dubbed, very clumsily indeed.  The film has an overall reddish tinge (outer space is inexplicably fire engine red) and the DVD was mastered from a really terrible film copy.  The plot points are horribly obvious, the special effects are garbagey, and the film moves at a glacially slow pace.  I can only imagine what it was like before Corman cut it to its current length!
That being said, the robot IS cool, as is the air-car.  The vision of Venus is hilarious, especially considering what we know now, and the idea of calling the robot "Robot John" and addressing him as if he were a particularly stupid child is peculiar to say the least.  
Overall this is pretty dang awful.  I like bad movies but...this might just be irredeemable.  If the MST 3K crew were still working, this would be perfect fodder for them, and with a sufficient amount of beer and three witty friends, you might be able to have a fun evening.  But there are much better bad movies out there than this one to make fun of.
