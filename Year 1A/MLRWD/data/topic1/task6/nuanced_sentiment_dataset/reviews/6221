The plot of this musical makes no sense at all, but that, unfortunately, is often the case with musicals.  Julie Andrews' character is a music hall singer and a German spy, assigned to get acquainted with an American flyer, Rock Hudson, and extract military secrets from him.  So far, so good.  But then it gets all confused and we learn that Ms Andrews is perhaps but perhaps not in favor of the allies and that Mr. Hudson is or is not giving out accurate information.  Comedy relief is provided by two buffoon French "intelligence" officers.

Rock Hudson is a bust.  He plays Rock Hudson, handsome movie star.  I never believed for a second that he was a heroic pilot, any more than I believed John Wayne was Genghis Khan.  Julie Andrews is decorative enough, and she sings like an angel.  Of particular note is her first song in this movie, reprised at the end.  The cinematography is quite nice, but that is not why movies are made.  To my thinking they are made to tell a believable story with characters that seem realistic.  True, musicals rarely achieve this, "Chicago" being one exception.

Watch this, but you may want to fast forward after the opening number.
