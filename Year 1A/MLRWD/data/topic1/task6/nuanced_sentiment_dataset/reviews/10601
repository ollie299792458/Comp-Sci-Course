This movie was actually very funny! Ray Romano plays a home-grown local plumber and is hilarious like always. Gene Hackman plays a just retired divorced president who takes his summer house in Mooseport, ME as his primary residence. This is a big thing for the people of Mooseport that the president is going to live there. With the mayor spot currently vacant, the citizens of Mooseport ask the president if he would become mayor. The president says yes. There is just one problem though, the hardware store owner (Romano) wants to be mayor also. This has never happened in the history of Mooseport that two people run for mayor. So the mayor and the plumber try to sabotage each other. I was laughing mostly throughout the whole movie. If you like how Ray Romano acts on his sitcom you will love him in this movie because he has the same character traits as he does on his own show in the movie. This will be a movie that everyone will like, even kids. I think everyone should go see it while it is still in theatres! I enjoyed the movie very much!!!
