I love the Harry Potter books.  I cannot even tell you how much I love those books.  So when I saw this movie, I was very disappointed.  I was the first person in line at the box office and was the first person in the theater to watch the premier and was very let down.  The whole reason I didn't like this movie was the fact that they took OUT crucial events and added weird things that never even happened.  For example, they took out:
-Cornelius Fudge's resign from Minister of Magic.  I realize it might not seem like a big deal, but for the next movies, it's going to be a shock when all of a sudden there's a new guy.
-Harry and Ginny's relationship.  Again, it's kind of an important thing for the next movies.
-Harry's inheritance of Grimmauld Place and ownership of Kreacher.  That is VERY important as it is their hiding place for the next movie and Kreacher was a key to defeating Voldemort.
-Most of the pensieve memories are missing.  Like the one showing Voldemort's mother and grandfather.  And the memory explaining why Voldemort had become evil.
-And finally, the battle at Hogwarts.  This was a huge part of the story.  It took up several pages telling about it and in the movie, the Death Eaters make a quick getaway with nothing holding them back.

I guess what bothered me is that they added the burning down of the Burrow.  Why?  It wasn't mentioned in the book.  It has absolutely no significant value to the story.  And that location is a very key part of the next movie and now it has been destroyed.  It's kind of a red flag signaling the poor loyalty of the next movies to the book.

One other thing that disappoints me is that they try to keep this at a PG rating.  What they don't realize is that the story of Harry Potter gets darker as the books go on.  It can't be a good movie if it's rated PG simply because it would imply too much has been left out.  If the Deathly Hallows movies are PG, I can't say I will watch them.  Very disappointed in this movie.
