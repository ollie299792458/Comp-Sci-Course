Don't purchase this planning to be scared. Startled once or twice, perhaps, but that's all; this movie knows it's a slasher flick and plays up most of the genre's cliches without going overboard like "Scream" did. It's a gay movie, so there's plenty of requisite shirtless men running around; there's also plenty of blood. In keeping with what probably a limited budget, you don't actually see much killing - it's insinuated, done off camera, and then the camera's back to the "dead body." I actually like the approach as it's a bit more subtle than, say, a "Nightmare" or "Friday the 13th" flick. This movie is a fun watch with friends; don't plan to watch it alone. Not that you'll be too scared to sleep - in fact, the movie might just put you to sleep. It's got more than a few slow spots, but with a few friends you can spend plenty of time "telling" the characters what to do ("no, don't go that way") and making fun of the few production foibles.

Perhaps the toughest thing "Hellbent" has going for it is that it's not quite good enough for an "A" rated movie ("A" slasher flicks generally engage more supernatural elements; the bad guy in "Hellbent" may just be a twisted mortal), but not bad enough to be a "B" movie. That puts it in an uncomfortable middle ground where you're wishing it was either much better, with perhaps a more detailed (if not credulous) plot, or much worse, with all the fun that comes with a bad slasher flick.
