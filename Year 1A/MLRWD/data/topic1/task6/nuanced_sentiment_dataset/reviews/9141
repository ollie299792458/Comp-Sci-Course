This is the sequel of the 2001 movie The fast and the furious, personally i think that the first movie is a lot better than the second one...but i have some valid point of view about TO FAST TO FURIOUS...or 2 Fast 2 furious...whathever

GOOD POINT:

1) Good action sequence...the only one that i enjoy is the first one...I love the sound of the car when they push the NITRO

2) The girls....very hot...i love every type of girls but i prefer the asian

3)The cars.....but not too much....im going to say why in the BAD POINT...

BAD POINT:

1) This is a car movie....then...WHY there's only one good race in the entire movie ???

2) Bad acting...the only one that I think that act well is James remar and the one that act like the bad guy, i dont remember the name..

3)BAD plot....the first movie has a lot better plot

4) there's a lot of imports hot car around the world..so why they choose only  2 mitsubishi cars like the principal one's....i dont have anything agains mitsubishi...but they could use other brands or models...maybe an EVO VII with a Impreza WRX STI....or a SUPRA with a ECLIPSE...i dont know...i think that mitsubishi paid a lot of money to the director...

that's all......this is a good movie...i can see one or two times without problems but after that..i dont want to see the movie again...
