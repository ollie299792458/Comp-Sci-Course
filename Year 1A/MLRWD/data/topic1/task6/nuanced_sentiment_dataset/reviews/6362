'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is a film that incorporates many colourful characters such as Dr.Jekyll, Mr. Hyde and Captain Nemo. Sean Connery plays the old adventurer Allan Quartermain who is given a mission along with the so-called comic creatures who include Shane West (Hello? He isn't invisible, nor is he immortal, all he can do is shoot a gun. His addition to the film was pointless. Obviously the director knew that because of his looks, this film would attract the girls) 
'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is another forgettable film that was trying to cash in on the successes of comic book inspired films such as 'The Hulk', 'Spiderman' and 'X Men'. Unfortunately, this film does not have the high caliber performances seen in films like X Men, it is just an extremely poor version of what could have been an adventurous and enjoyable cinematic experience. 
The idea is great: it would be wicked to see different characters from stories being visually brought to life by the right people but LXG does not succeed. This film's actors are miscast (what is Sean Connery doing in this? He can play suave like no other but he is too old and tired to be running around). The plot felt used and I even lost recognition of what was happening in the story because the film had no fluidity. 
There are some real awful films that you can see and this is one of them so if you feel like seeing visual rubbish, go ahead but otherwise, spare yourself!
