Being a Salvadorean, I must say that this movie is based on an outsider's viewpoint. First of all, there was no dictaroship, the death squads were splinter squads operating apart from the government and the military. Second, Human Rights only came to stir up more trouble, as our police, military and other sectors have been downgraded in favor of system which is comfortable for the FMLN (the former guerrillas now a government party). The movie portrays them as some kind of heroes and critisices the USA for helping our military, which was getting murdered, mutilated and tortured by the opressive guerrillas. I seriously doubt any Salvadorean finds this movie historically accurate, I myself do not remember anything portrayed in the film happening in reality. And contrary to foreing belief, our country is not in same stage, as when the guerrillas were terrorising ours and blaming the government for it. This is classic propaganda done through a film: misinformation to the foreign public, in hopes of critsicing our democratic government and liberty-loving way of life. In the end, this movie is nothing more than a confused foreign opinion on something that only us Salvadoreans truly understand.
