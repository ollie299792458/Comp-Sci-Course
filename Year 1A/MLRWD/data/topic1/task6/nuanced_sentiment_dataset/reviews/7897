A somewhat irritating exercise in self-indulgence from the usually great PT Anderson.
I mean, I love films with symbolism, theme & stylization, but not when I can I can practically hear the director in the background of every shot screaming "I'M A GREAT DIRECTOR! LOOK AT MY WORK OF ART!"
Apparently, Punch-Drunk Love is some sort of American rip of Jean Pierre Jeunet's Amelie, with a similar plot line involving 2 dysfunctional individuals seeking love -- both films with a "dark" subplot which threatens the central character's pursuit & realization of that union (Amelie w/the picture booth, PDL w/ the phone sex gang)...
Some sort of masturbatory filmmaking by the "in crowd" of Hollywood, PDL seems more concerned with tooting its own horn & parading is "artistry" than building strong or remotely interesting narrative & characters... And I don't think that breaking genre coventions has to be a painful viewing experience.
Where Amelie provided history & background to support the pathos of the leads & empathy, PDL provides none. The film is so cruel to Emily Watson's character, that it doesn't even give a clue as to her inexplicable attraction to Sandler's character, except maybe some sort of twisted autistic fetish (?!)
The air is a bit too thick with pretense for my taste, and I just can't bring myself to contribute another laurel to Anderson's pile of collective hubris.
