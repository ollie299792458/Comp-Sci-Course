The Dreamers looks gorgeous and personally I disagree with most of the reviews here in that I found it interesting and not boring. For these reasons I've given it the 3 stars that I feel it deserves. However, I just can't make out what the point of the film is. After it was over I just felt like I'd wasted two hours. The best message I can come up with from it is, "You should spend your life playing creepy sex games with your siblings, but instead go out and live it." This, however, seems like it should be given in most people's lives.

 Not all movies have to have a point however, they can just be good entertainment, but this wasn't that. Afterall, personally I don't find incest erotic and this movie's main focus in on sex. The highlight of the film is that in certain spots characters act out scenes from old movies and their action is intersplice with the films they're mimicing. In fact it made me even go out and rent Freaks and Queen Christina the next day. However, as far as this movie is concerned, the film charades, along with incest, Maoism and Vietnam, is just another random digit which fails to add up to any meaningful real number.
