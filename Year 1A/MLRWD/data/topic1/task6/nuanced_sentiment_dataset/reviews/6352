Scooby and the gang once taught kids to be skeptical and that there was always a rational explanation to be found.

"And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!" was said by every villain in a mask for the entire run of the original series and for the majority of the spin-off shows.

However, this is the latest in a string of Scooby movies and cartoons that break that "formula" and trash the source material by implying things like magic, monsters & spirits are "real."  We have enough adults who choose to believe in that sort of stuff without encouraging impressionable children to do so too.

Stick with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNQVM">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZIZX54">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo: Complete 1st Season</a>" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K2UH0G">What's New Scooby-Doo?: The Complete First Season</a>".  These are faithful to the formula and to canon material.  They also teach kids look for answers instead of blindly believing that monsters or sky fairies did it.

Isn't a talking dog enough fantasy for your kids?
