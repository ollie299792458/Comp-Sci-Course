This is one of those films that you are suppose to admire and praise if you are in the artsy film crowd, however there was very little to really like about this work. Don't get me wrong the film was shot, edited and acted all very well, so what was the problem - the story.

First of for anyone who watches or reads a lot of science fiction will know that the premise has been done before so going into this movie one would hope for some sort of creative twists or something to differentiae this work from all of the others. The problem was there were none, and not only was there nothing different the movie never even pretended to try. This made the film so highly formulaic and predictable that it became painfully boring to finish. In fact the only reason I did finish it was to see if I was wrong -would they do something that surprised me and in the end the answer was a boring no.

**** Spoiler Alert****

Let be honest if you are a science fiction fan did any of this take you by surprise or did you expect it.

Vincent was going to succeed? Totally expected
Irene was going to be his love interest? Saw that coming a mile away
Irene was genetically defective? Yawn
Irene would end up covering for Vincent? Of course
Antonio would come back in the picture and try to foil Vincent's goal? My dog saw that one coming
There would be the inevitable second swimming scene? Boring
Director Josef was the murderer? Predictable

**** End Spoiler ****

Conclusion:

I'm giving the film 3 stars because it is well made and the acting was good and if you are new to sci-fi you might find it enjoyable, if you are not it will bore the dickens out of you.
