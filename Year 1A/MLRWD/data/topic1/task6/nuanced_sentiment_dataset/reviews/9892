What can I say? Yes, when this movie came out the art of CG graphics in movies was in its infancy. Heck, if you saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan you saw one of the first uses of computer graphics in a major motion picture (the Genesis sequence) produced by the people who would become Pixar. Those graphics actually looked a tad better than these which are closer to those you might have seen in Tron.

So, if you're really into modern CG and Sci Fi, you might have to gird your loins prior to seeing some of the graphics in this movie. For the time, though, the CG was pretty damned advanced. In a way, this film was a sort of test bed for what you could do without physical models back then. The funny thing is they actually did it more by accident than it being the intention from the inception of the movie.

That said, once you get past just how dated the CG is, you'll find a nice little story about a kid in the middle of nowhere finding a purpose he always thought he had but couldn't seem to find. It's a classic story that's even touched on by the characters in the movie (the Excalibur test). As much as I harp on the CG, I still enjoyed the story after all these years. This is, after all, one of those stories that I wanted to come true. The idea of being the "savior of the galaxy" isn't far from a lot of Sci Fi fanboy's dreams as is being picked up off Earth and dropped into a modern star fighter. And, the story is a fun little ride.

The extras on the disk aren't anything extra special but there is a nice behind the scenes featurette that gives you a sense for how much they were pushing the envelope at the time. I sort of expected more for a 25th anniversary edition but you know how the movies studios love to market the hell out of very little.

If you can get it on sale for $15 or less and you always wanted to be a starfighter pilot, then grab this sucker and have some fun.
