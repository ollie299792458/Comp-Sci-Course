Despite superficial comparisons to "Liar, Liar", "Yes Man" isn't a comedy--it's a drama. After only a handful of small laughs in the first half hour, I tried to enjoy it on a different level. Carrey has done drama before, and quite well: "The Truman Show" and "Eternal Sunshine...". The problem may not be that "Yes Man" isn't very funny--the problem may be that it feels mediocre.

It's the very definition of a high-concept movie, and it only succeeds about half of the time. It could be that many of the scenarios that Carl Allen (Carrey) finds himself in are unbelievable. No matter how seriously Allen's adherence to the "credo of yes", would he really get blown by his elderly neighbor (who has dementia)?

The movie is only loosely based on Danny Wallace's non-fiction book of the same name. (At the end of the film, there's a disclaimer: "Any resemblance to actual people, places or things is entirely coincidental and this is purely a work of fiction.") Had the movie taken a more literal approach to adapting the book, the movie might have been more dramatic and believable.
