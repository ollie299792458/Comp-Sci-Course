I am beside myself that this product was allowed to hit the stores. I have also gotten a copy that is terribly defective. Disk one the picture freezes multiple times, goes from 5.1 to stereo all my itself and I have to go back to setup to fix it and find the place I stopped at. Absolutely awful. Disk 2 is about the same, multiple freezing, which destroys the continuity of the concert and also every time you hit enter, as instructed, to see the interviews, it automatically shuts off 5.1 to stereo. Again, I have to go to setup and so on and so on. This terrible product should be pulled from stores and replaced with fixed product and all consumers allowed to get a replacement.

To the few who have said that their dvd's play fine, I almost find that hard to believe. My player is practially new, so it shouldn't have had any trouble UNLESS the dvd's themselves are defective, as others here have stated.

In any event, buyer beware, there's apparantly an awful lot of these defective dvd's out there. So you will surely be taking a chance on this product. I am sorry to say this.

What a terrible waste of 2 great concerts.
