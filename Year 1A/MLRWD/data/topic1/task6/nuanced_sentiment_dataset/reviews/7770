This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I bought it based on the unbelievably positive reviews on this site.  There was nothing I liked about this film.  First of all, it's part horror, part martial art and all bad.  This is not a film about Vidocq....this is a film about the director.

Hey look at me! Let me put the camera on the floor showing someone walking into a room.  Now let me put it on the ceiling showing them coming in.  Next, let me pan in and out and all around as they sit at a desk. Now, let me go in for a close up of their face at an angle, etc, etc. The direction is so annoying and in your face that you have trouble following the story which is disjointed as well.

Don't get me wrong.  I've seen plenty of stylized directors and many were quite good without without being distracting, but not this one.  There was literally not one minute where the camera stayed stationary.  The fight scenes were choreographed Chinese acrobatics with choppy close up editing.  You know, the kind where the director has no idea of how to stage a good battle.  Instead, he opts for tight handheld movements of waists and torsos moving around.

Vidocq seems to have been quite the character and I knew I wouldn't get the real story from a movie about him, but this was a travesty.  I found a good book on his life and will be ordering that instead.
