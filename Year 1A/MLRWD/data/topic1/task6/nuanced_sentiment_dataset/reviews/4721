First of all, please disregard the reviews that say that this movie is a family movie.  It most definitely is NOT.  Believing that Mr. Kinkade, who calls his self the "painter of light," would only have movies that were truly family-oriented, I sat down to watch this movie with my inlaws.  There was a profuse use of profanity, only partially covered breasts on one particular young lady throughout the movie, and sexual innuendo.  Now, we all know that people are like this in everyday life, however, it can be more tastefully portrayed to where the audience gets the idea.  Furthermore, the other reviews failed to note that these actions were done during, of all things, a church Christmas play, inside the church.  The young lady that was portraying the Virgin Mary was the one revealing much of her breasts, as well as saying and gesturing sexual innuendo.  Anyone who says this is not so, apparently were not paying attention to the movie, or their sound was to where they couldn't hear her, the town mayor, and also the church pastor's crude comments.  Needless to say, I was very embarassed to be watching this movie with my inlaws, of all people.

I'm writing this review, because the movie took away all that was good about Mr. Kinkade's artwork that I have loved all these years and made it something that seemed like a fraud to me.  I have felt nothing but hurt for what Mr. Kinkade said that he stood for, and so obviously doesn't.  As a person that was a Thomas Kinkade fan, I must say that I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and I was very surprised that he put his name on it.
