I was never a great fan of Ray Bradbury's writings, but I loved
Something Wicked This Way Comes and looked for the movie on DVD regularly until it was issued.  The movie does full justice to
the book, and the special effects, while not spectacular (and
probably not intended to be) bring the story to life in a way
not often achieved.  The basic theme is selling one's soul to
the devil, not very original in the abstract, but Bradbury's treatment of the theme, and Disney's rendering of it in terrifying color, bring the story orders of magnitude beyond
the ordinary.  The lightning, a key element of the story, is,
alas, a bit phony in the strokes, but the white-lighting of the
landscape by the flashes are very realistic.  As a lover of
thunderstorms, I count this movie worthwhile for that alone.
Not having re-read the book for many years, I had to watch the
movie more than once to get a full grip on the plot details.  I would have liked more special features than just the theater trailer, but you can't have everything, and this disc comes with
wide-screen and full-screen versions.
