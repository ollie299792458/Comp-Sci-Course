The more Kubrick I see, the more apparent it becomes that he was a very conventional film-maker.  Now, I love Doctor Strangelove, love it dearly.  But sadly, it's the most intelligent and original film he ever managed to  make.  After that nearly perfect auteur-debut, he came out with this  shamefull mutation of Nabokov's famous bestseller (Warning to lovers of VN:  This movie will make you want to die.), and he spent the rest of his  carreer tiptoeing the line between the greatness he achieved in Strangelove  and the Spielbergian depths of this abomination.  
Kubrick does a decent  job of adapting the portions of the book that he chose to use.  Unfortunately, much too little of this movie comes directly from the book,  and those long segments that he apparently made up himself ruin the film  beyond repair.
So, this movie is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the  Nabokov credit for the screenplay.  He wrote a script, but Kubrick ignored  it.
See the Adrian Lyne version, if you must see a film version of  Lolita.  It's got its problems too, but it's much more loyal to the text,  and Irons plays a diverting Humbert.
