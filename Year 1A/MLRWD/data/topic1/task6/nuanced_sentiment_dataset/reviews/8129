When it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", what can I say except breath-taking, Awesome, Great, Flawless, and Brilliant? Well the best part was that I was with some wonderful friends when I saw it.  It was an exceptional film. I was especially impressed by Rain. She was very sassy and clever. The interaction between her and Spirit were both comical and sweet. It was a very humorous movie. In the opening sequence, Spirit had an especially funny interaction with a big herd of bison. The interactions between the horses themselves was ingenious. The emotions being conveyed by facial expressions, whinnies, and neighs as opposed to human speech. It added a level of realism where as Human speech would have made it quite cheesy. The animation was very fluid and nearly flawless in my opinion. I can honestly say that I could watch this movie fifty times and still never tire of it. The songs and musical score were top notch and added to the overall panoramic experience. It made me feel like I was there. This movie conveys several positive messages.  It implies the value of friendship and the necessity of respecting nature and its living things.  It also clearly states what I have always believed, which is that animals have feelings and emotions similar to humans.  This movie is a priceless treasure that is very family friendly. It spans the spectrum of emotion from joy to sorrow and back again. It is a wonderful adventure that will leave you cheering and crying at the same time. If you see any movie this year, make it "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron". You won't be disappointed, but you will be uplifted. If I could describe this movie in one word, I'd say perfection!!!
