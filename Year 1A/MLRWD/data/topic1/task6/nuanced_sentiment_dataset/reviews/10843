I did not like the plot of the movie;  the convenience of Acupuncture in the last scene, the worst symbloic gesture IMO.

Others that bothered me are the incomplete coverage of the teenage prostitution, Dojun being hinted that he was not as retarded as he seemed, with the comments at the dinner table, and at the bus terminal, mentioning what he really sees all along. And, annoyingly smothering motherly love, or, the obsession, And the poor andvery unlikely accusation of the murder conviction to Dojun and another orphan kid by the police(prosecuters), then the poorly featured corrupted lawyer character. To me, the plot was not refined to sit in my head as a great and comprehensive work at all.

It is all cacophony, not rather concentrating much into the obsessive, yet, ignorant mother(Kim, Hyeja)'s emotional changes, or perhaps, the betrayal she feels when she finds her son, indeed, killed the poor school girl in-depth.

Seeing where Bong, Jun-ho, the director, comes from , and his interviews, I am a little disappointed with his crude plots of the movies. He should have grown further from the works 10 years ago. It still is the same. But, the RAW style images, he produces are quite something people may find interesting.

The actor, Won Bin, is Yun, Dojun in the movie. I find him as a very promising actor, even better after his Militay duty in S. Korea, that he could actually show the emotional changes in recent movies he has been in. But, I prefer his role in A Man from Nowhere to this one.

Kim, Hyeja is the top actress in Korea undoubtedly. And, I don't have anything to say more.
