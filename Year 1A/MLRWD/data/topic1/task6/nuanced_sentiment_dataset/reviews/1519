After ordering my copy from Hong Kong and Canada they have finally given the US a break releasing this installment of the hellraiser series. Greatful to have a good transfer of the film I'm somewhat depressed at what I've gotten.  After spending so many years in Limbo, the best we can do is a few small features?

Feature film only DVDs sell for way less today!  I can't believe the price is so high.  Just another DVD to hit collectors where it hurts... the pocket! Nothing to offer but the film. Although it's nice to finally have it, it's not worth the price.

It also said the film is the R rated Version.  I"m not sure if this is the unrated one or not.  I compared it with my Hong Kong version and I remember comparing my Hong kong with my VHS Unrated. I'm not sure if it's R or not.  If it's the Rated version, that's just inappropriate!  They should have at least left the option to play unrated by adding missing portions to the film and putting them in the extra features to watch seperately.

When it comes down to it, only a true obsessed collector should waste money on it.  And those who released it with barely any energy into explaining what they produced should be ashamed.  Hell knows, I feel ashamed for buying it.  I had the same thing on two other DVDs and there's nothing that special on this one.  At least Canada and Hong Kong earned their 5$
