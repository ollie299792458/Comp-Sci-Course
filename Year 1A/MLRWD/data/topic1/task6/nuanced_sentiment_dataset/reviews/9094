I have to say that I really really really liked this movie but they've got an incorect fact.  This fact is really important because it totally ruins the end of the movie.  I would like to point out that Gwen is not a commoner becasue neither of her parents are commoners.  Marian is of course of noble blood and might I point out was also the king's ward.  Robin was Robin of Lockesly and Robin's father was Lord of Lockesly therefore making Robin Hood also a Lord.  This would make Gwen of sufficient birthright to marry the prince or should I say king.  Therefore the fact that they didn't marry would be totally incorect because there would be nothing to stop them from marrying and might I say that the commoners would probably approve of her above anyone else therefore making everyone happy.  Besides this "small" incorect fact i really did enjoy the movie and I just wish that the movie had gotten it correct so I could have enjoyed it more.  I do strongly recomend that you watch it however because it is very good and very well done.
