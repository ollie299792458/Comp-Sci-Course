I enjoyed this movie. It was not one that I felt compelled about to discuss afterwards, but I am bored so I am writing a review. As probably the majority of people reading this do not have DVD (myself included) I  shall review the VHS version.
One of the main reasons that people are so  critical of this film seems to be that they think it is horror, or trying  to be of that genre. I would disagree, and suggest that it is simply an  attempt at a suspense film, and as a suspense film, it fared OK. I was not  really surprised at any point during the film, but some girls that I saw it  with were, proving that it is effective to those who don't follow the  genre.
Some positive aspects of the film were its scripting originality,  ending, cast, and from memory, sountrack. The ending is one everyone has  seen before, and will probably see again, but fairly well done, the  suspense scenes are fairly well constructed, although failing to really  deliver, and the cast, while mainly good for star attraction, managed their  roles fairly well.
Overall, this is a fairly good film, with nothing  really wrong, but there is no one aspect that makes it stand out above the  rest. For this reason, I rate it just above average.
