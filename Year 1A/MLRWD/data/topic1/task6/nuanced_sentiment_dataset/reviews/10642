As South Park seems goes on, more and more viewers complain that it's 'not as funny as it used to be'. Or ,'too preachy to be funny'. But lets face it, despite the fact that the creators have added more layers to their stories and gone for more socially relevant themes, it is still damned funny in its own right. And lets face it, these guys are having a tough time coming up with new show ideas. They produce the show the week it airs, for gods sake!! Lets see you meet a deadline like that. And as for season 9 itself, well, it had its moments like 'Best Friends Forever', 'Free Willzyx', 'The Losing Edge', 'Follow that Egg', and 'Marjorine'. My least faves here were 'Mr Garrisons Fancy New Vagina' and 'Erection Day'. Two of the worst episodes I have ever seen. Worse than that 'Pip' episode in season 4. The crowning achievement of this season was the 'Trapped in the Closet', a scathing look at Scientology that not only caused huge controversy but had the distinction of being the only episode to be pulled from the rotation because of a celebrity being upset over the shows portrayal of him. And, once the scientologists came at them, the catholics saw their opportunity with 'Bloody Mary'. Consequently, these DVD's are the only way anyone can ever see these episodes at all. Way to go, jerk-offs!

ANyway, I enjoy this season as a whole. And I can't wait to own it on DVD. Especially can't wait to hear the mini-commentaries. Well, that's it for this one.
