Did any of us know that Wyatt himself drew a map of the gunfight in 1919.........and there in is something very special........something captured in this version of the famous gun fight.....

I have just ordered this DVD, surprised it wasn't on Bluray, but no matter.....the most important thing to me is the additional story pieces restored to the film, and the extras, which in this case give you something that has never been noticed before: In Wyatt's map of the beginning of the fight, you see just how smart and dangerous old Doc is......which should add to his legend even more.....

Usually the fight shows all four men, the Brothers and Doc standing side by side. But Wyatt's map shows something entirely different.......As the good Brothers, Marshals and all, march up to the fight 3 abreast of each other, (with the intentions of getting the guns from the group to prevent violence if possible) old Doc stays near the street to the right side, showing he understands spreading out is the best approach, just in case the shooting starts......

So according to Wyatt's own map, that walk up together splits up right before both groups are facing each other, with Doc staying off to the right closer to the street.....tactically a great move....after all....Doc didn't come to arrest anyone............he came to protect Wyatt and the Brothers and kill anyone who tried to harm them, or all of them if it came to that......

I like it.....Doc you devil you.....you understand how to fight and WIN.....

Like M. G Watson "Miles Watson" wrote in his great review on page 28: Never mess with a man whose motto is: "Say when!"
