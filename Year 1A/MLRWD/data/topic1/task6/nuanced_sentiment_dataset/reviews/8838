I was initially charmed by the premise that the main character, Stephan, could not tell if he was awake or dreaming a lot of the time.  I loved the style of animation used to portray his dreams and whimsical personality.  However the film does less well developing the relationship between Stephan and Stephanie which is the heart of the story.  Although their "inner children" are kindred souls neither one seems to have the maturity to sustain a relationship.  Stephan is so needy he virtually throws himself at Stephanie.  The movie helps us understand him by alluding to the death of Stephan's father and alienation from his mother.  On the other hand we don't learn much about Stephanie.  Is she ambivalent because she's been hurt in the past?  Is she wary of Stephan's neediness, or should we take her statement that she simply "doesn't want a boyfriend" at face value?  We don't know what makes her tick, and she seems quite passive and reactive.

I count myself among the many who hope for a happy ending when they see a romantic comedy.  If I can't have a happy ending I at least want a clear ending, but I got neither.  The confusion and uncertainty that plagued these characters all through the film remains unresolved.  It appears that even the film makers could not make a commitment to these characters.  Frustrating!
