For me, attractiveness of the cast is a prerequisite for giving a movie the chance to work. This cast is outstanding in that respect. The four stars are well known to movie and TV fans, and all are pleasures to watch.

Brad Pitt's character, Earlie Grayce, is a bouncing bucket of nitro: he can explode at any instant. He is so pointlessly cruel that one is more surprised by his non violent actions. There seems to be no systematic rationale for his behavior. But his portrayal of the this inchoate monster is outstanding in the details of the action.

The other characters seem to have even less structure, but are all convincingly played. Duchovny's character, Brian, is an emergent being with little inner structure, and woefully inadequate knowledge of the subject he is obligated to write a book about, serial killers.

Juliette Lewis does a very good job of portraying what is almost a "Rain-girl" version of the monster's innocent girl friend. However she manages to summon up enough integrity and ego for independent thought.

Michelle Forbes seems to be extending her Star Trek TNG character of Roe Larren to the big screen. She is the underachieving, but mightily striving photographer, whose ultimate function in the plot is not clear. Her early unease about Grayce does not help her to deal with him.

At the end of the movie, what tipped the scales for me up to 3 stars was that as pointless as the plot line seemed to be, and as random as the characters' interactions were, the relationships were not much more bizarre and inexplicable than those we hear about on the evening news. Frankly, they were more believable than some of what you see on Oprah, Dr. Phil, or Jerry Springer.

Watch the actors; they are at least excellent, and Brad Pitt is outstanding!
