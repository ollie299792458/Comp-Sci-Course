I watched this movie because my wife read the book. I did not read it. The film version STARTS as a possible heartfelt family drama-adventure - a charming but serious-undertoned fantasy about the age old subject of Good vs. Evil - 'Light vs. Dark.' But soon it's drowning in testosterone-driven action; the pugilistic teenage male characters and their 'toughness' quickly dominate the story, overpowering the mystery and wonderment of otherwise good fantasy. This is not by any stretch anywhere near Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter!
Action and special effects in The Seeker appeared just thrown-together -- spoiler alert -- giving the film's middle and end sections a wildly chaotic look. Also, how many times in one movie can you use the now very tired effect of knocking down or blowing away a character in slow motion? Typically I'm not a prude about these things, but there seemed an awful lot of all kinds of violence for an '8yr+' film. No nuance, no wonderment, no charm, no finesse; only wilted mystery, stilted displays of family affection and broad disjointed violence disguised as action.
