Goodfellas is martin scorseses blunt look at the unscruplous life of Henry Hill, who dreamed of being a gangster growing up in his low life neighborhood. The film chronicles his "rags to riches" life that ends when he is forced to rat on his friends and enter a witness protection program. The film has a much harder edge to it than The Godfather; containing vibrant but grotesque characters that deserve little sympathy. The fast kinetic editing and period music add immensely to the overall effect of goodfellas. Not since Coppola has a director been able to absorb so many elements into a gangster flic but make it a creation entirely his own. Certainly one of the more violent mob movies made, it justifies every action made on screen. There are no filler scenes or excess blood to please the viewer. By the end, one has an understanding of all aspects of "the life" including that of the wives as well. With the exception of one scene, there are not too many surprises in Goodfellas, which speaks volumes about its power. It is able to keep the viewer hooked for 2 and a half hours moving from point A (Henry's childhood) to point B ( His exit from "the life"). Ray Liotta does a remarkable job in the lead role, but the supporting cast is brilliant. Pesci, DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, Loraine Bracco, and the rest of the "crew" make perfect caricatures out of the cliche gangster mentality.
