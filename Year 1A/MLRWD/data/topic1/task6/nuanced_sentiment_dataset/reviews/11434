>>They call it "Sin City".  Maybe that's why I didn't like it.

In all truthfulness, it was a REALLY good movie.  No use in doubting that.  It was a REALLY good movie, and yet...

  ...I didn't like it.

Apart from being just a little too long, by the time we reached the half-point of the film, I was already sick of it.  Yes, it's called "Sin City" and there is a reason why it's called "Sin City", with all the violence and brutality and sleaziness helping the film live up to its name--its title, but the fact of the matter is, they exhausted all those entities, along with others, to the core.

In the first hour, I was amazed by Sin City.  Its luminescent, lucid, at times blazing, grades of black and white.  Its piercing action and racy dialogue.  The unexpected outbursts of red, yellow, green, and blue.  The characters you find yourself enchanted with, the characters you rush to hate and hesitate to love.  All this, the first hour gave me.

But then, the film ran on....and on.  They exhausted their use of violence, gore, and brutality.  It really did make me kinda sick.  There were parts at which I felt like gagging.  Too MUCH gore.  Too MUCH brutality.  "Sin City" &lt;--no lie.  Maybe I should of expected all that "sin", but really, they exhausted this word, too.  Many characters got the sh*t beat out of em.  Likewise, this film got the sh*t beat out of it.  By gore, by brutes, by sleazy, twisted men, who made me feel like screaming.  I sat, writhing in my seat, finding no other solution to my fuming awkwardness.

They threw the blood at us, and it became annoying.  An overly excessive use of gore.  I can take it in moderation, hell, I can take a lot.  SIN is not just gore.  Makes you wonder if they realize that.  GORE is a product of sin, but it is not its equivalent.

Once again, this film is REALLY good.  But I didn't like it.
