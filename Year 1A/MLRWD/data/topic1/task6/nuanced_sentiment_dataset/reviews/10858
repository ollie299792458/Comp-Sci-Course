This week was the first week that I ever saw this movie. I was so moved I had to watch it twice. The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is so moving and touching that it has gotten me both times. Do I recommend it? Yes, very much so. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Now. I purchased the Amazon copy so it's on my library, but I plan on buying a DVD copy of it and later a Blu-Ray (if I get around to buying a Blu-Ray player).

The story is of a famous Polish pianist named Szpilman who is a Jew in Warsaw during World War II with his mother, father, two sisters, and brother. Through his music, he is able to survive and escapes death many times (I'm not really ruining anything since he has to live as he would later become famous again). The composition for this movie is fantastic and I have since started listening to the great Chopin. Not to mention, if you love Adrien Brody, this is absolutely a must-see film. He is amazing in this film and about as gorgeous as ever. His performance as Szpilman will forever haunt me because it is so lifelike and will stay with you. Watching this movie made me realize how easy of life is. We can get food, water, or blankets when we need them, but he could not. He survived with what he could find, even after every little tragic thing that happened to him.

Overall, fantastic film. Five stars across the board, no hands down. If you see this movie in stores, buy it. You won't be disappointed. Who knows? Maybe it will inspire you to learn to play the piano. It might just save your life someday.

God Bless Wladyslaw Szpilman.
