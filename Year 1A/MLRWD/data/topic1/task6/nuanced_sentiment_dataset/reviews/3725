*NOTE* This review is for the UNRATED version ONLY.

First thoughts...Ummmmm I'm not sure about this one. It's still kind of funny in some scenes but it lacks the quality of the first two. Here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--The directing from David Zucker is just okay. I personally preferred Keenen Ivory Wayans who directed the first two.
2.  Script--Face it, the script sucked. It's not very funny, and sometimes it's just plain stupid. Yeah, some of it is okay, but that's it. It's just okay, unlike the first two, which were excellent.
3.  Acting--This is something that has never improved in the Scary Movie series. It's just okay. You've still got Anna Faris and the late Leslie Neilsen.

Now for the content review.
Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor throughout, some comic violence and language/UNRATED.

1.  Sex/Nudity=5/10. There are still a lot of sexual jokes, but they're not funny, unlike the first two.
2.  Violence/Gore=2/10. There is some violence, but it's played for laughs.
3.  Language=6/10. It's far different from the first two. 2 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 3/5. I'm not a big fan of this movie. There are maybe ONE or TWO funny parts unlike the first two, which had you laughing throughout the entire movie. I personally think that it would have been better if it had an "R" rating but the people who made it were trying to reach a younger audience, which I think is pretty stupid. But, anyways, stick to the first two, they're worth watching, unlike this one.
