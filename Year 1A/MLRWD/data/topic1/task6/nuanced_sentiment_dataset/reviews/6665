1. Decpetive Advertizing - The early ads for the films were stunning and made it look like a plotted dino documentary.  Then later ads revealed that the characters talked.
2. Why is this Movie Backwards? - The biggest scene in the film in terms of effects and emotional impact is the asteroid destroying the lemurs' home.  Since that came so early on nothing really came a long to top that, the movie pretty much went downhill.
3. I liked it better when it was called "Tarzan" - Despite the lack of songs, this flick feels extremely derivitive, especially of the aformentioned movie about the guy in a loincloth.  But Tarzan went through the various trials and emotional battles of trying to discover where he belonged.  Aladar just walked around a lot.
Basicly, "Dinosaur" is a film that's all show and no substance.  I'm all for a pretty film, but nothing in here looks good enough to counter the dull as dirt characters and stale plot.  An animated film of any kind can only truly work if time and attention have been paid to the story.  Unfortunately, no attention seems to have been paid to the story of "Dinosaur".  The star is for the nice textures and a few visuals that I liked.  Not nearly enough to rescue this movie.
