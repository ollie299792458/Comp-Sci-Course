this is one of the 5 best movies ever made, barnone...it is without a doubt the finest movie ever made about the music 'industry', and the casting is extraordinary...

it would be a shame to single out any one individual, because, despite the obvious initial reaction to one lead character (who shall remain nameless), every character is essential to the elements that come together and make this film work...(including the 'extras' auditioning...)

and what a soundtrack...can you do any better than 'mustang sally', 'dark end of the street', 'never loved a man', and 'treat her right'...i don't think so...

and the fact that they finally acknowledged that fact with this terrific 'deluxe' set does my heart good...

however...

even though i agree with all the great reviews that are posted here, i have to disagree with the use of the word 'comedy' to describe this movie...

sure, it has some funny moments, but at it's core is the passion...the passion for what you do, and what you love, and, when both can come together, even against all odds, it's a beautiful thing...

so don't just look at this for laughs...see the struggle that brother rabbit has in realizing his dream, and seeing the potential in others...

then you'll really begin to see the potential in this film...
