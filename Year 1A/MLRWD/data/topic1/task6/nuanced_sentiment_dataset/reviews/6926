Natalie Jane's review and nurses perspective I couldn't agree with more.  Buonaugurio bumbles along trying to make a point about home birth but fails by being totally a self absorbed, poorly dressed, inarticulate meathead. Sticking the camera in his wifes face, when she clearly seemed annoyed, was painful to watch. That scene where shes crying, suggesting that the traveling and (implied) the film was bringing her down. And then during the birth it appeared she didn't even want  Buonaugurio near her, as the sign on the door said keep out. I was thinking maybe her labor was so long because she had to worry about where  Buonaugurio was and if he had the camera on. At the end I was expecting to find out she left him. Only truly interesting parts were the interviews in Holland and Germany showing how natural birth is common and integrated into the culture and medical system. It's too bad since the concept of the film was to promote midwifery and home birth and it really just left me annoyed. Hospitals aren't bad. It's a complex system with problems that saved your daughters life.
