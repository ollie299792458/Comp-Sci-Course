Have you ever wanted to escape? Leave the hustle and bustle of city life behind? And do you believe things, even tragic things, happen for a reason? If so, you should truly be enthralled with "The Horse  Whisperer".
When my younger sister first told me how she cried and  cried throughout this film and that she related to the horse....I had to  wonder! After viewing an horrific accident in the icy snow between a truck  and two young girls on their beloved horses, I saw an insight into my  sister's life I had not known. As "Pilgrim" ( Graces horse ) did,  my sister also felt scarred, disliked , and rebellious. See, she too had an  auto accident which left physical scars on her face and apparently in her  own psyche. This film was her catharsis.
This a beautifully shot  meandering journey to find oneself again. Whether you are the young girl,  the confused yet strong mother, the displaced father, the hallowed horse or  even the magically patient horse whisperer himself.
The crazier this  techno world gets...the more I say, "Life is calling, but why can't  she whisper?" Enjoy!
