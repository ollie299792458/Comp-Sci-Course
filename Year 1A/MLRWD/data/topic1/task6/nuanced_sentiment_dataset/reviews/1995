I tried to keep an open mind going into "Not Another Teen Movie". The teen film is ripe for parody and maybe someday we'll get a good, funny film that skewers the genre. This one certainly isn't it. Sure, it had some funny moments (Jaime Pressly is especially good as the head cheerleader), but most of the jokes fall flat and the film just becomes another lame teen flick. Also, someone in the writing team is obsessed with scatological (and I mean that literally) humor. It's just disgusting and not funny at all. Finally, some of the films that are targeted will probably not be familiar to those THIS film is targeted toward, since most were released when today's teens were toddlers ("Pretty In Pink" and "Risky Business", for example). It's fun to see actors from that era (Molly Ringwald, particularly), but their presence probably went over the heads of the kids in the audience. If you feel you must see this, rent it first. I was not a fan of "Scary Movie", but it blows this one away.
