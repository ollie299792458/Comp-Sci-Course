To be a teenager in 1975 was an awesome thing.  Great, new music was coming out all the time, filling the airwaves and stereo speakers with incredible new sounds.  Some of the new sounds came in the form of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here - the follow-up to their record breaking, history making The Dark Side of the Moon.

Sited by fans and band members alike as their favorite album, it went straight to number one on the charts in both their native England as well as in the U.S. as well as topping the charts in other countries, as well.

This rockumentary tells the very interesting story of the making of this iconic album through new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason as well as archive interviews with the late Richard Wright who passed away in 2008 just one week before the release of the concert DVD by his band mate, David Gilmore, entitled Live in Gdansk on which he played keyboards.  There are also interviews with the sleeve designer, Storm Thorgerson, the "burning man" on the album cover, Ronnie Rondell, the recording engineer, Brian Humphries, and guest vocalist, Roy Harper.

Of particular interest to me was the discussions amongst the remaining band members of their ex-band mate, Sid Barrett, who they sung about in the song, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, and his unexpected visit to the Abbey Road studios while the band was working on Wish You Were Here. They also share an astonishing photo of the psychedelic genius in his later years.  Obviously, Waters, Gilmore and Mason still have a tremendous soft spot in their hearts for their late, tortured friend who passed away in 2006.  The band also discusses the album's theme of music industry greed as well as "absence".

The Story of Wish You Were Here is one of those rare documentaries that warrant repeated viewings because of the incredible wealth of information and revelation contained within it.  It's definitely a must-have DVD for music buff's viewing library.
