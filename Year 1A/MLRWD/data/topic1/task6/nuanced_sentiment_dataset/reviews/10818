If you are new to WWII studies or have limited knowledge, this series will keep and hold your attention featuring mostly original color footage, which thanks to the reprocessing looks often times amazing.  However, if like me, you expected the actual footage to be the star - as reflected in the title - then you will be disappointed.  Instead of stories behind the combat footage or even longer shots of the footage, this attempts to tell a real "dramatic" story. Thus, you have quick cuts, a story line that jumps around, and extensive (but well done) overdubbing of the (originally nonexistent) audio.  The footage is only related to the real events in certain locations, so that I was wondering if what I was viewing was really footage from the alleged location.  (This sense is increased by obvious errors and repitions of the same footage.)

Though I appreciated the Hollywood talent on the voiceovers, I would have rather had Gary Sinese tell me the real story behind the video rather than try to recreate Saving Private Ryan as a documentary.  I was expecting something more like the 1999 or 2000 Tom Hanks narrated "Photographers of WWII" (title?), but that would probably bore most viewers.  So I appreciated the high production values that went into this and I'm sure it will hold many viewers' attention, but I found myself again and again simply hitting the pause button to study and watch (because many cuts don't last longer than 3 seconds - MTV style).  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, but here they had pictures running in color but instead chose to mash them into something they weren't.
