I wanted to like this show, but it was just so incredibly bad.  The story is poorly executed in the very crucial sense that there's very little true drama, no intensity, no suspense, no humor, no heart, very little action.  In short, the story lacks the absolute critical elements (or ingredients) that go into good story-telling and consequently the show was not entertaining.  The only real story seemed to be the supposedly-friendly-acting-but-really-sinister aliens (aka the Visitors or the Vees) have some super secret evil plan that a handful of humans and "truly friendly" aliens are trying to reveal and stop.  That single lone storyline takes up the entire season and it flimsily and boringly drags on and on and on for the entire first season with a few vapid sub-stories thrown in.  So the season was really boring since the story never seemed to progress, mature or truly go anywhere.  Watching it was frustrating.  And making matters worse is the fact that all the characters are boring and uninteresting--the FBI agent, the Priest, the hammy over-the-top Mercenary-type, the friendly "black guy" alien--are all boring.  The writing is so weak on this show.  The acting is bad.  The SFX are bad--I've never seen worse green screen SFX shots on any TV show.  For a truly good SCI-FI TV re-make, check out the re-do/re-make of "Battlestar Galactica" (Seasons 1-3).  That was an excellent re-make of an older SCI-FI TV show.  This remake of V is a colossal disappointment.
