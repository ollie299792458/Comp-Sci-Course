"Shrek 2" was the best bet for a potientially great film, (...). It wasnt.
The Good is simple: Antonio Banderas. Puss in Boots was simply a far better character than anything else in the movie, with a side-splitting voice and a fantastic Zorro-esque mood. The best jokes in the film come from him.
Eddie Murphy. He stole the original, but here he doesnt have the same energy, and not enough classic jokes to keeep his motor mouth turning. Despite this he still lands kudos for his "Pinyata" speech. As Donkey points out in the movie, "the postion of annoying talking animal side-kick is taken". Sadly by Donkey, Puss in Boots is by far a funnier character in this movie.
MOVIE JOKES: Excellent references to films such as "Spiderman", "Lord of the Rings", "Flashdance", "Alien", "raiders of the Lost Ark" etc.
MUSIC: Not just as good as the original, but Counting Crowes theme is brilliant.
THE BAD: The plot isnt as razor sharp as the original, the piss take of Hollywood cultire doesnt work as well as the piss take on fairy tales did. Mike Myers has no good jokes as Shrek, who becomes a very 2D character, as does Fiona (Cameron Diaz).
Who got John Cleese cast as the King? Good work!
Who wrote the screenplay giving Cleese NO jokes at all? Get out of making films for Good!
The jokes arent as well thought out as the original, and seem to fall back on bodily function jokes as opposed to down right killers like the "Ogres are like Onions" joke in "ShreK"
In any case its worth watching for Banderas alone.
