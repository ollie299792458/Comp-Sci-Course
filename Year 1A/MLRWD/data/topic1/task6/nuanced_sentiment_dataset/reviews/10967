Paradise Now a gripping film on the lives of Palestinian suicide bombers. Having spent a semester abroad in the middle east in college, I was particularly interested (and passionate) about this subject. I left my 3 months in Israel/Palestine more frustrated and confused than when I initially came (my initial thoughts/views were quickly destroyed when confronted with real life), and this film doesn't attempt to solve the problem, merely shed a more complete light on the plight of Palestinians. A few things of note in the film:

  * The media and prevailing assumption of the West (especially in the evangelical church) is that suicide bombers choose this route as a vengeful, spiteful, and somewhat lustful FIRST resort of dealing with the Israeli/Palestinian issue. While the film doesn't shy away from the heroism that is fostered among suicide bombers in Palestinian culture, it makes a compelling case that this method of suicide bombing is but a desperate last resort. "If one cannot be equal in life, then at least one can be equal in death..."; this is buts one rationale offered. (This is not a justification of suicide bombings, but rather an attempt at understanding. Big difference...)

  * Along the same line, the film does a powerful job of showing the everyday reality that leads many young men (and a few women) to choose suicide bombing as a means to not only further the resistance, but also as a means of escaping the hell that is life in present day Palestine. It's difficult to watch a human being resort to such desperate measures.

  * The film also is careful to note that not all Palestinians are extremists. Many are conflicted, oppressed, yet hopeful proponents of peace and justice. Thus, the Palestinian people are vastly more complex than the media (and the church in the West) gives them credit for.

  * The entire issue is incredibly more complex than we realize. There are deep, deep cultural/ethnic/religious issues at play, issues that mere diplomacy won't fix. Western political pragmatism and strong arming won't cut it. Carrots and sticks by the U.N. won't do it either. Until the world immerses itself in the middle eastern culture (honor/shame, prominence of land, community over the individual, etc.) and 'contextualizes' a plan for peace, our attempts to 'help' will only breed more suffering.

  * Finally, a parting shot: maybe if we owned up to the reality that both the Palestinians and Israelis have made some crucial mistakes, and both have legitimate gripes, we could then provide a platform to make some progress. But this involves leveling the playing field, which is a far cry from present-day reality, as evidenced by our own nation's blank checks and blind eyes to Israel's campaigns against the Palestinians. Again, this doesn't at all make suicide bombings a good or right thing, but understanding leads to healing...
