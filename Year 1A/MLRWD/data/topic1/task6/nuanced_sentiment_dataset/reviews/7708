I won't make this a long review, there are plenty of those on these pages already!

Instead I'll tell you the good and the bad.

The good:  Obviously this film had a nice budget, and they spent that on some acting talent.  It always helps when performances are strong.  Secondly it wasn't shot on DV, so at least it's "filmic".

The bad:  Some have commented that this is a new twist on the vampire tale - but honestly, it's not.  All they did was reverse the roles - humans for vampires.  Clever?  Hardly.  Then they grafted on a really poor (and telegraphed) evil capitalist slant: the standard evil corporation that is greedy, and nothing else - and wants what is best for the bottom line, not the people.  Seriously, if you haven't figured this out before 145 minutes of the film has run, you probably haven't seen many films.

So, it's a new angle, but the emperor has no clothes.  It's really the same old thing (see 20 Days Later etc.) except more actors are wearing fangs.

Some good moments though.  If they had concentrated on the battle between those starving and those not it might have been better.  But the tired corporation thing just let the air out of it.

Overall, a 3 out of 5 because of some good set pieces, a nice budget, and some decent actors.
