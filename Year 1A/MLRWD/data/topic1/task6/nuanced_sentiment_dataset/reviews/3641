This new special collectors edition includes a new, alternate ending. This new ending was once the original ending. Adhar Ru'afo escapes in a craft that fell into the rings that surrounded the planet, where he gets younger and younger. The real attraction of this DVD, will be the specials, where you see the making, and behind the scenes with the cast and crew. In Frakes directing work, he is renowned, and warmly called "two takes frakes". As he is so efficient with capturing what is needed. Commentary is always fun to listen to, Especially important for all those aspiring directors out there. As for the movie itself, My most endearing memory of it must be the Data scene (didn't brent and Patrick just steal all the big scenes for all the movies? Great actors.) where he is malfunctioning, Picard gets him to recite Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pinafore". In the story "Runaround", an Isaac Asimov story, a malfunctioning robot recites the same while evading capture by his human masters. The inspiration for Data's character is taken from Asimov's writings. (Data's positronic net, adapted from Isaac's Positronic brains.)
