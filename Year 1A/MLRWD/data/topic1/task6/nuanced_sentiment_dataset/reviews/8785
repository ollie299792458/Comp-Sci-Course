I came into Ninja Assassin with very low expectations.  That probably helped me have an overall positive impression of the movie.  Let me tell you what you can probably already guess:  the plot isn't anything deep or particularly compelling, the characters are stock, and the acting is just passable.  That said, it's a pretty fun action movie.

The fight scenes are well choreographed and employ an excellent blood effect.  Every swipe, severing slice, or star seems to unleash a half-gallon of blood from the target and it looks great.  The main character looks the part and the director does a great job composing the action sequences.

If you go in expecting Crouching Tiger then you will be disappointed.  If you go in expecting Blade then you will have a good time.  Just remember that whenever the characters start talking, that's a great time to get up for a drink or bathroom break.  They'll give you just enough time to get back before something interesting starts happening again.
