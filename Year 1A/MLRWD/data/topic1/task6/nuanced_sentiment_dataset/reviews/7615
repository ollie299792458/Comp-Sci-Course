Let me preface this review by saying that I have been a huge fan of "Nip/Tuck" since its inception. I have even converted a few of my friend into true fans as well. The craziness of this series pushes the envelope just enough but never goes completely over the edge, & I am always entertained. However, Season 4 is not as good as the "Nip/Tuck" that I have come to expect. Following up the Carver of the previous seasons (even though that big revelation ended up a bust) must have been a difficult job. The major story arc this time around involves Christian's new girlfriend Michelle & her madame, James. The entire storyline is pretty boring. The answers are given away pretty early on in the season, & we are left to wait until Christian finds out.

Some minor storylines that were good involved Sean's new son having a birth defect. We also learn more about Sean's past, & his relationship with Julia continues its bumpy ride. I won't spoil that ending here. There is another minor storyline that includes Matt & Kimber, which is interesting at first but seems to fizzle out. Liz also gets a little more development this season, which I was happy to see. To me, she is an irreplaceable character & one who makes the series.

For fans of the show, this season could be a letdown after the superb first 3 seasons, but "Nip/Tuck is still easily one of the best show out there.
