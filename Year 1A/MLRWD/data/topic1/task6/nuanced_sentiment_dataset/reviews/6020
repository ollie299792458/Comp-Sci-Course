FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I DO LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT THE THEME OF THE MOVIE IS "BETTER RED & DEAD THAN FIGHT"  DESPITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS THAT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF DOCTORS AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS AND SOME COLLEGE STUDENTS THE CHARACTERS WERE INCREDIBLY UNAWARE OF RADIATION & FALLOUT EFFECTS.  FROM THE ADS AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL BROADCAST THE VIEWER WAS SUPPOSED TO WRITE THEIR CONGRESSMAN TO DEMAND DISBANDING OUR ARMED FORCES
ONE STRANGE THING ABOUT A PROGRAM DESIGNED BY FAR LEFT LIBERALS; THE PROTRAYAL OF BLACKS.  THERE ARE ONLY 3 BLACKS IN THE MOVIE.  A USAF MISSILE MECHANIC AND HIS WIFE WHO NEVER FIGURE OUT THAT THE MILITARY'S JOB IS TO FIGHT WAR AND IS NOT JUST A GOVERNMENT WELFARE/SCHOLARSIP PROGRAM.  WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS TRYING TO SAVE LIVES THE BLACK USAF MECHANIC INCITES THE REST OF THE USAF TO MUTINY AND FAILLING THAT HE DESERTS HIS POST.  THE THIRD BLACK IS A HOSPITAL ORDERLY PROTRAYED LIKE AN UNEDUCATED 1930's MISSISSIPPI SHARECROPPER ON "AMOS & ANDY" EXCEPT HE WAS FAR TOO STUPID TO BE AN "A&A" CHARACTER.  PERHAPS HE WAS TUTORRED BY JETHRO BODINE, EXCEPT HE LACKED THE INTELLECT TO LEARN UP TO JETHRO;S LEVEL.  IN THE 1980'S A BLACK CHARACTER THIS DUMB WOULD BE TOO POLITICALLY INCORRECT FOR A MISSISSIPPI REDNECK  BACKWOODS BAR..
