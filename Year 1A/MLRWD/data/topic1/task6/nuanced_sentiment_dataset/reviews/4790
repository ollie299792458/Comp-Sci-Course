"The world is his who can see through its pretension...see it to be a lie and you have already dealt it its mortal blow." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

So begins the documentary film "I Am" by Tom Shadyac, big time Hollywood director who had an epiphany after an accident nearly cost him his life. This film will transform your understanding of who you are and inspire you about humanity and what is possible for our global destiny.

Learn what Darwin actually said about survival -- that sympathy is the strongest instinct in human nature and that our ability to cooperate and take care of others is how our species evolved. This film DEFINES the new outlook that will prevail in 2012, and provides access to a breakthrough for humanity.

As the Gandhi quote says, "Be the change you want to see in the world." Filmmaker Shadyac says, "I AM isn't as much about what you can do, as who you can be.  And from that transformation of being, action will naturally follow."

Don't miss it -- you'll want to share this with everyone!
