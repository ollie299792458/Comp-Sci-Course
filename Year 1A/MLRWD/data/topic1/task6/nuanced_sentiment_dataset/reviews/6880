Heathers is a fantastic movie full of wit, wryness, and sarcasm, and yes, twisted humor.  The snobby clique (all girls named "Heather", with the exception of not-so-snobby Veronica, played by Winona Ryder) present an exaggerated look at an alpha-female high school group.  If you've been a high school girl at any point in time, they're not as over-the-top as it seems.  You have Christian Slater playing the bad-ass J.D. in this movie, complete with motorcycle.  J.D. convinces Veronica to play pranks on the snobby kids, yet one by one, the pranks end in those kids' deaths and J.D. using Veronica's abilities to forge her friends' handwriting to cover the deaths up as suicides, complete with manufactured suicide notes.

***SPOLIERS AHEAD***

The movie premise is unrealistic on so many levels.  Honestly, would the first Heather really drink Drano out of a cup on a dare?  I mean, after the first sip, surely she'd spit it out rather than down the whole thing?  After that death, would Veronica really go along with J.D.'s plan to set-up the football jocks in the woods?  Her character is a smart girl, and yet she's made to look "dumb and in love" as she follows J.D.'s schemes without questioning his motives or intentions?  And what's up with J.D.'s dad in this movie?  What a weird character to randomly throw in as an attempt to explain why J.D. is so messed up.

But all in all, it's a great film, I love the sarcastic one-liners, the dry humor, the fact that Winona Ryder and Christian Slater look fantastic in this movie...  I love that they play strip croquet, and all the 80's fashion is even more fun to watch now that that decade has passed (Swatch watches! Jackets with padded shoulders! Odd color combos!)

Definitely a good movie to add to your collection, but only if you don't take yourself too seriously and have a good appreciation for dark humor.
