What a totally depressing representation of marriage. I have never read the book and did not know what to expect, but the movie sounded interesting, as I find period pieces enjoyable. The first couple of hours were not terrible and actually drew me in, but then the main characters got married and everything went downhill quick! Marriage, as protrayed in this movie, is a horrible, dreadful thing where the men never stop their side affairs and the wives are forced to find lovers. One man tells his wife, on their wedding day, mind you, he only married her for her money. The other is a homosexual, who we discreetly find out about when the horse groomer gives him a flirty wink, and then we find out in whole, when they are discovered wrapped in each others arms, sleeping in bed (with smiles on their faces). Nan is the unfortunate married to this fellow. But what is quite hard to understand is why Julius (her husband) pursued her so ardently in the first place if his feelings are for men. Second, is why Nan had such fun with Julius before she married him, and then when he wants to sleep with her, she shrieks and crys. What happened to change her feelings? No explanation. She goes completely cold on him after that and seeks out the man she would have married if he hadn't left for a job in a faraway country, but now has returned. The few characters in this movie who seem to think marriage is for life, and that if both husband and wife would put aside selfishness and try to please the other - a good marriage is possible, are made to look loony. Basically this is a movie that shouts if you're not happy, find a way to make it happen. The whole second half of the film was like a bad soap opera and for this reason, I'd say skip this movie if you put any value in marriage.
