Don't get me wrong, I like some art house and indie films. But I also know that, just like their mainstream Hollywood counterparts, they have they same capacity to be boring, overrated pieces of garbage. I think Mike White is a pretty witty guy and a great comedic actor. But his potrayal of Buck made me sick to my stomach. 
I couldn't feel sorry for Buck. He is annoying, desperate, pathetic and idiotic. People like Buck should not be tolerated and sympathized with, they are stalkers who should get help fast. He manages to harrass Buck until they have a homosexual encounter together....whoop de doo. 
Speaking from experience, I knew a "Buck" myself in high school. Only instead of a childhood friend this guy was a mildly "touched" student who I briefly tutored and who proceeded to follow me around for the duration of my high school years, desperate to ignite some non-existent friendship between us. It wasn't until my freshman year of college that I  finally told him to get lost. Chuck should have done the same to this child-like pansy.
Waste of time, film and money.
