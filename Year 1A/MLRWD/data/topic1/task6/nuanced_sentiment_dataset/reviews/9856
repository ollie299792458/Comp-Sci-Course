Movie Summary:  Elliot is the office doormat. He's the dude that all the men avoid and the guy all the women ignore. One day as the female coworker of his dreams passes by, Elliot mutters those fateful words "I'd give my soul..." and up pops a gorgeous version of the devil with a contract for seven wishes. She talks Elliot into signing and that's when all the fun begins.
My Opinion: I didn't know quite what to expect going into Bedazzled. I was pleasantly surprised once the seven wishes started. Each one puts Brendan in a completely different and twisted situation. He shines in each one. Hurley is devilishly hot as a not so evil devil. She lights up every scene she is in. Gabriel Casseus make a guest appearance and is excellent. The story was well done. Each of the wishes had a point and they were entertaining and fun. The tone of the movie is lighthearted. Elliot is taught a lesson and we get to learn along with him. The removed Rock Star scene, which is included on the DVD, shows a much darker turn that the movie could have taken. I was glad it was removed.  In the end I was entertained and enjoyed the movie. I liked the message that we all make our own choices. You are free to make yours, but I'd recommend you check out Bedazzled.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Commentaries, Making of featurette, Deleted Rock Star Scene and others Menus: Cool Good Menus let you make your own wishes
What You Should Do:  Check this movie out. Brendan Fraser is very funny and Elizabeth Hurley very hot. It's a lighthearted comedy with a heart well worth watching. You just might want to add it to your collection when you're done.
