An animated serialization for Britain's Channel 4 of one of Terry Pratchett's numerous wonderfully witty "Disc World" novels. Those who've seen later telemovies with live actors and digital graphics might find this one hard to watch. It's animated, and it's broken into episodes, with titles and credits every time, unlike the later works which are not broken up.

Nonetheless it does the book justice. Everyone's favourite character, Death, is voiced by the legendary Christopher Lee. If anyone can talk in upper case, he can. But he's not happy, having just overseen the demise of his adopted family, and he takes time off to forget. Hard stuff for someone who even remembers things that are yet to happen, but while he's off, his grand-daughter is stuck with "The Duty".

Keep your wits about you or you'll miss a rock music allusion - for example, the band's troll roadie is named "Asphalt" - what else? It's a matter of playing spot the artist, from the fifties through the eras of the Beatles and psychedelia. And Death is just made for a Meat Loaf album cover...

If you came into Discworld via the later live movies, you might feel a little let down, but Pratchett lovers will possibly find it's worth bearing with the style of a short-episode serial to see if their picture of the novel matches what's on screen. You can decide how much you want to risk and get either a new edition or a used one. They're not that expensive, after all.
