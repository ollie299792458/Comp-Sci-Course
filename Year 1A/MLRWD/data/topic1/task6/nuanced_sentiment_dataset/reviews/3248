The fast and the Furious 1, opened an all new gender in Sport Cars movies, hitting right where it's supposed to..

The fourth "official" sequel (It's really the 2.5 Fast And Furious Film, with in the time frame) is really exhilarating and regardless of the "SUPER FANTASTIC ACTION" performed as Dom and Letty escape from a rolling, flaming gas tank heading towards them and the video game sequence inside the maze of tunnels between the border of US and Mexico.

The movie really got back to the roots and stuck to the formula that gave them the success on the first movie.

Being Latin I deeply respect the different scenes from Latin America that are showed in this movie and they truly give the Latin tunning the place of respect they deserve for spooling the super tunning to another level with the different types of modifications made to the cars.

The trama of the 4th version of the saga is really intense and gives you the tunning world perspective and the real logical and well thought concept that makes the movie very interesting to car fans and movie fans and non fans as well.

My personal rating for the 4thlogy is:

FAST AND FURIOUS  ***** (Original and innovative)
2FAST 2FURIOUS  **  ( Play the video Game instead)
TOKYO DRIFT  ****  ( The actors swap, didn't help)
FAST AND FURIOUS (4) ***** ( New Model..Old Parts..) Really Version 2.5

Hope the review helped you make up your mind. (I always read reviews before buying at Amazon)
