Sahara is an action movie that knows it is an action movie, and not in the good postmodern way. At one point, the hero's sidekick offers 'you get the bomb, I'll get the girl'. If i were the writer, I'd argue that the sidekick had seen too many dopey action movies. As the critic, I'd argue that the writer hasn't seen enough good ones.

The film stars Matthew Mchoguney as an all-purpose action character, Dirk Pitt. Unlike James Bond or Indiana Jones, who save the world for a reason, Pitt seemingly only does it because as an action hero, that is his job. Often times he points at things and helpfully explains how they fit into the ludicrous plot, just in case we care. The film's action sequences range from boring to mildly entertaining, nothing that seems to justify the film's $130,000,000 budget.

A range of not quite A-list actors chime in supporting performances, including the completely wasted William H. Macy as Dirk's boss and the atrociously miscast Penelope Cruz as a concerned WHO doctor. Sure, Penelope serves as eye candy, but when you only devote a solid sex seconds of the film to her traipsing around in a bikini, was it really worth having to listen to her phonetically pronounce her lines? For that matter, was just about anything in the film worth our time and $130,000,000 of Disney's money?

Sahara was based on a novel by Clive Cussler, who rejected numerous drafts of the screenplay, most notably the one that got put to use. Who can blame him? Either the film takes one of his stories and makes it grossly unbelievable and stupid, or it shows how grossly unbelievable and stupid his original work was.
