I have a hard time with Westerns, I really do. This one was mercifully short. I guess I wasn't in the mood for what it offered: I didn't like the THESE CHARACTERS ARE SYMPATHETIC and THESE CHARACTERS ARE UNSYMPATHETIC heavy-handedness, or how predictable the ending was, or how awkward it was to see Dana Andrews emoting, or how the movie decided to teach me a lesson. Maybe it's just not a lesson we need bludgeoned into our eyeballs in 2010, or am I being optimistic? Well, I didn't feel like being taught a lesson, at any rate. I felt like tangling my fingers in Dana's hair (or Anthony's eyelashes. Mmmm).
The good: Dana & Dana's hair, Anthony & Anthony's eyelashes... Also, Henry Fonda was better by the end than he promised at first. He started out being not very intriguing and ended being a hardass. I especially liked the quiet scenes between him and Harry Morgan, which came close to balancing out the bleak and overbearing scenes of, you know, lynching. There were a lot of surprisingly artsy shots and those were kind of fun to see.

I really enjoyed certain scenes here and there, but overall I think it did itself a disservice by being so social commentary-y (although at the time it must have been more progressive than it looks today) (I understand that it was based on a book but I don't feel like looking that up). Hmm. It just was not the type of movie I usually like to see, so I had to put up with some stuff to get through it. So take that into consideration if you would.
Favorite scene by far was Henry Fonda drinking on horseback and making those weird faces -- so good!
