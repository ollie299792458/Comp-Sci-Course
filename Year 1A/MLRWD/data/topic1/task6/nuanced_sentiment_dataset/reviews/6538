Being such a huge fan of John Landis's entertaining horror/comedy AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, I rented THE HOWLING (released around the same time as AAWIL) hoping that it would be just as good, maybe even better than what I was anticipating.  Unfortunately, I was once again suckered into believing the reviews of this movie, calling it "The Best Horror Movie."  THE HOWLING is far from it, an exercise of how bad you can screw up a seemingly good premise with poor pacing and a disjointed plot.
Dee Wallace stars as Karen White, a TV news reporter who at the beginning of the film is being used as bait to capture demented serial rapist Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo).  Karen meets up with Eddie, never seeing his face, but her brief encounter with him makes her traumatized.  Since her trauma is putting a strain on her life and marriage, therapist Patrick MacNee sends her to "The Colony," a backwoods group therapy center which contains a host of patients including the sexy Marsha and a suicidal old man.  Needless to say, Karen, along with her two friends, discover something fishy going on and soon the blood and fur start to fly.
Although Eddie Quist's transformation into a werewolf towards the end of the film is truly amazing, and the funny moments involving a mortician and a librarian are short but sweet, there's not much else to say about THE HOWLING.  It's no small wonder why Dee Wallace has been starring in low-budget B-pictures ever since; she's a terrible actress.  Throughout all 90 minutes of this movie, I never believed once that Karen was in any kind of danger or threat.  Joe Dante is a good director, however, but his use of shocks and scares are predictable.  Plus, the scenes where Karen's husband Bill (played by Christopher Stone, Dee's real-life beau) gets bitten by Marsha, has sex with her the next night, and automatically turns into a wolf is utterly ridiculous.
THE HOWLING is, in short, a disappointment.
