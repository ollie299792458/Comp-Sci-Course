Just a great movie! San Francisco has always been my favorite city in the U.S. All the different venues in this city make "Bullitt" a classic in every sense of the word. The Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, the Mark Hopkins Hotel, Pacific Heights, the hills, cable cars, the Embarcadero, albeit a much older pre-1989 version, are all here. Steve McQueen turns in a terrific performance, but the cast of characters also meshes well with his character. Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn),Captain Bennett (Simon Oakland), Sgt. Delgetti (Don Gordon), Captain Baker (Norman Fell), Weisberg the Cabbie (Robert Duvall), as well as girlfriend Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) all turn in very fine performances. This cast of characters has to be one of the best ever. They all fit together seamlessly. Whoever came up with the chemistry in this movie is a genius. The chase scene is the one that defines all others. I defy anyone to come up with a better one. If you look closely at the start of the chase, when the sequence takes you down the hill with brief glimpses of Alcatraz in the distance, look for the silhouetted faces of the stunt driver and his passenger. These two guys are definitely enjoying their work. No one is on a par with McQueen's driving. His is in another galaxy. If I was a cop, I would want Captain Bennett as my boss. He is a tough straight-shooter extraordinaire! The dialogue in this movie is memorable, especially between McQueen and Vaughn. Lalo Schifrin's music keeps this flick moving.I just hope no one gets the bright idea to make this movie again, as there are no suitable replacements for any of these actors. A once and done enduring classic, to be left that way. In other words, a can't miss movie!
