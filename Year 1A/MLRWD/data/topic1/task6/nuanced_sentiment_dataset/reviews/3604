When this movie first came out in 1993, I remember so many other saying it was the coolest stoner coming of age flick since Fast Times.  Well, I didn't see it like that.  I was actually kind of turned off by it.  I mean, the main thing that stood out to me what the characters.  For the most part, all sucked, from the acting down to the lines they spit out.  So bad.  Most of these kids couldn't act there way out of a paper bag.  Seriously, it was like a high school project filmed.  Three were a couple that did OK, like the football quarterback Jason London and the brief appearance from Matthew McConaughey, but that's about it.  The main kids Wiley Wiggens, Rory Cochrane and Adam Goldberg were almost unwatchable.  Painful to see act on the screen.  I understand this was basically an independent film, but come on.  I get it, it was a small town with nothing to do, but really?

The plot, or lack of.  Not unlike an episode of Seinfeld, this story never really goes anywhere.  No witty lines, jokes, characters or story to make it great like Jerry's show.  First it seems to be about a jock, then about a freshman boy, then a girl, but nothing really happens to make sense beyond stupid antics and week growth.  Just bad acting and lame actions.

The sound track was a good selling point, but basically if you have a radio that can pick up a classic rock station, you're not hearing anything you don't hear everyday.

I really wanted to like this movie.  It was part of my youth, but just couldn't get into it.  I didn't hate it, but wouldn't buy it.  Maybe if it was on TV, I would recommend watching it.

If you want to see what life was really like back in the late 70's / early 80's, I HIGHLY recommend Over The Edge and Fast Times At Ridgemont High.  The closest true to what I remember teen life stories that made sense, told a good story and had great music.
