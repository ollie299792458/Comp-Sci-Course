I really give this DVD 4 and 1/2 stars.  We all need to remember that just about any type of footage of the Who live while Moon was still around is almost priceless to any Who fan.  Yes, the songs here appear out of order, some songs are even incomplete, and the cameras don't always capture all the shots you would want, but this is the original Who live.  Not just live, but live when they were at their peak before recording their best album Who's Next.  They played an incredible show at the Isle of Wight, and while this DVD may not have the complete concert, at least it has most of it and at least the sound is great.  Well, Entwistle's bass could have been mixed louder but Keith and Pete are on fire and so is Roger.  "Heaven and Hell," "My Generation," "Water," "Young Man Blues," "Summertime Blues," "I Can't Explain," "Christmas," "I'm Free," "See Me Feel Me," "I Don't Know Myself," "Pinball Wizard," "The Acid Queen," and "Fiddle About" are all phenomenal performances.  Sometimes you need to forget about some of the poor camera angles and just get lost in the music.  The camera angles aren't terrible anyway because every member gets a good amount of camera time.  Well, maybe not Entwistle but he is still shown.  The CD version includes all the complete performances and is a good companion to the DVD.  I have a feeling that this DVD will eventually include all the songs that the Who performed that night.  It's the same thing with regular movie DVDs since they first only feature no special features and then they decide to feature them two years later and then more the following year.  A new version of this DVD just came out with "Substitute" and "Naked Eye" and bonus tracks.  There will probably be more added footage soon.  For now though, this is an excellent DVD for any Who fan, and so far it is the only film CONCERT featuring John, Pete, Keith, and Roger.  Also, the interview with Pete is excellent.
