Not sure why this has got such a high rating as it is a complete waste of time. While 'Saw' had a unique story, this remains in the brain for all of 5 minutes after it is turned off and revels in sadism and ridiculous logic for what seems like an ice age. Firstly Jigsaw should not have been revealed and an attempt to make him more 'human' with a flashback to his former life is just ridiculous. Plus why does he torture people as punishment for leading amoral lives? isn't his just as amoral?

The other characters in the film are witless, particularly the man assigned to 'play a game' which is based on showing mercy (or not) to the various people involved in the car crash which killed his daughter, this moron takes far far too long to make what should be split second decisions - watch the scene with the guy in the twister device and you'll see what I mean. We also get the background of Jigsaws accomplice, add to that a convoluted plot 'twist' and you have 90 or so minutes from your life you will never get back. Now *thats* torture.
