Gangster No1 offers nothing new in either ganster cinema or British cinema. What it does offer is an incredible performance from Paul Bettany, a skillful recycling of classic gangster pictures like 'Scarface' and 'Pulp Fiction', a few invigorating scenes of sardonic violence, very much in the tradition of 'Lock Stock...' and even 'Trainspotting', and a confident directorial grip, one that allowed Malcolm MacDowell once again attempt to return to his 'clockwork' form. Too bad the film doesn't belong to MacDowell, who appears as the aged protagonist briefly in the beginning and end of the film. Maybe it is for the better though, because at the end is when the film crumbles heavily under MacDowell's heavy rantings, while Paul Bettany, who plays the young gangster, is truly astonishing as a man hired by a mob boss and striving to gain his power. Sounds familiar? No doubt - that's good ol' 'Scarface', almost scene by scene, yet though Bettany pays homage with his lack of likeable qualities and ceaseless, demented determination to similar qualities that Pacino's Montana possessed, the young actor manages to twist it a little, distance it from the ferociousness of 'Scarface' by adding an element of poignancy to it. Consider the scene where he tortures someone, having turned up contrastively happy music. 'Reservoir Dogs', anyone? Yeah, but here we get the POV of the MAN being tortured - we're hooked.
 While offering nothing new and trodding off into dull, repetitive and predictable territory at its 80-minute mark, 'Gangster No1' mostly manages to avoid cliches while still being cliched, and is definitely worth watching for Bettany's powerhouse acting.
 The film is enthusiastic. The crew's love for the project is palpable. The director must have nurtured it for a while before he could watch his creation on the silver screen.
