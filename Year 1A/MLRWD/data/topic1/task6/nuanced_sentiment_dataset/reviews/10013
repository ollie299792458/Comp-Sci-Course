As with most Disney sequels, the story is disconnected and carefree, the characters aren't as appealing as they were in the original movie, and the animation is degraded to a somewhat lesser degree. This leaves the film in pieces, making it a jigsaw puzzle for the viewer to put together. As is the case for "Mulan 2".

After saving China, Mulan is overjoyed when Shang asks for her hand in marriage. But before they marry, however, they must escort three princesses to another city/villiage in China....where they (the princesses) will be married to three princes chosen for them (aka...an arranged marriage). The only problem with this whole "Mulan and Shang getting hitched" thing is that, if they do get married, Mushu will lose his new job. I'm sure you can figure out what the rest of the story is about.

The animation is good, but you can tell that it's lost some of it's original "flare" from the first film ("Mulan").

The (voice) cast is so-so. Although I have to admit, Mark Moseley does a fantastic Mushu, in place of Eddie Murphy.

In a nutshell, this movie will probably entertain younger kids, but will leave adults sitting in the back of the theater. It's got enough humor in it to make your little ones laugh, but corny enough to make it all seem quite..."unreal".

There's also a couple of "in-jokes" that they "stole". As usual, Disney has to put at least one "Finding Nemo" phrase into their trashy sequels, and it seems like they're also "stealing" from the "big cash" movies, too: a pin-point observer will be able to point out the "Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers" joke they put in.

I only watched this movie because my dad worked on it. Thankfully, he got credit for it, and I'm proud of my daddy.
