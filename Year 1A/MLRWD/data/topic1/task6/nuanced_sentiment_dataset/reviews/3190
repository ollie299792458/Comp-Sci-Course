GENERAL: I rented this movie with mixed hopes- on one hand, the critics had trashed it, while on another most customer reviews were positive. I'm now very glad that I veiwed The Time Machine and would recommend it to anyone.
ACTING: Suprisingly good. Guy Pearce gives a convinvcing performance Alexander Hardtgen, a professor who builds a time machine in order to go back and save a loved one who died. Samantha Mumba, the semi-famous popstar, actually was decent at Mara, and girl living in the future and trying to take care of her younger brother.
PLOT: Very gripping, yet short and sweet, this movie speeds up after the first few minutes and really sports some interesting concepts. Original and something you'll have to see twice.
SPECIAL EFFECTS: The SFX, by Digital Domain, are wonderful and create some of the most amazing effects seqences ever when Alex travels millions of years into the future while in his time machine. Beautiful and realistic.
SCORE(MUSIC): Beautifully done and original. The music, infused with breathtaking tribal chants at times, is of a high standard and memorable.
SPECIAL FEATURES: Very good for a single disc DVD, there are some interesting "making of" featurettes along with a wonderful segment about how Digital Domain created several effects sequences. Overall very good.
MY GRADE: A-
