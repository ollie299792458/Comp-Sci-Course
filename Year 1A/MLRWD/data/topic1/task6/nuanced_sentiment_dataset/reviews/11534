I love Rawhide. Having not been alive until more than a decade after it stopped airing, it's been great to be able to watch it on DVD. I'm not crazy about releasing of the second season in two volumes, but that didn't stop me from buying it. However, having already purchased the first season, it makes me very angry to find that Paramount has included a rerun from the first season in this collection. I have already paid for this content.

Other reviewers list the episodes in this collection as follows:

24- Incident of the Day of the Dead 9/18/1959
25- Incident at Dangerfield Dip 10/2/1959
26- Incident of the Shambling Man 10/9/1959
27- Incident at Jacob's Well 10/16/1959
28- Incident of the Thirteenth Man 10/23/1959
29- Incident at the Buffalo Smokehouse 10/30/1959
30- Incident of the Haunted Hills 11/6/1959
31- Incident of the Stalking Death 11/13/1959
32- Incident of the Valley in Shadow 11/20/1959
33- Incident of the Blue Fire 12/11/1959
34- Incident at Spanish Rock 12/18/1959
35- Incident of the Druid's Curse 1/8/1960
36- Incident at Red River Station 1/15/1960
37- Incident of the Devil and His Due 1/22/1960
38- Incident of the Wanted Painter 1/29/1960
39- Incident at Tinker's Dam 2/5/1960

This list is not correct. The collection provided includes a rerun of "Incident of the Roman Candles," the last episode of Season One. The DVD even lists the episode as having originally aired on 9/25/1959. The real episode list is as follows:

24- Incident of the Day of the Dead 9/18/1959
xx- Incident of the Roman Candles 7/10/1959 and 9/25/1959
25- Incident at Dangerfield Dip 10/2/1959
26- Incident of the Shambling Man 10/9/1959
27- Incident at Jacob's Well 10/16/1959
28- Incident of the Thirteenth Man 10/23/1959
29- Incident at the Buffalo Smokehouse 10/30/1959
30- Incident of the Haunted Hills 11/6/1959
31- Incident of the Stalking Death 11/13/1959
32- Incident of the Valley in Shadow 11/20/1959
33- Incident of the Blue Fire 12/11/1959
34- Incident at Spanish Rock 12/18/1959
35- Incident of the Druid's Curse 1/8/1960
36- Incident at Red River Station 1/15/1960
37- Incident of the Devil and His Due 1/22/1960
38- Incident of the Wanted Painter 1/29/1960

Essentially, if you bought the first season already, you'll be buying only 15 new episodes with this collection, not 16. That's really disappointing and low brow, in my humble opinion. I expect more from the people who produce these things.
