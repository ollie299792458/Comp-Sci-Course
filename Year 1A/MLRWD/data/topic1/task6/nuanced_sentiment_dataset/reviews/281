I really love this DVD and that's why it is so sad to find out that this edition is defective. I purchased it 3 times now. Two times at Barnes& Noble and another one just now from amazon. All three skip!

I had another edition (don't remember what year), but it is without the GAIAM logo and advertisements and that one worked perfectly fine. I gave it to my mom and now I have a feeling I'm going to request it back since I cannot find another copy of this DVD that doesn't skip.

If you are interested in details on where it skips, I'll tell you:
1) During the first pose of the cross leg position while doing twists to the sides. You do one side, then it skips and you start from the beginning.

2) During the downward facing (wide leg) dog pose. It skips to a totally different pose (previously done). It is really annoying.

There are a few others, which I don't recall at the moment.

You can still do the routine if this doesn't bother you. It does bother me because I know how it is without skipping. It is awesome!

I don't know whose fault this is, but I wouldn't advise to purchase this DVD. If you can find the one without GAIAM logo, get that one.

Thanks.
