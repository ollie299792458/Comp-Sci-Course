Let me be concise and simple:

1.) Evolution is a SPECULATION! It canNOT be repeated in the lab. Evolution exists only in the "text"books. Nowhere else. Well it also exist on the drawings of some theologically inclined dogmatic naturalists, whose theology is atheism. Nevertheless, evolution is FAR from being a fact!!!

2.) All the videos in this series are spinning around the idea of "Irreducible Complexity". This is an idea(far more attractive than the evolution), that many organism are irreducibly complex.
Irreducibly complex is a type of complexity that cannot be reduced any further. For example, for  me to use computer to type this message, I at least needs the following: processor, motherboard, input (keyboard), and internet connection. If any of the following is absent I cannot write here on Amazon.com.
So, for some (if not all, but let's speculate for second) organisms to operate many components are needed at the (a) SAME time and (b) FULLY operational.
a) if they are operational but not present at the same time, organism will not be functional. I twill simply die. "Dead organisms (as being said in the video) cannot evolve!"
b) if they are all present but not functional, organism will also die. and again, "dead organisms cannot evolve".
In addition to being (a) present at the same time and (b) be fully operational, the specific components of the particular organism are unique. Unique parts of the organism are specifically built for the specific purpose.

There are plenty of various examples of the INTELLIGENCE imprinted in organisms that cannot and should not be there if evolution is true.
For example: giraffes, woodpeckers, are irreducibly complex.
Birds who migrate have a knowledge when and why to migrate, etc.
There are plenty of examples for those who willing to take of wishful pink glasses of dogmatic naturalism, set them aside and be honest.

Great videos.
