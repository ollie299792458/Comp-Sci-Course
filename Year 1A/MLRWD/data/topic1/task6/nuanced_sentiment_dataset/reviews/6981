I was greaty looking forward to re-visiting the Babylon 5 universe. There are many tales only hinted at during the main show which had a lot of potential. The direct-to-DVD method I think has promise. I like the idea of funding future 'episodes' through purchasing DVDs. However, the story quality was poor. The visuals were poor. I wish I could return it and get my money back. I feel cheated. I read much of JMS' pre-show hype and I just don't see it on the screen. Maybe I missed something, maybe I'm being too harsh, but it really wasn't a good use of my money. Now this leaves me in a quandry, if my dollars fund future DVDs would I buy them? I'd like that method, and Babylon 5, to suceed. But I would not buy another in this series, hopefully I could rent it first. It's just sad this is what has happened to the show. I can't think of many positives. It was nice to see Galen and Sheridan in action again, albiet briefly. The CGI and music was nice, but all that adds up to a minute or two of screen time. The 75 minute running time should have created a high paced show, but instead it floundered around like a dead fish in a big white room. It's sad that 'fans' will have to purchase this by their very definition. I wanted to post this review though in case there are some people on the fence, seeing the bad reviews, and I strongly urge you to use the money for something else.
