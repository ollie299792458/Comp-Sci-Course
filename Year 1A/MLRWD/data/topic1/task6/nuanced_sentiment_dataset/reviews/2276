I've seen only one other Fellini film (8 1/2), which I enjoyed, but I wasn't sure I would like Nights of Cabiria. Seeing this movie for the first time turned out to be a delight. The story, quite simply is about Cabiria, a prostitute who lives on the outskirts of Rome and who wants to find a decent man to marry. The pleasure of seeing this movie is about getting to know Cabiria, laughing at her misfortunes, seeing her fumble through bizarre predicaments, feeling her sorrow when she's mistreated, watching her deal with life on its terms. Aside from Giulietta Masina, there are many other reasons to see this movie. The parade of improbable faces, the opulent locations in and around Rome, the wonderful variety of music, and the amazingingly artistic quality of every shot that Fellini directs. This is one of the rare films which should be considered a work of art. Finally, I can't say enough about the Criterion Collection DVD's. Nights of Cabiria has been restored and re-mastered for this DVD and the results (as demonstrated on the disc) are incomparable. If you can, see this edition.
