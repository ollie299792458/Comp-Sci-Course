i found this movie disapointing.  i am a big deniro fan(who isn't)?  this movie though is just boring and predictable.  the cast is great, especially christopher walken, which almost upped it to two stars, but it was  just such a terrible movie.  i could almost see why this movie was conidered a landmark film when it came out, but now it just seems dated.  having already watched great movies such as full metal jacket and platoon, i did not see the deer hunter, but i already knew the outcome.  you knew that this was going to be an anti-vietnam flick, and you knew either deniro or walken or both were going to come back and would "not be the same."  but this movie offers nothing.  the statement it's trying to make is obvious before the movie even starts.  there is no real action no real drama.  and is there really anyone that actually likes the wedding scene.  talk about long.  it went on for about an hour and takes up about a third of the movie.  you can make a point about small town friendship without taking an hour to do it.  the russian roulette scene is considered the truly great part of this movie.  but was this really the best way to depict the horrors of war?  it sad really that it was the only remotely decent part of the movie.  this is supposed to be an anti-vietnam movie, but it does not seem as if there is a whole lot of warfare going on.  the vietnam war was horrible.  we get it already.  you can watch just about anyother vietnam movie to get the same thing.  and the deer hunter is the worst and most overated of all of the vietnam movies.
