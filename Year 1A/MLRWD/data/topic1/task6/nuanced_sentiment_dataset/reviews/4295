Most people's expectations of Sherlock Holmes is "supposed to be" are shaped by what they saw in movies and a few tv episodes, maybe reading a few of the original stories. This classic view is often wrong. This movie brings back Holmes to what he was in the books, and while it may focus a little more on the action, some parts of Holmes' characteristics from the original books are toned down (the original Holmes had a penchant for drug abuse).

In any case, the movie taken by itself is spectacular. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal and Jude Law, whom i'm not usually fond of, is solid as Watson. The overall story is fast-paced but never lets you down, and I disagree with the editorial above that the plot is a mess. The plot is very smart, letting you guess at what's coming without actually telling you but never leaving you behind. For those worried about the action: while it is there, Holmes rarely relies on action as his sole weapon. His mind is the most effective tool in this movie; his fists are just a way of executing his plans.

Also of note is Hans Zimmer's music: providing an eclectic and original score that I believe is his best work (yes, better than the Dark Knight).

All in all, this movie is one of my favorites, and I will be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.
