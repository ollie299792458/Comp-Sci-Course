Since Highlader 2: The Quickening (which should be renamed just the Quickening, removing Highlander from it) Highlander movies have sucked. Endgame was the becon of hope. Maybe now they'll get it right. Not quite yet. Endgame is better than H2 and H3, but its no H1. The best way to look at this movie is as a sequel to the tv show, not the movies. Only the first movie could have happened before this one, and even that is slightly impossible. I suppose that a different imaginary version of H1 happened before Endgame in which key events like being the last immortal and winning the prize didn't happen. As a sequel to the show, this movie works. As a sequel to the movies, well it pretty much is impossible. Adrian Paul was actually pretty good in his first Highlander movie. I did not like what happened to Chris Lambert's Connor MacLeod though. The best way to describe this movie is Star Trek: Generations for the Highlander series. This movie retconed the previous 3 films and paved the way for a new batch of films with Paul's Duncan MacLeod. Since Duncan didn't win the prize, we can be assured that Panzer and Davis won't make anymore mistakes like H2 or H3. H1 and Connor are casualties but maybe now we can forget the past mistakes like H2 and H3 and make new Highlander films that don't suck. I still think that the fist film should be the only one, but no matter how much we want to we can never get rid of H2 and H3.
