In addition to serving as an actor, producer, and writer, in HEAD OF STATE Chris Rock also assumes the role of director for the first time.  In HEAD OF STATE, Rock plays Washington, D.C., alderman Mays Gilliam, who is setup repeatedly as someone who truly wants to make a difference.  For the rest of the film we watch Gilliam's presidential campaign, which basically becomes a platform for stereotypical racial humor and Rock's thinly disguised standup routines.
Tamala Jones plays Gilliam's new love interest, and plays the part well.  Robin Givens is funny as Gilliam's ex-girlfriend, although she really only has one gag that she gets to repeat over and over again during the movie.  Bernie Mac never really gets to shine in his role as Gilliam's brother.  Tracy Morgan is placed in what should be a cameo role but instead is asked to play a bizarre character that appears in the movie altogether too frequently.
The movie is reasonably strong for the first half but slows down as it struggles into the finish line.  It's not a movie with continuous laughs, but if you like Chris Rock's comedy then you will probably enjoy this movie.
