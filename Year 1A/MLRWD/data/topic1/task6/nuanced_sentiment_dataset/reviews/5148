Citizen Kane, in my opinion and in the eyes of just about every legitamite film critic in America is one of, if not, THE greatest movie of all time. After viewing it I was so blown away I had to sit down for awhile and collect my thoughts. At no point in the movie is it boring unless you are one of those ignorant fools who thinks all black and white films are boring. Albeit, there isn't much action in Citizen Kane, but the characters make up for it ten fold with their realism. The ending of Citizen Kane is definatly one of the biggest surprizes in the history of filmmaking and makes watching the movie worthwhile. The plot was so important that forms of it are being used in big name Hollywood movies to this day. The film was extremely naive in its undertaking as it writes a biography of one of the richest and most influential people in American history ever and showed how imperfect the life of a supposedly "perfect" person is. This movie truly plays out like a dream. Don't listen to (people) who tell you elsewise.
