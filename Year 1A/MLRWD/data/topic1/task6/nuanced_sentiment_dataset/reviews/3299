First off, I'm not a deadhead so I'm not going to give you an analysis if why this is a great set, I just know that I enjoyed a vast majority of the songs on there. 
Secondly, the sound is simply spectacular. Nice mix. Not over the top 5.1, but there are some nice effects and I enjoy how it opened up through the back. I only listened to the DTS so can't comment on the 2.0 or the regular 5.1.
Great special features, particularly the winterland documentary. well done. too bad the NRPS track is a compilation video rather than footage from the actual show, but as far as video go it was well done. 
Why the loss of a star? Because they chose to cram this on 2 discs rather than boost the video quality over three. If you check out the bit-rate it is about half what movies are, particularly on the first disc. Picture quality improves somewhat in the third set. I know that they didn't have the greatest elements, that this was shot for low-resolution tv, but the digital noise that you see there, particularly in the darker shots would probably disappear for the most part if you raised the bit-rate. I know the music comes first, second and third, but the discrepency between the beautful soundtrack and the poor video was distracting. But I will say that the editing was very nice. 
All-in-all, this is not only a great document, but a very enjoyable dvd and well worth the price of admission.
