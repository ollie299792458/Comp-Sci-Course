I don't know who thought up the idea of another Die Hard film, this time with the "Mac user" kid, but this really didn't work for me.  The formula of the rookie/new guy has been done and done well, but I've yet to see a successful rookie/irritating computer hacker formula in a film ("Let me got a shoot things, while you conveniently stay here and hack things", etc)  It's been done, and the formula is getting tired.

I was glad to see Bruce Willis back in action again, and I'm equally impressed with with Wolverine-magnitude fast-healing factor that almost completely recovered him from his earlier injuries (it looks like he was near death in the earlier Police station sequence... but subsequently he healed... magically!)

A surprise for me was seeing Kevin Smith in, amazingly, a likeable roll, and even in the unrated version, not once did the customary f-bomb fly out of his mouth (watching his interviews at things like the LA comicon, you'd think he's replaced the word "the" with the f-bomb.)

Anyhow, this film was completely implausable and ridiculous, but it is one of those films that gets you to wondering how long the world would last without electricity, if some terrorist nut (that vaguely resembled an evil Ryan Seacrest) took over the computers of the US.
Then again, who really cares...?
