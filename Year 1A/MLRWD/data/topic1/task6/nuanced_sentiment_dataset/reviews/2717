The first season of this classic show all on DVD, and I finally ordered it.  First and foremost, if your a fan, you won't go wrong with these DVD's, forget all of the "Most Outrageous Episodes" DVD's, they're a rip.

Okay, on to the DVD's, the eps screen quality is sorta dissapointing, I would've thought they'd clean it up a little but they don't look that bad, just as good as anything you'd catch on F/X which is good enough for me.

The Special Features are the real let down, with a bunch of trailers that are barely related to the show(one for the Sweetest Thing with Christina Applegate, the other only related by network for the quickly cancelled A Minute w/Stan Hooper.  The only payback is the reunion special that aired on fox is also on this set, so thats good, but I was craving some commentaries and deleted scenes, or atleast bloopers but oh well.)

Anyway, don't let that ruin the DVD's for you, because the series is still great and worth the 20 bucks if you are just getting into the show.
