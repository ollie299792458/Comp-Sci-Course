Many fans of the game might be inclined to watch this movie, simply because of their love for it but like Star Wars fans who watched the prequels, many watched more out of curiosity of how the story would develop, opposed to great movie making.  The parallel between Star Wars and its prequels would be the same as playing Dead Space and watching this movie...prepare for disappointment.

It seems that the people who were inspired to make this movie saw a good money making opportunity but did so with as little amount of money as possible.  I'm always captivated by new fresh ideas and genuine creativity and so I had much hope for this film.  Even if a movie is poorly done, if it is a novel piece, I'll like it to some degree.  Unfortunately, this movie wasn't as unique as you might think.  Much of the movie parallels <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GMH8TC">Event Horizon [Blu-ray</a>] and to a lesser degree John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CW7ZWG">The Thing  [Blu-ray</a>].

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1NXAY">Event Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> wasn't a great film but compared to Dead Space: Downfall, Event Horizon deserves an Oscar.  A saving grace would have been high quality art work, along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304493681">Ghost in the Shell</a> and incorporating the techniques used in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YOX3HE">Family Guy - Blue Harvest</a> episode.  Sadly though, it ranked up there with many of the Saturday morning cartoons, with the addition of gore.  Its use of cgi didn't help, mainly because of the poor art work; the cgi didn't blend well where it complimented the movie.

When it comes to fear factor...there wasn't any.  Maybe because it's a cartoon.  I have yet to see a cartoon horror movie that is actually scary.  Live action horror movies use lighting and mood, which can't be reproduced in a cartoon.  At least not well.  Despite the use of props, when you see a live action horror movie, you close your eyes because it looks real.  It's the cheap, low budget movies where you can tell it's all props, which you want to either laugh or make fun of it.  Going live action would have made this movie a little scarier.

Anyone concerned with nudity or looking for it, there isn't any other the scene in the showers, where people are being attacked.  In that segment, you're only going to see nude men, one in particular where you see a guy's "equipment."  There are no nude women scenes or sex scenes, which is common with the anime genera.

One pathetic aspect of the movie is that the person putting the story together and/or the director, took ideas from different movies and tries to make it work in this piece.  Many times when a writer or director puts details here and there, it makes a symmetrical arch later in the movie.  With Dead Space, you can see small elements from other horror movies but doesn't make those small elements work because they don't fully use the components to its full extent.

Take for example the end of the movie.  Before it goes to credits, you hear a child's limerick.  The child's limerick doesn't fit any where because you don't have any earlier segments where they utilize aspects of the child's limerick.  You don't see any of the character's childhood where the song is sung, or even anyone communicating with a parent where it makes some sense to include that in this movie.  Furthermore, having the limerick doesn't do anything to enhance fear.

There are portions of the movie where you see what's going on from the monster's point of view.  That worked well for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator [Blu-ray</a>].  The reason it did, you didn't know what was stalking the people.  You had little glimpses here and there but it took a while before you really got a look.  Doing so kept the suspense and mystery up.  Try to have the same effect after you know what's coming after the characters, doesn't work because at that point, you already know.  That's why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VFM0YW">Predator 2 [Blu-ray</a>] wasn't as hot as the first movie.  In Dead Space, you only see things from the monster's point of view, long after you know what's attacking people.

Other aspects of the movie, you really don't connect with any of the characters so you really couldn't wrap yourself around what's going on and hope that the characters make it.  The dialogue was also weak.  It would have been interesting to see more about the historic background of the Dead Space universe.  Granted fans of the game probably have read it already but for a movie, it would have been nice to have included it.  Having scenes of life on Earth would have also been interesting.

In one part of the movie, the second in command has to step up to the plate.  He actually reminds me of one of the characters on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJ6K1K">King of the Hill - Seasons 1 - 6</a>.  The similarity isn't just in the way he's drawn but at points, you hear the same voice as this particular character from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015QT76Q">King of the Hill - Season 7</a>.  I wonder if it's the same actor.

This movie had so much potential of really good story telling but drops the ball.  Unlike many movies that have either gone from books to movies or video games to movies, many of them are bombs but at least they try to make the movie work.  When it comes to Dead Space, I think this movie is an insult to fans.  A company produces a product that generates interest and obviously enough interest to make this film but instead of giving its fans something to talk about, they instead produce a cheap, hopefully money generating bone.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product.  First off, it isn't worthy the price they are selling it for.  If you want to know how this story line goes, you are better off renting it.  When you see this movie, you would understand why you wouldn't want to keep it in the house because all it will do is create dead space.
