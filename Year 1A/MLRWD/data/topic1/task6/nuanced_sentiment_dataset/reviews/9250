This 1985 serial has the Doctor revisiting a planet to find it has fallen under the dictatorial rule of a mutated scientist who uses a device called a timelash to eliminate any opposition.  He must not only free the populace but also avert an interplanetary war in the process.

The two leads are less irritating with each other than they were in the earlier <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GRUQME">The Mark of the Rani</a> but the Doctor is still a bit rude and overbearing for my tastes (though he has a few good moments as well), and Peri is particularly useless in this adventure.  There are several things that don't work too well and there is a lot of padding in the second half (it was running under its allotted time.)  "Timelash" is an infamously poorly regarded story, but to be fair, most of its criticisms could be leveled at any given episode of the original series.  I can't exactly defend it, but I don't think it's significantly worse than a lot of others.  Watch it for Paul Darrow's performance, which is great fun.  (Darrow jokes (?) that you should turn it off after his character dies because it becomes boring.)

The DVD contains a featurette called "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" in which the main cast, writer and script editor talk about the making of the story and why it turned out the way it did.  (Seems they were just as unsatisfied with it as most fans were.)  There is also a commentary track with Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Paul Darrow, but I didn't find it as entertaining as these things usually are.
