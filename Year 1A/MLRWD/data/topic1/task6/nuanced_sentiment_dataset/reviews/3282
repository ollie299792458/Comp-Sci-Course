This was a great story about the power of Jesus Christ transforming someone's life, no doubt!  Unfortunately this is probably one of those case where the book would have been much better than the movie.  My wife and I watched this together and had some trouble following the storyline at times in the movie.  For example in the beginning of the movie, the family up and moves, and neither of us really caught why.  The movie drags along at parts on scenes that don't really advance the storyline.  The beginning especially was slow, many scenes showing Angus' hot-temper, but that was about it.  I get that he's a hot-head in need of a transforming work in his life, aren't we all, let's move along here!

What really caught us off-guard was the tragic death of a little boy.  For one it was very graphic, definitely not a scene for little ones, and maybe some big ones too.  They could have stopped at the shot of the tractor wheel, but they go on to show him writhing and coughing up gobs of blood before his death.  As awful as a scene this was, I didn't really empathize with this scene due to the confusion I had over who this child was.  I think this family were friends of the main family in the movie, but it was never introduced that that, they just sort of showed up in a few scenes before, and now their son has just died, and I really didn't feel for him.  It was like reading a news article on a tragic death, but since you don't really know them, you have trouble feeling real pain, it was the same here.

The subtitles were also somewhat annoying, but I didn't have any problem reading them, and they were more in the beginning than toward the end.  I couldn't see how you would have done the movie in that setting without them.  Would have certainly detracted from the film if the Zulu's spoke English!

Overall, it was a good storyline once it got going, just be prepared for some confusion on the part of the minor characters.
