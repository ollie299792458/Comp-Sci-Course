Severed was a good enough premise, but some of the mpovie doesn't make sense. One of the most glaring is when the zombies grab the guy (forgot his name) who was "like a son" to the leader of the survivors. instead of feasting on his entrails, they decide to carry him off as if to pack him away for the winter. This let me know that the guy was going to somehoe get away from 2 zombies, and come back later and force the leader guy to make the hard choice of having to kill a kid that was like a son to him. My eyes rolled out of my head at that point. There wasn't a lot of gore, but there was some suspense, but the movie never held up, and i know we are a orrible species and all, but does everyone who falls into a zombie holocaust have to make a fighting arena where you have to fight zombies? Do we ALWAYS have to prey on each other, and instead of showing compassion in the face of overwhelming odds, do we have to try to subjugate everyone around us? I'm sick of zombie movies where the humans are worse than the undead. I tend to let little annoyances drop when there's a souless monter trying to eat my flesh. Instead, we get what we always get: a megolomaniac who thinks he's a king and rules basically a cabin while zombies amass outside his yard. Just once I'd like to see humnas vs zombies with no interlude of humnas versus each other. Dawn of the Dead, the new version, is the only one that has ever come close to that.
