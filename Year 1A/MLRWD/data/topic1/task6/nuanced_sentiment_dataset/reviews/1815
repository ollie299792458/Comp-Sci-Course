If it is hard for you to picture the 1970s with 21st century hindsight, watch this movie. An Australian white teenage girl and her younger brother who find themselves lost in the desert are eventually saved by an Aboriginal youth who is journeying through the outback as part of his ritualistic passage to manhood.  The film abounds with simplistic clich&eacute;s of gender roles, primitive innocence, the clash of modern urban civilization with so-called traditional cultures, and pseudo nostalgic yearnings for a simpler existence. In the end, the trek through the harsh outback becomes reduced to little more than a vigorous summer vacation. None of this undermines this movie as a worthwhile period piece, but if you have not seen it before, it might strike you as quaintly dated. We meet David Gulpilil in his youth - he is the same aboriginal actor who stars as an aging Aboriginal tracker in the more recent 2003 Australian movie Rabbit Proof Fence (another movie I have also reviewed on this website).
