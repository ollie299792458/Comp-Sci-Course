About the only thing I get from this movie is that Peggy Sue and Charlie were meant to be. And nothing Peggy Sue did could alter that. Not even going back 25 years into the past to break up with him.

Which would have been fine, if Peggy Sue had ever realized that if she broke up with Charlie, her kids would have never been born. But she doesn't. Instead all she thinks about is that now she can have some fun, but she misses her kids and wants to go back to her own time.

The film tries to show Michael as an intense, sensitive poet. Instead he comes across as someone who is going insane and will probably die of drug overdose or automobile accident by age 23.

Everyone else in the movie is extremely shallow. As has been noted before, the woman in the wheelchair is never explained. Charlie gives up on his music career even before he graduates from High School. Even Peggy's Grandparents are portrayed as flaky weirdos, attending strange clubs and participating in bizarre rituals.

Was there any point in Peggy Sue going back to 1960? Did she manage to change anything? Did Peggy learn anything to better help her deal with her life? Not really. So what was the point, other than to waste 103 minutes?
