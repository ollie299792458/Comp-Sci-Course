I agree with most of the reviewers on this one.  I sat through this with my husband and two children, paid the high cost of movies now days, even to see it at the theatre.  It was so bad, that two seconds after an event occured on screen, I could not have told you what it was! There was one, maybe two, jokes in which I found myself chuckling briefly, but they were over the heads of my children, who had more fun playing peekaboo over the chair arms than watching the movie.  It seemed to last four hours.  Some of the voice acting was good, some painfully stereotypical with their accents.  Some of the scenery was worthy of capturing a few fleeting moments of my attention.  However, the story line was boring for me as well as my children, the characters were unimaginative and dull, and the events lacking in many respects.  I found myself echoing my daughter half way tthrough, "Can we go home now?"
Do not spend the money to buy this new.  Buy it used or rent it if you must see it.  You will thank us all afterward.
