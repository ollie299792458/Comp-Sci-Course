In my opinion the best movie Dario Argento has ever made, although I didn't care for the ridiculous end too much. I saw it on VHS when it first came out.
Popping in the blu-ray I was abot shocked at the horrible (and I mean horrible) picture quality of this transfer, which is as grainy as a bad VHS copy of a 70s movie (the same problem the blu-ray of MARTYRS has). I read in some review that the picture quality was "very good" and that the movie "features a thick layer of grain that, again, preserves the filmmaker's intended vision". I find that hard to believe. I don't own a DVD of this movie, but as a previous reviewer said, it can't look worse than this.
The sound however is excellent, and features the dubbed English version and the original Italian track.

The movie itself I found quite good, except for the ending (I'm not an Argento fan, so some of the fans out there might object). I found THE STENDHAL SYNDROME suffered from the same problem that TERROR AT THE OPERA suffered from, it doesn't know when to end. What you get is a ridiculous plot twist to allow the movie to go on for another twenty or so minutes, depriving it of all credibility.
