I first saw "New York Dolls" at the LA film festival in the directors guild of america theater. The movie revolves around a punk rock bassist from the 70s, Arthur "Killer" Kane to be exact and his band, the "The New York Dolls." If you haven't heard of the Dolls before, then this is a great way to find out just how they helped shape American pop/rock culture.

Even though "Killer" had a good run in the spotlight it would never last as long as he hoped it would. The dreams faded and his mind went on vacation, he was slowly falling down that spiral of stairs he worked so hard to climb. In 1989 he had hit rock bottom by attempting to commit suicide through jumping out a window. He survives and while recovering is introduced to the Mormon religion through advertisement and when he fully recovers, seeks refuge in a LDS church.

I don't want to go over the whole movie but know this; it shows the realities from being on top of the world to holding on to your last knot on the rope. I'm at a loss of words for the rest of the movie, because the film-maker was able to capture just how real and brutal the world can be to someone down for the count. Overall New York Doll continues to be one of the best movies I've seen and will continue to be when it's released to the world on DVD. I simply cannot wait and I believe all Rock fans will derive something from this amazing movie.
