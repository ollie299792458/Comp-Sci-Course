Tetsuo: The Iron Man is not a Japanese horror movie, but a dark art film which was way ahead of it's time. Those watching it expecting a simple J-Horror flick are bound for disappointment. Those watching it for artistic merit and visionary visual experimentation will be in for a ride.

Portraying many different ideas and metaphors, it's all wrapped in a sort of stop-motion cyber-punk style of filming with a loose plot of (at it's basic element) a man whom sticks an iron rod into his leg and slowly transforms a horrid machine. However underlaying symbols and quick-cam shots riddle the film into puzzles of fear and technological nightmares. Metaphors of trials in Japanese culture (technological take-over, alienation, xenophobia, guilt, and modern isolation) plague the screen which gives a strong depth to it, making it worthy of multiple watches.

Though let me warn you, it is not pretty. The reason it's frequently upheld in the horror genre is that it IS also bloody and bone-driven with fx and violence. Many of the scenes can be downright really creepy and suspenseful. Body parts are turned into machinery, people are stabbed and beaten, and there's a Hell of alot of screaming.

Don't just take this film at face value. Like I said, when broken down it is more of an art film than horror flick. There are alot of layers to it and you need to look deep to interpret the substance of the subplots and symbolism. Not only that but the style of filming and camera work. Yes, did I mention it's absolutely insane in it's musical score, camera angles and cinematography?

Anyway if this entices you at all then definitely check this film out because it's right up there with Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain, and many other great dark surrealist-type films.
