I thought the intensity of the plot was good enough to overcome some of the tacky "video"-style special effects. I think the problem with many horror/psychotic thrillers is that usually moviegoers go in with the knowledge of exactly how the movie is going to end: girl needs to be saved and they are running out of time, just in the nick of time she is saved from the killer's plan. So, much if not all of these movies are based on how they are composed. The journey into a troubled person's mind was fascinating. I know this has probably been done before, but it was certainly enough to hold my attention. This movie is a lot like "Silence of the Lamb" , but it examines the mind of the killer, and what it is like to be "trapped" inside it. I think that Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn were stellar in their roles and that, as a psychological thriller, the movie was good enough to be suspensful and disturbing. I'm not much into these type of thrillers, but this one worked. The parallel scenes at the end, Lopez releasing the killer from his "evil" self and Vaughn saving the woman from the killer, were cool.
