Well I must admit I was going in to this movie with little expectations.  I'm a big fan of the other 3, 4 if you want to add Manhunter in there.  My first concern was someone other than Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal will be a letdown.  Gaspard Ulliel is not Hopkins but he won me over.  He did a very respectable job.  I'd never heard of him before and am now very impressed.  Gong Li was very good as well.  Overall the acting was better than expected.

I won't go into the plot since I trust everyone knows it by now.  Going back to see how Hannibal got his start was very interesting.  I'm a horror film fan and love blood and gore but to this movies credit it did not need the blood and gore.  By my standards it was moderately gruesome, but I was so intrigued by the story I wasn't dissapointed at all.  The movie was beautifully filmed.

Here's how I would rate all the movies so you can gage by my ratings how you might like Hannibal Rising.  I rate my movies personally on a scale of 0 to 10.

Manhunter  6

Silence of the Lambs 10

Hannibal  9

Red Dragon  7

Hannibal Rising  9

I was truly thrilled with this movie and look forward to more, hopefully with Gaspard Ulliel.
