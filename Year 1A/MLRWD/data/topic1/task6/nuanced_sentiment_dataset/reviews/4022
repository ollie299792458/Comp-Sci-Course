In the mid 1980s Freddie Mercury contracted what would later be diagnosed as aids and his health began to fail. Mercurys voice was allready damaged as a result of smoking coupled with exaustion from heavy touring. Queen had taken a 1983 break from touring because of voice problems from Freddie as well as for a break from constant touring with the hopes of coming back and playing to the end of their career but that did not happen. Mercurys abilities as a showman were compromised, the band was tired and they chose initially a longer break of 3 years after the final show of thier 1986 tour at Knebworth Park. That never happened as Freddie collapsed after a Solo Concert in 1988 and was diagnosed with aids. With Mercury no longer able to perform properly Live as a Frontman for his safety and popularity Queen stopped touring live for good. Live At Wembley captures Queen during the 1986 tour, a time when Queen were at thier worst as a Live Band but still gave thier all and its decent under the circumstances, Freddies weaker voice and moving about less, simpler 80s songs with a offstage/onstage musician used quite a bit and a silly medley of songs.
