Goodbye, Columbus seems on the surface like a sweet, inconsequential tale.  And maybe that's all it is.  But reading it tapped some really nice pleasure zone in me that made me feel good while and after I read it.  Who's to argue with that?

Part of its specialness was that as a young man I worked in Newark near the Library in the same general time period as this novel.  I didn't much like the regimented boredom of adult life and responsibility, so I used to frequent the library (even when I was supposed to be busily working at Prudential Insurance Company) where the protagonist of Goodbye, Columbus worked.  I was able to remember the marble staircase and the main reading room fondly and vividly based on Roth's evocative descriptions.

The book is hard to analyze and critique.  It has lots of humorous and charming characters; everyone is a little kooky and flawed, just as in real life.  But there is no evil to be seen anywhere.

The romantic plot just drifts along in a realistic way, and the hero is almost transparent, featureless, better allowing the reader to directly enter into the experience themselves.  I rarely give 5 stars, but would to this book, except that I wonder if part of my especial appreciation of it was based on how well it evoked my own similar Jewish girlfriend and Newark experiences.
