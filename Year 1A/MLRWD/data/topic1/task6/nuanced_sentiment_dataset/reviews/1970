This 50-minute workout is a good workout.  I gather you would do it every other day. The fitness instructor says it is strength training.  Nothing new here.  Some moves with weights, some without.

It starts with a warm-up.  Then back work with weights.  There are cardio intervals.  Very athletic.  I think the weight and cardio intervals are a bit too long.

The exercise take up a bit more space than I have.  The music is a bit masculine for me.

"10 Days to a Better Body", by the same makers, is great.  There are one-minute intervals, and the music is pleasant.  It takes less room, and the workouts are 1/2 hours, 2 of them, once every other day. It is very challenging as well, but at least it is 1/2 hour!

The diet that comes with this DVD is just as predicted; expensive shopping trips, and not a good use of leftovers.  All except you have to cook recipes, and use those leftovers.  That part is good if you like to cook.  I just do not have time.

A lot of lunges, free-weights.  All parts of the body are worked.  Not in sections like the other DVD I mentioned.

I see nothing new.  There are dance steps that frankly, I am not willing to do.  Some people need a challenge, and that is ok.

Overall a good workout.
