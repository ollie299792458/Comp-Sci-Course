This movie about a covert-ops mismatch joining forces to fight the dastardly minions of 'Terror' in the fair city of Paris could be a great first-date film... for a politically right-leaning gay couple.

A junior CIA functionary assigned to the US Embassy in Paris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and an ultra-cocky senior-level CIA operative (John Travolta) have an over-the-top blind-date with Asymmetric Warfare Destiny in this tale that is both shoot-'em-up & coming-of-age story with blood, guts, big explosions, chase-scenes, five-kilos of coke, psychotic ex-girlfriends and big, *BIG* guns - which are held, fondled, caressed, sung to and at one point even lovingly *sniffed*... (and _!Holy-Mackerel!_ that scene was too weird for me to make up).

The aforementioned actors are professionals and worked the material the best they could. Kasia Smutniak, who played the femme-fatale in this 'global hoax on terror' had to be a real trooper to make it through this thing in one piece (her character does not). Hopefully she gets a better part at the next go-'round.

It looked like a two-star movie to me at first - and I don't write about 2-stars - but then I thought about what legs this flick might have in the home-entertainment market. It could be a cornucopia of quotables for guys who don't get much female company... To each his own! Cheers!  ;]]
