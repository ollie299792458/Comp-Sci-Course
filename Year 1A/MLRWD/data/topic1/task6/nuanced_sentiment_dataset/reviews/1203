THERE WILL BE SPOILERS!!! BEWARE!!!

From the description given on imdb.com: "A haunting portrait of Lucy, a young university student drawn into a mysterious hidden world of unspoken desires", I expected a sort of modern-take on the Sleeping Beauty tale, most likely one with a bit of a darkened flair for both effect and meaning, combined with an obvious moral takeaway.

That is not what I received.

Sleeping Beauty is...how to put it kindly...dull. The movie, from start to finish, just...goes. Nothing really happens; you don't learn anything or gain some brilliant insight, it just...keeps going and then, without warning, it just stops cold, leaving you no idea of how you got to the end or where any of the characters will go from there.

Half of the plot points are never explained, like the obviously tense relationship with her mother, the one 'stripper?' 'hooker?' who helps her get ready, or her friend who commits suicide. Descriptions of the relationships might have made me feel something for the characters but, since they didn't exist, I found myself lacking any sort of understanding.

Oh, and that scene with the medical test and the tube...*shudders* that was so horrible that I nearly stopped watching right there.

The film isn't even really 'artsy'. The viewpoints are stagnant, the angles are often awkward, and the lighting is sometimes so horrid that it makes you alternate between squinting and covering your eyes. The lack of soundtrack doesn't make this movie more dramatic; it makes it harder to determine when anything of worth is happening, something oddly fitting when the film ends and you realize that nothing did.

The only high point of the picture is Emily Browning, who gives an excellent performance (and proves without doubt that she's damn nice to look at when mucking about in the nude).

I'd give the film itself 0 stars if I could but, since Emily's performance was worth all 5, I'll average it out to 3.
