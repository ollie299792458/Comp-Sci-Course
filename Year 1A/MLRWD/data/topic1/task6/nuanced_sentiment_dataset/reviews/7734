This this is a halarious comedy about two best friends who work secretly as wedding crashers on the side. Wedding season is in full swing, and their main objective is to blend in, party hard and hopefully get laid by the end of each night. Everything goes according to plan until they hit the wedding of the season. John (Owen Wilson) falls hard for the maid of honor Claire while Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) has a fling on the beach with a bridesmaid Gloria who is now a "stage 5 clinger" (virgin). The rest of the film is centered around these love stories as the crashers are invited to the family's home. John continues to attempt to win the heart of his crush, Claire who is engaged to a Prep on steriods, and Jeremy does everything he can to survive the clinger and the rest of the CRAZY family. This funny comedy has love, friendship, crude humor and a whole lot of unfortunate but halrarious situations. There are so many jokes, You'll miss half of them because you'll still be laughing at the last ones. It's even great as a date movie.
