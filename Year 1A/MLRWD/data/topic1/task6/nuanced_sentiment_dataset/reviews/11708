I wish I could get back the past ninety minutes I wasted on this completely un-scary "horror" movie. I even rented the Unrated version thinking it would be the best one. Well it might be, for third graders who've never seen any horror movie for the past thirty years. I can only imagine what a slog the PG-13 version is! Every cliche you can think of is in this movie. Every.single.one. If this was made for horror fans then my intelligence was just severely insulted. I kept waiting for scenes to payoff only to be strung along a little more until the completely predictable and groan inducing ending. This wanted to be some kind of ghostly Fatal Attraction but failed miserably. As a horror buff nothing angers me more than a boring horror movie. I'll even take a so-bad-its-good one, but boring? I want to break things.
In 1978 a man by the name of John Carpenter changed horror movies forever with his use of widescreen in the movie "Halloween". You as the audience could see Michael Myers coming before the characters in the movie did. It was a cheap trick but it drove moviegoers crazy! It became a guaranteed way to get audiences to fling their popcorn. One of the more popular appearances of this is the old open-the-bathroom-mirror-then-shut-it-and-in-the-background-is-the-ghost/killer. However, we are all in on the gotcha and have been for years. We can still fall for it but it doesn't satisfy like it used to. It's become lazy filmmaking. That's what I think of "Shutter"...lazy filmmaking. I imagine this was based on another Japanese original and if that was styled basically the same then the US has to stop importing them...like now. Sure "The Ring" and "The Grudge" were scary,to me anyway, when they first came out but enough's enough. We're scraping the bottom of the barrel now.
