I'm looking at all of the negative reviews on here and 90% of them are based on the graphic nature of the film and the fact that it's not for younger audiences... DUH!

The film is rated "R", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult to see it in theaters or to purchase it in the store. If you don't want to watch a hilarious movie with shocking obscenity and nudity, go watch something else.

I personally think "Wanderlust" is the perfect film for anyone who's questioned their life's path and I think the movie has some wonderfully understated moral themes about individuality versus group identity.

Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd are all at their best while they're working together. It's also fun to see three giant movie stars doing a film that was not a sure-fire blockbuster guarantee.

I say, if you're not a prude, see this film; If you are, go see another crappy remake of a fairy-tale or a movie about harmless vampires falling in love.
