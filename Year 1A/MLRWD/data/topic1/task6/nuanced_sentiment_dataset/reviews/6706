Quentin Tarantino wrote the ultimate guy flick in the form of a romance movie, and then let Tony Scott polish it off with a bit of Hollywood sparkle. The resulting kitschy film comes off not so much a blockbuster epic, nor does it resemble a Tarantino-like piece of art. It just represents a sort of middle of the road movie that really could have been so much more, but still satisfies..
Clarence is a loser, until he meets Alabama, a young prostitute hired to show him a good time for his birthday. The two fall in love, and what starts with Clarence killing her pimp to take back her stuff, results in a cross country chase with Clarence and Alabama toting half a million dollars of cocaine in a suitcase, with the mob and the police on their tail.
The biggest draw of the movie is the star power, and more so the chemistry between certain actors and actresses in the many key scenes of the movie. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken play their cameos to the hilt, while Gary Oldman's performance as an urbanized white pimp absolutely steals the show in the first half of the movie. Up until Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette reach California, the movie remains dark, gritty, violent, and irreverent. But once the sunshine state hits, the slapstick-like comedy takes over, resulting in a shootout ending that doesn't so much make sense as it does distort the overall tone of the movie.
You get the sense that no one really knows what the hell is going on, so each character acts their own way. This results in a strangely mesmerizing but disjointed movie experience, as the movie definitely shines and lulls in its given moments. 
But still, this movie is way smarter and more enjoyable than many other summer blockbusters that get tossed out there and deserved more acclaim in its 1993 debut than it originally received.
