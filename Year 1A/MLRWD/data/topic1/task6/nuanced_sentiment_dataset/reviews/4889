This movie is a running infomercial for what is wrong with Hollywood today.  They take something from our childhood and mangle it beyond recognition and add adult humor so maybe parents will enjoy it and buy it when released for home viewing.  I made it as far as the "dirty Hoe" reference and then stopped the movie once the cat made sexual overtures to the "dirty hoe".  What tripe.  I am not upset they changed it from the book since that is part and parcel of Hollywood.  That is why we have the colloquialism "The book was better" because they do such a good job of taking something simple and pure with a simple mesage and transforming it to something unrecognizable.  To let your children view this is to train them in the based humor of mankind and maybe get them killed when they try stair-bobsledding.  If you watch reruns of America's Funniest Home Videos then as an adult this may appeal to you, but for your kid's sake, let them have a childhood without a Rave Club visit from Paris Hilton.
