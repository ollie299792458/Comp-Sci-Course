I don't want to spoil anything but this is the happiest saddest movie. Towards the middle end i was thinking this was a boring lame movie butit all comes together at the end! Make sure if you start watching th movie to finish the whole thing! I SERIOUSLY DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER CRIED SO MUCH FOR LOVE AND JOY IN A MOVIE! AWW MAN WHOEVER MADE IT SHOULD GET AN AWARD! IT HAS ACTION, PLOT, DRAMA, SUSPENSE, LOVE, HEARTACHE, AND THE BEST A HAPPY ENDING! THE LITTLE GIRL IS THE CUTEST LITTLE GIRL EVER!
  And the little girl is so cute . she is like a korean shirley temple! Honestly give yuan bin and the girl an award they did a great job! Godbless you guys (like they would ever read this ha ha)

i am curious though maybe someone can help at the end of the movie was he supposed to go to jail or something they didn't really explain anything but i thought he would take care of her...i don' tknow a loose end they could have tied up!

Also the guy at the end who died through the windshield i thought he was going to get it bad like tortured i wish maybe they would have thought of a better part for that guy!

ALL IN ALL ONE OF THE BEST HEART TOUCHING MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! ANYONE WHO LEAVES NEGATIVE FEEDBACK OF 3 OR LESS KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MOVIES OR JUST DOES NOT HAVE A SOUL!
