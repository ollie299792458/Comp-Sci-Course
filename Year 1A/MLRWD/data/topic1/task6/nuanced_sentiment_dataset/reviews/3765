I could swallow the Fantasy part, such as odd physical abilities of key characters, different "lands" and Goddess', but its too disjointed to have any bearing to a coherent plot. SPOILER.

The fact that the slave-since-near-birth becomes an ultra-confident, kunfu master and subsequently becomes a greater noblemen then his new master is only ludicrous in the sense that we see no progression to this state.  Its a huge jump in a characters which has no logical bearing.

Additionally, we think the villian is attempting to subvert the emporer, yet later in the movie the "council" of the city seems to divest to the villian, as if the upheavel the villian initially caused was forgiven.  Just odd.  We also see no resolution for the fallen-generals betrayal by his right hand man.

Yes, their are beautiful sequences, but your too much trying to figure out exactly what the hell the director is trying to accomplish.

If The Promise cut out 4 of its weird sub-plots, and focused on the rest of them (by building them up sequentially) perhaps we would have understood the story and identified with the characters.
