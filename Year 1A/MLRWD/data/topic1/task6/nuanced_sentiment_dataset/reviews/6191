Why is it that such horrible movies always get great reviews from people who think they are art.  This isn't art.  It's just a bad movie.  A woman of such high quality as Neve Cambell's character would never lower herself to the idiot of a boyfriend  she gets stuck with in this movie.  And I really doubt such a powerful businessman would let a street hustle get that close to him.  If he wanted to meet the girl he would have done it himself or had one of his flunkies find her.

And the whole scene with that teacher was just a waste of film.  Why would she want to work with him?  He's an idiot and so are all the people they run into on the street.  All that scene does is show that while she has a boyfriend she is more than willing to cheat on him.

Now the nude scene.  While a naked beautiful woman is always a wonderful thing to see, it serves no purpose.  If you want to show her strength and power that certainly is not the way to do it.  I can point out hundreds of movies that show strong powerful women who never take their cloths off for the camera.  Let's face it, nudity in a movie shows only one thing, a naked body.  Trying to say this is art just points out the lack of talent on the part of the writer and director.

And any movie that brings in Mike Tyson is just a fools movie.

The only thing that saves this from being pure trash is the fact that Neve Cambell is such a great actress.  To bad she made the same mistake as so many other young actresses that try to get out of a mold they are stuck in by takeing off their clothes.  Nudity has its place in movies but that alone does not make you a serious actress.  Most go downhill for this point into a string of B movies.  Only a few have ever made it back to real films.  I hope she makes better choices in the future.
