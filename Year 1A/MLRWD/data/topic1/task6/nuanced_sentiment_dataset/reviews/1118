It seems that Catholic tragedies are the only events which warrant the attention of filmmakers. The IRA, INLA, Real IRA and Continuity IRA are responsible for bloody monday, tuedsay, wednesday, thursday , friday, bloody Brighton, bloody Enniskillen (11 civilians murdered), bloody Warrington (two little children, ages 12 and 3 murdered), bloody Warrenpoint (18 soldiers), bloody Omagh (29 civilians), bloody Guilford (5 civilians), bloody Birmingham (21 civilians), bloody City (3 civilians including a 15 year old girl),bloody Harrods (five civilians), bloody Claudy (8 civilians)... There isn't enough space for me to list all of them, but the list goes on.
  The stastics say it all: In the whole course of the conflict Republican groups have killed far more people (2153) than the security forces (365) and Loyalists (1080) put together. In addition they deliberately target civilians (example: Harrods 1983, Omagh 1998) and have even forced civilians to become suicide bombers for them (Patsy Gillespie, Londonderry 1990).
  This film is lacking, not for its portrail of the events of the day which is done quite well, but for what it omits. For example, the very same year (1972) was Bloody Friday (22 IRA bombs murder 9 civilians). No mention is made of any of these other events in the film. Nor, by the way, is there any mention of the fact that the Catholic alienation was due mainly to policies of the Unionist parliament in Stormont and not the British government.
  So, in my opinion, see the film, but don't use it as your only source of information about the conflict.
