I think children over the age of 7 or 8 would be bored.  As [others] have noted, it is really three short stories on one DVD; the link between the stories is the premise that the mice are putting together a storybook of Cinderella and the castle.
Two things could have been better:  Cinderella wanders around the castle and in town in her old workdresses (a little longer than knee-length, apron, hair tied back).  I would have liked it better if Cinderella had worn prettier gowns, though not dressed up as ornately as the palace staff would have it.
The second thing is that the movie ridicules people "of size."  For example, there is one fat woman in the story where Jac is upset because he can't help Cinderella because he's just a mouse.  The fat woman is shown as being stupid, insensitive to others (couldn't discern that a human Jac was not attracted to her -- was actually repulsed by her), and hysterical (in her reaction to seeing a mouse).  In the first story, the fat lady-in-waiting is a giggling not-bright mess.  Her reaction to Cinderella cooking breakfast was the typical "fat person" reaction to food -- enraptured and obsessed (implied).
Fat people are one of the few groups of people that are openly ridiculed in our society, in print, movies, and television.  I know Disney is just playing off a stereotype of "fat equals lazy, stupid, insensitive, etc."  I just wish Disney would have backed off on this one.
