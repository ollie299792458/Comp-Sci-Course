I consider myself a beginner at yoga.  I have practiced yoga on and off for a few years.  This type of yoga is very different and I really enjoy it.  I try to practice a little each day.  The matrix menu allows me to pick out a 20 - 30 minute workout, because I use this to supplement other strength workouts and running.  I have also been in the process of a huge relocation, so this is something I have been able to do on the go.  I like the video because it is different and challenging, the instructors are obviously very experienced, and the instructions are fantastic.  I recommend watching the breath section first to better understand the breathing, I think it is key with yoga in general, especially this style.  I have improved my flexibilty greatly and feel more lithe and centered.  My posture has improved.  But the most amazing thing that has happened after practicing this video, is that my lung capacity has increased, AMAZING.  I did my first run in almost a month yesterday, due to relocation, and I didn't even notice until about 1.5 miles that I was strictly nose breathing, as in yoga and totally fine, not out of breath at all.  For those who run, this is pretty amazing after not running for a month.  So, I sped up, I had been trying to take it easy first run back.  End of story, ran my fastest 3 miles ever and still wasn't completely winded at the end.  AWESOME!  Ana Brett and Ravi Singh have definitely found a true follower of their videos.  I also own the Ultimate Stretch video.  I am trying to get my husband to do them now, he is also a runner.  Oh, I am also a Christian and have noticed some concern from other reviewers.  My response is to use the matrix, do the parts you want and skip some of the more meditation/chanting sections.  I usually skip them because I have two kids running around me when I am exercising, so meditation is quite difficult.  I really love the videos and will definitely buy more  Expanded lung capacity, for real, I am truly amazed!
