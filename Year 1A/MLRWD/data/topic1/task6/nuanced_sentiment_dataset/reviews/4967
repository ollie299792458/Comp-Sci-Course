The writers of this movie hadn't made a decent film since 'Scary Movie', so I already knew better than to waste my money on this movie. But my cousin had left it at my apt one night, and since I had nothing but time to kill, I went ahead and popped it into the dvd player, figuring that I could at least make fun of how bad it was. WRONG! This movie was so awful that I couldn't even bear to watch it, let alone make fun of it. Being a fan of movies such as 'Airplane!' and 'Not Another Teen Movie' I can appreciate and enjoy a good parody, but all the producers of this movie did was take an awesome film like '300' and crap all over it. It's got no originality, even for a parody. It's style of so-called humor is a never-ending string of jokes about bodily fluids/functions and lame attempts at poking fun at pop culture...which is fine in small or at least tasteful doses, but this movie's got so many pop-culture jokes that the movie itself is nothing but that: one big pop-culture joke. Comedy is my favorite genre so I normally enjoy most comedies, especially since I'm known as 'the girl that laughs at everything'..but this movie barely even made me crack a smile. In fact, the only thing possibly funny about this movie is the fact that Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra's careers are so fledgling that they decided to actually be seen in this movie. If I were either one of them, I'd rather let my career go and slip quietly out of the limelight (at least I'd do it with class and leave my career on a good note) than have people remember me associated with this pathetic excuse for a comedy. Please, do not waste even a cent of your money on even the 1 cent used copies they have for sale here on amazon. You're better off tossing that penny into a wishing well and wishing that these guys would stop making these awful satires already.
