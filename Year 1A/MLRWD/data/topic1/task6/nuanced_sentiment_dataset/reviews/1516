Okay, maybe turkeys is going too far.  But none of these films are classics.  Criterion, as others have noted, is a fabulous company in terms of producing restored, pristine DVD versions of films.  However, these films are not classics, and are for Karloffians and collectors only.  Me?  I'm both.

I run the video room for a local science fiction convention, so I'll claim a tiny bit of authority here.  I would not show any of these films, although I'd watch them at home.  None are as good as "Fiend Without a Face", mentioned in another review in this section, and that one was not quite a classic, either.

Both Karloff films are from his older age.  The Haunted Strangler is probably Karloff's better film, and gives him a chance to contort up his face a bit and show some acting chops.  Corridors of Blood is just ok.  Neither film is particularly scarey or suspensefull, although both do have their moments.  Again, both films are of definite interest to those of us who love Karloff.  Others should beware.

The Atomic Submarine has some atmosphere, but otherwise, watch out.  The effects are cheesy, even for the time.  Not a lot of money was spent on this one.  As for First Man Into Space, you should have some Scotch before trying that one.  It's slow going, and the effects are even less impressive.

Anyone looking for something along the lines of these films that is better, nifty even, should consider the earlier Karloff film, The Body Snatchers, part of his Val Lewton period.  And in terms of the sf Marshall Thompson films, you'd be much better off with Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers.
