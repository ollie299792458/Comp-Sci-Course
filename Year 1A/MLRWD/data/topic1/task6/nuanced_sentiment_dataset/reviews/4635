I saw ACDC three different times on their Black Ice tour and there would've been a fourth time but due to an ice storm I was unable to attend (Black Ice, yeah I know). Anyways regarding this DVD it was a pleasure to have a commemorative DVD for this tour and maybe their last, but once again there seems to be too much crowd scenes and not enough of JUST some ACDC on stage playing their arses off! I felt too bombarded every 4-5 seconds with a scene change, whether it be from band member to band member or from band member to crazy crowd. I wish they would've made it an option to be able to watch the DVD without so much of the crowd. If you saw them on this tour you will also see how they chopped up the animated beginning quite a bit and to me that was a shame because that really set the tone of the show. Whatever happened to music DVD's that concentrated on the group more than the crowd?

With all this being said, and I know I've been hard on this DVD, I'd go see ACDC again in a heartbeat! I hope they do come out with something new soon and tour again!
