For those who haven't read the book (and are easily entertained), you may enjoy this film. If you're discerning or have read the book, then don't watch this movie. This clumsy adaptation has more gaps than a crack whore's smile and a little less charm. The acting was mostly wooden and flat. Whoever adapted this film left out vital subtleties that form the foundation for the character so masterfully portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. We see Hannibal as a child and a young adult, but we don't ever get into his head. That's where the fun is, right? We're here to peep, as it were, into his psyche. This portrayal of young Hannibal lacks the dimension we need in order to appreciate the depths of his intelligence. That is, after all, his greatest weapon. In the book, we know right away that Hannibal is a genius -and a bit peculiar. Not a monster and not just another little boy. The glosses over all of this. What the movie does include is ludicrous: Lady Murasaki teaching Hannibal how to fight with a katana. That is where I had to turn it off.

Repeat: If you've read the book, don't waste your time with this movie.
