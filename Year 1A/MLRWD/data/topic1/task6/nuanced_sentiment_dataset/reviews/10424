Spoiler warning! Passengers is 2008 thriller film starring Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson. Directed to perfection by Rodrigo Garcia, it had an unfortunately limited Halloween-week release and quickly disappeared from theaters. Though slightly derivative of films like "Fearless" (1993), "Flatliners," "The Sixth Sense" and "Ghost," it is nevertheless a fascinating blend of great writing, great acting and other great production values. Therapist Hathaway is ordered by boss Andre Braugher to treat survivors of a plane crash. Survivor Wilson hides his true feelings of fear and anger by making major changes in his life, such as painting...but soon he receives visits from the dog he had as a boy--which is buried in his parents' back yard. Soon, the other survivors begin to disappear, leading Hathaway to believe that the airline is killing them to destroy evidence of a mechanical problem that has plagued the company. Hatahway can't get ahold of her estranged sister and visits her house...just as an airline rep David Morse appears there too. He  reveals that all of the plane's passengers died in the crash and she discovers that she, too, died on the flight. Fast-paced, spooky, terrifying and ultimately quite a human horror film with a heart. Please ignore all these negative reader's reviews...Passengers deserves your 90 minutes of time.
