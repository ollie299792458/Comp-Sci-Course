this documentary was a disappointment. it bends, twists and distorts in order to persuade the viewer that chomsky's opinion are correct. one example -- text stating that macneil-lehrer has had 10,500 interview-guests and chomsky has appeared only once. there are 6.5 billion people so the odds of being on at all are infinitestimal; more to the point and fair would have been the median and mean for appearences and noting what percent of guests were interviewed multiple times. i'm willing to guess that 99% of guests appear just once. another -- the constant refrain that the media is the tool of the elite but choosing to ignore the role that media played in ending the vietnam war, raising concerns about nuclear reactors, ousting nixon from the presidency, and many more. the media is highly imperfect as are we all, and i share many of chomsky's concerns and some of his beliefs, but the world is not binary --just black or white. much of the imagery was also highly manipulative and i do not think this was just ironic commenatary. this film purposely distorts and therefore lies to make its case. this is really too bad because the questions about media, opinion, democracy are important and deserve better treatment.
