For someone who has admired Oliver Stone's work throughout the years, Alexander is a huge let down. None of the freshness and bold attitude of JFK or the striking brilliance of Platoon or the grittiness of Salvador are here. There's nothing memorable as Wall Street or as cutting as Talk Radio. After twenty minutes one asks them self "where's Oliver" He is not in this movie. The movie is lost and uneven. It starts and stops in fits. Colin Farrell is woefully miscast. He doesn't carry the movie, which he needs to do. He doesn't have the weight of character but he does give it the old college try (well you know what I mean). The choice of using Irish accents make it seem unbelievable. If one closes their eyes (which is not hard to do) one would think it is set in a pub in Dublin. For all the money that was spent on this film, it captured none of it's potential (especially compared to aspirations from the Behind the Scenes conversations). Through there was a lot of work put into the film, it doesn't all add up in the end. The only saving grace of the Director's Cut  edition is Oliver Stone's commentary (which is always a treat and is more interesting then the movie) and this cut is better than the theatrical version, if it's any consolation if you paid to see it in November, my condolences.
