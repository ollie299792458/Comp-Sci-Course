I strongly recommend NOT purchasing Madagascar. There are so many good CG and non CG animated movies out there with such better plots, storylines, characters, etc. Madagascar just stunk. And the reason it stunk is because Dreamworks was so interested in showing off their technical brilliance with so many unnecessary and unconnected asides and distractions from the plot that when the movie returned to the plot I was tired from trying to make sense of how the scenarios were related even to each other and not just the main storyline. Pick any Pixar movie and you'll find it more compelling than this Dreamworks movie. Don't get me wrong me and the family like some of the Dreamworks movies - Shrek, Shrek 2, Kung Fu Panda (which is TOTALLY AWESOME, we own and watch it often) and Aliens vs. Monsters. Like Dreamworks, Pixar also shows off their technical brilliance in all of their movies (esp. in HD - whoa!), but the difference is that one is not distracted from the storyline, plot, character development. Often this brilliance is an integral piece of character development, plot development, story movement, camera angle, etc, that enriches an already strong story. Madagascar did not deliver for us. The characters were just this side of one dimensional. If you don't care about the characters in a story (any story) it isn't a story worth telling. I, as well as my fourteen year old son (both of us looooove animation and are connesiurs) agreed the only redeeming quality of this movie were the penguins and enjoyed the second short movie involving their efforts to save their compadre when he gets into trouble at Xmas time, but don't buy it for that, either.
