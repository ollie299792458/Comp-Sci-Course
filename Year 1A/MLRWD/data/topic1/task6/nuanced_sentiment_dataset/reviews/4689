As a De Niro fan, I guess I should never say this, but I'm going to say (write) it anyway: Leo di Caprio steals the picture here! Only in "What's eating Gilbert Grape" have I seen him giving such an  absolutely stunning performance, stealing the picture to Johnny Depp,  another great actor that I admire.
  "This boy's life" is  certainly not a milestone in De Niro's career. In fact this movie closed  somehow a period during which he has made a string of mediocre movies, such  as "Guilty by Suspicion", "Backdraft",  "Capefear", "Mistress" and "Night and the  City", and he went on later to give stunning performances in great  movies such as "Heat", "Casino" and  "Sleepers". Although I like De Niro and di Caprio, to me  "This boy's life" is just a watchable movie. The best thing this  movie brought to the audience is di Caprio who, I'm sure, will certainly  give other remarkable performances throughout his long and, I hope,  illustrious career.
