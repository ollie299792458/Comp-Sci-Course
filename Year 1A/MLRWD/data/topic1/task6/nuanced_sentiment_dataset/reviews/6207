Of course, I'd be willing to bet it will become a favorite of everyone in your family, as it is in ours.  The only, and I mean ONLY, caveat here is that the Scottish accents may take a wee bit getting used to, but that's hardly a reason to miss out on this, the best family movie I've seen in a long time, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, period.  I won't repeat the basic plot info, as that already appears here on the Amazon page.  I would respond, however, to those reviewers who liken this film to "Free Willy" and "E.T.," only to say that this movie is finer than either of those by my estimation.  It's far more sophisticated than "Free Willy" and has dimensions of meaning about love, loss and war that "E.T." could never hope to aspire to.  The acting is fantastic.  Emily Watson will break your heart with her quiet dignity.  Alex Etel, who plays the child Angus, gives a more subtle, layered performance than any child actor I can think of in any film.  You'll be surprised by the adult male roles here, played by Ben Chaplin and David Morissey; who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  The answer here is not so readily apparent.  Most of all, three cheers for the studio artists who brought Crusoe the Water Horse to life, from infancy through adulthood.  You won't believe your eyes; he appears as real as any living creature you've ever seen.  Finally, there's the script, which is intelligent, funny and deeply moving.  No cheap manipulative tactics here, no condescending to young viewers.  This film treats its audience with respect.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime treasure.
