i respect them trying to engage social opinion with entertainment but this is just time capsule for those around then to watch the show. to see it now and i'm 51 yo, most of the comedy was flat and the Paulsen guy for president was painful to watch. so not funny so i'm assuming this was something for the times also. i like to see some of the musical guests that you dont have the chance to see from those yrs and some of the comedy skits are ok (james mason, pinochio, the whole show with just musical guests great) but some of the humor is so dated and that david steinburg!! ehhhh, i would like to know where ppl think he is funny? i know he took over directing the show Designing Women in like the last season and killed that show with his directing as it was like night n day from the great seasons that he wasnt involved with but here on this show his 'sermonette' was soooooo not funny! maybe thats why CBS cancelled the show? i think for alot of these olders shows (and tommy even warns the viewer about seeing these shows now might not b the same from what they remember in their mind) because the comedy is from that time basically maybe find one sketch to view and leave the musical guests in and the smothers brothers singing speaking etc and would b ok. show from the 70's like tony orlando and capt n tennille suffer the same as the comedy skits r really not that funny. just more of a time capsule type thing but music can be enjoyed thru the yrs past.
