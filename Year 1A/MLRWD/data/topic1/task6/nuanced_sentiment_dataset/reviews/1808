As much as I hate to disagree with Amazon.com's review of the DVD release of DUNE, it is not the original theatrical release. I was in the theater when it premiered in my hometown. I, my young son, my mother, my father and my brother were all there and can tell you that 137 is not the whole flick. The first intermission was at 90 minutes. What's the point of that for another stinking 45? No, the original was about 3 hours long and the only complaint I had was seeing the Irulan Chronicles delivered by Jose Ferrer, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Irulan wrote the Chronicles while she was married to Paul and should have delivered them in the movie. When the Video version came out, I couldn't believe they got the whole thing on one tape. Even Ben Hur used two tapes and half of that is music and intermission.
Well, as I feared, they did not get it all on one tape. They chopped it up and spit out this watered down version with only one notable improvement: Irulan delivers the opening Chronicle. As soon as I saw her face on the screen I knew this was not the movie I paid money to see back in 1984. Therefore, be forewarned that what you are buying in both the DVD and Video Tape is a severely condensed version of an exceptionally well-crafted film of a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and not the full meal deal. Frank Herbert was consulted on the making of the original movie, and if you could see the rest of the movie, you'd know why the Barron is covered with festering boils, what the heart plugs are about, and all of the other out-takes that this version deemed unnecessary.
