I did give it three stars for being different and interesting, but I say that with a bit of reservation. For this film is unbelievably bleak. While I hate those fairy tale love stories like "sleepless in Seattle" as much as the next guy, this goes in a complete opposite extreme. This guy meets a girl who he thinks is different from the rest, and he does his best to do right by her and offers her the respect he thinks she deserves. Yet, she does not reciprocate that respect and the inevitable disillusionment sets in because of it. He soon realizes that the person he loved never really existed at all. That she only seemed that way due to her boarding school upbringing, that she isn't as she is by choice, but by environment alone. Now that she is out of school she quickly morphs back into a "real girl" if you will. As interesting as I found it I also found the cynicism of it all rather depressing. I say this because if this is what "all the real girls" are like, who would want one. For according to this, "all the real girls" are not worthy of a man's respect. At least, that is the way I saw it. In the end, it gave a voice to my own cynicism and disillusionment. For this movie resembles my love life. I just hope to God this isn't really true.
