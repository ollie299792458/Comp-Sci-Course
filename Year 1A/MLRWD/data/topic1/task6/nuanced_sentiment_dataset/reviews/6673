I took both my three year old and my six year old to this movie, and they sat through the whole thing! They were mesmerized by the silly humor. For instance, in one scene Alvin pretends to eat Theodore's poop so Dave thinks it's a raisin and doesn't get mad.

The story starts with Dave, an unsuccessful song writer, who accidentally takes the chipmunks home. This is where all the fun starts. He wants them out, then finds out they can sing!  He says they can stay if they sing his music. The chipmunks grew up in a forrest with no parents, so they have NO manners. There are loads of funny scenes as they destroy his house and his social life. He is determined not to be their "dad", they're just friends.

Enter evil uncle Ian. He is Dave and the chipmunks manager, who of course, told Dave his music stunk before the chipmunks entered the scene. On Christmas, Dave had given the boys savings bonds, which granted, is a lame gift. But he meant well, and he was thinking about their future. Uncle Ian comes in with lots of toys, setting the scene for Dave is the serious one, and uncle Ian is the fun one.

Dave of course gets soft to the boys, and his desire that they have a normal childhood becomes apparent, whereas Ian just wants to make money. Ian eventually exploits the situation and the boys come to live with him. This is where the real drama comes in. You have to see the movie to find this part out. But don't worry, it has a happy ending with a nostalgic "ALVIN!!!"

The music is absolutely great. There are songs I remember from growing up in the sixties, and then there are new ones that are more in keeping with today's music.

I pre-ordered this DVD as soon as I found out it was available, and my boys and I can't wait to get it!
