There's much more to this movie than might be seen by your average reviewer.  Yes, it repeats itself.  Yes, it uses obvious gags.  But, such is the spirit and style of the Austin Powers series.  Myers may reuse jokes, or use obvious gags.... but the point here is that he does them WELL.  He isn't repeating material from the first two movies because he's lazy.  Anyone who knows him will tell you very quickly that he'd never let that happen... he is doing is because its funny.  The opening is an obvious preparation for such total absurdity (and even a mockery of its own popularity) and all references to earlier movies are done with such self-consciousness that he obviously wants us to think about the previous films.  He isn't trying to make it seem new.  
Its barely a shallow movie, either.  If anyone knows the background to the Austin Powers series, you've probably heard about Mike's amazing devotion to his father, Eric.  (note the name of the production company.... Eric's Boy)  And, what subject perpetuates Goldmember, in jest or in somber truth?  Family and fatherhood.  No, this isn't Shakespeare, but he is contemplating an issue in a special way that only a comedian can do.  It is as if he is laughing at the Mike Myers that made the first two films.  On that level of self-realization, the film is hardly shallow.  If comedies aren't your bag, or you have to cry all the way through something for it to say anything to you personally, that's fine, but lets remember that this is a comedy, folks.  Laugh a little.  It won't hurt.  I promise.
With that, I tip my hat to Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat, and Goldmember.  Mike is one of the most talented comedians of our era, and I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.
