Just finished this flick, and I can't say that it was time well spent.  Although this film purports itself to be a family movie, it is no more family oriented than any of the National Lampoon spoofs.  It's a movie your average worldly 13 year old will probably like, but I wouldn't in a million years try to sell it to my family.  The ever popular "men 'r fools" undertone infests this entire movie, as the patriarch of the central family can't even figure out how to make his seat belt work.  I feel sorry for this guy, who has to endure taking his embarrassment of a family on a road trip to Colorado.  Of course along the way, they meet a trailer-trash type family who RV's full time, and *of course* they end up being a homeschooling Christian family (gasp! Bet you didn't see that one coming!)  They are a sorry representation of both homeschoolers and Christians, but again, is that any surprise? (I have no doubt that if they had been a homeschooling Muslim family they would have been presented as being intelligent, tasteful, and modest...Hollywood's gotta be careful where they point their bias, after all.)  Many Christian homeschoolers are intelligent, tasteful, and modest, but Hollywood doesn't seem to notice or care.  Not much entertainment value in that, I guess.  More fun to make fun of them and cast them negatively, I suppose.  Anyway, making this movie was a waste of money and even a waste of celluloid.  Unless you're 13, or 25 going on 13, I would steer clear of it.  And if you have any concern at all about what your children are putting into their minds, I would most certainly steer clear of it.  Just my two cents, take it or leave it, it's all the same to me!
