I've always loved the fun that the actors and writers must have had with this show.  Even the monsters show disgust at the constant badgering, fearless intrusiveness, and self righteousness that the reporter portrays.  Daren simply aces capturing the essence of obnoxiousness. It's a portrait of contrasts: small newspaper in a big city, but part of a larger syndicate; editor that wants a "scope" to put it on the map, but is afraid of the stuff Kolchak drags in; self-righteous officials perplexed by things they don't understand and want to forget, except for Kolchak constantly there reminding them...

The DVDs started to degrade in about six months and even though I wrote to the manufacture and Amazon, nobody gave a dam. Part way through many episodes the picture starts to halt and eventually degrades into disjointed blocks and the whole thing stops.  I would have reported this to Amazon, but they don't have a QC function... at least this section of Amazon isn't in it for quality...
