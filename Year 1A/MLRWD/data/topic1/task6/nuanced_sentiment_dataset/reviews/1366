This time its war! The iconic line from the blockbuster 1986 action picture Aliens. This film is the sequel to the 1979 horror flick Alien. First of all, let me just say for the record I didn't think the film was going to compare to the original. As I sat there watching Aliens earlier today, I found myself liking Aliens more and more, and as time went on I found myself liking Aliens better than Alien. Now don't get me wrong, Alien was an awesome horror film, but with the slow pacing leading up to the moments of suspense, I thought that Aliens was a better film because of the fast paced action and the acting was incredible. Now I know why Sigourney Weaver was nominated for best actress of that year. She puts all her effort into making Ripley believeable, relateable, and a bad ass chick who kicks Aliens Asses. So to say I prefer Aliens over Alien. But of course people should see the original first because then the second one doesn't really make sense. Anyway on to the blu ray review. The tranfer was crystal clear and amazing. I thought I was watching a movie made yesterday because of how well they did on cleaning and upping the picture quality and the sound. To me the transfer looked better on this than on the Alien blu ray.(But that's just my opinion). On to the bonus features. This single disc blu ray comes with commentaries by director james Cameron and cast and crew. It also comes with the 1986 theatrical version and the 1991 special edition.(I've only seen the theatrical version). But anyway if you're an Aliens film fan then make sure to pick this up.(Oh and P.S., both The Alien and Aliens blu ray come in cheap Eco friendly blu ray cases. So if I were you I'd have some extra non Eco friendly blu ray cases on hand). This is One of the best films of the '80s so I strongly think you should watch this film. Bye, Bye now.
