Well, after some of the reviews I read I was hesitant to purchase this little gem.  I am SO glad I followed my instincts and got it.  I haven't been able to stop watching since I got it.  I can only guess the bad reviewers were not fans of Dallas and the like?  This show is a great blend of the nightime soaps and the supernatural genre.  I agree with the comparisons to Dark Shadows.  While this show is not perfect; I was hooked from the pilot.  I found the acting and story to be quite good and a creepy feeling of dread pervaded the show from the beginning....making for some nice chills up your spine.  Very rarely will a show start out being all it can be.  The only example I have EVER seen of a show being absolutely perfect from the first minute is Wonderfalls!  The main flaw I had with this show is that I don't think it could have gone for more than one season and remained the unique, interesting show it was.  The whole premise revolved around Christina finding out who she was and fighting her dark nature.  Will she fight for good or evil?  Once that decision is made, basically the show is over or if it continued you would have a killer of the week trying to off Chris for various reasons.  One person responded to a reviewer that Chris went "evil".  I totally disagree with that.  ***SPOILER ALERT***
Had she truly gone evil the whole town and the people would be dead, wiped off the map, period.  She let them live....they can still save her, deep down, she is good and wants to be good.  I can excuse her killing Jesse.....God he was WAY too goody goody anyway and totally betrayed her.  That MIGHT have worked better and the angst been able to build between them.  Anyway, this is a fun and entertaining show, you won't go wrong with it!!
