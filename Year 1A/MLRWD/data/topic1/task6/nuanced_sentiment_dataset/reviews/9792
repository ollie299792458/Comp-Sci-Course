Originally, I was not a Tyler Perry fan. His earlier movies to me seemed to portray African American families in such a stereotypically degrading way. Mr. Perry's most recent films now cast African Americans in more varying angles.

This movie stars Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates. These two ladies have honed their acting craft to perfection. Sharing the screen with them is an  amazing ensemble cast. Their acting in totality is seamless which makes the families and this story truly believable.

The script was well written. When you think you have the entire story together and gather a "what is going to happen next is..." expectation, you are given a surprise. This is delightful as it draws you more into their stories.

This is the first time I have seen a Tyler Perry movie where all of the actors mesh well together and the scenes flow perfectly. The only awkward scene I believe that should have been shot another way was the one with Kathy Bates in church sitting on a pew. That scene was too long. Although it was meaningful, it could have been done another way.

This movie is definitely a DVD purchase, not a rental.
