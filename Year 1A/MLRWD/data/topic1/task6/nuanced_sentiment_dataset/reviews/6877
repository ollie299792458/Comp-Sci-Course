From Danny Boyle, famous for directing Ewan McGregor in "Trainspotting" and infamous for his poor film adaption of "The Beach", we have the scariest movie that I have seen in twenty years.
The film begins near London, when a group of animal activists break into a secure animal laboratory. Against the advice of a very British looking laboratory technician, one of the activists releases an ape from a cage. When the laboratory technician desperately tries to smash in the brains of the activist, for the protection of everybody else, you know that there is something very seriously wrong.
Filmed digitally, there are several minutes of wonderful footage as the hero of the movie, dressed in a hospital gown, walks the deserted streets of London, even passing close to the Houses of Parliament. For the early part of the movie, you wonder where the residents of London have gone, and there is this mild horror, slowly growing in the pit of your stomached as you begin to see the extent of the devastation - or rather, depopulation.
I don't want to go into detail about the plot, because I want you to have the chance to enjoy this movie without preconceptions. This is both Horror and Thriller, but don't let friends or web-sites make you believe that this movie fits into an existing sub-genre. This film is not like one of THOSE kind of movies. It is far closer to Wyndham's "Day of the Triffids" than to anything by George A. Romero. I saw this movie in Glasgow in October 2002. Apparently I jumped in my seat several times, and I can tell you that the audience atmosphere during and immediately after this movie was tangible. There were lumps in a lot of throats.
Not to be missed - and definitely to be kept out of the reach of the children.
