I really wanted to like this movie---I even cut out of work early to see this movie, and well (sigh), here goes...
Matthias Whitlock {Denzel Washington--Training Day, John Q.} is the chief of police in small-town, who happens to be married and having an affair with his high-school sweetheart Anne Marei Harrison {Sanaa Lathan--Love & Basketball, Brown Sugar}, who is struggling with her own fidelity issues with an abusive husband, Chris Harrison {Dean Cain--host of Ripley's Believe It Or Not}, an former quarterback turned security guard who is bitter and strapped for cash.
One day, Anne Marei takes Matthias to the doctor where she learns she is terminally ill with cancer.  Treatments are expensive and not guaranteed to extend her life.  Whitlock decides to take measures into his own hands, and steal some drug money from a successful bust to help his lover.
On the night he is to deliver the money, Anne Marei's house has been burned to the ground, killing her and her husband!! Investigators suspect foul play and are looking for answers. To make matters worse, the lead detective is Whitlock's wife {Eva Mendes--Training Day}.
Now Whitlock, must solve this mystery and keep the rest of the force hot off his trail, before they discover the truth.
The movie draws you in without a problem, especially as Whitlock discovers some truths of his own.  But it's the last 20 or so minutes of dialogue/plot that it all went downhill.
Overall, not too bad.
