Just pay attention long enough to see the incredible eye-gouging scene... If anybody out there truly believes this is the hallmark of Japanese horror films, then you haven't watched enough of them to know the difference. There is not one single moment of horror OR suspense. This was undoubtedly one of the dumbest & most dissapointing movies I've ever seen. Every scene is stolen from other horror movies. And it's all so predictable. Do they actually think people are scared when a light falls down from the ceiling, or when one of the characters jumps out of the closet in attempt to scare another character? Give me a break. And how BAD is that 80's synth pop tune which literally plays every single time something "creepy" happens?! It is apparent this director knows nothing about creating tension or atmosphere. There was stronger tension in the rolling credits of the French movie "Irreversible". Not to mention that there are spoof-horror movies from mid-90's Hong Kong which are immensibly more clever and gory than this. The worst part about this film is that it takes itself so seriously that it can't possibly be amusing. Compare it to Evil Dead II. EDII is a film so drastically better in every single way, yet it still had the wit to parody itself a little bit and make us laugh till our stomachs hurt. EDTrap has no rights to even suggest an association to such a great series as The Evil Dead.
