Obviously the Deer Hunter is a whopper of a movie. But I think that it has in the time since it has been made, the legend of this movie has largely eclipsed its reality. This is an ambitious movie, with great performances by de Niro and Walken. I'm not going to deny that. But anyone who is serious about movies for what they are, rather than what people say about them, should acknowledge that perhaps they like it because they are supposed to and because the silly russian roulette scene (wow that sure got everyone talking right?) - rather than because this is such a great movie. It is good, sure, but true greatness eludes it by a considerable margin. It is too long, too complicated, and too wrapped up in its own politics (was the roulette scene "racist"? who cares!). What I mean to say is that Deer Hunter got too much attention for the wrong reasons, and that when one actually puts the hype aside and tries to see the movie for what it is, it is a remarkably melodramatic, boring, tedious, and overly complicated movie. When I consider Deer Hunter on its own merits, what I personally perceive the most strongly is the influence of some very overbearing filmmaking (forcing the nonsensical and dubiously famous "marriage scene" as well as the silly prisoner of war scenes on the viewer). I mean, it is almost heretical to disparage this movie, and I don't want to disparage it, but rather to balance what I think are some jaundiced opinions.
