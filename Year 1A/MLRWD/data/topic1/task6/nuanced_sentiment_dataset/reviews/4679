First let me start off by saying that I think Patton is one of the greatest movies ever.  This is a review of the blue-ray disc and it's over use of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).  The source elements for this movie where shot on 65mm film, so the image should exhibit a very fine grained texture to it.  The DNR has made the movie look exceedingly clean to the extent of looking like digital video rather than film.  This has caused a softness and lack of detail in the movie.

Want an example?  Go to time code 11:59, it shows a wide shot of a battlefield with a dog in the center left.  The dog leaps forward, but he halts and jerks back in midair for no reason.  The reason for this is the dog is teathered by a leash.  It's been virtually erased from the film by "cleaning it up with DNR".  In a still frame you can barely discern a thin line attached to the dog.  Yes you should see the dog leash, watch your old dvd copy.  The blue ray might look good on a small screen but as you go up in screen size more of these problems stand out.  This disc doesn't represent the movie's photography and doesn't live up to blue-ray's potential.  Film is a medium that the movie artist paints his creation on.  With DNR they can change the medium and thus change the movie.

I hope that maybe they will see thier mistake and pull this blue-ray and give us one from the source.
