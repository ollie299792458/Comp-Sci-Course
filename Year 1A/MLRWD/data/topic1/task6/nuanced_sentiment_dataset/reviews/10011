This major motion picture ,based loosely on the original television show,had the potential to be one of the funniest films of the year and beyond.Jim Carey was offered the role of Darrin and turned it down.After seeing this movie ,I understand why.Even if Carey accepted the role, with Jenny McCarthy as Samantha,the film was doomed from the start.The script was too far removed from the typical funny bewitching plots of the hit series.How about actor John Lithgowe as Larry Tate? Michael Caine was excellent,yet too serious here. Nowhere is Doctor Bombey or even Tabitha! The supporting characters added so much fun to the original show.Bernie Fox ,Erin Murphey,and even Henry Gibson could have done cameoes.The astral traveling,botched spells,the witches council,Sabrina the evil sister,and pop-up appearances were each an intrinsic element for the show's magickal chemistry.Shirley MacLaine was perfect for this type of role,yet the script was so bad it ruined her spiritual aurora.Shirley says the part was forgetable.What a shame.Both Kidman and Ferrell are great actors ,but not for this lame romantic comedy feature.
