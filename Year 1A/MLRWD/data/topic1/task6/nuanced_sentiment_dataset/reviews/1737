I recently saw this small gem of a movie and was completely enchanted.  It is a story that will entertain your children and grandchildren while keeping you completely captivated.  Based on a graphic novel by Neil Gaiman it tells the story of a young man who crosses into the realm of a magical land (as had his father before him) to retreive a fallen star and bring it back to the woman of his dreams.  Upon finding  the star (Clare Danes) he attempts to return home with his prize.  And so the adventure begins.......... as they are pursued by an evil witch (played with relish and devilish glee by Michelle Pfeiffer),  and are befriended by a flamboyent lightening bolt chasing pirate (Robert DeNiro) who could easily fill in for one of the "Fab Five" on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

In addition, this film is filled to the brim with wonderful cameo performances by Peter O'Toole (as the King), Rupert Everett (as one of the Kings evil sons), Sienna Miller (as the spoiled girlfriend), and Ricky Gervais (as Freddy the Fence). Although reminiscent in some ways of The Princess Bride, this movie possesses  more humor and charm as well as visually stunning special effects and an impressive use of make-up and prosthetic devices.

Stardust emerges as a welcome and refreshing change from the the plethora of sequels and animated films that have been clogging the big screen recently.  For a pleasant two hour romp through a fun filled fantasy world, put Stardust on your list of must see movies.
