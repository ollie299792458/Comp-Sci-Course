I let my 4 year old watch this movie, trusting the fact that it was Disney/Pixar and rated G. The fact is, the content/dialogue of this film warrants at least a PG-13 rating. Granted it does not have obscene language or graphic violence. It does, however, contain very cruel behavior, lots of "I'll kill you" (in one case a character says to his brother something like "if not for the promise I made to mom on her death bed, I'd kill you right now!"), as well as the mean grasshopper gang (who party in Mexico and are modeled after hell's angels) that is very scary and too dumb to be amusing. In general the themes/ideas presented in this story are far too dark for a kid's movie, with way too much mean-spiritedness and very little to redeem itself. Speaking strictly from the perspective of "Is it entertaining?" I'd say that the three of us that watched it (parents and child) were not entertained. One of us adults even fell asleep. By the way, the mean grasshopper gang-leader (named "Hopper") gets fed to baby birds in the end, screaming as he's lowered into the open beaks.
