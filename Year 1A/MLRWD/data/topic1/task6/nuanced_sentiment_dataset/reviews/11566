As a brief summary, Cameron Diaz is a teacher who hates her job. She is happily looking forward to being able to quit (so as to pursue other interests, such as a breast augmentation), when her husband divorces her. Reeling, Diaz is forced to confront the fact that she is no longer wealthy by continuing to teach. It becomes apparent that Diaz's character is far from the most ethical and competent of teachers, as she simply does not care about her students' performance. What follows is the story of a school year in which Diaz first ignores then aids her pupils in an effort to win prize money which would allow her to win prize money sufficient to afford an augmentation in order to impress a wealthy coworker (Justin Timberlake).

On the whole, I rate the film as follows:

ACTING: A
 -Diaz shines in this movie for, really, the first time in a while. Timberlake and Jason Segal each add the flare that we are accustomed to receiving when they film. The interactions between the characters are believable and each embodies the role cast to them.

PLOT: C
-The idea of a "Bad Teacher" is a creative one, to be sure, but if you are expecting huge comedic interactions between Diaz and her pupils you will be disappointed. These occurrences, while present, are few and far between and, to me, made the movie somewhat less enjoyable.

COMEDY: C
-The comedy is raunchy, as would be expected. It's not a blockbuster comedic hit, for sure, but it will cause you to chuckle at points. Certain comedic points do seem stretched, and the lines of comedy are not as creative as would be expected for such high-profile actors. What comedy I found in this film came not necessarily from character interaction (which was more of a storyline) but from individual character moments. The group could have been a lot funnier together had the plot been more helpful in creating comedic moments.

FINAL REVIEW:

If you can rent this, then do so. I wouldn't necessarily buy it. At points it's good, but it had the potential to be so much better. Then again, everyone has different tastes in movies.
