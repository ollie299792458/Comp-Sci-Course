Can you say FINALLY?  The network have released on dvd one of the best shows that television had to offer.  I began watching the show very late in the game, but luckily they ran it late every week night for from the beginning where I was able to catch it from act one scene one.  When I watched all 5 seasons and the network began to run it again, they stopped showing it in between seasons where I started taping the show for my collection.  The chemistry between Michael and Nikita were so intense you felt like you were drugged into seeing what was going to happen next. Every single episode was great, Season Five didn't end the way it should have, but having being rushed to complete it, is probably the reason.  BUT, if you want to watch a show that has action, emotion, very little comedy and just a great overall 96 hours of stay on your couch till it is all done show, this is the one to watch...Believe, me, you will fall in love with every character at Section one whether you want to or not...You will see the bad and good side of each of them and that makes you realize they are human after all...
