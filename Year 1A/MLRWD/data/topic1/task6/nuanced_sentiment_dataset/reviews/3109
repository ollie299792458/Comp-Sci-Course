It seems to me that people who liked this movie a lot, related well to it.  That maybe the most important aspect of the film - and a very sad comment  on our social fabric.  I think that is the only reason I rated this movie.  The film did not mesmerize me...I hung in there to find out just how bad  could it get.  Pretty bad.  Similar to Boogie Nights, although one could  justify it as a representation of the worse of those times.  But why  glorify the bad and the ugly?  Magnolia might be a great documentary for a  college class discussion or more, but as entertainment the film stretches  the bounds of enjoyment of the black, the sadistic and the unfulfilled with  nothing much else offered up.  Albeit not in a pornographic or vulgar way -  almost like trying to experience, via voyeurism, the feelings and minds of  twisted and warped people.  Yes, they exist, yes the director portrayed  them well, but to what end?  A cinematographic painting of ugly and jaded.  More for the anthropologists to review in 3030 A.D. than  "enjoy" as an evening's entertainment.  Well, there you have it.  My opinion and mine alone most likely.
