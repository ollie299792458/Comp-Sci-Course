Shame on Alan Rickman for involving himself in this mess!

The movie started off okay, but I was totally distracted by the awful techno music that played NON-STOP, no matter what the mood of the scene. Then the plot just got more and more ridiculous, the acting more and more terrible, and the music NEVER ended (in fact, it got worse). The people who gave this movie more than one star must really like their techno... Instead of watching this movie, just go to the local dance club and seek out the most obnoxious d-bag you can find. Then stand there listening to him for two hours while the repetitive electric music beats at your eardrums. That might actually be a more enjoyable experience than sitting through this utterly predictable and RIDICULOUS waste of time.

Even with the stupid plot twists and bad acting, this movie might have earned a couple of stars if not for the terrible soundtrack/sound direction and editing (like the horrible swooshing sounds when they oh-so-dramatically show people moving in fast forward and then rewind and then fast forward again...lame!). If this movie had been quiet, it would have made for a much more eerie experience and perhaps I might have given a fig about at least ONE of the characters.

I give it zero stars, but Amazon is forcing me to give it one.
