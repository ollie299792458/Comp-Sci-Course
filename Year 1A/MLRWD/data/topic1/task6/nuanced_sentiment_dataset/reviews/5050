This movie was recommended to me by someone after a discussion regarding the fact that less educated and intelligent people are more likely to have children, and in particular many children, than the more educated/intelligent segments of society.  It certainly brought that discussion to life in an amusing and yet disturbing way.

This movie is clearly meant to be satire, and should be taken as such, yet it raises concerns that we as a society should be considering.  We worry about eugenics and preferring babies with blue eyes or high IQs, but we have yet to begin discussing the fact that, with survival concerns largely removed by technology, our gene pool may cease to weed out the "less fit" members of society - for good or ill.

Funny and thought provoking all at once, I'd recommend this to anyone who is concerned that our society is getting dumber and dumber.  As with much satirical commentary on society, the idiocy of the movie (excuse the pun) contains a kernel of truth that will (hopefully) make you think.

I do agree with the some of the lower reviewers that the movie was a bit overdone, and that the point could have been better made if it hadn't focused so much on stupid-funny.  That said, I did find it amusing and it touched on an issue that I think we ought to be concerned with, so I am giving it 3 stars.

Of course, I can't help but wonder how many people will watch this movie and NOT be prompted to think, or worse yet, not realize that they are part of the population being satirized in this movie...
