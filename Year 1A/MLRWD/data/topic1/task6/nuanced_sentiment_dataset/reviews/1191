The story of 'The Ring' is simple and it is just as like other horror movies but it gives a different style of horror. The whole atmosphere of the movie in itself is very dark. One female newspaper reporter found nameless videotape in the cabin and she watched it . But it showed only weird things and after watching it, she got a call. The scary voice on the phone said 'You are going to die in a week' In one week she needs to find what is going on and also the solution and way to live too. She asked help to her ex-husband, who has knowledge about video and photos. He needed to watch the same tape and also got a call. Few days later, they know what happened little by little and just one day before female newspaper reporter's day to die, they got to know true story?
The last scene that the girl came out from the television was the scariest to me, yet it doesn't make a sense in a way.  After watching it, the whispering voice saying 'You are going to die in a week' kept hounding me. Despite some plot holes, I would have to say that this movie worth the time and rental fees.
Warning : After watching this movie, you can hear the whispering ?'You are going to die in a week.'  =)
