I Am Legend by Richard Matheson has to be one of the most frightening books ever written in the 1950's. But it seems all of the theatrical renditions of this movie have not hit the point of it's clever title. In "The Last Man on Earth," "The Omega Man," and the recent "I Am Legend," all Neville characters are portrayed to be legends of men- the Last man ever to live on Earth.

However, the book's true meaning has been warped in all three motion pictures,(though I have to say "The Omega Man" is, sorta, the closest). The novel's Robert Neville is not a legend among men, but among Vampires. As the crowd of vampires look fearfully up at him as he is about to be executed, the author describes that Neville was really like a vampire to them- Coming during their resting hour to slaughter them during their sleep, just as a vampire would a man. See the connection?

Over all, if I had not read the book afterward, 2007's "I Am Legend" was entertaining, suspensful, and, I'll admit, a bit frightening. But I'm afraid that too many people would not have understood the real meaning of the film had it been made directly according to the book. Maybe that's why.
