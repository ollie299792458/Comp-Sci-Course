I want to say that I enjoyed the movie and the possibilities of where it could have been going, with the ideas in the film, the way we got to see the inside of the space ship, the way the presence of the predator creature could be understood in terms of the spirit world as understood in a voodoo way of thinking, and well we got a bit more of a glimpse of the predator culture and the head of an alien from the movie Aliens, which although was a film joke, turned out to be a crumb of an idea that would lead to a sequel for this movie. The main actor in the movie was good enough, and I liked the fact that I did not know about him at all before this movie. The effects were good too. Nothing was out of place for me apart from one thing!.....One thing that held it back viciously! ...... It wasn't the presence of underground trains in LA, which there are none of in real life, but instead the presence of Morten Downey Jr as a reporter, turning up repeatedly through the film trying to uncover the truth of what was going on, in ways as irritating to me as the man himself.  It utterly ruined the credibility of the picture! It turned it almost into a pile of s**t!
If the director would only recut the film removing all signs of this man, I would enjoy the movie much much more, and give it an extra star
