Since the reissue of SISTERS on DVD/Video , I couldn't resist purchasing a copy on video since I haven't seen this movie on rental for forever, I was not dissapointed.  Friends liked it as much as I and agreed it was an eerrie,bizarre thriller/horror classic. All the other review entries are spot-on. This is one of the best directed project's of Brian DePalma and hit-and-miss starring vehicle for then girlfriend Margot Kidder in the lead playing siamese-twins Dominquie &amp; Danielle .Jenny Salt is Grace Collier an over-zealous ambitious reporter whom witnesses A murder from her apartment window.  On all levels including direction,acting,cinematography,musical score and production does this weird fright of a tale about Siamese-twin's deliver, one so sweet and charming the other murderously mad. The finale is an eye opener.  Aknowledgement's to support cast Dolph Sweet(deceased),Charles Durning and breifly Olympia Dukakis.  Much thank's to Criterion for making this much-missed favorite available  once again.  Recommended Viewing!
