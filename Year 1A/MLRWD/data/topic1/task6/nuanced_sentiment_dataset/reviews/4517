This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and an absolute classic!  Cagney's performance is just incredible, he's playing what should be a bad guy(Tom Powers), but it's done in such a way that you really feel for him, even though at times he's a real jerk!  It's no wonder this film made him a star, he's just so darn good in it, he's magnetic, and at times, downright chilling!  The film is also beautifully directed by William A. Wellman, especially when the action takes place out of sight from the audience's point of view!  This also, is a very effective use of sound, especially so early on.  We don't see as much violence as we hear, and our imagination(when used properly) makes the violence worse then what could ever be done on film, not to mention, the ending is one of the most startling moments in movie history.  The supporting cast is quite good as well, and it's all around an enjoyable, compelling film, and it puts you right smack in the middle of that world with it's use of popular tunes as the musical score!  The film is made all the more powerful by the performance of Cagney in one of his signature roles, and I'd have to say it's my favorite of his movies.  This DVD is well done, and has some nice extras!
