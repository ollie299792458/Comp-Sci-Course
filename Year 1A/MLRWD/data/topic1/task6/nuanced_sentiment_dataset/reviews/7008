If you have experienced in human life, "Love at First Sight", as I did in 1986, then you will understand and appreciate this movie for your entire existence.  It happened in Poland at a Grand Castle, just as the picture's setting takes place at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island - a beautiful place for romance. The movie's music of haunting love comes from Eastern Europe. The "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" by Sergei Rachnaninoff is perfect, and it is not plyed excessively as is suggested by a New York Times review.  The musical score embellishes the movie's theme.  I ask, did Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, share love during that movie, only to have it lost?  Can one live in a future life a love last from the past?  I certainly hope so.  Great movies are not necessarily found by critics during their opening day, but this outstanding movie has become so over time.  Later comments by Jane Seymour about this movie appeared on February 14, 2009 in a special WGN television program.  Thus, three decades later, "Somewhere in Time" has become the "Love Story" for many who did not appreciate it initially. If "Love at 1st Sight" is real for you, this movie is for you.
