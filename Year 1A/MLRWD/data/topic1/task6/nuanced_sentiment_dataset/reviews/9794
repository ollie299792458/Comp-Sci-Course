3/5 Stars

"Let Mortal Kombat begin!"  Quotes like that are what this movie (and the video games in which it is based) is going to be remembered for.  I decent action film based on the successful Mortal Kombat fighting games the movie is focused on, you guessed it, "Kombatants" punching each other around trying to win an inter dimensional tournament to save the world from the evil Emperor.  About as scary as playing a game of Space Invaders, but you don't go to see a movie like Mortal Kombat and expect anything more then the title implies.  Plenty of action and a plot so simple that there is no brain required to watch this film.

The plot centers on three Kombatants who the thunder God - Lord Raydon - believes will decide the fate of the earth.  During the course of the tournament they face a series of warriors possessing supernatural powers who are commanded by the Emperor's evil sorcerer Shang Tsung.  As the tournament goes on the face stronger opponents, including the red-eyed Kano, the ninja attire wearing Sub-Zero and Scorpion, the four-armed champion Goro, before they take on Shang Tsung himself.

A short film, barely going over ninety minutes Mortal Kombat certainly does what it intended to do and with a fair level of success.  The constant action and laughable dialogue will no doubt entertain teenagers and just make for a fun late-night movie for casual viewing.
