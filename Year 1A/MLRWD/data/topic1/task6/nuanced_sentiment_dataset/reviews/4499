Two positive things that prevent me from giving this movie a one star rating. Jerry Goldsmith's music and the fact that Sam Neill is perfect as Demian.

On the negative side... Well, the story speaks for itself. Damian Thorne is now 32 years old. He is head of that Thorne company from the second movie. But he has to become ambassador in England, so he can fight Christ - who (according to "The Book of Hebron") is going to be reborn in there. Damian Thorne also has a large following of satanists, or whatever, that he preaches to, and commands to kill all the babies that were born on the day Christ was to be reborn (according to an astrological phenomena). Apart from Christ, Damian has some other enemies: seven Roman Catholic priests (or monks? or are they both?) have discovered his secret identity as the Antichrist, and have bought the seven knives that can kill Thorne. Sounds interesting? Didn't think so.

I can turn a blind eye to the fabricated "Book of Hebron" that is to be apart of the Septuagint, and even to the nonsense of speaking of the "original latin" of its text. There are similar problems in the first Omen, and they don't bother me. But why would the Antichrist be chased by priests? And why does Jesus - who incredously is REBORN in His second coming, according the this film! - play such a minor part in the fight against the Antichrist?

And no, the death scenes are not cool. Some lame ripp offs from the first two films, and some uncreative new ways to go.
