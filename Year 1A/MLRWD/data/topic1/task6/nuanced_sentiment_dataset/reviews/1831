For those who don't know, I love a manga called Fairy Tail I absolutley adore it. After reading the first couple of volumes I decided to watch the anime version online (I havent bought and anime but I will soon so this review is to encourage people to buy it on amazon) and I really loved it. When I was getting ready to watch it I expecting it to just be a good anime adaptation of the manga, but after I saw the first 4 episodes (in english dub) I had this to say, "Along with the manga, the Anime is also one the greatest things ever." I honestly don't know why I love Fairy Tail but it's such a phenomenal manga and anime. I like how it stays very true to the manga and that it can be both enjoyable for kids and adults. the only complaint I have with the anime is that it censores to much stuff from the manga and that really bothers me. I highly recommened this to anyone who loves anime and it's worth every penny. Before I forget, I have to say that animation is awesome I really like how the makers of this anime where able to translate the art style of the manga into anime. I'm also worried that Funimation won't Dub the rest of the anime (which by the way, the English dubbing is excellent) because for those who know, Funimation only dubbed the first 48 episodes. So yeah, if you love the manga I really recommened buying the anime version.
