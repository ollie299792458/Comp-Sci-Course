In an era when "Horror Movie" usually means mindless slasher films of exceeding visual ugliness and moral repugnance, "Sleepy Hollow" is a welcome return to the classic gothic chillers of the past; visually elegant and beautiful (Like all Tim Burton movies), spooky, funny, scary and intelligent. The casting of Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Who co-starred in Hammer's "Horror of Dracula" back in 1958) along with a host of top British actors (Including Ian MacDairmid, the Evil Emperor Palpatine of the "Star Wars" movies) give it the flavor of a classic Hammer film, while Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Casper Van Diem bring youth and beauty to the cast. Depp is hilarious, and Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken add sinister icing on this Halloween cake. A terrific movie, here served with a Tim Burton commentary track. But be aware, this is not Washington Irving's famous ghost story, but rather an original story using some of Irving's character names and situations, but with a whole new plotline (A whodunit with a ghost and witchcraft), and Depp's funny take on Icabod Crane bears no resemblence to Irving's skinny schoolteacher original. But we've all seen Irving's story already, so this new tale is welcome indeed
