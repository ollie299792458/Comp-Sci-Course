"Silence is God's first language." You will see this quotation from St. John of the Cross on the phamplette in the CD case. The director made a wrong choice in that he used God's language instead of human's. Shortly, this film is as much superficial as the silence itself which surrounds the monastery physically. Silence in itself is nothing. It's just like a vacuum. I understand the intention of the director, but his intention is not supported by normal human psychology. It only brings irritation to the audience. Maybe he wanted his film to be interpreted in many different ways by them. But it's his own thinking. His own interpretation omitted the medium through which we can access to his intention.

Foremost, he wasted the precious time, which relates with the fact that monks do waste time in their monastery. When the director intermittently showed the faces of the monks, I thought that I was looking at the prisoners. Paradoxically, they are actually prisoners of love for God. If these are what the director aimed at, it's a great success. But it's not an appropriate and conscientious way of sharing his experience in the monastery for six months with other people who want to know the depths and reasons of the life of the monks. If this is a documentary which appeals only to our heart and soul, not to intellect, then it is not a documentary at all. It's just a propaganda for Catholic Church. In my thought, through this film, Carthusian orders will lose many vocations. His approach too much idealise monks lives and separate from the secular world. But they are only an extension of any other monasteries practicing looser rules than Carthusians.

The only thing I was surprised at was that I mistook the ear of the monk on the first scene for a wound in Jesus' heart.

What would Thomas Merton (who was tempted to join this Order) say if he is alive and see this film? He'll be very much disappointed, I think.

German people are sometimes too philosophical.
