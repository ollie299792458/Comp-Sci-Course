So I could wash the memory of this film from my mind. Run, no wait... get in a car, a fast car, and drive as fast as you can- ignoring all traffic signs and signals- away from this movie. It's terrible mix of pure treacle and bitter hostility. Julianne Moore plays a saint -nay- A GOD, who takes care of, I dunno, 100 kids? And she's as warm and kind and intelligent and loving and patient, etc., as any ascended being would be. Woody Harrelson plays... I don't even know. Knowing one of the kids wrote this is creepy because Woody's character, the father, is an angry, bitter drunk who is about as emotionally mature as your average 10 year old, and all the kids hate him. But then occasionally he has to come groveling for forgiveness and I think it's intended to elicit some sympathy, but it's so slapped on it seems pretty clear the author would have just preferred to damn the father altogether. Cree-py.

And that's the thing, this movie isn't even honest. Moore's character at some point says "I'm not a saint". Yeah, right! That's just bad filmmaking. This movie is nothing but the 90 minute beatification of Moore's character (with some serious damning of the father thrown in), and rather than show the character as a real person, the character has to tell us she's a real person. Show, don't tell. Every second the woman is on screen she's second only to Jesus. When she said that "saint" line I laughed out loud because it was so ridiculous.

This is a lousy movie. It's gonna appeal to anyone who loves blunt treacle, but if you're a fan of realistic characters, effective pacing and plotting, stay away.
