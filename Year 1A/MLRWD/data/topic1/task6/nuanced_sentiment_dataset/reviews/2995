I am 25 years old right now, and the first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what they were trying to get across. Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was "Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future." And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.
