I suppose some people love a drama, for them this is a 10 star movie.  But to me when I buy a movie by Harrison Ford I expect top notch acting and a script that Hollywood money can afford and the right knowledge of how to make it all happen.  The end result is supposed to leave me feeling highly entertained and look forward to watching it again some day, because after all thats why I bought it, not rented or borrowed it from a local library.  In the case of this movie I wish I had gotten it for free from the Library instead of wasting my money on it.  Its all drama, all tear jerking drama. I wanted to be entertained, not dramatized!  After viewing it I put it in the "to sell" pile, not on the shelf.  Like I said, if its a drama you want, then buy it, but if you want more than to cry constantly for the constant onslaught of crap that happens to nice people, then go ahead and buy it.  personally I prefer an uplifting movie or pure entertainment, whether action, sci-fi, true story, ect. anything but non stop tear jerking gut wrenching drama.  I might as well watch a video of the day we buried my beloved Mother!  Meaning simply: you dont need a movie to remind you of some things, you just don't!!!  so I give 2 stars, only reason I dont give it just one star is because Harrison Ford does act well, but there's just no story, its all just a bunch of situations designed to give you grief!  All clumped together to pretend its a movie, which it isnt.  You need a great story to make a great movie, not just dramatic situations one after the next!  Sheesh!!  They should have thrown the whole thing out, sorry, but I really do feel that way, and I know a good movie when I see it!  I've tried to be as accurate, honest and fair as I could be on this review.  If you really do like this kind of movie, please buy my copy, its for sale.
