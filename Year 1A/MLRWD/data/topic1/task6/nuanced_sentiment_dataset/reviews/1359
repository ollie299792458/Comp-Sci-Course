If you've ever rented a "blockbuster special" movie, you're in for a low budget experience where rather than showing you the big alien ship everyone is afraid of, they show you the expressions of fear on peoples faces. I can think of a few movies like Pontypoon(spelling?) or that one that came out last year called Monsters, that was really about 2 lame people and their "love" story, but wasnt at all about monsters.

You cant mention material like dark holes, black holes, parallel universes, etc. and not come to the table prepared to deliver. At least make something up as to why these people are missing, why Roanoke and missing colonists are referenced to, why are there still animals walking around? Why leave two children alive at the end of the movie? By the way, its very irksome to have writers bring children characters into an adult movie. Think Return of the Jedi and those annoying teddy bears that had no place in an adult science fiction movie.

Why not just set the city on fire building by building until you can figure out a way to combat what is happening? I would like to think that people are alot smarter than the people in this movie but you can never tell. I just dont get why everyone is gone except for the animals and two kids at the end of the movie. If that's the case, then this is a stripped rip of Dean Koontz's "taken".

Save your money folks.
