The problem with "Valiant" is that it doesn't really break any new ground.  It's saddled with a strictly by the book "Little guy proves he's got the stuff" storyline.  This could've been overcome if the script was a little more lively, the animation a little more creative, the action a touch more compelling.  But these areas don't pick up the slack.

There's nothing really wrong with the film, but there's not a whole lot right with it either.  While I liked the characters, they never transcended their simple intent (snooty bird, slob bird, battling brothers, evil falcon leader, etc.).  And never once did I have the slightest moment of suspense over the outcome.  Of course, I knew our hero wasn't going to be killed.  That's a given.  But usually the unpredictability of the story keeps me involved.  Not in this one.

Okay, so I'm not a kid.  A kid would probably like it.  But in this new age of animation, the bar has been raised exceedingly high, and Valiant falls wells short.  On the plus side, I thought much of the quieter animation and character design was excellent.

Okay, but not great.
