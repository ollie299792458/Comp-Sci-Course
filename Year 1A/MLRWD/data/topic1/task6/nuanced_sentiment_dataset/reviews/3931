If you read movie reviews for the benefit of discovering the technical qualities of the movie, read some one else.  I judge movies on a subjective level.  If I like it, the story appeals to me, the photography is good, the acting is better than a high school performance, it rates at least three stars.  To an extent this film meets those expectations.
Wm. Thackery is not one of my favorite authors.  However, if you are able to read I strongly suggest the three hours could be better spent reading the novel than watching this movie, but that is true of most movies based on fine literature.  The main character, Mr. Barry is a person of low class.  I use this designation not in the sense of his position in society, rather his position in hte human race.  Personally there is little to recomment this character to our sympathy or regard.  Beieuvung he's killed a man in a duel, Barry joins the army to escape jail.  He deserts from the British army, surpriseing as that may be, and is caprtures as a spy by the Prussians who force hism into the Prussian forces in the Seven Years War.  In further service to the Prussians he is sent to spy on an Irish resident in the service of the French, posing as a French nobleman.  These two men join forces and tour the continent as card sharks.  Barry realizes this is not to last forever and marries a lady of wealth.  He succeeds in wasting her fortune, is shot by his step=son in a duel, dies in poverty, etc.
Very gentle fun is poked at the civil society of Britain, and illustrated at how Barry moves up in society if not in goodness.  Considering the length of the movie, I would say the action moves well.  If you care to watch a movie where you care nothing what happens to the characters, where you demand a certain justice meted out to the wrong doers, you should enjoythis show.
