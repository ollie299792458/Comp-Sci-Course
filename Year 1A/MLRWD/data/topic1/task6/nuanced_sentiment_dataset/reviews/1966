A relatively decent series.
A little slow and aggravating at times.
The white woman divorced from a white cop
and married to his ex black partner is
generic. Is it just me or is it
less then enjoyable television to
watch 2 races slobbing all over each other?
It seems acceptable if Italians want to
keep marriage between Italians.
Irish between Irish...etc etc.
Yet when it comes to black and white
all of a sudden if you do not
embrace it and rejoice exceedingly
about it when it desired to have
Caucasian with Caucasian or Black
with Black...then your a racist bigot?
I think it is natural not to be
overly embracing of it. I think
this is natural and does not make
one a racist. I have many black
friends..good friends. I have never
seen a Blue Jay hooked up with
a Cardinal? Yet...if 2 people
choose to be with each other, that is
their decision..we will still be friends.
But I do not want to watch them slob all
over each other...nor do I want to
watch it on TV.
