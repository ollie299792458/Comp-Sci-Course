This is a powerhouse from one of the acting greats. She won gold for "Mildred Pierce", a good role, but Crawford gets to pull out all the stops here ... it's intense to behold, and at the same time, a nuanced performance. The story is a mesmerizing tragedy that seduces the viewer with a stark opening sequence that leaves us so curious; and the movie engages us even moreso with eventual flashbacks that keep us wanting to learn more and more, and to see what may happen. We have the antihero/protagonist, Louise, who is obsessed and possessed by an 'homme fatale' (Van Heflin in a rather unlikeable role as a callous fellow who makes you wonder why anyone could go cuckoo over the likes of him).

Some of this movie focuses on the mental issues that Louise Howell suffers and faces (there are doctors, medical terms thrown about, etc), but for me it was the plot and emotions that made this experience riveting: a romantic rejection leads to the main character's breakdown, and she seeps deeply into madness.

If you enjoy film noir, or mystery/thriller movies, this will readily and satisfactorily fit the bill. You'll be sure to get pulled into this lurid web. And you'll be treated to a showcase from one of the great ladies of classic cinema.
