I remembered watching a few episodes back when Christy aired on TV and enjoying it. I decided to buy the whole series since it was such a  reasonable price for 907 minutes worth of film in the collection! When I first started watching it I had to watch practically every episode in a row since I was so curious and interested in what happened next. I still am completely addicted and watch it over and over again. A true classic I would recommend to anyone. I think it's so great to actually be able to watch quality movies and television series that are garbage free. So much on television and the theater is not worth the time watching anymore. So if you are looking to expand your collection of movies/tv series collections that promote good morals and values, definitely consider this well developed mini series!

**Side Note: Now I am reading the Christy book which is EXCELLENT! I noticed there are several differences in the book as in the series; however I still find the book to be very interesting and intriguing! Both are good in their own way. I also purchased the 3 Christy movies: Return to Cutter Gap, A Change of Seasons, and A New Beginning. All are excellent, especially if you are curious to see a continuation of the mini series and good quality movies. Many of the characters are different, so it took some getting used to a different face and personality playing the parts.
