I've been watching this movie whenever it appears on TV for the last 30 years and it brings back floods of memories.

PROs:
American Missile crews conduct WW III against the communist U.S.S.R.
The Landmaster Vehicle (the most bad-ass vehicle until the "Dead Reckoning" from George Romero's Land of the Dead)
Mutant cockroaches attack
Playboy magazine centerfolds from the 70s (back when PG-rated films could show breasts)
Trippy 70s special effects (similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, when Bowman goes through the Stargate)
George Peppard (from the A-Team) gives a great performance
Jackie Earle Haley (the official 70s kid actor)
91 minutes (short for a quick watch--low commitment)

CONs:
Not realistic at all (hence a cult popcorn movie-must use suspension of disbelief)
  --The Landmaster would have ran out of fuel long before their destination
  --Gamma Rays & fallout from the nukes would have fried our travelers
Paul Winfield plays a whiney Security Forces hippy--cops don't spout off about peace and love...
The digital transfer has not been remastered & is in pretty poor shape (still best quality version I've seen)

Overall, I've been waiting years to add this one to my library and I'm happy to finally get it.  Highly recommended for missileers & Sci-Fi Fans.
