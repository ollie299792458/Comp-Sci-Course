What a treat to see "A Passage to India" on DVD! David Lean's final film hasn't looked this terrific since it was first shown in theaters in 1984. The colors are rich and vibrant and resonate with the texture of India. And, it's letterboxed!
The only thing missing is a digital 5.1 soundtrack. You'll have to make do with simple Dolby Surround, but the soundtrack is clean and full (and Maurice Jarre's score comes through beautifully). There aren't many extras either: a few trailers and eight minutes of tape from an interview with Lean.
"A Passage to India" is the story of Adele Quested's journey of discovery through the sensory (and sensual) delights of India. Lean loved India and it shows in every frame of this fascinating film. 
What really happens to Miss Quested in the Marabar caves? Who can say? As Mrs. Moore, Mis Quested's traveling companion says, "India forces one to come face-to-face with oneself. The results can be disturbing." That mystery is the core of the film.
Enjoy!
