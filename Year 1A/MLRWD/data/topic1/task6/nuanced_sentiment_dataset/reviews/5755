I live in China and Ip man is a pretty big thing here. It is a fantastic movie that, like fearless, captures the essence of Kung Fu. This makes fights turn into epic fights because everything has a purpose to it. It also accurately tells the story of Ip man. It really was a fantastic movie. However Ip man 2 just...is more holly wood and less story. Yes, the fights in the Ip man 2 are really cool and well choreographed, however, the story is just sub par at best. It talks Ip man, who wants to teach students his style of Kung Fu. However he is unable to get the respect of the other masters, therefore cannot open one. He does his thing and at the end of the film, has to fight a 'super' villain. The story just not very complex. This is a film for a friday night where you just want to see guys beat stuff up. Its great for relaxation but its sub par story sets it off. However, if you want to really see a full fight movie, watch Rocky, Ip man ONE or Fearless(Huo Yuan Jia). Sadly, Ip man 2 just does not live up to that standard.  I really would like to love this film, but it really..is just not in the same level as any of the other movies stated.  Its a classic sequel that disappoints the audience since it does not live up to its original standards.

Pretty cool movie with well Choreographed fights, however Average Story earns it a 3 ):
