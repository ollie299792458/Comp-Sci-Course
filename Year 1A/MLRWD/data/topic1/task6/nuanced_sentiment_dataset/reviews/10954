BUT......The main protagonist is so DUMB!

Okay first off...*SPOILERS*...

I have a very hard time believing that even after a little pot and a some alcohol, that you could fall alseep in a train station with an extremely loud train coming to a SCREECHING halt merely a few feet away. Plus the fact that nobody did a sweep of the station before locking it up for the night is also nonsense.

Then later on in the film she has "the creep" laying face down on the ground in front of her. (At the cage scene) She is holding a sharp weapon in her hands. Does she finish him off? Nope....she throws it down next to him and runs away which led to several more people dying later on...ugh!

With that being said, I loved the idea of being trapped below ground with a monster and I did like the "the Creep" as a villian. If you can look past the absolutely ridiculous plot and watch the film for what it is, then you may enjoy it. I did like the film overall, I just couldn't get past the reason she was down there in the first place and the extremely poor choices she made constantly throughout the entire film.

By the end of the film, I was rooting for The Creep...
