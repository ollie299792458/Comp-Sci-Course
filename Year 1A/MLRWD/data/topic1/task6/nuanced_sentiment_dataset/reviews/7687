I'll spoil the plot right now: Ethan commits suicide and we are supposed to be glad about it. A more compelling and believable outcome would have been for him to persevere despite his quadriplegia in the face of newfound love. THAT would have been a story worth sharing and one to inspire audiences. He could have gone back on radio to tell his new reason for holding on to life. He could have encouraged other quads to hold out hope for their own reasons to live. He could have been the mentor behind up-coming magicians. But most of all he could have embraced his longtime love who would have never considered his care a burden. This is what happens when non-Christians try to write what followers of Jesus would do and think. In fact, Christians hold that our God and Father creates and sustains our life and we are that not wise enough to decide when to end it. I would sell back my copy, but I don't want to perpetuate the foul message. (Conversely, I love the actors, the story telling, directing, music, and screenplay.)
