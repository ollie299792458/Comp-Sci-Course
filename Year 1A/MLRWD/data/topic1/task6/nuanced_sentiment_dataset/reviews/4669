Like the reviewer who said he couldn't stop laughing while viewing this ridiculous piece of low grade cinema, I, too, found myself laughing and saying out loud to no one in particular, "This is just plain stupid.  The effects are not even that great and not even halfway believable."

  The only thing that attracted me to this movie was the trailer, which, as it turns out, was the best part of the movie.

  Lines like, "There are more things to do with books than burning them" are just annoying and uncalled for and would make any lover of literature cringe, even under the circumstances that the books were being burned.  (To make a fire in a library fireplace to keep warm-whatever.)  When a guy is sifting through books to toast, he expresses his disapproval over the possible burning of a Nitzsche title.  But lo and behold, around the corner pops a guy who exclaims, "Hey, there's a whole section of tax books over here guys!" and away they go to add the IRS to the bonfire.

  I can't remember the last time I saw Dennis Quaid in anything I was glad I paid money to see, but witnessing Jake Gyllanhall struggle through this two hour mess just made me sad.  An actor with his potential, (re: The Good Girl) should not even be looking at scripts this bad.

  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.  It's the end of this movie, and I am glad.

  Do yourself a favor the next time you get a hankering to watch a disaster movie and rent something done by Irwin Allen in the seventies.  At least his stuff kept you at the edge of your seat.  I watched this mind numbing yawnfest over three days time and still couldn't stay focused.  Not how a disaster film should make me feel.  Two thumbs down and one nose up.  Avoid this movie.
