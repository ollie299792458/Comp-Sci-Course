This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it is still very stirring.

I just saw an outdoor, singalong presentation on a perfectly hot and sweaty July night in Brooklyn, New York. The WSS-heads were out in force and there weren't many dry eyes in the house by the end. Kinda cool when you're snapping your fingers or calling out "Mambo!" and "Krup You!" along with a thousand or so Friends.

The story and songs are timeless and beautiful. Bernstein's score is a gem, as is the choreography. I also get a kick out of seeing late 50's New York, though I have to admit most of those Broadway dancing / "gang members" wouldn't last very long on the streets nowadays!

My only problem now is that I just realized a DVD I picked up a few years ago is a horrible "Full screen" formatted version, and it looks pretty awful on my 46" HDTV. But coincidentally, Amazon just sent an email announcing the 50th anniversary blu-ray pre-release.

Thanks Daddy-O!
