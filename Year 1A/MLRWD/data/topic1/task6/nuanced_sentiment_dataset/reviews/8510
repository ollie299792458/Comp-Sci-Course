Along with the scandal-ridden career of Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, the mayor of Providence, the Von Bulow case was, and probably remains, a popular topic of conversation in Rhode Island. Barbet Schroeder gives a mesmering look at a dark chapter in the history of Newport, Rhode Island with exceptional performances from Jeremy Irons and Ron Silver. Iron portrays Claus Von Bulow with the right mix of elegance and sleaziness thrown in, letting us know that he is not quite the man he seems to be (Indeed, Von Bulow had married far above his station when he wed Sunny - Glenn Close in the film; there are many who still believe that he deliberately tried to poison her for her wealth.). Fellow Stuyvesant High School alumnus Ron Silver is magnificient as Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz; although he doesn't quite resemble Dershowitz, he does a remarkable portrayal of the latter's personality, judging from what I have seen of Dershowitz during his conversations with television talk show hosts Larry King and Ted Koppel. This splendid film is both a first rate thriller and a revealing look at how rewarding justice can be for those who are wealthy. Without a doubt, it is one of the finest dramatizations of a celebrated criminal case ever filmed.
