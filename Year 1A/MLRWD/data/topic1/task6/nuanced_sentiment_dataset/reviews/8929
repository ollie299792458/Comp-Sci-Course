Long thought lost,(because suppposedly all prints and negatives were destroyed when a version of the Ghoul was re-made as the 1962 horror comedy No Place Like Homicide) M.G.M. has released a version of the Ghoul that looks as good as the day it was filmed! For years the only available way to see the Ghoul was on an awful looking transfer made from what looked like a third generation dupe on VHS without main titles and severely edited. I saw the un-impressive cover art online and thought "What the heck, it can't be worse then that vhs video". What a pleasantly AMAZING surprise. A crisp, clean unblemised picture awaited me! I would think that someone at M.G.M. home video would have mentioned that this new, pristine source transfer was being made available for the first time on their new DVD version!. Would love to be hired by M.G.M. Home Video to make sure that truly rare films were made known to the public. I cannot recommend the GHOUL enough to fellow Horror Film/Karloff fans. John
