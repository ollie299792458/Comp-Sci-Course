This movie is now my favorite movie of ALL time.  I heard from lots of people that this movie is quite amazing and that I have to see this movie.  So I put it off for a while renting it from my local Blockbuster but then one night after dinner, I was scrolling through my digital cable guide list and then I saw "October Sky" coming on at 8:00 and so I decided to sit down and watch the movie...I must say, from the moment the opening credits first appeared I was glued to the TV, I couldn't stop watching it!

It is truly a touching and heart-wrenching story that leaves you amazed on how we can achieve our goals with the effort that we put out to them if we truly want to meet them.

The story is about a young man named Homer Hickam who is inspired and intrigued in rocketry and decides that he is going to build a rocket.  Before you know it, the whole town, which is Coalwood, starts making fun of him with the exception of a few people, which are his mother, a few of his friends, and some people that work in the mine at Coalwood.

The main idea and theme of the story is dreams can be achieved no matter what anybody thinks.

Once I was finished watching this movie, I immediately ordered it.  Everytime I watch it, I never turn it off and continue it later.  It will leave you touched after everytime you watch it.

I encourage you to purchase this movie, you will not be disappointed.
