this is not your typical love story but it is pretty close to how love stories are. It is basically a boy meets girl story, except the boy is a musician who drinks too much and has too many issues to be in any relationship. The girl is a mother who has a child and in persuit of a story, she is a small time reporter, she get involved with the boy. Love sorts happens but remember there is a kid and no matter how good the sex kids and drunks are not a good mix. I mean he does not abuse the kid but he does let her wander off and has to get the police searching for her. The mother was none too happy about this.But she allowed him to watch the kid while she did what she needed to do, so I feel she is as responsible as he is. End of story the kid is found the mother realizes what she should have known from the start, she dumps the boy. they both go on with their life and she finds another boy who she says is good. all well that ends well??????? Any way I loved the movie maybe because it is sorta my story. and the music is great and the actors do a really good job.What is it about these musicians that turn a sensible girls head to mush.
