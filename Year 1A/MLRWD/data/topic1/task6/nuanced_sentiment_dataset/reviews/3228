I've seen many a bad movie over the years, but this one is close to the top (or rather, the bottom) of the list. I'd been looking for a silly but well-done R-Rated comedy. But you won't find it here. Head-cracking (literally) slapstick without the choreographed comedy of Laurel and Hardy; a script that's full of amateurish sexual and scatalogical obscenity that made it hard even for me to watch; and...well, I don't ask for a well-crafted "plot" or artistry if a film offers at least a good laugh or titillating entertainment. But--I'm sorry--"Miss March" offers neither. The "jokes" would appeal only to immature, dysfunctional adolescents (like the sub-hero) who need counseling. The "R-Rated" scenes are mostly disgusting rather than sexy. At the end, a Hefneresque character (or was it the real "Hef," in a cameo appearance? I don't know) advises the loser-friend on how to get what he wants from a woman. Great stuff, eh? Since the "film" is rated "R" and is therefore not suitable for viewers under 18, I strongly recommend that responsible parents show it to their teenaged sons (and daughters), see where the boys laugh and hit PAUSE to take time to discuss what they think is so funny--and require a coherent answer before hitting the PLAY button to continue again. It might be a "teachable moment."
