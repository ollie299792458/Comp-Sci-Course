I watched this for the first time late last night after reading all the glowing reviews. I wasn't disappointed but I was terrified! Afterwards I had to go to the bathroom at around 4am and this meant I had to pass the attic...

The scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face. It's more unnerving than it is frightening and the film is paced somewhat slowly. If you prefer horror films with alot of action, you best look somewhere else. Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in bright exuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. In this regard it reminds me very much of Dario Argento's horror masterpiece "Suspiria". It's a beautiful looking film. The atmosphere is also second to none and the first person view from the killer only compliments this.

There are moments where you have to suspend belief, I won't mention them as they are probable spoilers, but one I can is the cops didn't even think to check the attic out near the end. Or the rest of the house for that matter. They would inevitably have come back, but despite being certain they had the killer, they left a traumatised young woman on her own!

The director himself later admitted he would have preferred to have dropped the open ending, and I would normally tend to agree. I usually hate open ended films and would much rather know the who, what and why. However, in this film it works. You will be left thinking about it for days and I imagine it will remain in your mind alot longer than if we knew everything.

On a side note, I'm 22 now but I wish I was born in the 50s so I could have asked Olivia Hussey (Jessica Bradford) out! She looks stunning in this movie.

4.5 stars.
