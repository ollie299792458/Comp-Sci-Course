I was living in Los Angeles and I remember the HUGE billboards going up all over town prior to the movie's release.  Even before it was released, everyone was panning the film.  Too many people listen to critics...  I look at it this way:  If someone is a movie critic, they are an actor, director, screenwriter, etc. who has failed.  Ditto for music critics - they wanted to be composers, musicians, recording artists, and failed.  I went to see this movie and laughed till I couldn't breathe.  I picked it up on VHS years ago and will purchase it on DVD as well.  It was a modern take on the various 'screwball comedies' of the 50's and 60's.  The characters are hysterical even if they [and some of the script] is a tad predictable.  There are inconsistencies in the film, such as the story taking place in New York, but when they go to a hospital, it is the hospital in Woodland Hills, CA.  [they COULD have put up a fake sign while filming], and other 'mistakes' that a trained eye can catch during the film.  But overall, Griffin Dunne and Madonna work well together and there are so many quotable lines in the movie that after all these years - I remember and still laugh at.

Highly recommended for an irreverent, laugh-filled viewing.
