I really was looking forward to this film having seen Tony Leung in "The Lover" and usually appreciating almost any film rated NC-17, but this film fails on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin.

First, it's L-O-N-G! Far too long!  At 158 minutes, a good 30-45 mins could/should have been left on the cutting room floor. There are SEVERAL scenes (including many of the sex scenes) that do nothing to further the story.  And speaking of the story, the plot is contrived and hackneyed; beautiful spy for the resistance supposedly falls in love with the subject she's trying to ensnare. And he, likewise, supposedly falls in love with her.

I use the term "supposedly" since, while I may be a hopeless romatic, I find it totally unbelievable that a supposedly intelligent girl could fall in love with someone who routinely brutalizes her and bascially thinks of her as nothing more than a plaything and then could also save his life just as the resistance is going to assasinate him. Then, I also find it completely beyond the realm of comprehension how a man who is supposedly in love with a girl who gives him all the sex he wants and saves his life, could turn around have the same girl cruelly and brutally executed!

The performance of Tony Leung is Terrible!  He might as well be a stick. He shows no emotion other than brutality and hate. This is a far cry from his thoughtful and touching performance in "The Lover". It is completely inconceivable how ANYONE could fall in love with this character.

The ONLY bright spot in the entire film is Chiu Wai as the resistance spy. She tries her best to make her character believable and in most spots she succeeds, except when asked to do something totally incomprehensible; like falling in love with the despot and saving his life. She plays a college freshman and a refined Chinese matron with equial aplomb.

But bottom line, even the sex scenes are not enough to save this film. It's a total waste of 2 1/2  hours.
