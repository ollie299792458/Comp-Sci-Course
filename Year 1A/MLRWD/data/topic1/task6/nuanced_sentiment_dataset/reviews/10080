This is an really good movie that presents the argument very well, although I'm not sure how fairly. The emphasis is on the drama and conflict that the issue creates, there is very little representation of the pros or cons of cochlear implants. It is also very binary: it assumes that there are only 2 answers to the question, it doesn't consider the benefits of being part of both hearing and deaf cultures, and having both abilities; hearing and signing.  There is too much emphasis on being one or the other, rather than on coming together and learning about and appreciating each other.

The deaf man in the film, Peter (if I remember his name correctly), even though he is vehemently against the implant, clearly outlines some of the real reasons to have a cochlear implant: mainly related communication with the hearing world. (Discrimination, dependence on e-mails and interpreters, selfishness, the corporate glass ceiling.) It's not that deaf people cannot be successful, it's that an implant may provide more opportunities for more success. He comes across as very proud, stubborn and selfish, and doesn't really consider all the elements of the issue. Much of the cochlear implant issues could be resolved by allowing and encouraging both cultures for the implant recipient and being inclusive, rather than exclusive.

Incidentally, although I work with deaf people and ASL students, I can hear, so this review might be biased, even though I have tried very hard not to be.
