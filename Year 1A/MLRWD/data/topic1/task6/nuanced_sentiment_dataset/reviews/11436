Ok, nuff of the whining here about this "movie" being anti-Jesus or pro-Jesus.

Who cares?

It's a fairly well crafted "Hollywood" movie.

In defense of this film, one reviewer wrote that this film was shot on a shoestring budget.

Uh, no.

This movie was very well hyped and much was poured into both production and publicity. Millions, in fact.

A number of indie films have tackled the same subject with far more interesting results, the most 'famous' of which is  Pasolini's "Gospel according to St. Matthew".

Such films never even got an iota of recognition that "Last' got because they didn't have the money supplied by the Hollywood machine to back them up, and thus, sank without a trace.

Last Temptation, unlike 'Matthew' is a slick attempt by a Hollywood producer to show just how daring, controversial and cutting edge Hollywood can be.

The Hollywood factory is neither daring nor cutting edge.

If Christ existed, he was more than likely an unkempt, dirty heathen and probably had manners that we would not be comfortable with and would find uncouth.

In short, Christ would have been an outsider.

The 'Matthew' film is the closest I have seen to truly portraying just that and it took an outsider, indie filmmaker to show Christ as an outsider.

Scorsese and Gibson are sell out Hollywood whores who have hypocritically tackled the subject matter of a 'contrary' spirit.
