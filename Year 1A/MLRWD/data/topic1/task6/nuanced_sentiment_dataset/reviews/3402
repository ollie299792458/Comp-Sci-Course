Title says it all, the choreographed fight scenes between Beckinsale and Farrel were delicious. I always wanted to see more of Sharon Stone in the original, and hello 21st century, a villainous girl can beat the hero's butt in these movies now. Having said that, It was just unbelievable that Farrel could kill a room full of guards but couldn't even bruise his wife. I will be buying this on dvd (huge Beckinsale fan here) but I honestly prefer the original with Arnold.Time may have produced a sleeker remake, but the plot of the original was simply better. It made more sense.  I loved the Mars angle of the original, it gave purpose to the elaborate deception of erasing Quaid's memory. I could see the value of introducing oxygen to Mars and why people would risk their lives for it. In this remake, I just do not understand anyone's motivation. What did the villain want? just to install an army of robots? Why erase Quaid's memory? They should have guessed where the resistance leader would be hiding, I did. It proved completely anti-climactic unlike the excellent special effects used to explain why the original resistance leader was so hard to find. I missed the elaborate makeup of the original mutants, even the effort to fool quaid into thinking he was still at recall was more believable in the original movie. As for special effects, Arnold and the gang didn't do such a bad job back in the day. Yes I know this is a retelling, not an exact replica, But aside from the sleek effects the original is just better as far as I am concerned. Good try though!
