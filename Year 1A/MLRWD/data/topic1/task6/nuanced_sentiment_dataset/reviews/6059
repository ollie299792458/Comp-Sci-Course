Unfunny, uninspired, and insipid. _Old School_ lacks creativity, wit, and doesn't even have the wherewithal to try to charm us with a sense of its own stupidity. I was expecting a dumb, fun, profane movie. What I got was often cynical, boring, and tame. 
Who are these characters? Is Luke Wilson's character supposed to be funny? No? And if he's the straight man, why is he so totally unsympathetic? From the very first scene, where he ditches his friends and leaves them holding the bag, to the end, am I supposed to care what happens to this guy? He sleeps with a 16-year-old, the bosses' daughter, and--nothing happens. There are no consequences, and certainly nothing funny is done with the (tired) situation. And what's with Vince Vaughn's character? Why does the movie go to such lengths to showcase him as a loyal father and faithful husband, but one who can't stop bad-mouthing marriage? Is there anything funny in that? 
The movie's listless, it has no energy, no spirit of fun. Tonally, it plays half-serious. Even Will Ferrell--who couldn't be unfunny if he tried--is unfunny here. An old man nobody cares about dies, his heart giving out before he has the opportunity to grope two naked co-eds slathered in K-Y jelly. We see the funeral, and the movie again goes to considerable lengths to show us that the old guy was a war veteran, even a war hero. How are we supposed to feel about that? What is it with the dark overtones in this movie? Is it funny that he was a veteran? Ferrell sings "Dust in the Wind"--poorly--over the flag-draped coffin, and the scene's over. What's the joke? How are we supposed to feel when Will Ferrell's wife dumps him? Happy? Are we supposed to laugh?
Don't waste your time, or your money. Go buy or rent "Airplane" or even "Airplane 2," instead.
