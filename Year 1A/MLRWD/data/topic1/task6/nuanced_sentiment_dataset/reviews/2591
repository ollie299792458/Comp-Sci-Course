First of all, I love the movie and have long wanted to have it on DVD. The quality of the DVD seems fine to me, but it is clear someone did not take the time to consider the subtitle treatment. You can view the movie either with a French or English audio track, but in both cases you have to look at subtitles in English: you have no option to turn the subtitles off. Yes, you're reading this right: the English audio track option includes subtitles for the French translation of the English! A large portion of the reason I enjoy animated features is, not surprisingly, for the animation, and the white wording at the bottom of the screen is annoying and distracting; moreover, it wrecks the lower portion of the movie visually. I have the English version on VHS, without subtitles. Until this DVD is redone, that's the version I'll be watching. Because I speak French, I also want to be able to watch this movie in French without subtitles! I've never encountered a film moved to DVD with a treatment this inept.
