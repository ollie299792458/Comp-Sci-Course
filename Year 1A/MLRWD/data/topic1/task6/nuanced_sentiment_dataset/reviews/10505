DJANGO has a wonderfully gritty feel to it. It and other Italian westerns of it's time (e.g., "The Dollars Trilogy") had an enormous effect on American cinema -- first in the Western genre (even the later John Wayne  films drew from the Italian West) and then branching into mainstream  affairs. Though the character of the antihero, so popular in the spaghetti  westerns, had long existed in American film, he lived (and usually died) in  the crime noir genre almost exclusively. Until Italy made its mark,  westerns were inhabited by absolutes: good guys wore white and bad guys  wore black. But if something as pure as the good old fashioned western  could be polluted by the noirish antihero elements, so could (and would)  all other genres. And so it went.
Franco Nero, as the title character,  Django, fulfills perfectly the classic spaghetti western role (as did  Eastwood in his own projects). He is the unstoppable, immoral, gunfighter  whose only weakness is his conscience. Seemingly indefatigable, he falters  only slightly when his heart is touched, and is undone -- only to return to  conquer all his opposition. Eastwood follows the identical path in FISTFULL  OF DOLLARS. 
All told, DJANGO is a fun and entertaining, though not light  and inconsequential, glance back to the beginnings of the modern western.  My only real complaint with the DVD release is the lack of option  concerning subtitles and the original-language track. Especially after the  packaging material laments the poor English-language dubbing, I would've  been excited to hear the original track (with English subs, of course!).
