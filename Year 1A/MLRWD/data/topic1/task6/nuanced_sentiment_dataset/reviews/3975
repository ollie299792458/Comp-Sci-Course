I'm a sucker for any and all animation in BD format and sa a review on a credible web site so I took a chance on a Blind Buy like I've done before. While the actual look of the film in BD format is really impressive the story with the characters seems to be out of place. Two of the main characters look as if they came from different films . One is Gwizdo who looks somewhat proportional being a animated character while his companion Lian-Chu looks as if he came from the film Igor with a tiny head, thoothpick legs but arms and upper torso out of Hulk. The two embark on something like a traveling sideshow of glory conquering Dragons wioth Lian doing the work and Gwizdo thinking of riches.

their "talents" are sought and found by Zoe, a neice to a cold stuborn King whose kingdom is threaten by the King of Dragons; World Globbler. The very same one who destroyed Liams village when he was a child. From there it's a adventure of abck and forth between the three ending with a final battle. There's not allot of side stories or characters except hector a Rabbit/Dog something that tags along as a friend and sideshow...no idea why?

The film and sound is really something though. The overall look is really impressive throughout and the sound does shine on several scenes. But I kept looking at the central character, Liam and his figure and it just doesn't fit. Throw in a massive world with floating cities of rock and a Kingdom that has three habinats = does not compute?
