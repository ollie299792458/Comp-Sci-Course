"Dog Day Afternoon" has aged well.  It puts us into its millieu, it puts us in touch with its characters, and like John Ford it does not call attention to its direction. (With the exception of its use of sound effects to do the work of a music track--and that's just fine).  This is 1970s colors and despite the thought that when it was releasted, Lumet was criticized for a lack of sense of place within its frame (in contrast to Hitchcock who carefully gives the audience a geography lesson), we are in the place with the characters. Even as we know they are actors, we come to believe their reality.  Lumet reflects the unique nature of NYC and Brooklyn in a time and place when the fact that a bank robber was "gay" was not just a freak event, but an anthem shouting gay people cannot be steroetyped. A bank robber could be masculine, an hostage taker and gay.  At a time when the New York Times avoided the word "gay," on radio a homosexual was a reality check. Gay people exist, all over. Viva the lifestyle!

Notice how well Lumet keeps the set getting dingy over time.  It is nice, as is the lighting which goes from flourescent harshness to cold night.

Almost 50 years after Stonewall, almost 40 years after its release, "Dog Day Afternoon" brings us deftly back and presents a narrative more compelling than it seemed wehn first released.
