I didn't expect this movie to be that great. I enjoyed this flick surprisingly. It's not the greatest I've ever seen but seeing the directions the movie took was fun, and I was at least interested in the overall story.
There were problems with this movie, it goes on for too long for one thing and had me uninterested in many parts in the movie. Ben Chaplin also seems kind of uncomfortable here. I don't like him as an actor. He [tried] in Birthday Girl and didn't enjoy his performance here either. At times the movie just didn't take the right direction but I can't quite remember as I finished the DVD a while ago.
I really liked Sandra Bullock here, she goes against type for once and it works. She gives a strong performance. Not as strong as the two teenagers (Michael Pitt off Dawson's Creek is especially impressive) who practically made this movie for me. They were brilliant - I see big stars ahead. I loved the conclusion of the movie and the way it unraviled and nothing was as it seemed.
Better than your average by-the-numbers thriller, but not overwhelming or anything.
