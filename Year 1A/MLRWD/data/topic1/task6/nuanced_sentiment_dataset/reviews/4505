The premise looked like it had some promise, but I ultimately destroyed the DVD after I watched it b/c I thought it was so unpleasant and implausible.  (I usually have a high tolerance for films compared to my friends.)

The more I considered this film, the less I liked it.  Seemed as if there was some sadism and internalized homophobia involved in the screenwriter's mind.

The film focuses on the "relationship" between a very messed up teen hustler who has a nasty drug habit and very few morals and his fawning teen hanger-on (NOT a friend in any real sense).  They basically hang out together, do drugs, develop no intimacy, oh and there's a nasty rape scene that is patently offensive.  It paints a pretty nasty view of gay life when positive views are both more representative and functional for people to watch.

It's hard to imagine NOT being offended (and not in a thought-provoking way, either) by this film.  It was poorly written, not very interesting to watch, and not sexy.  Usually if I thought a film was ok, I'll keep it or give it away.  This I destroyed b/c I did't want to abet the sentiments expressed therein.

With films like this who needs the Religious Right to persecute us?
