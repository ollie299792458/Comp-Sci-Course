Of all the free spirit liberal rebel vs. hidebound conservative straw dog movies that Hollywood has churned out in the past decade, this is without doubt the most shameless. Director Lasse Hallstrom has fallen a long way from his "My Life as a Dog" triumph and has now been typecast as the guy to call when you need a heart-string tugging period piece. 
Here the setting and period is an uptight French village in 1959. Vianne Rochon (Juliette Binoche) comes to town to melt their frozen hearts with gourmet chocolates it would have taken a small army to make. She meets a predictable array of allies and enemies before a predictable crisis is raised and resolved.
So what's worth sampling here? I liked the chemistry between Binoche and Johnny Depp, who played a gypsy troubadour. I also liked that the villian Reynaud (Alfred Molina) was more than a one-dimensional lout. 
All in all, the film is sort of like a cartoon for grown-ups.
The film I think was hurt more than helped by the oscar nominiation for best picture. It never stood a chance of winning, yet took heat from everyone whose favorite didn't get the nod.
