Okay, so it will never make a list of the 20 greatest Westerns ever.  The problem is, so will a lot of other entertaining movies like the more light-hearted Texas Across the River.  On the other hand with the loss of a great star for many of us who admired him there doesn't seem to be enough Dean Martin movies out there.  In Five Card Stud you also get to see quite a lot of the lovely Inger Stevens, who passed much to soon, and Mitchum being as menancing as he could obviously be.  What the earlier viewers missed was the enjoyable byplay between Martin and Stevens in her "barber shop".  Or perhaps the shear delight of seeing Mitchum sing hymns and preach the gospel, his gospel anyway.  Enjoy the movie and remember when Poker was an all night process where you bet the cards and not a media event like Texas Hold'em has become.  It may suffer what earlier critics have laid on it, but on the other hand, if you want to sit around some rainy afternoon and enjoy it, you might get more than you expected.  I wonder if she really did meet him in Denver?
