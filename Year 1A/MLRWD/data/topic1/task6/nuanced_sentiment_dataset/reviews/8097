Since I was a kid I'd see this movie box ,it's title never appealed to me.Then(at 27 yrs. old)I had wathced just about everything there was too see. I picked up this movie and decided to give it a shot.I never really liked classic movies, luckily this one was in color. I put it  in while I was still running around the house (distracted), then came this tune (moonriver)which made me stop what I was doing I suddenly felt so happy and sad at the same time.I sat down and instantly fell in love with Audrey.Her face,her waist,her stucture-so beautiful,elegant.It was so  natural,graceful.Grace is something that you are either born with or  not-you can't act it.

I'm not sure I would  classify this movie as a romantic comedy.Some may consider this movie as "campy". In my opinion this movie has a realness that no movie to date has ever had.  
The point is that no movie has ever made me feel the way  this film has (good all over) + need to review it .I have never felt the need to opiniate myself to thousands primarily because I'm not a reviewer.
This movie is over 40 yrs. old.It's situations and subject matter are far ahead of it's day.
This movie is basically about a scared girl who on the outside party's, "dates men", and lives by the moment.Like all of us(well atleast like me) in the end comes to find out that eventually  it's time to settle down.Despite being a guy this movie made me take a good look at myself for what I am/am not, of what I got/don't got at 27.
This is why I have a problem calling this work a romantic comedy or some  "campy"work. This movie is about finding yourself.It sure hit home with me.I classify this movie as being real.
