It doesn't follow the books, or so my daughter says. I've never read the books and am only judging the movie apart from the books. The movie is amazing to watch. The computer animation is so real, beautiful and at times disturbing. This movie is not just for kids. But, the battle scenes aren't for the young kids. My 11 and 12 year olds watch this. I wouldn't recommend going too much younger unless they're really desensitized to violence already, which isn't recommended because we should protect the minds of the very young so that they're not exposed to ideas that they're not ready to handle. While there was no blood or gore, there are slashing enemies throats, birds falling hard on the ground, one bird falls in the fire and stuff like that. It's done tastefully, but just be warned. War is violent, and it is not sugar coated very much. Evil birds try to take over and their idea is that the strong rule the weak. The theme of the movie is fight evil, mend the broken and strengthen the weak. Overall, a great moral story with fantastic visuals and interesting characters. I'm very impressed.
