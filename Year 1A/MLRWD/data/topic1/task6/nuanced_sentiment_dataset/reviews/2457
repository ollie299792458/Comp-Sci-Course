Inland Empire

This was probably the 2nd or 3rd DL movie that I had seen so far, I knew after seeing "mulholland"  and also reading the IE synopsis that I was going to be in for a nightmare where you don't know what's gonna happen and above all feeling scared and unsettled. When I read the synopsis for IE I thought this movie should be easier to follow then MD, how wrong I was, by the time act 1 was over I was like "what the hell?", (mind you at this point i still hadn't become familiar with DL's style). Inland Empire is hard to digest at first, even on 2nd viewing but once you have learnt that this movie doesn't spell out the story for ya, that's when watching this movie becomes an entertaining joyride, the idea is not to feel you have to be in control by trying to find the story in this movie, the idea is to just let yourself go. If you can work out what the story of is, yay, yippee! but if you can't, doesn't matter, just the emotional turmoil that this movie puts you through is enough to thrill the heart.

More things that happened

This is basically a 90 min movie of all the deleted scenes in IE. I read that these deleted scenes delve deeper into what IE is about, this is true because when I watched "more things" I found myself understanding IE a little better but only a little :), there's one scene in "more things" that is kind of boring, just as well it didn't make the final cut. Other than that I recommend that you watch MTTH.

As for the rest of the special features, Ballerina, Lynch 2, Quinoa and Stories, these are all fun to watch. You get see DL at work and also what he had to do when making IL, my fav is Lynch 2, I would suggest you watch Lynch 1 first which is on the region 4 version.
