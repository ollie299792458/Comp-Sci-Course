THIS SET STINKS. DON'T BOTHER. There was no way to rate this with negative stars or I would have, until the space ran out!!! Once again these films have been issued and once again they have been mastered from dirty, visibly deteriorated copies with washed-out colors and ugly edits. The films are not presented widescreen, which would be alright for some of them ("King of the Monsters" and "Rodan" were not shot in widescreen in the first place) but again, there has been no clean-up, no restoration here in any way shape or form and obviously no footwork put into hunting down fresh prints from Toho (who confusingly gave this set their "OkeeDoke" - Why doesn't Toho CARE about this sort of thing???). It's unforgivable how poorly this material has been treated YET AGAIN and I wish I could return my copies to the company ...THEY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED BUT I'M SURE THEY DON'T CARE. If you're a fan of this genre or just a monster movie fan, please, PLEASE don't bother with this. Even the copy of "Rodan" looks washed out and trashed, and that was the set's centerpiece for cryin' out-loud!!!
