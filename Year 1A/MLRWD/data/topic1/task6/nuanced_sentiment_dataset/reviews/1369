I'm embarrassed to say I lasted as long as 25 minutes into this film, which has nothing to recommend it besides the predictably infantile wow factor of watching a dried up old lady (the rest of this description has been censored by Amazon). Believe me, my description is far funnier and more titillating than the dramatization of it, which could compete with any frat house cartoon sex dream. The director's style, or absence of it, harks back about 60 years, sort of like TV in 1962; the color and cinematography is amazingly garish and awful, the story is random and virtually nonexistent, the acting shameful and workaday, the writing sophomoronic, dishonest, manipulative and sexist. I've seen pornographic films made with much higher production values, acting and writing. Who conceived of this crap? This film is an open insult to women masquerading as comedy - much as the Republican Party portrays women's troubles - as well as to medicine, to the Brits, and to history (it's based on some interesting "facts" in the medical treatment of sexuality). If it weren't such inconsequential, incompetent trash, it would be picketed. Please don't think I was offended by the content. It is the film's completely dishonest, titillating, pandering treatment of it that is offensive.
