First off, the music is outstanding.  Many of the songs were written by Adam Schlesinger (my apologies for possibly butchering the spelling of his last name) from the great rock band Fountains of Wayne.  The satire of 80's bands (particularly Wham!) was generally well-done, although I felt there was a lot more they could have done with it.  The opening faux "music video" for Pop Goes My Heart was hilarious.  Hugh Grant does his usual witty British guy shtick, which I did enjoy for the most part.  Drew Barrymore...well...seemed to be trying to channel Annie Hall era Diane Keaton but I'm not sure that she's a good enough actress to really pull that off.  Having said that, I suppose the romantic story line was decent enough...nothing outstanding, just kind of routine, "seen it before", to be honest.  There were some good supporting actors (Brad Garrett is always appreciated) and the story moved along at a nice pace, but going back to my original point, 80's synth/pop music is just RIPE for satire/homage and I was hoping for so much more from this movie.  Maybe someday someone will do a "Spinal Tap" type send-up of 80's music, but that wasn't this movie.  Oh well.  A pleasant rental, for me.....
