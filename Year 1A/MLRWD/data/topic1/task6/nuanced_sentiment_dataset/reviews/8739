I will never buy a kids movie based on the cover again!  How could you go wrong with such a cute little puppy peeking out of Santa's backpack right?  Well, what a terrible movie! My daughter cried on and off the entire movie, and my son kept talking about ways he wanted to hurt the mean people in the movie - that's the Christmas Spirit Disney!  Here are some highlights: Santa gets hit by a car, suffers from amnesia, and at the end is in critical condition in the hospital and they tell the little girl he probably won't make it.  Then the wicked woman who runs the orphanage yells and screams at little girls, does not allow them to sing, have toys, or celebrate Christmas, and punishes them by putting them in the cold dark basement overnight.  I have to say the part that really crossed the line was the cute little "paws" losing his "life force" and turning into a pretty scary looking stuffed stuffed dog that gets thrown into an incinerator by the wicked woman.  There are flames lapping all around the dog.  The little girl crawls into the incinerator, onto the conveyor belt, to rescue the dog from the flames that are lapping at his face.  Due to the subject matter, and kids not being able to understand that "it's just a movie," I would say kids need to be at least first graders to watch this.  Disney, you really dropped the ball with this Christmas Flick!
