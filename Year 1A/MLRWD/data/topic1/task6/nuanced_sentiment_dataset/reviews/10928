Maybe I missed something, but I didn't notice a single reviewer point out the most obvious flaw in this movie: ALL worker bees are FEMALE, not male. Male bees are drones who DO NOT fly away from the hive to collect nectar or pollen. ONLY female worker bees do that. Drones stay in the hive and are fed and cared for by FEMALE worker bees, who also do all the other work in and out of the hive. The male drones' sole--ie, ONLY--function in life is to fly into the air and mate with new queens, after which they die. The only way this bizarre tale could have worked would be for a FEMALE worker bee to play the Seinfeld character, fall in love with a MALE human, then discover how humans are exploiting bees. This is what happens when story and screenplay writers and directors and studio personnel fail to do their homework. It's called research, folks, and it's essential to avoiding ludicrous situations like having MALE worker bees! Maybe Seinfeld could have played a real MALE person and Renee Zellweger could have played a real FEMALE worker bee who fell in love with him. Despite the other obvious flaws in this film, and they are many, at least the movie would have been biologically and scientifically correct.
