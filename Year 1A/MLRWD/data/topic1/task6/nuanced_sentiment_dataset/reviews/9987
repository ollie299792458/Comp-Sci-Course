Having seen just about every film Mamet has to offer, one goes into this with fairly high expectations. The three stars might be as much a symptom of that as any flaws the film has. There are plenty of bright spots here - David Paymer shows his evil side (remember him as the "Hello" guy in Crazy People?) perfectly, while Hoffman as usual seems to get to the essence of the person he is portraying. Maybe not as convincingly as in Boogie Nights, but close. Rebecca Pidgeon is always well-used in Mamet's films and I am always amazed that he can handle putting her into intimate situations. But I digress.
The biggest problems with Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are not their performances but the fact that they are not well-developed and stay in a 2-dimensional periphery throughout the film. This is surprising, considering the impact Baldwin made in Glengarry despite such little screen-time. Macy unfortunately is the most inadequately drawn character despite possibly having the most screentime. He resembles a chicken with his head cut off (ala Billy Crystal in his terrible new movie) and never makes himself the sympathetic rogue he could have been.
All in all, there are some very funny moments and it is worth seeing, but you won't be in any hurry to watch it again.
