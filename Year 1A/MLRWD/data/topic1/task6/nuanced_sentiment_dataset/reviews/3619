I love Formula One and racing in general, this is why I bought the DVD. But let me tell you ... this movie is an insult to every racing fan in the world. The actors are third-class, the FX are terrible, the background music is laughable, and to top it all : the plot of the movie is just horrible. This looks like a Baywatch episode on wheels (at least they have good looking babes on bikinis running around !).
I heard Sylvester tried to do this movie about Formula One but at the end could not get to an agreement with F1 owner Bernie Ecclestone over differences on the plot of the movie and money matters. Then Mr. stallone returned to the States and had to settle for CART. I was pretty upset at Mr. Ecclestone for not allowing this project to become a reality, but now that I have seen the movie I would like to thank and show my admiration to Bernie on taking this wise choice. Please save your money and forget this movie was ever made, let's just wait that someone has the brains and the balls to make a decent racing movie, the sport deserves it, the fans deserve it !
