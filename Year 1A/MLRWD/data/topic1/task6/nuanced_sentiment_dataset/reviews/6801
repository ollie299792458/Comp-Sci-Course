Sleepaway Camp is first and foremost, another summer camp slasher film.  A very popular slasher subgenre originated with the 1980 classic Friday the 13th.  Angela and Ricky are young teenagers off to camp Arawak for the summer, Ricky the likable popular type, and Angela, the quiet and  'different' type.  When all kinds of scuzzy camp regulars begin to give  Angela a hard time, they start dying rather brutally...much to the dismay  of the camp's burnt out owner Mel (Mike Kellin).  Sleepaway Camp is a  slasher film, however, it goes a bit deeper than that, what gives Sleepaway  Camp its distinction, is the bizarre homosexual themes running throughout  the film.  Why they are there are anybody's guess,but from the strange  transvestite (?) Aunt Martha, to Angela's gay father, the truly shocking  and disturbing final shot and more, Sleepaway Camp is sick, grisily,  twisted, yet always fascinating.  Of course, its not always great, many  scenes in this film are just laughable, like the melodramatic boating  accident at the film's start, or the character that wears a shirt with her  name on it, and even the scenes with Chef Artie, the local camp sleazeball.  Sleepaway Camp however, always manages to be charming, despite its warped  themes and lurid subject matter, this one certainly isn't for everybody,  but those with a taste for something not quite the norm will find much to  savor here with Sleepaway Camp, a truly strange film that stands in a tired  subgenre, but stands out as a unique achievement-even if partially a fluke.
