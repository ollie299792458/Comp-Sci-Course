"Days of Wines and Roses" is head and shoulders above any other movies about alcoholism for many reasons, most of which can be summed up in the word "multidimensional". Instead of showing a snapshot in the life of an alcoholic, like "Lost Weekend", for example, "Days of Wines and Roses" follows the entire descent of not one, but two characters, into the depths of addiction. The interplay between man and woman and the progress of their relationship allows for the depiction of many aspects of alcoholism: the casual start; the discovery of a new pleasure; how one person can unwillingly lead another to become an alcoholic; the recovery; the belief that it is possible to have an occasional drink after recovery; the relapse; the different ways two people who love each other can deal with the problem and how they can influence one another for good or for bad. Everything is here. And the ending is astonishingly realistic. Instead of the usual message that everything will turn out fine in the end, the movie makes it clear that, once you become an alcoholic, the outcome is uncertain. You may or you may not recover. This is a powerful and poignant movie that has never been equaled. Recommended.
