Upon seeing the first two Shrek movies, which were entertaining and funny, Shrek 3 was a must-see.  Sequels seldom outperform the original, but Shrek 2 did pretty well.  Unfortunately Shrek the Third, lacked the charmingness of the first two movies.  Justin Timberlake voicing "Artie" as the only newcomer, was good enough, but I couldn't help the fact this movie was about "Artie" and not Shrek.  In this new installment, Shrek & Fiona become the servants of vengeful Prince Charming.  They also welcome a new addition to their Ogre family.  Artie is Fiona's cousin who is next in line to a reluctant "King" Shrek.  Artie is the typical "high school outcast" in most teen flicks, that ends up winning, at least in this movie "a kingdom".  Shrek the Third started out promisingly enough, with many laughs in the beginning.  As soon as it morphed into a teen comedy, some of the charm was taken away.  Animation wise, it's as excellent as the first 2.  Story wise, it borrowed too many elements from other cliched comedies.
