Unlike the mediocre and Disneyfied 'Pearl Harbor' with its cheesy love story and splashy special effects, Tora! Tora! Tora! actually has the feel that you are reliving history. The drama of the moment when the United States is dragged into World War II does not need embellishment, and the filmmakers here are wise in their use of restraint. You are struck by the missed clues that doomed thousands, the all-too-slow teletypes and relaxation that turns into realization and then to horror. This is a movie that honors the dead, and yet seeks to understand the Japanese as well and portray them realistically.

The heroics on the ground in the face of daunting odds and total surprise are inspiring even in their futility. As is the end of the movie, which doesn't feel compelled (unlike in Pearl Harbor) to tell you what happened next. We know what happened next. The country was ripped from its complacency, and was changed forever. And mushroom clouds eventually came to Japan. There is a solemnity to the whole enterprise, an understanding of the tragedy that befell the Navy that day that will live in infamy. You cannot help but be swept away by it.
