Why four out of five stars? Simply put, I paid a lot of money - these are pricey! (Definitely angry at the fact that the price dropped about $20 a week after I finally got around buying these...). All this aside, I absolutely love this series - I'm a huge Indy fan. Although some say the packaging is cheap (I disagree - really it's not that bad - any of you own the Sex and the City DVDs - that's cheap). There's 8 episodes (all about 2 hours long), loads of bonus features - for those history buffs -, plus an interactive 9th disk with the time line and game. I know many fans of the original are disappointed because of the new editing - they try to follow a more chronological order of Indy's life (which means that the beginning of some episodes with Corey Carrier have been completely revamped) and more notably the missing original entrance theme with the George Hall (old Indy) bookends. Honestly, I think the editing is great. Besides, I always fast forward the George Hall part (do your really think Indy would have turned out like him anyways?). Overall, (to wrap things up) this was a great buy and I'm very happy with my DVDs! Love the show!
