There seem to be a lot of people who don't know what "digital restoration" means, so let me clue you in.  Digital restoration is when a film is cleaned up of any grain or noise in the picture to enhance the overall clarity and sharpness of the image.  It's the same process that was used to restore The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather or ANY classic movie.  It does not CHANGE anything within the frame at all, only clarifies it to its original state.  This is completely different from making a "special edition" which superimposes new computer graphics and backgrounds onto the original film.  Doing so changes the images of the film.  No one can deny that part of the artistry of Star Wars was its groundbreaking use of visual effects.  Removing and replacing these effects makes it a different film.  It has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with digitally restoring the original film.

To all of you saying that fans who are upset with the poor image quality of the 1977 version included in this DVD are trying to have it both ways, please reread the above paragraph until you start to comprehend the difference between these two concepts.

The original Star Wars deserves to be restored, just like any classic film.  It deserves to have a DVD presentation that is on par with any DVD released past the year 2000 (think for a moment how ridiculous it is to even have to say that).  George Lucas can make whatever "corrections" or "improvements" he wants.  I could care less.  What I can't stand is that a revolutionary classic film will probably never be given the restoration it deserves.  I will probably buy this, because I think Mr. Lucas is crazy and immature enough to never release these originals again.  But I refuse to believe that this is anything less than a selfish affront to film history by an egomaniacal crank.
