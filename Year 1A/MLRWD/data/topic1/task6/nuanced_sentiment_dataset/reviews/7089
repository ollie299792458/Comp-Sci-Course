People will likely be upset with my review because I didn't actually watch the entire movie, but it was so terrible in the first 30 minutes that I couldn't keep watching. Not only is Kevin Smith telegraphing the entire plot of the movie by slapping you in the face with constant and entirely not believable references to the dire financial problems of the movies two main characters (their constant back and forth about bills, rent, the water getting shut off, etc., all of which seems thrown into the movie without any thought), the vulgar humor that is lacking in the humor part and just seems like Smith is trying way too hard, or, perhaps more accurately, not trying at all. It's as if just saying ridiculous, offensive things over and over again is meant to be funny. That said, if I was in high school still the blatant vulgarity might have seemed daring or novel, but I am not and so alas I was not impressed. I am a big fan of several members of the cast and of movies that could be lumped into this genre, but I am also a fan of decent dialog, a basic level of believability, and characters that are more then one dimensional and have some redeeming qualities and development. This movie lacked what other movies such as 40 Year Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Superbad, and even Step Brothers were able to achieve. Or Smith's own, and perhaps best movie, Dogma, which was funny, interesting, had a storyline that was engaging, and so on. While it's possible that this movie gets better, from the first terrible 30 minutes I cannot imagine that Smith suddenly changed his entire approach to the movie. STAY AWAY!
