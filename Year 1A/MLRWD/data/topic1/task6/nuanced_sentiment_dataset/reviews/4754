This Batman movie of 1966 was enjoyable; but now some of it seems too silly.  Even at that I still think the 1966 version of the Batman and Robin genre is cooler than the recent movies.

One thing I liked about the movie was that there were more scenes with the famous batmobile (lincoln futura) and scenes with the bat helicopter and bat cycle.  The acting was always very good, with such stars as Romero, Gorshin, in this case Meriweather, Hamilton, Meridith, etc. and West and Ward I think are great actors too.

I don't recall if the pow bam bubbles are in the movie version; but I did not like the introduction of silly science fiction phemonena which makes no sense; and in some cases it was treated as a comedy, like when batman is running around trying to find a place to dispose of a bomb, it makes batman look inept or not as a quick thinker.  These shows should have been made a little more like the classic James Bond, or a little more sophisticated with perhaps subtle humor.  The Superman shows had been done in a serious tone, and that show ran for 5 seasons.

The movie is just as formulaic as the tv show.
