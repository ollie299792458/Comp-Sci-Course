I saw 81/2 when I was quite young and I was dazzled by it. Now when I view it I can relate to adult themes and I can comiserate with Fellini's lead character who is full of self doubt, regret, and yearns for the simple pleasures of the past. But 81/2 is not a great movie because it has a profound story; it's a great movie because it is a profound movie experience. Dreamlike, it is both exotic and familiar at the same time. Fellini presents his story without explanation or judgment so we are free to experience with him. Fellini's great artistry &amp; theatricality open our eyes anew. And if that sounds too high minded to you it's also alot of fun.  Fellini's contribution to film is immense and he is still truly unique. There isn't a film maker who lived through the Fellini era that won't admit that they were influenced by Fellini. Yet, there no other filmmaker remotely like him; his films are a testament to his devotion to make films that express his personal vision.  There is a childlike quality to Fellini's films. Fellini understood that film has ability to create a unique experience for the viewer. I think that to see through someone else's eyes is one of our most cherished dreams and Fellini tries to provide that for us. I think what Fellini wanted was for us was to leave behind our own pretensions and assumptions and see the world innocently and with a sense of wonder.
