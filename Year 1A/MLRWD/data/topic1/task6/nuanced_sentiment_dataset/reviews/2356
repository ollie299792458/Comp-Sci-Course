12 Angry Men is, undoubtedly, a classic!  This film should be seen by all of us, especially those in the younger generations, as it's themes and motives still ring true... even some 47 years after it was released.  While the thought of black and white films might turn some away, people should realize that this movie makes up for modern technology and effects with old fashioned dialog and suspense.  The film's all-star cast ignite the storyline with 12 completely different attitudes and personalities.  The banter and the expressions, the calmness and the rage, the outbursts and the silences, the joy and the shame.. all of these combine for a litteral tour-de-force that, in today's world, would require explosions, aliens, and nudity to achieve the same results.  Do not be fooled by the simplistic nature of this film.. yes, it's twelve guys sitting around talking... yes, there is (for nearly 100% of the movie) only one setting... but to say that it is boring, or outdated, is a crime.  Watch this movie... you will not be sorry!
