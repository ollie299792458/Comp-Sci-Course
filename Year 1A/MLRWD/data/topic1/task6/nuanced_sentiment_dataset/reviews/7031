The star director, cast and expense was wasted on this film. Frank Lucas was a man who could not READ OR COUNT. Considering he was a black person from Harlem at a time when there were plenty more powerful gangsters in New York, this 'achievement' makes him a business phenomenon.

The movie is a somewhat interesting story on a gangster related topic but does not convey what Frank Lucas was and could have been more accurate towards his life which in reality was extraordinary.

Lucas imported drugs inside coffins JUST ONCE whereas the movie portrays it as the usual business model. The point here is that the movie is good as a fictional creation but compared to Lucas and his life it is just an average movie and certainly not in the league of GoodFellas or The Godfather - But it could have been as good if not better.

Most people will also not realize that Frank Lucas 'over-dressing' for the boxing match and sitting in seats in front of the Italian Mafia was a huge blunder. This single incident was a miscalculation (due to his wife) and which drew attention to Lucas. The lesson of flying under the radar is obvious but the movie does not stitch the lessons behind the Lucas story in a way that can be easily appreciated.

And this is why I give this move 3 stars because considering the money and talent invested - the movie is not up to the mark.
