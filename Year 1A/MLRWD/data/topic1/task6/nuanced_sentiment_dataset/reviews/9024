Wow, this movie absolutely pissed me off completely. To start with the plot had to be one of the worst I've seen in quite a while. It might have been better if they got writers that weren't 10 years old! There was little or no fleshing out of the plot and it was hit or miss whether a scene would actually move the plot along or just waste space. And don't get me started on the computer graphics. What is this the mid 90's again? They were TERRIBLE! There were parts of the movie where either non-computer graphic objects were moving very oddly in comparison to the the computer generated objects on the same frames. (E.G. where the serpent crashed through a building at night and a car was driving by and swerved around it.), or the computer generated creatures seemed fuzzy in comparison to the real scenery. Also there were cars that were thrown around by the serpent, that seemed to me like the special effects guys just filmed someone throwing matchbox cars around and putting a computer generated layer on top of them to put in the movie. The acting wasn't anything special either, especially atrocious was the villain. He didn't have many lines (thank god), but the ones he had were horrible.

This film was apparently made for a single demographic only. 9-12 year olds with a fascination for dragons and other creatures of the scaly type. Because anyone past the age of 13 would roll their eyes at this steaming turd of a movie.

Avoid this like the plague.
