I have to say I was disappointed with this DVD (or at least the concert footage portion of it).

I was at one of the concerts on this tour, and while the performance qualilty is high, the DVD comes nowhere near to reproducing the magic of the event.

The video quality has been mentioned in several of the other reviews here - it is simply shocking. This isn't something that you need to be some high brow techno geek with multi thousand dollar equipment to notice; many of the shots and camera angles are grainy enough to appear out of focus and there is occasional annoying 'white out' from shots taken stright into the stage lights and losing the image in the glare. If it had been produced by schoolboys I'd have given a 'B' for effort and pointed out where they went wrong...from professionals it really isn't good enough.

I freely confess though that most of the reason I bought this DVD was for the sound  - I was really looking forward to hearing the concert again in 5.1. I was a little dissapointed here - while the concert is clearly recorded in 5.1, neither the dolby or DTS soundtracks really brought the sound to life. Both of the multi channel tracks seemed too focused on the front 3 speakers, with the rears only being noticeable through applause from the audience. The sound quality itself is excellent, crisp, balanced, clear, etc., but it failed to live up to my expectations. I noticed 3 or 4 times during the show that the soundtrack was out of sync with the video, and on I think 2 occasions there were audible pops when changing camera angles / scenes.

Overall? I think this is a great concert to own just for teh spectacle and music; however I could have gotten this audio/video quality ten years ago with a regular VHS system, and that really isn't good enough any more.
