This is a sequel to the 'Super/Batman: Public Enemies' animated movie, of which I was a HUGE fan.  Read my review for more on that...

This sequel however is not like it's predasessar.  It falls short in animation quality, story, action and it's overall attention keeping power.

It does have Kevin and Tim reprising their roles as Batman and Superman, one of the few pluses of the movie.

It's not terrible, but definitely not '...Public Enemies' quality.

**Minor Spoilers Ahead**

This tale focuses in on Superman's cousin who falls to Earth in a space ship.  She is roughly 16 years old, and unfortunately this movie focuses mainly on her.  She is not very interesting to say the least.  Now if Powergirl was swapped in instead...that's a different story.

Anyway Batman doesn't trust her, as Batman doesn't trust any aliens, and he spends most of the movie distrusting her.  Darkseid takes an interest in her and kidnaps her.

So our heroes go to Big Barta, who is REALLY tall, and with her and her motherbox, THAT'S A COMPUTER THAT OPEN WORMHOLES THREW SPACE for all you dirty minded people, descend upon planet Apocalypse for a rescue.

Decent movie, completists like me will no doubt want to own this, if they do not already.  Hope they make a third in this series in the future, and hopefully recapture the thunder of '...Public Enemies.'  Hope this review is helpful and as always sorry for the misspellings, why Amazon doesn't have Spell Check I'll never know...
