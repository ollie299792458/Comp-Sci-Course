Like the Murnau-Foundation's restoration of Lang's

"Metropolis," this American-edition sparkles like the finest

of nitrate-prints! It is so silvery, soft, and the range of hues and contrast are as one would expect from first-generation

materials. There must be hundreds of shades-of-gray here. Hardly a pumped-up rip-off, this joint-restoration with the Bundesarchiv and a Dutch production-house is going to difficult to top, unless some lost-materials surface. This isn't likely, as in the case of "Metropolis."Audio is also vastly-improved over the earlier-restoration,

and isn't shrill or harsh as in the soundtracks of such early

sound-films-- probably due to the fact that original, first-or-second-generation materials were used. Without-a-doubt, this film has gone through some cleaning-up with computers, but I didn't notice any obvious-tweaking, the materials are already

very solid.It's also obvious that a lot of the restoration-work was in photographic-labs, long-before digital-tranfers were

done.

  The extras are all exceptional here, and most directors would be green-with-envy over such an edition of their craft. The film speaks-for-itself--and better-than-ever--and is

timeless. It is seminal, and is still copied today by lesser-lights in cinema. 1931:This is the true-beginning of the modern crime-film, things would never be the same.
