Review of DVD:  This is a nicely restored version of the film, with reasonalbly good color (a bit contrasty sometimes), with good sound.  DVD extras are adequate, but sparce by modern movie standards.

All the principles did give fine performances.  While Katina Paxinou gives a fine, Oscar winning performance, I believe Akim Tamiroff as the undependable and annoying Pablo is the finest in the cast.  But Pilar is a much more likable character.

Discussion of the movie: Cooper and Bergman are fine, independent of each other.  But the romantic attraction did not seem believable to me, especially how quickly Bergman's character was smitten by Cooper's.  Cooper looked, well, middle aged (he's about 42 here), when younger men were available (a rivalry might have added something here).  Fortunately, while young, she doesn't look 19 (her character's age, she's about 28).  Remember, her character is falling for Robert Jordan, not Gary Cooper, and any attraction built up in the book is not added in this adaptation.  There was absolutely no suspense in what was going to happen between these two.  For me, the romance story simply got in the way of action, and the Pablo/Pilar conflict.  What was Pablo going to do?  Can he be trusted?
