I saw this "mockumentary" on HBO the other night and enjoyed it so thoroughly that I looked it up on Amazon.com to purchase it.  Okay, so it IS hokey and amaturish; but it is also entertaining and while not preachy or "heavy," it does get it's point accross.  It challenges us to think about our prejudices, even the ones we think we don't have.  When we generalize populations and fall victim to political rehtoric we dehumanize the "other."  This film uses a subplot of vignettes to show us the importance and the humanity of our fully "American" latino brothers and sisters, and reminds us that the uniqueness of American Nationality is precisely that we are ALL immigrants in one sense or another.  I was disappointed in the poor reviews many others gave this film.  I think the amateur quality was endearing and effective in making it a sort of "believable" documentary.  I am eager to share this film with my 8, 11 and 13 year old children and their friends, to help them understand a little more about recent immigrant struggles.  The people who gave the worst reviews and redirected shoppers to buy different, "better" films (also very good) would do well to remember that not all films need to be literal, heavy, fully accurate, social works of art.  This film has it's place in any diverse library and is both entertaining and thought provoking.  I think it is worth buying and viewing.
