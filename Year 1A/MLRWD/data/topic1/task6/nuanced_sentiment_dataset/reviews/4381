This is the type of movie I've grown to love more as I get older (I'm in my mid 30s). I'd rather have a scene with something fascinating unfolding in a company's boardroom followed by a private backroom conversation between characters as imposing as the ones Spacey and Irons can conjure, I'd rather have that than my screen being filled with explosions, CGI effects and cheesy one liners. This is the best film I've seen this year. Period. In this film you get to be a fly on the wall as one of the most age defining events of the decade (the financial meltdown) occur. I didn't take my eye off the screen for the whole duration of the film. I just couldn't. I watched captain America the other day and I simply didn't care about the characters or about anything that was happening on screen. I took phone calls, went to the kitchen for coffee, etc. (And it's not like I can't appreciate a good superhero movie, Thor was awesome, but Hollywood nowadays, is turning into a one liner fest with no substance). The only thing that this movie allowed me to do while it was playing, was to look at the screen and breathe in order to keep a steady body temperature. I didn't do anything else. It was THAT good. I know it's  a totally different type of film (compared to Captain America) but a good  movie is a good movie. Period.  I wish more movies like these were made.
