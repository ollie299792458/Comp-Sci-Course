When it comes to a movie that will make you laugh to death, The Hangover is a perfect fit. This movie deserves 4/5 stars for its lessons, depictions, and incredibly funny suspense.

The Hangover is a comedy about four friends who go on a bachelor party in Las Vegas. One of them accidently gives them ruphies. They wake up the next morning knowing nothing. Even worse, they lost their friend. Then they go all around Las Vegas trying to find him.

I bought the movie in 2010 because everyone told me it was so funny. I didn't believe them but watching the film made me a believer.

The Hangover tells a good lesson on what not to do when you go to Las Vegas. The terrible things that happen to them tell you not to do it.

The movie shows a great depiction of the city of Las Vegas. It shows how beautiful the city is and what all you can do there. The film shows Ceasar's Palace and the many casinos there.

Finally, The Hangover has incredibly funny suspense. The things they go through to find their friend will make you laugh.
The only downside to the movie that I have found is that it is rated R so children cannot see it. You don't need to watch it with your kids.

If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh to death, The Hangover is it.
