I was forced to choose between giving this one or two stars. The original Highlander 2 was one of the worst movies ever made. It made no sense and explained the immortality of the immortals as they being aliens from a planet called Zeist. Sean Connery once again made his role as the immortal Ramirez.(Note: As stated by the [...] reviewer that Ramirez would be a scottish is wrong. There is nothing in the movie that Ramirez is in fact scottish, except for Sean Connery being it.) The Renegade Version is better then Highlander 2: The Quickning but is not any good in comparision to the first Highlander film. Planet Zeist from Highlander 2: The Quickning is gone but now it is replaced with something unexplainable. Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert had met at an earlier moment, which is not given any more explanation once the movie goes on. I give this version one star because I give the original Highlander 2 no stars. [....]The movie has some scenes that were deleted from the original and it got a different structure but it's still the same bad film. The longer presentation tries to establish the movie in the same way that the first one started out. The scene between Christopher Lambert and Virginia Madsen now includes some kind of a love sequence with Lambert just walking up to Madsen, presenting himself and then "foul around", right there on the street. Sean Connery is still good but here his performance is put into a shameful material. Michael Ironside tried to make a more crazied and awful baddy than Clancy Brown and failed. The best scene in both films is Ramirez return. He appears out of nowhere on a stage while a guy is playing Hamlet. Better then the original but not a movie worth watching, not even for laughs. (If you didn't like the first Highlander film it could be possible for you to like this)
