About a year ago, I babysat a classmate's baby. That was my first real baby sitting experience - but I was scarred for life (or so I thought). Even though I followed the instructions clearly, baby nic still would not stop crying. The ordeal lasted 2 hours and by the end of it , I had somehow concluded that I wasn't made for motherhood.

My fiance's sister gave birth to a lovely girl 2 months ago, Baby Angie. Now... I knew this meant more babysitting would happen in the future. Remembering my experience with baby Nic... I was suitably nervous. My co-worker Jan somehow got to recommending me this VHS called "The Happiest Baby on the Block" by Dr Harvey Karp. I was pretty impressed about the reviews online but skepticial about it but purchased the DVD online anyways. After watching it, I was completely sold on how easy it would be to calm a crying baby (who was already fed + changed). But I was still nervous as to how I would be able to translate this knowledge into real-life application.

Tonight was my chance at giving the 5 "S"s a shot. After Angie's parents left, she started to burst out into tears (Murphy's law). I applied the 5 S and promptly put her to sleep. It was amazing... like a MAGIC SHOW. I kid you not!!! She had 2 more outbursts later but it was directly related to a. the need to be fed b. soiled diaper. After we cleaned her up, she was still antsy and "McFussy". Again, I applied the 5 S and Abracadabra! She was asleep again... Just like mush in my hands. I could not believe my eyes!!! Dr Karp, you're amazing!!!

Listen guys, If I can calm a crying baby - so can you! This DVD is a must-watch whether or not you are a parent. You never know when baby-calming skills can come in handy!
