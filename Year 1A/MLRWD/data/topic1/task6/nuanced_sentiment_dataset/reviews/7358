Cornelius Ryan is a legendary writer of the history of World War II.  Sometimes ponderous, this movie faithfully reproduces a battle that is little known to most Americans.  Most people lose perspective and have  never learned of the major battles between D-Day and V.E. Day.  The  exception is the Battle of the Bulge.  The movie explores the situation on  many levels, looking at common soldiers, the division between Montgomery  and Patton, the courage of airborne forces, the leadership of many of the  same generals that led the D-Day invasion, and the trials of fate.  The  movie hilights the bond between the British and the Americans.  Two  countries that have always stepped up to right wrong at great sacrifice.  Poignant also is the participation of the Poles and their commitment to  liberate Europe even as their own country was trading German oppression  with Soviet oppression.  The all-star cast is top notch.  In the days when  epic movies do not keep the attention of viewers, this movie is an  exception.  The sadness one feels as the Allies are eventually stopped in  what has become a futile effort is mitigated by the knowledge that the  allies would eventually win.
