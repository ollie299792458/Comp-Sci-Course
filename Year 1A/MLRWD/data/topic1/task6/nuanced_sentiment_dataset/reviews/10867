it's funny how stereotypes can either make or break a movie. this was an aweful attempt to sell something that it wasn't. John Cena might be able to act, but he got completely shot down in this one from the horrible directing and script, as well as the terribly bad acting from the supporting cast except maybe from the sarcastic guy from Terminator 2.
I had an unbelievably hard time trying to get passed the self-stereotyping done by the bad guys. it was like they were trying to get the audience to hate the fact that they were even casted into the movie. This is one movie i wouldn't recommend to anyone except the extreme fans of the WWE, or maybe the little kids who believe the storylines in wrestling are actually real drama.
one fine point that i thought was extremely humorous about the movie. How is it that you can drive a camero (or whatever the cop car was) at top speeds with a million and one bullet holes in it and not either a) blow up, b) blow a tire, c) just die or d) not allow the driver to get hit from any of the million and one bullets?
i certainly hope this movie was supposed to be strictly a comedy because if it wasn't, the director should be shot and left in the car that mysteriously didn't blow up.
