It really is quite astounding how bad this movie really is.  First things last, I was blown away to find out that Martin Brest wrote & directed this mess.  Midnight Run happens to be one of my favorite films of all-time.  Gigli actually tries to be Midnight Run on more than one occasion, along with Rain Man, Chasing Amy and any number of Elmore Leonard filcks.  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are atrocious.  Affleck's Brooklyn by-way-of Boston accent is comical.  His scene where he's flexing his muscles for a closet mirror is grounds for black-listing.  And I'm not even going to elaborate on his come-ons to Lopez.  She's not quite as bad, but her speeches on the female anatomy and "people skills" couldn't have been written by a human.  Then there's Al Pacino and Christopher Walken.  Hoo-ahhh!  Pacino's just plain awful - a completely stupid, over-the-top performance than he's been giving us more often than not lately (and yes, that includes Brest's Scent of a Woman, a completely overrarted film).  As far as Walken, he basically regurgitates his True Romance-Bluloo Boyle speech, then suddenly starts talking in some strange alien language where I honestly needed sub-titles.  And then he was gone.  There is so much wrong with Gigli, you could write a college thesis on the subject.  I haven't even touched upon the mentally disabled character.  The music.  Gigli's boss.  I haven't even scratched the surface.  But let this be said.  As far as bad movies go, this is right up there with the best (worst) of them...
