I was disappointed with Ice Age.  The animation is technically proficient and at times quite dazzling.  The sound is good, the characters are appropriately charming and menacing as needed, the story is predictable and acceptable to the vast majority.
In short, it's boring.  There are flashes of brilliance in the character of Sid the Sloth but everyone else acts as they are rendered, as if by computer.  
Oh I'm sure that 4 year old kids will squeal in delight.  SO, it's a good family movie to get if you want to keep your kids quiet.  By the same reasoning, you could feed them gin (or the modern equivalent).  That's how people kept babies from crying in the 1800s.  
But I thought we knew better now.
Remember Bugs Bunny?  That cartoon was written for *real adults*.  It was uproarious and anarchistic, witty and insulting, clearly made for adults, which makes it perfect for really entertaining the kid in all of us.  
Ice Age is about as uproarious as a wet match.
Your kids are going to love it, you'll be happy, Fox will get lots of money.  But they could have done much better.
By the way, the cartoon character Scrat that we see in snatches throughout the movie is much more interesting.  Too bad Fox didn't have the courage to feature him.  But he's too adult for their tastes, he actually fights nature.
