I was recovering from a frontal lobotomy when I saw this film. I was feeling kind of lonely because, after getting a frontal lobotomy, it's difficult to find other people to relate to. But I could relate to every character in this film! They seemed so real to me. Like the people you see on reality TV. They were just like that. Like that Kim Kardashian. But with flaws. This entire movie was like an endless reality TV show. So real. And just as entertaining.

The acting was also incredible. Everyone was very believable. They reminded me of a senator or a president. So life-like and caring. With real emotions. This movie made me so happy, I felt like crying. I realized that having a frontal lobotomy does not mean you are alone. There are lots of people just like you in the world. In movies like this. And on reality TV. And in government. And business.

Oh, the only actor I didn't like was Debra Winger. She was not believable because she is too good of an actress. I love her deep voice and she was so good and I've missed her not making movies these past years, so I hope I never see her again in another movie like this because she ruined it and she should only make bad movies and not good movies like this.

Yeah.

So anyway, after watching this movie, I was feeling lots better. But then I kind of realized that, gee, it's only a movie. Real people like that only exist in movies and on reality TV and not in real life. Then I came here and read the 5-star and 4-star reviews of this movie, and I realized all over again that I was not alone. There are real people out there that are just like me. In fact, most people are just like me.

Omigod, I wish I had gotten a frontal lobotomy much sooner. So much lost time...
