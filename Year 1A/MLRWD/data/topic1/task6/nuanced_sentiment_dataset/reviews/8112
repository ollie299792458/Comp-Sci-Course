This movie was dumb. Really dumb. So dumb that I couldn't stop laughing. I was frankly amazed that anyone could produce a movie as bad as this one and still posess the mental facilities to feed and clothe themselves. Maybe someone else does it for them... like at an institution or something.

The first 1/3 of the movie involves the Rock meeting old friends and everyone fake laughing and smiling while they hug and pretend to love each other. Then it gets dumb.

The trailers make this movie look like it has some sort of coherant plot and rising action. Trailers lie. The legal basis for everything that happened is the movie was a hilariously childish view of justice. You can't be aquitted of a crime (brutal premeditated assault) simply because the target "deserved it".

All of the plot turns are boring and hilariously cliche. I wouldn't care, seeing as it's supposedly an "action" movie of some sort; however, said action was conpicuously absent from the film. What you get instead is watered down, silly clips of grown men pawing at each other; and a few gun-driven scenes that might be vaugely cool if they situation and dialogue surrounding them weren't so hilariously retarded.

The romance follows the basic "woman brings man leftovers, woman and man have intercourse" formula. I guess she was attractive, in a promiscuous way.

Nothing that is intended as humor in the movie is even remotely funny.

If you want to laugh at a horribly, profoundly silly and stupid movie, this isn't a bad shot. However, if you're looking for a cool, badass action romp, or real humor, or romance, or semi-believable human emotion, or a plot, or a vague connection with reality - look elsewhere.
