I admit when I first watched the movie Legend on TV I was addicted. I was probably one of the minority that thought Ridley Scott did damn well with this fairy tale motion picture. But when I found out that it wasnt the version that he originally intended for the US audiences I began wondering why? The performances by Tom Cruise and, in my eyes the ultimate villain actor, Tim Curry(of Rocky Horror fame)as well as newcomer Mia Sara, were tremendous. I did feel skeptical as to the score performed by Tangerine Dream. Why put a rock type score in a fairy tale or fantasy movie? I then researched who originally did the score and was stunned to find out that it was Jerry Goldsmith who was the original composer. Unfortunately at that time the only release that was the US theatrical version. I was ticked off! But now I found that Ridley Scott released the Legend Ultimate Edition DVD. I only had one word, SWEET! Two versions of the movie, the original Jerry Goldsmith extended movie, and the US Tangerine Dream Theatrical version. Now we, the viewers can view the movie the way director Ridley Scott intended it to be. This truly is a cult classic to be treasured. I just feel it is a shame that Legend wasnt recieved as well as it should have. But I'll let you folks decide.
