I didn't even know this movie existed until today. I remember being about 14 going to the Theater to see the original so I figured I'd take a trip down Memory lane and check this movie out.

  Basically You have a Sarah michelle Gellar look alike(in certain scenes they use camera angles that really makes it apparant). Bunch of kids, someone dies, then a year later they start recieving notes saying I know what you did last summer. This Movie doesn't have the All-Star cast the first two movies did and I think thats why it won't be looked at in as positive of light But I did like how they continued the series.

  If your expectation is to watch a great horror movie you will be dissapointed. If your expectations are rock bottom like mine, Youll probaly be surprised and the movie does keep you intrested throughout.

  I'm probaly being a bit generous with 3, If I could, I'd rate it 2 1/2 stars. Worth watching and worth adding to a horror movie collection, especially if you have the first Two movies.
