I really enjoyed this season.  I think my favorite episodes include "Dark Frontier" where we see the Borg complex and get to see a species being assimilated.  I also really enjoyed "Timeless" where Chakotay and Kim are in the future trying to save their long-dead comrades.  One episode that did have a pretty big error was "Course: Oblivion."  In that episode it had been 11+ months since the crew visited the Demon Planet of season 4, 11 months heading towards home.  When the duplicated crew started heading home (opposite direction of the Alpha Quadrant mind you) they are all dying.  A few weeks out from home they almost run into the real Voyager and crew?  That would seem that Voyager was just running around in circles for the better part of a year.  Not to mention the fact that the last episode of season 4 "Hope and Fear" they use the quantum slipstream drive to get like another 10,000 light years closer to home.  So just in case you haven't been paying attention, how was it possible for the real Voyager to be near the Demon Planet of season 4?  Anyways, don't worry about this one error, it was the only one I found and the season was otherwise excellent
