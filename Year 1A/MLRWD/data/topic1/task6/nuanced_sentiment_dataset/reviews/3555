The Alphabet Killer was surprisingly a good thriller. The production values were high, the cinematography was adequate though spotty and the actual "visions" of the dead children were bone-chilling. Instead of just being a straight up crime thriller where sanity draws the line between "good guys" and "bad guys,", we get a healthy dose of insanity from both killer and detective, which was a breath of fresh air and an interesting angle.

Naturally, it's always a pleasure to see The Dush, I've never really been a huge fan of her films but I'm always a fan of a nice ass! Seriously though, Eliza's turn as a schizophrenic cop haunted by visions and voices was impressive, she definitely went the extra mile and her descent into mental illness was visually impressive. Cary Elwes on the other hand never really hit the spot for me, when he isn't doing comedy he just seems to phone his roles in.

As a whole, the film works and Rob Schmidt actually makes it work well. You'll be guessing right up until the very end! The one thing I really loved about this film was the slow decay of the visions, each time Megan sees the dead children they're grosser and grosser! Wonderfully scary stuff! The Alphabet Killer wasn't half bad and it's well worth checking out.
