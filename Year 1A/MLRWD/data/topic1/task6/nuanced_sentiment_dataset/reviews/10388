I first would like to say that I am a huge fan of Dave Chappelle and all the recording artists in the movie. So it is a given that I enjoyed the movie. I love the fact that Dave used his popularity to make a movie basically about the great music that he likes. The artists in this movie do not get play on MTV, they do not sell millions of records. They make good hip hop music and are overlooked by all most all media. Media has potrayed all hip hop to be guns drugs and putting down women. That is a part of the culture, but there are people like Kanye West, Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli, and the Roots who make great music and are not respected as much as they be because most people that do not listen to hip hop cannot tell the difference between Common and the Yin Yang Twins. I hope that not just people who like Hip Hop go to this movie but all people go just to see this side of hip hop that mainstream media has not shown the public. This movie is very funny I think Dave is funny basically not matter what he does. There are some great momments where Dave just speaks very candid about his feelings on how the music in the film can help people and also bring people togeather. The Fugees getting togeather was a great end to the film Lauryn Hill is an amazing artist and hopefully they will release new music soon. It was hard for me to sit in my chair and watch Talib Kweli perform "Get By". My only complaint is that the performances are often cut into interviews and backstage stuff. I would have like to have been able to hear the entire song at some parts but this is a minor complaint. Overall, I suggest everybody see this movie you may not like the actual music, but after watching the movie you will realize how powerful hip hop music is.
