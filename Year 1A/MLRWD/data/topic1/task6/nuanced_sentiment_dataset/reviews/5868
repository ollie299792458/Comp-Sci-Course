Sometimes I wonder why directors and producers choose to commit certain action to celluloid. This is one of those films. All I can ask is WTF?!?! I guess I'm not artsy enough because reading the blurbs on the case would lead you to believe that this is a masterwork of cinematography with a message that transcends the human experience. I'll tell ya, I didn't get it. I wouldn't compare this even remotely to "The Road". A vague, unexplained catastrophe occurs that leaves society in a shambles, though there's no visual evidence of destruction or cause. It's more of a morality play on how people react to calamity though there's no plot, sparse dialogue and no real resolution. The movie starts, stuff happens and then it ends with nothing compelling in the interim to make you even care about any of the characters after the first few minutes. Maybe if I spoke, understood or thought in French (the films native language) I might find some understanding to the films purpose. It's not SciFi, barely qualifies as good dystopian or post apocalyptic genre and the events could have taken place after a tour bus full of people broke down on the side of the road in some remote area and their reactions while waiting for the tow truck (food and water running out and tempers flairing). Honestly, I want my money back. Don't waste yours.
