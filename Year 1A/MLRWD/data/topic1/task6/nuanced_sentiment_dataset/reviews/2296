I doubt anyone will ever come out of the movie theatre or will finish watching this in the VCR, and say 'this is the greatest film I've ever seen' or ' One of my top 10 films'.
I also doubt many people will come  out of this film saying 'this is really bad', unless they were insulted by  the treatment of Gays in this film, or by the it's lack of  inteligence.
Three to Tango is Comedy-Lite:  It might be offensive, a  little, but the message is liberal.  It's not really funny, but often  amusing.  It's never emotionally powerful, but the characters are mostly  sympathetic.  The story and the script aren't powerful or exciting, but  it's never dull.
Three to Tango is OK.  It can be amusing, it's a  reasonably entertaining way to kill 2 hours.  It's amusing, it's  satisfactory.
The acting is pretty good, especially by Chandler (no, I  mean Mathew Parry - but will he ever play someone DIFFERENT from Chandler?)  and the guy who plays his gay partner. Dylan McDermot wasn't very  impressive, but he's not on screen much.  Neve Campbell was fine. 
This  film is mediocracy in full - it's an OK film.  You'll enjoy it, but you'll  never think about it again ten seconds after you've left the cinemma or  turned off the TV.
