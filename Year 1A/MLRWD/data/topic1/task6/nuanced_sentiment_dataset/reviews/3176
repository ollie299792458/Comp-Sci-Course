I was much surprised by the use of double-sided DVDs which require at least 10 power magnification to read what's on the disc.  I'm sorry I did not read the comments that other people had with these double-sided discs.  It might have swayed me not to buy it.  I had rented Series 2 from Netflix and they were all single sided discs.

Much to my surprise Disc 1 of four was physically out of balance and caused my player to vibrate and resonate an annoying sound.  It was much less when I tried Disc 2.  All four discs seemed to have problems with skipping, freezing and general were not performing well.

A positive (*****) five star performance was given by Amazon.com in their return and refund policy regarding these mechanically defective DVDs.

I would hope that in the future the number of DVDs involved in a series is mentioned so you could avoid this double-sided manufacturing method.

Again, hats off to Amazon.com for their service.  Would have loved to own this series in single-sided discs.
