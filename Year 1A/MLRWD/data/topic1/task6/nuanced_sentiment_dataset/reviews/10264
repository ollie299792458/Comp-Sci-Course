I hate to be the lowest rater of this movie, especially since I am a RE fan, but I have to admit there are lots of flaws with this movie.  Before I go into detail, the animation is great. I had a fun time laughing when there were pieces that just didn't make sense.

#1, Why deploy a Raccoon City cop in the middle of a revolutionary war "seeking american POWs" when there were none to be found in the movie?  Well maybe there was one, who had the virus go in his mouth...

#2, There was a scene were Leon let the two lickers surround him, that's stupid on his part. In addition, there was another scene were Leon let the licker stick his tongue closer to him as he does nothing. great. that's just pro.  Also, before he goes down the elevator, there was a scene were the Lickers walked past him. what the heck?

#3, In the tunnels, there's a scene were 3 "zombies" were talking toward Leon and JD as they were trying to open a solid metal door.  The zombie had his head pop-off into the crazy bio octopus head mode that isn't able to land a single scratch on as leon tries to squeeze through the door?  Also afterward, leon puts a chain through the door and the monsters were able to easily open the door? what the...

#4, RPG's don't work against those big metal dudes, why send in more Lickers to directly fight them head on?  The last licker was smart, no doubt.

#5, Did Leon really climb all the way down that elevator shaft?

#6, The scene when Ada kicks away a little pistol from the butler, then wrestle/fights with the blonde President, then figures out she gets locked in the office.  The butler should've grabbed the pistol and had her surrender, but instead... he shows up with a shotgun after the fight scene is over. WTF?

#7, where are the notorious zombie dogs? Those things made me wet my pants in RE director's cut and RE2.

#8,How does that guy end up in a wheelchair? that makes NO sense, especially when Leon said you must live, blah blah *BANG* LOL

#9, There was a scene with the beehives, and leon and ada get completely surrounded by the dark dressed military.  HOW DOES LEON RUN AWAY FROM 30 GUYS AT POINT BLANK?

#10, there's a Truck with the Bees. Do the lickers know how to drive? Who's driving!?

Sorry for the crazed review, as I am a heavy fan of the RE series, but overall the animation was done very, very well.  I think the scene to scene transitions could've been done much better.  Also JD is a very annoying character with a Harlem/austrian accent. doesn't fit this country of "eastern slav"

P.S. I've just started RE 6 and very I'm pleased with it so far, though I wish when you move the L joystick, he wouldn't start running.  It's capcom's signature that when you move the L joystick all the way, you walk. you press X to run.  The olden days of cameras in the corner of the room + 360 pivoting made the game way more challenging and fun.  I hope that comes back to 7, 3rd person only > 3rd person + fps
