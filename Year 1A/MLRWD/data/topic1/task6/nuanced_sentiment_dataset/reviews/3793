I waited until the 2nd time doing this yoga practice until writing my review. I liked it MUCH better the 2nd time. I am an intermediate practioner and do yoga once or twice a week to keep my flexibility up. (Other DVDs I do are: Jillian Michaels' Yoga Meltdown, MTV Power Yoga w/ Kristen McGee, Yoga Zone Power Yoga--still one of my faves--and sometimes Brian Kest Power Yoga level 3.) I find this workout to be comparable if not SLIGHTLY more challenging than a few. The key is to do this with no air conditioning or fan going...that way you'll really sweat.

The poses are not really explained with a lot of detail so if you are new to yoga I would probably not recommend this DVD. Once you are familiar with the poses, this would be a great addition to your yoga DVD library.

Poses done include: vinyasas (several), tree, warriors 1 and 2, half moon, reverse triangle (twisting), triangle, reverse warrior, crescent, chair with twist, extended side angle, a nice ab section, and great twisting/compensatory poses.

Have fun!
