Five minutes into the film and you are thinking - this is rubbish, introspective and the asides to camera are far too corny. However, if you are a devotee of Nick Hornby - and I used to be until I read -'How to be good', you will love this DVD. Allowing the main protagonist to speak on camera might at times be considered either too cliched or suspending one's disbelief a little too far . However, there is no other way in which the director would have been able to demonstrate the witicism of Nick Hornby.If you loved the book then undoubtedly you will love the film, although real afficionados might debate the merits of setting such an English novel in Chicago, especially when given Catherine Zeta Jones's Welsh-Chicago accent.  If you have ever entered into a specialist cinema or music stall you will instantly recognise Barry and Dick.They are the 'geek' and the tutting 'know-it-all'. The put-down of the father searching for Stevie Wonder's 'I Just Called to Say I love You' enable us to enter into the eternal debate over should a music artist be forgiven for putting out total dross once he has attained the pinancle of his writing. This film is about the human condition whether in terms of 'The Top Ten Break-ups of all time' or the 'Top five albums of all time'.
