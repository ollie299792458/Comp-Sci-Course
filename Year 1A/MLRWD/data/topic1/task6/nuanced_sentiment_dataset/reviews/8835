If you haven't seen this movie and you like good escapist science fiction, this is good for a hoot.  Special effects and miniatures are a little lame even by the standards of the the day when the movie was shot.  I got the movie for two reasons.  One, it was cheap and two it was a cheap Blu-ray.  I'd just gotten my first Blu-ray player for Christmas and wanted to try it out.  I also got 2001: A Space Odyssey and 2010: The Year We Make Contact in Blu-ray, also cheap.  And here is where I going to go into my review of Blu-ray, not the movies I purchased.  After I played these three movies, plus some newer ones that I rented, I've concluded that what little difference there is between standard DVD movies and Blu-ray movies isn't worth the fuss.  My standard DVD of The Bourne Identity looks just a crisp and clear as the Blu-ray version.  Granted, they can pack so much more onto a Blu-ray, and that may be worth the whoppla, but I fell asleep playing back all of the "backgrounders" on the Blu-ray disks there were so many.
The only thing that I can say for Blu-ray that I'm happy about personally is the fact that I shoot in HD and I can edit in HD and author my personal programs out to a Blu-ray and it looks incredible.

One last comment about Logan's Run, the movie.  The cinematographer should have over cranked the miniature camera for the city scenes so that the water moved in slow motion to keep it from looking like a miniature model of a city.
