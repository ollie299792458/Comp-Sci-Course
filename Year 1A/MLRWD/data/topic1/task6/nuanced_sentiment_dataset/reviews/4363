Starring Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl, Killers seemed interesting to me. A woman meets a man while vacationing with her parents. They get married and three years later she finds out he used to be an assassin. Reviewed horribly by critics, I decided to give it a chance anyway. I sometimes like movies and tv shows others don't. In this case, it's really not as terrible as some make it seem. It wasn't great either. I wouldn't recommend spending full list price for it, (I got mine during Black Friday week for $5.99) but it may be worth checking out on sale or if you could purchase it used. Basically to me it seems like a good idea gone a little askew. There were some things in the plot like SPOILER: Jen's pregnancy that weren't really necessary to the movie. Also if Spencer went through rigorous training like he stated, how come he didn't know who the people were who were trying to kill him? Wouldn't he suspect them? Either way, it still kept me somewhat entertained for the 90-some odd minutes I watched it on a rainy day.
