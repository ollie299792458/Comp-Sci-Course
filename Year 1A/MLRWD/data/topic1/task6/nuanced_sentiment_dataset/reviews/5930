I will start by disagreeing with the low raters of this film. It is not a sleeper, it does have a story, the acting is solid, special effects are as good as any multimillion dollar movie. The characters let you in just enough to relate to them. Although it is about vampires, it is more the lazy stupid vampires. A cross between a vampire and a zombie, on the other hand a vampire is nothing more than a zombie anyway right. Also too many younger viewers are addicted to CGI effects, the really good special effects films don't needs CGI, this is one of them.
 Doesn't matter anyway, the details of the spread vampire-ism are left low key, we've all seen enough vampire/zombie movies to figure those details, the story lies the the survival of this small group. Yes that kind of story has been told a few times, but as with any movie, the characters make the movie, and these characters do make the movie.
 There's a few pop up scares, enough blood for the gore lovers but not too much. You will see remnants of films like "28 days later", "30 days of night", "I am Legend", "The Postman", yes I said The Postman, just some hints of it, simply because The Postman id a movie that has heart & emotion for the characters as well as action, the country side landscapes and visiting town to town give the feeling of that one.
  I didn't rate this one 5 stars simply because I disliked the ending, Its not a bad ending, I just prefer a different way of concluding movies like this. Never the less, you will enjoy the movie.
