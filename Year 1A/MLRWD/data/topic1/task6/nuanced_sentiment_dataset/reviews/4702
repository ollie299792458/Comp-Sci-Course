The movie is a true epic, set in Ancient China during the time of the 10 Kingdoms where areas of the land were restless coming under there own rule ,small kingdoms cropping up often through much blood shed and misery. This tale is an interesting version of a female Hamlet type love story that has its breath taking rises and falls as the story progresses. The costumes,uniforms, and background scenery the colors the padgentry is truly romantic and true to the age as well as the breath taking artistic input, it is simply a must see. The martial arts fighting scenes through-out the film, the flowing rythmic dance moves during the banquet, the tragic empothy you feel in each melody comes together so gracefuly without over shadowing the drive of the tale and feeling true to each scene. The icing to this marvelous mixture is the soul stirring theme song composed by Tan Dun titled "Only For Love", that plays prominently from the last scene through out most of the credits and the stiring vocals in Mandarin is a touch of class as this movie leaves you weeping and awe stricken for the ride you just took. It is incredible. The cast was strong and wholy satisfying in the portayal of the tale. I recommend srongly this movie to all of us who love a great story.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104AYGK">Legend of the Black Scorpion</a>
