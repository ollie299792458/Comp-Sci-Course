You can read reviews of the movie anywhere, so on that topic I'll just say that I was glad I saw it once, but it's probably the least likely of my HD DVD collection to be watched again.  (I bought the movie because I couldn't find it in the video stores here in Japan, and I wanted to see it.)

Beyond the movie itself, which looks and sounds pretty good, as it is on HD DVD, there's really not much to enjoy on the disk.  There's a minimal number of deleted scenes, none of which are especially memorable or interesting, and despite the fact that this is the "Unrated version" it lacks the ability watch the original theatrical release, which would be extremely easy to add as a feature.  The other special features are just the theatrical trailer and a making of documentary that I tried to watch for a few minutes before giving up on.

Honestly, I can't say I'm too surprised, as this is the kind of movie that's nice to rent but unnecessary to own, but for those who liked the movie enough in the theater to spend money to buy the movie on HD DVD, the option to watch the version seeing in the theater seems like an obvious inclusion to me.

If, after reading this, you're still thinking of buying it, one thing that might help you save a few bucks is that this isn't a movie that really needs the extra video or audio quality of HD DVD, and certainly doesn't take advantage of the extra features it offers.  If you really want to own it, picking up a copy on DVD should be fine for the vast majority.
