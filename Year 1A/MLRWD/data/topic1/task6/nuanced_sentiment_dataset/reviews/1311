There's not a whole lot to say that others haven't already said, but here goes anyway...

As a huge Robin Williams fan, especially of his darker work, I was very eager to see World's Greatest Dad.  When it was over, I was very happy I decided to rent it on demand rather than buy it.

The movie isn't bad, per say, just not great and probably not something I'd ever have the hankering to pull out and watch over again.  As a novelist myself, I found the storyline of the film to be rather alluring, but not all together enduring.  It was hard for me to find much to like in any of the characters really.  To be perfectly honest, I found the most interesting of them to be the old woman who hoards newspapers because she's afraid to throw anything away (she's convinced that if she does, something terrible will happen).

***SPOILER WARNING***

Williams' character, Lance, has some admirable qualities, but I found it hard to get past his actions after the death of his son.  Using it to garner attention for himself seems pretty ghastly to me.  But, he does tell the truth in the end, so...

***END SPOLIER***

All in all, The World's Greatest Dad isn't a bad movie by any means, nor is it a great one.  It's a bit raunchy and very dark, but an adequete way to spend an hour and a half.  I would certainly reccomend renting it before purchasing as it seems destined to be the type of movie you either love or hate (and most likely headed towards a semi-cult following in the year to come) with very little falling in between.
