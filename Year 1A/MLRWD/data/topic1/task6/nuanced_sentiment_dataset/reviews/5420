The director of the first Twilight movie, Catherine Hardwicke, was changed over to Chris Weitz, which I found changed the feel of the movie a great deal.  I don't know if I can credit him with the change in Bella's (Kristen Stewart) acting or if some other force took control of her body, but I am thankful.  She has done away with the excessive sputtering that was overly comical in the first film.  (Remember the hospital scene where Edward was going to leave her?  I think the lines went something like "I...but...no...you...can't...no...no...why...whyr...shio...as.....whiiii...")  Her twitches have been toned down and her eye flickering was kept to a minimum.

Those that are Team Jacob will be happy for all of those shirtless scenes he has.  And Taylor Lautner deserves all the ooh's and aah's he received.  His acting chops are still nothing to be raved about, but he's trying, and he worked his butt off to get this role, so that bumps him up a notch in my book.

Team Edward fans need not worry.  Even though New Moon focuses more on Bella and Jacob's relationship, Edward (Robert Pattinson) makes appearances throughout.  However, Edwards shirtless scenes did not evoke anything from the audience like Jacobs scenes did.  Edward is just a pale, thin, vampire, what do you expect.  (And I'm Team Edward!)

So while the acting was so-so in many parts, it's still an entertaining film, especially for  teenagers and fans of the books.  I look forward to Eclipse, which will be out on June 30, 2010, where I hope to see more of the supporting cast.  (The best actors of the bunch are hidden in the back.)
