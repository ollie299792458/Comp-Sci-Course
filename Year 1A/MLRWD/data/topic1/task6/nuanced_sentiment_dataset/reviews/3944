The film owes much to the intervention of the producers with a first time director, and the DVD shows just how the film came together, as well as how it potentially may have derailed itself.
This film, as an end product, works superbly; it has a conceptual flow, great humour, and some masterful contributors.
The source material is in fact Three comics, with a couple of follow ups... all of which I have never seen( Except in one of the Featurettes), and based on the DVD  extras and comments from various sources, I have no wish to see ... mainly because Deepak  Chopras son is one of the authors of the text of the original comic which was helmed specifically  with a film in mind.
I am not a John Woo fan, but the director does seem to be, and the film succeeds in spite of this  handicap.
Bottom line is that this film is a popcorn flic, and any attempts at analysis is going to fall flat. Chow Yun-Fat's humourous delivery, as well as Sean William Scott's skill at humour save this film on many levels.
The commentarys, and both are definitely worth a listen, detail the production as well as the many "cooks" who went in to make this cook to perfection. The writers track show just how far this story could have been derailed, and the featurettes coupled together with the deleted scene, and the alternate ending show what we were saved from.
In my opinion, this is one of the few films that justify the studio intervention process, and the constant flow of test screenings.
Bundles of Trivia abound in the commentaries and the featurettes to make this a rich DVD  package, and certainly do make it obvious, that the studio helped guide a talented director from committing to film some major mistakes.
Worth every penny for the film ... and the DVD  extras show the behind the scenes changes that help a film gestate and eventually become a very workable and watchable film.
