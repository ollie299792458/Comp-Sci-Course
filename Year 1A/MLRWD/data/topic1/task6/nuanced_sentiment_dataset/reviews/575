The fan collectives are really good star trek materials. But when Klingons are included in it it has lost its meaning in the process. Why because its not possible to please all klingon fans with just 4 discs. There had to be more.

Although they brought the key episodes for Klingons there are many with no meaning at all. We start with the best Klingon episodes from TOS.Then we continue with Enterprise but, come on do you really think that Enterprise's pilot is a klingon episode. Just it has klingons in it (for a couple of minutes, in a 90 minute show), it doesnt mean that it must be included in this collection. I mean i dont complain about enterprise but i dont think that this episode belongs to this collection. Then comes the great TNG episodes. Then we continue with some of the best DS9 episodes. Then again there is Sword of Kahless it's an okey episode but i would rather prefer "You are cordially invited..." to see the marital traditions of the Klingon race. Plus it would be more fun to watch. And there are more DS9 episodes about Klingons that could have been included in this collection.

And finally my last complaint: Voyager's the barge of the death. Horrible, i mean really horrible probably one of the lacking episodes of the great series Voyager. Probably they included this episode to just squeeze in Belonna Torres and Voyager in the collection.

Anyway, as always you get your money's worth with this collection. Plus text commenteries are very detailed and fun to read. I'm giving four stars because i believe there could be better klingon episodes in the collection. But then agian to receive the perfect Klingon collection they had make a 8 or 9 disc set.

If you are a Star Trek fan you shoul get this collection.
