What can I say, this is yet another one of those DVD's you have to have in your collection. Mel Brooks is a master at doing parodys and site gags, and this movie shows it. While not being as good as Blazing Saddles, the DVD is still scoring extremely high. I've owned this movie on every format excluding LaserDisc and including Beta, and I must say, this is the best transfer I've seen. The original transfers had a "washed-out" look to them, and the audio was sub-par. The DVD is absolutely amazing, the picture is clear and sharp, the colors are much better, you can even see Dark Helmet spit coffee on the camera, something I hadn't seen before. This dual-sided DVD features the 4:3 Pan-and-Scan (for you old fogies who want a full screen) and the wide screen presentations, including audio commentary by Brooks recorded in 96, and a wonderful Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track which was mastered extremely well. If you know someone who likes Brooks, pick the DVD up as a gift, trust me, they'll love you for it.
