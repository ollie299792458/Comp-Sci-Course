First off, there are 2 versions of the box set. There is the original first release that comes with an embossed tin like the others in this series set where the lion head is raised up a little bit. It also comes with a quad fold insert that holds the discs and it covered with artwork and an accompanying booklet that describes the episodes and other info about the series. If you look at the pictures you should be able to see what I am describing. The other version comes in a smooth flat tin case and instead of a fold out with artwork the discs come in a standard plastic multi-dvd case. It also doesn't contain the booklet that describes the episodes and other info about the series! I haven't been able to confirm this yet but I heard that the flat tins do not contain the bonus content. So, if you are a collector you might want to contact the seller and make sure you are getting the correct version! If you just want the episodes than either version will be fine.

As far as the show itself, the quality and work that has gone into bringing this series to DVD is one of the best if not the best. They went above and beyond. I loved watching the series as kid!
