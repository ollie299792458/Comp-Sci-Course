Ok, so this movie won't win any Oscars, but it's not as bad as most of the reviewers say!  The movie does have a lot of action sequences that are pretty cool...all little far-fectched, but still cool.  It also actually has somewhat of a followable plot.  I thought the prophecies coming true to show CYF (Chow Yun-Fat) that SWS (Seann William Scott) was the next heir to guard the secrets of the Scroll were pretty clever.  Also, adding a female hero, Jade (daughter of Ivan the Terrible) was a cool twist.  It did get a little out-of-control with the Nazi regaining his youth and using mind reading machines, but this film didn't claim to be a documentary.

All in all I was entertained.  SWS played a believable role and was able to effectively break away from his American Pie stereotypical roles.  CYF played this role the best could.  Yes it was a weaker role than we're used to seeing.  The supporting characters played nicely into the story, including the British villian of the subway, Funktastic.  A cool twist on a bad guy.

After boiling all this down, less than 3 stars isn't fair.
