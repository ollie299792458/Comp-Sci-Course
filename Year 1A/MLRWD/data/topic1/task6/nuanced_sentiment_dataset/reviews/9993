YOU WILL NOT VIEW THIS MOVIE AND NOT HAVE IT HAVE SOME SORT OF EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE. THIS FILM BRINGS TO LIFE THE HARSH REALISM THAT SOCIETY HATES. IT ACCURATELY DEPICTS THE CLOSE-MINDEDNESS OF SOCIETY TOWARDS CERTAIN PEOPLE. THIS FILM, BASED UPON THE LIFE OF BRANDON TEENA, IS A POWERFUL FILM TO BEHOLD.
IN A SOCIETY THAT IS FULL OF RACISM AND VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF HATRED, THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THE HATE FIRST HAND.
THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE WITNESSES THIS FIRST HAND AND AT THE SAME TIME TRIES TO COME TO GRIPS WITH HER OWN LIFE!!!
THIS FILM, IN MY OPINION, IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE OF IT'S REALISM.
I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CANNOT CHOOSE WHO THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH!!
THIS FILM, WITH MANY SEQUENCES THAT ARE VERY HARD TO WATCH, SHOW IN DETAIL THE HATE THAT SOCIETY SHOWS TO SOME PEOPLE.
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ONLY VIEW THIS FILM IF YOU ARE OPEN-MINDED.
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD SIMPLY TOSS THIS MOVIE OUT OF THEIR "TO SEE" LIST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE STORY.
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE, AFTER VIEWING THE FILM, THAT MIGHT EVEN
SAY THAT THE MOVIE IS TRASH.
HOWEVER, ANYONE THAT WOULD SAY THAT, IS TOO CLOSE-MINDED AND THEY NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH "THE REAL WORLD."
EVERYONE HAS A CHOICE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE TO LIVE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE INDIVIDUALS' CHOICE TO MAKE...AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT CHOOSE THE SAME SEXUAL PREFERENCES FOR OURSELVES, WE MUST LEARN TO RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S CHOICES!!!
THIS MOVIE HAS A DEPRESSING FEELING THROUGHOUT AND IT FEELS AS IF THE MOVIE MAKES THE AUDIENCE FEEL EVERY EMOTION THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE FEELING.
THE MOVIE WAS INTERESTING FROM BEGINNING TO END. I JUST HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE THE MESSAGE THAT IT BRINGS.
IT IS A MESSAGE TARGETED TO THE MANY PEOPLE THAT SHOW HATE TO OTHERS BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER SEXUAL CHOICES OR DECISIONS.
IN OTHER WORDS, AS INDIVIDUALS, WE NEED TO RESPECT EACH OTHERS CHOICES OF LIFESTYLE, SEXUAL PREFERENCES, ETC.
I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE IS THIS:
WE ARE WHO WE ARE, AND WHO WE MUST BE, IS WHO WE ARE!!
WE MUST BE OURSELVES!!!
WITH A STORY AS COMPELLING AND TOUCHING AS THIS, IT IS SURE TO STIR UP SOME EMOTIONS WITHIN YOU. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT ALL.
SO DON'T LOOK AT THIS MOVIE AND LAUGH, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, SEE IT WITH AN OPEN MIND!! IT DESERVES JUST THAT- AN OPEN MIND!!!
THE DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE BY HILLARY SWANK IS CAPTIVATING AND CHLOE SEVIGNY SHOWS US HER ACTING TALENTS AS WELL!!
THE ACTING IS TOP-NOTCH BY THESE TWO ACTRESSES, BOTH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR AND WON NUMEROUS AWARDS!!
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ROLES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND APPRECIATED.
THE DRAMA IS IN PLACE AND IT TARGETS YOUR EMOTIONS.
SO IF GOOD DRAMA IS YOUR THING, THEN SEE THIS FILM...AND AFTER IT TOUCHES YOUR LIFE, MAYBE THE EXISTING HATE WILL GO AWAY!!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE IN IT'S OWN RIGHT AND IT HAS LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION ON MY LIFE. IT MAY DO THE SAME TO YOU!!
FEEL THE PAIN - SEE THE HURT - PUT YOURSELF IN HER SHOES-
BECAUSE THEN, AND ONLY THEN, WILL YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!
