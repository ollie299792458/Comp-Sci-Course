Man on a Ledge is about just that, at first. It later turns into a plot with twist, turns, and of course not everything is as it seems. The previews for this movie had my interest when i saw how flashy and fast paced the movie looked like, i admit i do enjoy a mindless drama with gunfights and dramatic scenes from time to time. I decided to take a chance and check it out. To my surprise (i had been expecting a train wreck) i found myself enjoying a lot about this movie. This is one of those guilty pleasures, a movie that you and your friends can rent and watch one night when there might be nothing else to do, or if you just want to see whats new at Redbox for the moment. Heres the rundown:

Man on a Ledge stars Sam Worthington as a desperate man named Nick who has a plan to clear his name of something bad that happened to him, which naturally involves him getting out onto a ledge for the whole world to see. From there the movie gets into plot twists, action, more close calls than you can even begin to imagine as Nick shows the police that there is something more than just him thinking about ending his life. The movie also has  a decent if not somewhat predictable ending. (at least for me, you might be surprised!) I will say that Ed Harris does a wonderful job in the movie as the opposer to Worthington, (I'm just a big fan of Harris) and its always nice to see Jamie Bell as he costars as nick's brother in a movie (he is in Defiance and Adventures of Tintin) so the supporting cast does a good job in keeping the movie seem fresh.

There are car chases, break ins, spy gadgets, and a lot of dizzying views from up top where nick is in this movie! Bottom line, this movie is a worthy rental and perhaps worthy of your money to buy and keep. Again a somewhat predictable but definitely enjoyable movie that has all the necessary blends to make a moderate drama. I just didn't like Worthington's hair haha.
