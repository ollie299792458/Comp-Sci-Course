If you are unfamiliar with the incredible Resident Evil video games, watching this movie won't make you want to try them out.  And if you're a fan them, like myself, you're going to be set up for extreme disappointment.
First of all, there's not much here in common with the games, other than zombies and an occasional mention of the T-virus or some other phrase from the games.  Secondly, there is nothing frightening about this movie.  Unlike the games, all the instances of violence/gore/shock come across as very campy rather than scary.  Actually, "campy" may be the wrong word to use, as that would imply a bit of lightheartedness- this movie takes itself *way* too seriously.  
You feel very little tension or buildup while watching, and you'll find yourself looking at the packaging halfway through to find out what the running time is.  It's just plain boring.  And of course, there's a setup for a sequel no one is asking them to make.
The only impressive thing about this film is the performance of lead actress Milla Jovovich, who seems to be the only involved in the movie who realizes this is based on a VIDEO GAME, not Shakespeare.  She did a great job considering the quality of the movie.  On the other hand, Michelle Rodriguez gives an eye-rollingly melodramatic performance as the token "tough chick."  The other actors either just stand around, get killed, or most likely, both.
But who knows, maybe the upcoming sequel will be better.  But not likely.
