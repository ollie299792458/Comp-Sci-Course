This is a movie that is both well acted and exciting.  It is based on real events taking place in Peru during the period of the Shining Path "revolution".  It is fictional history, but the overall plot and events are based on actual occurences (with considerable license in order to make the film entertaining).  Abimael Guzman becomes Ezekiel in the film, and the story centers on the attempt by a security official to locate the revolutionary leader.  The actor who portrays the official is convincing, and a most attractive figure, as are his associates.  There are authentic scenarios, even if shot in Ecuador, Spain, and Portugal.  The use of Quechua in key places (with English sub-titles) added to the authenticity of the film.
The  film is a captivating adventure that takes the viewer deep into the urban and rural living zones of South America, and like a mystery novel it is difficult to anticipate what is coming next and final outcomes.  It should be added that the dancing, artistic presentations, and decorations in the residences and buildings are elegant and very pleasant to experience throughout the film, and even in the final epilogue.
