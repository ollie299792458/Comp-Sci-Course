This is an interesting concept with too many problems within.  Here is a pill that makes you smart yet somehow Cooper always has problems!  He didn't know he was out of pills until he grabed the last one.  Never occured to him?  He forgot to pay his loan shark back with his millions of dollars of profit?  The worst of course, is that he successfully predicted a texting driver would crash into another car.  Out of all ways and means to prove this guy is brilliant, the movie has to resort to complete random chance.

Not to say it was terrible - it was entertaining but too many scenes threw me off.  It's a problem to have a genius run into problems he could have easily avoided.  The final scene is Cooper chewing down on De Niro when in fact that speech should be geared toward the audience, not some small character we don't care about and can't connect to.  There were not enough connections to everyday events (people) to engage us.

It's enjoyable but I wouldn't say go out of your way to see it.
