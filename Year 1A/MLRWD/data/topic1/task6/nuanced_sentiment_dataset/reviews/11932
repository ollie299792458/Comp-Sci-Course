What a wonderful movie.  This movie Cocoon takes place in a nursing home in a coastal town.  The inhabitants of the nursing home, Don Amache, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, and I can't remember any of the others escape the nursing home and find an indoor pool that didn't belong to them.  They played like children in the pool, until the pool manager told them they had no right to be there.  At that point they had found space cocoons with aliens inside.  Those cocoons were originally placed in the ocean, but had been placed in the pool.  In the end the residents
moved with the aliens to their planet so they could live forever.
The cast in this movie was wonderful, especially Gwen Verdon who played Bess McCarthy, her best role since DAMN YANKEES.  You are sure to love her.  She has red hair, buck teeth, her voice is like a quiet whisper.  I liked the part at the beginning when she was leading the residents in a dance singing.  "And swing em to the left, and swing 'em to the right.  Then you do the twist with all your might.  Shake it to the front and shake it to the back.  That's what we call dancing!"
This is a must have for anyone who likes action movies.
Enjoy
