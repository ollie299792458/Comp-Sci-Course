I watched this movie using the digital copy that came with it.  I asked an Amazon customer service person if the digital copy of this movie had expired and he said it did, because Bueno Vista, Paramount, and Disney digital copies only last two years.  Wouldn't you know it, it's been 2.3 years since this movie came out.  However, I tried installing in iTunes and voila, it worked! I guess someone in Disney forgot to turn the dedicated digital copy server off?  These 10+ gigabyte films take up 1-2 gigabytes on an iPod, which somehow fit on 32 gigabytes.  Interestingly enough, my computer didn't have 2 gigabytes free so the movie download crashed on me.  After some deleting I tried again.  Thankfully, using the code from the enclosed pamphlet again afforded me a workable copy.

I found the product to have an annoying "letterbox" format that created big black rectangles on my iPod Touch, which was terrible because the iPod Touch isn't that big of a screen in the first place. The movie was very hard to watch.

I found the film to be really slow and tamed.  This movie was based on a book with the same name about a taxi driver driving two small alien fugitives around.  Disney chose The Rock (Vin Diesel) to be the taxi driver hero.  The Rock puts up an excellent act, but the plot was so dry I slept through it.  I'll give it an extra star for the educational lesson of digital copies.
