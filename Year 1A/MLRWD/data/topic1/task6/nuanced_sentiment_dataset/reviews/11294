REGARDING THE MOVIE ITSELF:
Being a fan of "300", I reluctantly agreed to see this movie at the urging of my older brother. My actual statement to him when he picked up the box at our local video rental place was "Are you kidding me?! Sean Maguire couldn't carry Gerard Butler's codpiece... Let alone fill it."

However, I was pleasantly surprised by and actually enjoyed "Meet The Spartans"... There are a few slow spots in the movie that just aren't that funny, but there are others that are hilarious. Ultimately it is what it is: a spoof movie.

If you enjoy movies like the "Scary Movie" franchise, and it's spin offs... Then consider "Meet The Spartans" a distant cousin.

I would also say that while it's not required to see "300" before you see "Meet The Spartans", it would be beneficial. Roughly 85% of "Meet The Spartans" specifically parodies "300", so having a knowledge of what's being made fun of can make the jokes that much more funny.

REGARDING THE "UNRATED PIT OF DEATH EDITION" DVD:
This "special edition" isn't very special. A growing trend that saddens me, and I blame it largely on the push to convert to Blu-Ray. The special features found on this disc would be expected (at the very least) on a standard edition DVD. Disappointing as a "special edition" anything.

There was one pop cultural reference that wasn't included, but should have been kicked into the "Pit Of Death": The Paparazzi... Now THAT would have made this a 5 STAR MOVIE!
