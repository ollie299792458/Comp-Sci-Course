In all fairness, the "Drawn Together" t.v. show never was my favorite. I would only watch it when nothing else was on. I thought the concept behind the show- a bunch of different style cartoon characters living together in a "reality show" type setting- was rather clever, the storytelling never lived up to the potential, at least in my opinion. Still, when I read that there was a "Drawn Together" movie, I wanted to see it. And since all the video stores in my small town went out of business, I either had to wait to see if Redbox might carry it eventually or see if I could find a copy online. I took a chance and bought the dvd. It was okay. Not great. Not bad. Worth watching once, but I'll likely never watch it again and will probably just give this to someone else to watch. As for the story, the Drawn Together cast is still living in their reality show house when Foxxy realizes that they can curse without being bleeped. She finds out that the show has been canceled but the Jew Producer just hasn't told them because he has an affection for them being they are his creations- fake characters similar to real ones. Once they find out they've been canceled, they are targeted by Jew Producer's boss who sends a robot-thing to hunt them down and erase them. The movie is filled with gross-out humor that was prevalent in the t.v. show. Captain Hero has a dead girlfriend he drags around everywhere. They stomp puppies while Jew Producer masturbates. Clara is grotesquely disfigured after she finds out she's not really a Disney princess. The Waldorf thing goes full-frontal with highly detailed genitalia. There's plenty of profanity and an interesting point-of-view lesbian love scene. If none of that scares you off (it didn't me), you will probably like to see how this storyline ends.
