This film is about a wealthy business man played by Michael Douglas who gets present for his birthday from his younger and wilder brother. The gift is a game. It is a very expensive and exclusive game played across the city using dozens of characters and involving an endless series of increasingly dangerous and unpleasant situations. The producers want you to believe that no real animosity can exist between brothers when one of them crosses the line,grandiously. If I had been the wealthy business man character and I had a younger brother like that I would not have been so forgiving.That is the problem for me with this movie. I think not all things are forgivable even within the frame of family, while the producer says all is forgivable, and to forgive is supreme even in the face of total garbage. The premise remains all consuming even though the film is filmed with excellent technical skill and the acting is perfect. The overall concept is just wrong.I call it a dangerous movie somehow because it suggest that such things like the game happen in real life, and should be OK, when I think such a game in real life would be the antithesis of OK, both during, before, and after.
