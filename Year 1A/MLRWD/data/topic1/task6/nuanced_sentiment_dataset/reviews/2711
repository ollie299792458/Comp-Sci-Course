For many western viewers, this may be the first "samurai" film that they have watched with only a vague and rudiamentary knowledge of who the samurai were, what they symbolized, and how they arose and declined in power.  The more one knows about the samurai, the more "phoney" this film appears to be.  Make no mistake, this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai.  This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo.  There's an early scene in the movie "SHOGUN" where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai.  I watched Kurosawa's "RAN" (before watching "THE LAST SAMURAI" in the cinema) where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers.  "THE LAST SAMURAI" looks good visually, but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise's egotism and Hollywood's cliches and obligatory plot devices (such as the weak "happy" ending).  Nonetheless, this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today's technocratic Japan.

By the way, Japan's new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines.  The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled.  On the other hand, it's a Hollywood film where it is too commercially risky to cast Tom Cruise as a German officer named "Fritz" who drowns his sorrows in shnapps instead of whisky.
