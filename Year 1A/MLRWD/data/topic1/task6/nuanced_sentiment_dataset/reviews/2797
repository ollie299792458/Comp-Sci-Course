Made during World War 2 at ta time the Americans were making their entry into the war this is a blatantly pro American propaganda film. But viewed as such it is quite o.k. and even stands out among others of the time like Wake Island and Gudalcanal Diary. Bogart is the giant of the film and acts the cool sgt holding a motley group of men together against the Boche (German soldiers).

The Germans here are an evil and treacherous lot and little to like about them, the motley crew are soldiers from almost every corner of the world, Frenchie the Frenchman, Tambul the Sudanese SM, an Ozzie, several Brits and Americans and the second star of the show a rare example of a M3 Lee tank (discontinued in favor of the more famous M4 Sherman Tank) defend a desert Oasis against the Boche with names like Capt. von Schletow and Maj. Von Falken of course. A bit like a good western.

Of course the oasis is symbolic for the fight for freedom etc. and the end speech where Bogart lists the names of the fallen who have given their ultimate sacrifice gave me goose pimples (in a bad way).

I daresay the film isn't all that great and quite a different experience for a modern viewer but has 3 things going for it.

1) It is probably the best War time propaganda movie made
2) Bogart is his cool self, could even be war time sgt version of Philip Marlowe
3) Rare footage of a Lee Tank in action

All which make for an entertaining watch.
