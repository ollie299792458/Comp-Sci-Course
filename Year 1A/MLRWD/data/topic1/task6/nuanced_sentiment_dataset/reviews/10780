This time I wasn't too stupid for wasting my money on the second series. I double checked every description to see if it had closed captioning or subtitles and I didn't find anything. Although I can hear like most normal people with my hearing aids, I am hearing impaired and still miss out on things, so I rely heavily on CC or subtitles. Almost any other DVD I have ever bought automatically came with these features and yet I ended up making a bad purchase when I bought the first Xena series only to find there were none. Technology has come a long ways in filling in the void for Hearing Impaired and deaf people and yet Anchor Bay is still way behind.
I have been a dedicated fan of the Xena series and was very happy that the TV series had CC. The final episode that came out on DVD also had CC. So why did Anchor Bay choose to ignore this feature on the full season series? Anchor Bay could be making so much more money had they been more considerate. As I had stated in my previous review for the season one series, I absolutely refuse to purchase any more series without those features.
