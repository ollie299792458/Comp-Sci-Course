To be upfront, this is a critique, not praise. This is less about prophecies, and a lot more about trying to prove the accuracy of the Bible. More interesting were the archaeological findings, as I like reading histories, yet only a few tidbits show up (like evidence of Moses crossing the Red Sea) and then they are not mentioned again (seriously, the most miraculous act in the Old Testament, and they examine it for all of 2 minutes). This show is repetitive, with the narrator announcing a bit of information that is then repeated by the four experts that appear. There is no countering viewpoint to explain archaeological findings, nor any other prophecy from any other religion, both of which I found disappointing. I wanted a show about Prophecies--not a show trying to convince me that God exists.
  It is ludicrous when they use "Oh, I cannot calculate the odds of this or that happening" as proof that God must be at work. Well, I cannot calculate the odds for a single spermatozoa (out of millions) to reach and enter an ovum, nor can I calculate the odds of a marathon runner winning in under 2 hours and 10 minutes, but both events have happened. That is simply not a rational argument. Furthermore, to accept biblical authors/prophets as being prophets, one must know the date of their writings. Heck, in the Book of Daniel specific mention of king Cyrus (a historical figure) helps pinpoint the time of authorship...and that isn't mentioned (lazy film-making). Being wide-eyed and reverent to God is not proof!
  To sum up. This is trying to prove the existence of God. I respect their faith, but I fell asleep twice trying to make it thru this. Make of that what you will.
