Yes, it's stupid.  But it's still pretty funny.
Rob Schneider plays a traditional fish out of water role, having had the personality/soul/whatever of a beautiful young prissy coed transferred into his body (normally a 30 something semi-conscious, small-time thief).  The ensuing predicaments that he finds himself in, although already played out in at least 10 other movies I can think of, do prove to a humorous flavor to them that only Schneider can provide.  Although heavy on toilet and vaguely homoerotic humor, the movie manages to provide adequate chuckles throughout its 104-minute length.  Supported by a reasonably talented cast including Anna Faris, the Mowry Twins, Adam Sandler in a very one dimensional cameo, Michael O'Keefe (remember him from Caddy Shack?) as the coed's overly hormonal father, and a virtually unrecognizable Michelle Branch, Schneider manages to keep this movie slightly above the level of your typical teenage romp film.
The DVD is a moderately good package, including the movie, featurettes on each of the main characters and stunt production, a dozen or so deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and a very well done music video.  The big question is "Is it worth spending [$$$] to own?"  Well, if you are a big Rob Schneider fan...sure.  If not, then I would recommend renting it first, and deciding if it fits your tastes.
