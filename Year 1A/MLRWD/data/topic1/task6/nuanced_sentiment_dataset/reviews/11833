If you are a real fan of this timeless Dickens classic, don't bother with the Patrick Stewart version.  It doesn't have the right "feel".  The script is written with some modern style at times, and doesn't hold as true to Dickens words as other movies.  The staging is also modified, such as the scene where Scrooge is late for the exchange to sell his corn, and gets asked to donate to the poor.  The gentlemen seeking money for the poor instead come by Scrooge's office, and there is no scene where corn is sold.  Along with an awkward script and staging, Patrick Stewart doesn't seem right for the part.  There's a "modern feel" about the way he plays Scrooge is the best way I can describe it, as if he could have pulled an iPhone out of his pocket at any moment.  When I was a child we always watched the Alastair Sim version, which was my Mom's favorite.  I personally think the George C. Scott version is outstanding, and it is my favorite.  If you are a fan of this Dickens classic, stay away from Patrick's version, unless you are specifically a Patrick Stewart fan, and want it for that reason alone.
