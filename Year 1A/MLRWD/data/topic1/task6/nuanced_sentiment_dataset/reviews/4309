Now that the 2010 baseball season is in full swing ( pardon the pun ),it may be well to remind Red Sox enthusiasts, owing to their team's poor start, that it's a long season and that this movie should awaken thoughts of the 2004 season upon which this film is based. There has never been and in all likelihood never will again be such an heroic comeback that the Red Sox demonstrated in that unforgettable year.

This movie captures the flavor, and in minutiae, the excitement generated by this never-say-die team of superb athletes. Jimmy Fallon is an excellent microcosm of the avid Bostonian fan, who for years saw their team come close to winning the World Series, but in the end came up short. Drew Barrymore gives a fine performance as the at first understanding then gradually disenchanted girlfriend. Together they light up the screen with both their comedic talents and romantic sensiblilities.

Call it what you will: a very good date flick, a singularly nostalgic trip down memory lane, an escape to what baseball can do one's psyche, or any or all of the above. In short, it is and was a timely piece of filmmaking.
