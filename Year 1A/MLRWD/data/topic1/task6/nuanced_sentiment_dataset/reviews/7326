This movie is nothing more than a disappointing load of garbage, better-suited to be found on network television as a palatable-for-the-masses made-for-TV movie brought to you by Hallmark. 
Plot holes abound. To wit: it was never explained what the motivation was for Dan Hedaya's character's life-long vendetta against the Hurricane. Why all the effort? And every scene involving the Canadian troupe was cringe-inducing.  A contrived group of feel-good saviors.  If the movie is to be believed, the Hurricane was basically saved by a bunch of overacting cartoon characters. The story would have fared better had those characters been Scooby and the gang. 
Every "dramatic" portrayal was comical at best, except for Denzel's which was plain infuriating. Here he plays the same character he plays in every movie.  It's frustrating how poor this movie is and that it opened to glowing reviews. An Oscar nomination? Pshaw - what a laughable notion. 
It's deplorable that a compelling true-life story about an unconquerable human spirit could have been botched so profoundly, but there is NOTHING redeeming about this entire production. Usually if I rent a stinker I'll finish watching it on principle, just to get my couple of bucks worth.  Not this time.  This is the ONLY movie I ever returned without getting my money's worth.  I didn't even bother rewinding the tape in order to avoid the chance of it getting stuck in my VCR.  
Read the book instead.
