I had the misfortune of watching this version of Oliver Twist on the local PBS station. It not only takes great "liberties" with Dickens' masterpiece, but it reflects an utter contempt for its values. It reflects current trends in English culture to deride Christianity, detest capitalism, and despise their history. While Oliver Twist is a timeless classic, it is very much a product of the Victorian Age. The producers of this mess wasted talents like Timothy Spall in order to make what John Henry Newman referred to as "smart hits at easy targets," with Christianity foremost among them. Dickens aimed his satire at hypocritical Christians, not all of them; he worked to improve state institutions, and he did not unilaterally attack all of them. He was not the most nuanced of writers--he still had a quaint belief in things like good and evil--yet he was enough of an artist not to render these values according to class, race, or religion. The producers of this version of Oliver Twist should have done their research and kept their pet hatreds to themselves.
