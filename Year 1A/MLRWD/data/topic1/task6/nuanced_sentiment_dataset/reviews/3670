Well, this will be a quick review: "Until the Light takes us" isn't a bad black metal documentary inasmuch as there are interviews with a couple of icons in the scene, nevertheless, they don't mention other key facts in the scene such as extreme right wing point of views (despite Varg Vikerness is part of it and, in some way, the one who actually opened that gate in BM). In addition, while Fenriz and Vikerness are icons in the scene there are other people who played an important role in the black metal development, I'm talking about group members in Bathory, Emperor, etc

In conclusion, if you've been into black metal for a while, you'll enjoy the documentary although you may agree with my opinion. On the other hand, if you're new into black metal or someone who is just interested in the subject, you may want to watch this movie later 'cause it'll give you only a tiny part of the whole idea; in this case I'd strongly recommend the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0922915946">Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground New Edition</a> by Michael Moynihan and Didrik SÃ¸derlind which, in my opinion, is the most complete book about the black metal history and development.
