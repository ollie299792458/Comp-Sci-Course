Other reviewers have commented on the story so I'll not go into too much detail about Jimmy Stewart playing a widower looking after his family as the Civil War barks at his doorstep.
This film features a number of typical Andrew McLaglen scenes - for example the punch-up between the men of the family and some government officials who have come to take their horses.
I find it interesting that the film starts off with its tongue planted firmly in cheek and those scenes are generally amusing to watch. It is not long, however, before the film's tone changes when the youngest son (Boy) is taken prisoner simply because of an event that takes place near the beginning of the film (I won't spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the film). From that moment on the film becomes much darker in tone and events take their toll upon the family.
It is an enjoyable film, Jimmy Stewart (as ever) turns in a fine performance.
The picture quality is excellent with only one small scene looking slightly below par (I would rate it 95% in comparison with the rest of the film). There are no features bar a trailer.
This DVD release is ruined, however, by the fact that it is cropped. The film is 4:3 but for this release it has been matted to 1.85:1 and then enhanced. So come on, Universal - give us a proper print of this film for DVD.
4 stars for the film, 2 stars for the DVD release = 3 stars
