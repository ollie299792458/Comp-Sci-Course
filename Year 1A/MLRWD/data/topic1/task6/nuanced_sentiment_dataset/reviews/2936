I finally got around to finishing the book which was hard because I don't normally read this type of literature, but it was a gift from my niece and... also because my father was from the South and he was raised with hired help (black and white people both)...kinda felt like I should.

Loved the book...decided to watch the movie right after to compare and it was such a letdown. I understand it is hard to make a book become a 2 hour movie...a lot has to cut out, but things were changed that I didn't like and after reading the hoopla in pop- culture mags regarding the lady actors who portayed the maids?
 All I can say is Viola Davis was robbed! She deserved the oscar win. Octavia Spencer who played Minnie was fun to watch and she did a great job, but Minny's character was very subdued in the film compared to the book...Minny was much more complicated and moody...I didn't see any of that in Spencer's portayal. Viola played her character (Aibeleen)'right on' and I feel she could not have done much better...JMO, not that it means all that much.

I encourage people to read the book  as opposed to this movie even if it requires some effort. This novel is a great choice for book groups and for study in schools. It offers opportunity for honest dialogue about inquality...to identity the differences of inequalities between racial prejudice and that of social class. The book is important..everyone should read it and talk about it but the movie..well, it is okay, but that is all there is to it.
