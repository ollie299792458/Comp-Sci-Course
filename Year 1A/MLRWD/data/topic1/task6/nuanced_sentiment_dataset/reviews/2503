I am very disappointed with Weeds season 5.  The first two-three seasons were LOL, hilarious, riotous non-stop laughing.  But the latest season 5 is just an utter disappointment, lackluster, no laughs, and needs to retire now.  I thought Cecilia's character got totally lost in this season, the writers did not do a very good job with incorporating her usual raw humor that she was known for in the first couple of seasons.  Andy's character included, just not enough laughs and good writing.

I thought this season's whole premise of Nancy getting involved with the Mexican mafia, then getting pregnant by the mayor was just sheer ridiculousness and the way she treats her children, or lack there of, she's never around to raise her boys (in the first two seasons, the relationship between her and her boys was great!) and her character never really develops, it's staganant.

I hope Showtime either decides to retire this show, or get a new writer who can put some UMPH into the script and make it funny and hilarious again--the way it used to be!
