Just had a chance to review Blue Underground's release of this Fulci classic. The transfer is beautiful (far superior to the earlier Anchor Bay release) and the 5.1 English mix is terrific. It's great to have the Italian audio track available even though the movie was clearly shot in English (even though the dubbing still never syncs up you can see that it matches better than the Italian version does.)

It was common practice in Italy to revoice everything anyway - I guess recording location audio was just too much trouble.

I haven't had the opportunity to see the Shriek Show 2 disc collector's edition yet to compare picture quality but it would appear that the audio on Blue Underground's version is superior - looks like a mono mix only on the 2 disc version.

I'm curious to see how much reinstated footage Shriek Show provide - I'll probably end up buying both versions as I am a horror movie completist and I want to see the doco that's included on the 2nd disc of Shriek Show's version.

It's going to be hard to beat Blue Underground's version for picture quality though - the print is virtually flawless, which is a lot more than you can say for the movie itself. Fulci was never a great storyteller or visual stylist - he sure knows how to pile on the gore though.

Great menu design on this DVD also - I love the moving worms that pour out of the Zombie's face. Real sick.

3 stars for the actual movie but 5 stars for BU's transfer and remix.
