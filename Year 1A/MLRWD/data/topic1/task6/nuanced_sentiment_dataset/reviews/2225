Let me just say that some of the people really hammering on this film need to calm down a bit.  I don't think anyone is rolling around in the grave, and I don't think these actors had the absolute worst voices or anything else like what some of the reviewers are saying.  But oh well.  To each their own.

That said, it was an entertaining film, with some great music, and some surprisingly good singing, choreography and cinematography.  Were the arrangements better than the originals?  Of course not, they were different.  Was the film accurately or thoroughly portray the Vietnam era?  Of course not, it wasn't meant to.  Was there a fantastic storyline and plot?  Not fantastic, but enough to carry you to the next song or dance number and better than many films out today.

To those of you who are complaining that you wasted your money purchasing this film, I can only wonder why you did not rent it first like most people who are concerned about spending money wisely.  Using that as a complaint says more about you than it does the film.

While I was not expecting the greatest film of all time and so was fairly happy with the film overall, I could do without the appearances of Bono and Eddie Izzard.  While both of them are fine performers in their own right, they were completely unnecessary and even distracting in this film, in my opinion.  Were their performances any good?  so-so.  Needed?  Not in the least.

Anyways, just go rent the thing if you are interested in it.  If you like it, buy it.  If not, get on with things.  It's that easy.  But please, whatever you do, take the 1-star reviews out there with a grain of salt.  Some of those folks need to calm down a bit and get down from the high horse I think.
