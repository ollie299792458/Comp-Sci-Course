'28 days' has a good mix of humour, song, seriousness and fun which makes it an easier movie to watch than 'girl, interrupted.' 
like the classic 'the bell jar' and, more recently, 'girl interrupted', '28 days' explores the creative &amp; sensitive mind of women who refuse to live life by any normal rules.  
as a writer, i am always interested in watching movies about writers, but sandra bullock's creative outlet in this movie is more verbal and physical than written.  i would have liked to have seen her character creating something out of the madness that is alcoholism. instead, she's almost a bystander in her treatment program and we watch as she fights herself in a battle against alcohol addiction.  
the supporting characters are what makes this movie great, including Loudon Wainwright III as the "guitar man."  his songs add a deeper, serious touch to this film and are, as always, fabulous.  if you're interested in hearing more from Loudon, check out 'career moves' asin:... be sure to see him in concert the next time he visits your city -- you'll laugh and you'll cry.  he's the greatest. 
sandra bullock is luminous in this picture and i quite enjoyed watching it.  the flashback scenes to her childhood give more insight into her character than anything else in the film.  i will definitely recommend this one to friends.
