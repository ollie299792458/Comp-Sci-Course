This was an excellent film through and through! "Flammen & Citronen" ("Flame and Citron") 2008 and directed by Ole Christian Madsen, was set during the Nazi occupation of Denmark between April 1940 - October 1944, it tells the story (based on actual events) of two legendary Danish resistance fighters - Flammen (Thure Lindhart) and Citronen (Mads Mikkelsen from "After the Wedding") who were no longer certain to the point and purpose of their mission. This film was very honest in its depiction of the brutality of war, but without the glorification of the actions of one side versus the other side. Here the brutality is depicted by both sides (that's unbiased honesty), and it showed us the so-called enemy wasn't so easy to discern (sometimes they came from your side) like many American 'war' films would like you to believe. Here loyalties were questioned and tested, as to who can really be trusted during chaotic times like these (even love was tainted). I give the filmmaker a lot of credit for also showing that even the head of the Gestapo in Denmark - 'Hoffmann' (Christian Berkel), one of the characters called him the greatest mass murderer in Denmark, was not a stereotypical embodiment of evil (he actually respected his adversaries, especially - Flammen). All in all this was an excellent film depicting war for what it really is, a hoax and a crime. There are no heroes and winners when humankind is stripped of all humanity for the sake of - national pride, or any ideology that condones war and murder!! The entire cast in the film were absolutely fantastic. This is once again proof, that only non-Americans (I have yet to see a film made here to make me think otherwise, with the exception of Brian de Palma's "Redacted" 2007) can make films approaching a discourse that's closer to the truth of the matter! The DVD picture quality by 'MPI Home Video' was excellent. Danish Language (English subtitles), NTSC NR 136 mins.
