After a month's begging I permited my sons to rent the video and spend an evening watching it.  I was impressed with one point that is lacking in most modern movies - the concept of "patriotism".  We expected the gore and violence (being a movie about war), and thought they gave a good depiction of the suffering our forefathers endured to give birth to this nation. So many of our young people have no idea of what true freedom is, let alone how we got it in this nation.
  Now for the down side:  1.  The Church Scenes
  As a student of history, especially religious history, I find the doctrine taught in the church in the movie to be foreign to the Southern Protestantism that was prevelant in South Carolina during the War for Independence.  Gabriel was told upon entering the church that the congregation was "praying for the souls" of the three men hanging outside.  The Protestants of that time wouldn't dream of such a thing.  It was for the most part a very weak Protestantism, but not to the point of adopting the practice of praying for the dead.
2. The depiction of the British
  The Brits could at times be a nasty bunch, but the depiction of Tarlton (the obvious historic figure who was the bad guy in the movie) was way overblown.  Sure, he was nasty, but not the Freddy Kruger he was portrayed as in the film. In fact, one of the main reasons we won the war was due to the fact that so many Brits, even in Parliament, openly supported the American cause. Cornwallis's attitude in the movie is probably closer to the truth than most - that the colonists were "our brethren" and that normal relations would have to be reestablished after the war.
  All in all, it was a good time, but the History Channel is more interesting to those who want the down to earth truth.
