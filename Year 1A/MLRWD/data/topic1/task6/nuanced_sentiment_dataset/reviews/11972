I read what this movie was about before I watched it and I figured what I might be in for.  I thought this movie would not hold me over but to my surprise it did.  I have recently started watching a lot of Vincent Price movies lately and find myself always entertained with his character.  The Tingler was laughable at certain parts and I don't mean that in a bad way but merely in a fun way.  I found myself wondering what it would of been like to see the movie back when it was made.  I was really loving a part where people are in a movie theater and The Tingler is loose and the lights are off.  Just listening to the peoples panics and Vincent Price yelling about the Tingler made me like the film even more.  You can see the wires and the Tingler looks like some kind of a worm but it didn't matter to me since I found myself enjoying it especially considering the time it was made.  There was another really great part where color was used and it fit perfect and I would say it is probably my favorite scenes from the movie next to the pitch black theater.  If you are a fan of Vincent Price or fun old horror flicks I say watch it at least once and see what you think.

The special features though not many are nice to have and the sound and video of the movie is kind of what you expect nothing great but not bad or ugly.
