After seeing the funny SHE'S ALL THAT and the hilarious 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, I was hoping that the combo of Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles would make DOWN TO YOU one of the better teen movies to come down  the assembly line. It turns out I was wrong. However, let's start off with  the positive aspects of the film: I like the fact that we have finally  reached beyond the "high school" settings and into the college  crowd. I also like the fact that we see a little more emotion in the lead  characters, as they are faced with some of life's biggest challenges. But I  must admit that the negatives far outweigh the positives. The story  flounders frequently between being your typical 'teen' flick, a romantic  comedy and a serious drama with social issues. It's hard to really tell  whose side to take. Prinze Jr. and Stiles are good in their roles, but with  very little to do they seem almost decent to be in another movie. Even the  supporting cast lacks depth...Selma Blair and Shawn Hatosy are basically  used only as eye candy and seem almost inserted into slow points of the  film to keep you from falling asleep. Only Henry Winkler shines in a small  role as Prinze father. DOWN TO YOU is passable entertainment, but  definately not upto standards with some of the other 'teen' vehicles out  there today. DROUGH!
