I am so glad that Disney released this classic film back onto DVD. I missed the chance to purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TG9E2">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a> when it was released in 2004, and have debated whether or not to purchase it or wait til Disney re-releases it with more features etc. So when I saw that the new edition was going to be released I jumped on it! I am glad to say that the wait was well worth it and this release is outstanding!

The package states that the film received and all new digital remaster but other reviews have stated that it is the same remaster from the 2004 edition. Needless to say the quality is outstanding. I owned the VHS version of the film from my childhood but with so much wear and tear the film didn't last. The image is so clear it brings new life to the film. I do wish however that Disney would have considered a Blu-Ray release at the same time as the DVD release but the picture quality is so good, it didn't bother me too much.

I can't recommend this film highly enough it has always been one of my favorites, and now it can be part of your family collection for the next generation to experience the world of wonderland.
