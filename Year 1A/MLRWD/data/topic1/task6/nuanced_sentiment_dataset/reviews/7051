Ok now there are definately going to be people out there who don't like this movie.  It's not for everyone.  But for those who say it's horrible and not watchable GET A LIFE.  It is defintely watchable.  It wasn't acadamy award calliber but it was a decent chick flik.
I definately enjoyed seeing it with a bunch of my girlfriends.  And of course guys are gonna like it, they get to stare at Britney for an hour and a half.  The acting job by all stars was at least mediocre.  I think Britney actually did a commendable job.  Although she's no Julia Roberts she definately showed that she has potential. And I definately think she is a better actress than singer.
She showed a more vulnerable and softer side to the Britney that we see prancing on stage in those barely there outfits.  I definately enjoyed the movie.
OH and even if you aren't a Britney fan you might just want to give it a chance.  It was a decently done movie.  And to all you people out there who don't want to give Diva's a chance GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not all singers are bad actresses.  Lighten up a bit and just try to enjoy a movie for once instead of banning before the credits even roll.
