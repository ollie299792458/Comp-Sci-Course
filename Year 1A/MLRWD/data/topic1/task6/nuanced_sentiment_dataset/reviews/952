First of all,... Zeus is not a dry cleaner, Simon is not Russian. And to all those... that said the second Die Hard (Die Harder) was a good movie, they need to be locked up and forced to watched Die Harder until they have a phsycotic episode.... Remember, there are only small scripts, not small actors. Now about the first Die Hard. I have faith in my review because I have watched Die Hard no less then 75 times, possibly more, over a period of time. Some may say that some movie points are physically impossible. One such point is the problem of how McClane (Willis) supplies his 9MM pistol with the seemingly endless amount of ammunition that he uses to kill the majority of the terrorists. If you know anything about guns/ammo, you'll know that the gun all but two of the terrorists use is a 9MM MP5 sub-machine gun. That means it fires pistol bullets at an automatic rate. Simply put, that means when McClane wants to drop the bulky sub-machine gun, he can just empty the ammo from the MP5 magizines into the clip of the pistol he always has. A lot of the reviews I read mention the "extra" characters (mainly Dwane Robinson) that don't belong in movie. Gene Siskel himself said this. I know that I don't know more about giving movies a quality rating then Gene Siskel does, but I belive Dwane Robinson and any other "extras" help move the plot along, and provide a deeper storyline. A scene I CAN agree is cheesy and very impossible is the one where the last terrorist gets killed. I thing I learned while reading reviews is not to spoil major plot points, but I will say that that paticular terrorist could not possibly still be alive to get shot again. I may be being partial, but by the time that part in the movie comes, if you're an action fan like they come, you'll be so hyped that you'll need to watch it as many times as I did to notice that it's not possible. In fact, you probably won't even care! The whole last 15 minutes is extriemly exiting.
