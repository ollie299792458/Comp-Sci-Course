John, this hulking tall kid, kills this girl for making fun of his mom or something. And then he shows his friends and they basically have these very lackluster reactions. No one is scared, no one freaks out, and no one even thinks its incredibly cool. Crispin Glover's character tries to hide the body. The actual murderer John doesnt seem to care if he gets caught or not. He seriously acts like a walking brick. Keanu Reeve's brother in the movie is that annoying little brother from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094ARJ6">Teen Witch</a> ("A DOG! A DOG! A DOG!"). Crispin Glover is this schizoid freak who just drives around, tries to smoke weed, and hide that girl's body.  I didnt feel for any of the characters nor did I care for their plight. I am all for the disaffected youth movies, but this was just annoying and boring to watch.

And how is Keanu a "great" actor in this movie?  Keanu isnt a great actor in any movie!  He's a sobered version of Bill from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ6N">Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure</a> in EVERY role.

"Woah"
