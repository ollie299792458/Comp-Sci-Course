A brilliant team of scientists in an underground government lab have transformed animals from an invisible state and back.  Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is determined to be the first human to do it.  After his team successfully turns him invisible Sebastian is monitored and tested.  When the team decides to bring him back there is a problem and they almost lose him in the process.  Sebastian becomes agitated untill he realizes that he can do anything he wants.  Then Caine decides he want to remain invisible and will do anything to prevent his team from leaking out thier discovery. 
First let me say that the special effects are some of the best I have ever seen.  They are just jaw dropping.  Sadly thats about it.  The acting by Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue were ok but the supporting cast was horrible.  Also the characters were way under developed.  The only one they elaborated on was Sebastian, but then when his personality changes it doesnt make any sense.
The DVD is loaded.  It includes a making of documentary, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and more. The picture and sound are excellent and it is presented in widescreen.  All in all this is an entertaining flick with great effects and bad acting.
