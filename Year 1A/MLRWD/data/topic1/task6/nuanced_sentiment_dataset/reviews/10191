The Dalai Lama is the star of this documentary and he shines; the 40 of the "brightest minds" in the world - not so much.  For all their acclaimed smarts and after approximately a week "solving" all the world's problems the very best they could come up with was an international boycott of China!  Even after the Dalai Lama told them the reasons that a cross the broad boycott was a very bad idea the speaker asked if that meant that was a "yes" on his part.

I personally would have liked to have seen more, if anything, else the group came up with but from the film that seems about it, one bad, if not stupid and impractical idea.

The movie itself is extremely well photographed and the inter cut shots are very evocative. As a movie, it is excellent inasmuch as it shows the personality of the Dalai Lama, and unfortunately also those of the session attendees. Non-ego versus super-egos.

As for Harrison Ford, if you buy this for his participation (which I am sure he undertook for pure compassion), there isn't much; a brief opening and the reading of a couple of title cards.

It all is a learning experience, but I think for the price it screams rental.  The Dalai Lama makes all those smart folk look like a CPA convention trying to figure who owes what on the lunch tab.
