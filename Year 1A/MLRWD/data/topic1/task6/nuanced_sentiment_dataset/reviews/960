One of the few movies ever that looks directly into the soul of a person, this movie helps us see that perspective is everything.  If Elwood had continued to live as something he was not, he would have never discovered  that inside all of us is the beauty of our sense of whimsy and grace.  Elwood enjoys his life and is not afraid of being who he really is.  He  accepts himself and those around him.  His delightful and scatter-brain  sister keeps trying to make life make sense and have it be structured.  She  represents us all.  We want things to be the way they should be, not as  they are.  Most of the other characters are doing the same.  They are  running about at a frenetic and frenzied pace trying to make life work,  while Elwood simply lets it happen.  The opening scene is one where Elwood  tears up a letter and instead connects with the real person giving it to  him.  Throughout the movie he connects with people on a real and human  level. He often smells the flowers----quite  a lesson for us all.
