Granted, as it has been written before, "Snatch" breaks very little cinematic ground when compared to Guy Ritchie's equally entertaining debut "Lock Stock". He uses many of the same high octane editing and super smooth camera angles as well as snappy smart dialouge that is hip, profane and quotable much in the vein of Tarantino. And because of that overriding similarity to the previous film, "Snatch" a very very entertaining and intoxicating work in its own right, suffers from the "been there done that blues".
That said, "Snatch" possesses a phenomenal ensemble of character actors all playing at the top of their game. There is not a weak sister to be found in the 98.9% male cast (save for the all too brief turn by the charming twins!). Like Tarantino, Ritchie structures his films like novels. He manages to balance character exposition with true development. It is far too rare to see real character development in contemporary film.
Where Ritchie surpases Tarantino, is in his ability to be hip without resorting to the endless self-conscious parade of pop culture reference. Tarantino's characters are often too self aware, while Ritchie manages to create beings that live truly in the moment, without awareness of the world at large.
Ritchie does need ( like Tarantino!) to vary he work, or he will end up repeating himself endlessly and lose the audience he so richly deserves.
Snatch is a great DVD also. The extras are a delight. The "making of" documentary really shows care and insight. The atmosphere that Ritchie creates on the set fosters the high energy spunk of his movies. The deleted scenes add fleshing out to the detail heavy movie and are a blast in their own right. A special feature allows the viewer to re-insert the deleted scenes into the film. 
All in all, not a great movie, but an extremely entertaining story that out Tarantinos Tarantino.
