Blu-ray version, ASIN: B004NDJXOY

Someone lied to Gary Goldman.  In the audio commentary with him and Don Bluth, he starts off by saying the edition they are watching is not as good as what we will be eventually seeing, and they will be cleaning it up for the final product, taking out the scratches and dirt.  While he's saying that, there is an excessive amount of scratches and dirt on the screen.  That's not a nice thing to do to Mr. Goldman.  It does not look like any restoration work was done at all.  Now, if you are a film purist, and enjoy the 'original look' of the projected image, going so far as to wait until a film's last week at theaters, so you can enjoy that aged film quality, then this is the transfer for you.  This looks as if there was no digital processing done at all either, so no worry about waxy or overly glossy images here, nothing but pure grain and silt.

Sound was good, in all of it's DTS-HD 2.0 glory.  Yes, 2.0, no other English options.  Purists rejoice.

Also, there is no top menu, none.  Only a very minimal pop-up menu.  When you put the disc in, it runs a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang trailer, which you can only skip with fast forward, then the movie starts right up.

Maybe some day this film will get the respect it deserves, and a decent transfer and disc will be produced, but not today.  If you already have the DVD, there is no real reason to 'upgrade'.
