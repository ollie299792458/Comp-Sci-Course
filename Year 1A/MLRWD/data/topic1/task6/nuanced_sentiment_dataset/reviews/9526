To be honest, this movie had a lot of hype to live up to.  The Boogeyman is something that has existed for a long time now in our society and the movie had so much to fulfill.  Not everyone is going to like this movie, because everyone's view on horror and the Boogeyman is different.

From the beginning the movie was intense and used a lot of the classic loud sounds and the normal horror pranks that have been used over the years to make one's heart race.  The movie turned out to be decent and worth seeing, but it did not live up to its full potential.  The main thing that dragged it down, was the same thing that ruins some of the other movies that are out nowadays.  The Boogeyman was CGI and not very realistic.  The classic horror characters like the original boogeyman "Freddy Krueger," which was a real person in prosthetics and make up, is what made horror movies scary.  The more realistic something is, the better.  Besides that, I recommend that the movie should be atleast watched once.  Barry Watson did a terrific job with his character, and the rest of the movie was creepy enough to deserve a chance.
