The main problem with this sequel is that the Supporting British Cast are all in throw-away roles and they really give you no reason to care about them as people.  Setting the sequel in London was a good concept in that Catherine would be pitted against the legendary  repression and tight-assedness of the English.  The issue is that her opponents are all so boring, underutilized, and so lacking as actors that it continuously SEEMS as if Catherine is chewing up the scenery but the REAL problem is that they can't even begin to match her Gleeful Hedonistic Sociopathic Ferocity.

The secondary problem is that Catherine doesn't have a worthy opponent to spar with and so both she (and we the audience) are bored.

The film is nicely shot and the producers had the good sense to stick with the original score.

Anyway, Stone's performance in the original film was so amazing that even if she never has another good role again it won't matter as she's already established herself as one of the great actresses of her generation in a career-defining role which may never again be repeated by anyone.
