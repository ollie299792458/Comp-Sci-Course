I am generally very much against the Hollywood system that is too afraid to do something new and just continues to churn out sequels, reboots, reimaginings and rehashes of existing properties.

But I like Will Farrel a lot.  Yes, his schtick is fairly predictable, but I still find him funny and likeable.  He is the reason I gave this a shot, and I'm glad I did.

If they hadn't called this "Land of the Lost" I don't think it would've rubbed so many people the wrong way.  They could've tweaked it just a bit to move it away from the tv show, and it would've been fine, without all the baggage.

Anyway, this is a light-hearted, goofy movie with good performances.  I especially like Danny McBride and Jorma Taccone - they do an excellent job in their respective roles.

THere are a lot of very funny situations and plenty of quotable lines.  And I really like that this stays true to its own goofy vision all the way to the end.  I personally hate it when comedies feel the need to "have heart" or get sappy in the final third.  Pathos and poignancy can have a place in comedies, but you don't have to suddenly forget that you're making a comedy to include those.

I think the bottom line is that if you go in with low expectations you might be pleasantly surprised.  But, frankly, I've seen many "hit" comedies that are much less funny than this.
