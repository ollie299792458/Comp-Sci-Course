Before purchasing, I try to do due diligence, but in this case I screwed up and failed to notice that this series was produced by ABC Studios. My chagrin is compounded by my having been poised to buy the British series of the same name and by my knowing of myriad examples of inferior American remakes of foreign movies and TV series.

My dismay at learning ABC was behind this is due to the fact that, while I buy a lot of DVDs of movies and cable TV series, I do not watch a lot of TV, and except for some of their sports programming, I no longer watch the regular offerings of the broadcast networks - ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox. These networks, constrained by FCC regulations, skittish sponsors, and an audience that appears to prefer a sanitized, Disney-like universe, produce programming that, in my opinion, is far inferior to that of cable channels. (The exceptions - Homicide: Life on the Street comes to mind - are few and far between.)

Bottom line: If you find the CSI franchise enthralling, or consider 24 to be thought-provoking, you may find this series to be "groundbreaking." But compared with The Shield, The Sopranos, or The Wire, the ABC version of Life on Mars is a cartoon.
