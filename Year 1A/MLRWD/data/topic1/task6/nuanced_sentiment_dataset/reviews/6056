The idea behind this is a neccessary one and I'm surprised no one has made this film already. But..here it is. I found the dry humor quite good and would put it alongside "Spinal Tap" or some Micheal Moore productions. I can see it has ruffeled a few feathers here...even in the "North"..but that's great. I am quite glad that this has done so. Personally I think the alternate reality presented here is kinder than it could have been as I think life under the Confederate States of America would have been even more brutal that how it is presented here. The PBS/BBC/Ken Burns approach is an excellent, dead-on satirical approach. Some ideas are not fully explored as the CSA becomes a nuclear power with a racist hegonomy to impose on the world for example. This could have been a series or a 12 hour movie if it wanted to be with the resistance, tensions with exile community in Canada, etc.(For the rare those of us that could stomach such a thing). I suppse the CSA would have been just like having NAZI Germany 50 years earlier. The "speeches" by various Confederate personalities over the decades were very well written and capture and expand upon that type of rhetoric very well. By doing so, help demonstrate what a demented idea of a society this was. Funny stuff that seemed like it wrote itself. And, of course, the sucker punch is what seems to be familiar in THIS reality. One of my top 10 or 20 films becasue I love dry, satirical humor.
