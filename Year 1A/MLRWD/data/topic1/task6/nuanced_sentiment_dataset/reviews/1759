Look this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life it's not funny the actor's can't act and well the sotry is well stupid. First off let's start off the two boys:

Johnny Knoxville: Sure he was funny on jackass but in this he shows us why he should NOT be aloud to act in any movie he's too stupid in this and his charater has nothing to do at all he just tells Bo how to drive or just go around and screws with young women. And by the way since when does Knoxville know how to fight?

Seann Willam Scott:Okay so he's a little bit funny in this movie but still you can't help but feel sorry for him for taking such a stupid role in a movie playing a guy who's in love with his car?

moving on.....

Jessica Simpson:Okay she's HOT in this but she just can't act it's like she can't even speak english he only reson they got her to do this was becuse they needed someone sexy for teenage boys like me

Burt Reynolds:Okay so he looks good in that suit but he just can't do the whole EVIL VILLAIN thing so you don't like him or hate him in this movie and his plan STUPID as S@#T

and last but not least Willie Nelson let me save you the time and just say he should stick to music

So overall The Dukes of Hazzard just ani'nt got eough MOONSHINE to save it from becoming one of the biggest flops ever made....TWO THUMPS DOWN
