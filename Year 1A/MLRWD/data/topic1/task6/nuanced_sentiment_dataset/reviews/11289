You are supposed to feel bad for this kid after 50 girls fall in love with him. Anyway, the kid's just plain annoying and takes himself, and thus the movie takes itself; WAY TO SEROIUSLY? This film had great potential, but it quickly crashed into a regular teen movie, all the more of a crash since the movie tried to be all high-folootin and moral.

The main character was a self-pitying pretty, vapid airhead who spent the film snooping around a girls dorm and looking for that girl who he had meaningful, seroious, hear-warming, kinky sex in an elavator. In the meantime he tries to convince all the girls (who just all happen to be pretty), that he's really a very smart, sensitive, person (who happens to be pretty).

ALERT TO ALL NERDS!!! The main character of this movie is not one of you, and he doesn't stand for anything you stand for!!

This movie doesn't have a moral, but it's statement is 'BE That Kid, and you will have a lot of sex!) It's the same asinine conclusion as the conclusion of every other piece of teen-movie pulp that ever was turned out from Hollywood, (and this movie REEEKS of hollywood in its unrealistic plot 'twists',). THE FILM JUST WANTS YOU TO FEEL INSECURE ABOUT YOURSELF, and desire to fill a slightly different caricature than other movies. ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ARE TWO-DIMENSIONAL. Jeez, I can't tell you in words how much this movie pisses me off!

BLAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
