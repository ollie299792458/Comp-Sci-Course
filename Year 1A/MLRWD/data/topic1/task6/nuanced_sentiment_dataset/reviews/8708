It's my sons favorite movie.  What more can be said?  He watches it at least once a day, and he is 16 months.  Nothing else captures his interest like this movie, I think it's the VIBRANT COLORS, and awesome graphics.  This movie is really cute, and very realistic.  The actors did an awesome job, the voices really add a lot of personality to the characters.  It's also an all star cast, which I think makes it just that much better..  I personally think the movie is cute and funny.  It also has a moral to it - I mean "you don't have to be rich and famous to be a somebody - what counts is what's on the inside, and for you to be happy" - and the one line that others may deem "inappropriate" is when Oscar says "Who in the Halibut trips under water?"  It's hard to catch at first - because it is said so fast that you really have to listen for it to even catch it.  There is obviously also the whole reference to the "godfather" which some might find inappropriate,.. in the end though - There is dialogue that is not much worse than that on t.v. nowadays!  The rest of the movie has nothing "inappropriate" in it.  If you are still hesitant, then it's at least worth a rental...
