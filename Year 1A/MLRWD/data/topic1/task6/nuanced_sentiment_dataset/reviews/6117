Having never read the book, I'm ill-equipped to comment on whether the deficiencies of the plot and characters are due to the novel or the screenplay.  Nevertheless, the parallels betwee this movie and another De Niro picture "The Mission" are too strong.  OK - in "The Bridge..." the heroic order resisting evil Catholic worldliness is the Franciscan Order, while in "The Mission" it is the Jesuits.  But in both cases, the same theme develops - sinister, worldly, heirarchical Rome vs. well-intentioned, truly-Christian (probably socialist) renegade Order.

Granted that in both movies, broader themes are superimposed on the superficial stories.  In that sense, both movies are about martyrdom.  But, a martyrdom for the Self, rather than for God.

But all this would have been forgivable in "The Bridge..." if the acting had been worthwhile.  Sadly, most of the performances were sub-par.  The dialog was far from believable (whatever Lima's idiomatic conversation may have been).  De Niro in particular was noticably off his game.

Too bad, but no surprise in this era of thinly veiled agendas.
