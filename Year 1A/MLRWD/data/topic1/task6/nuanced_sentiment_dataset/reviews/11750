If you scrape at the surface, House Of Wax doesn't look very promising. Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray could all compete for the Most Arrogant, Least Believable and Stuck-Up Actor Awards in my book. The story itself is something we've heard and seen a thousand times before, and it's flavored with nu-metal and strip sequences. But surprisingly, it's actually a really decent film.

The first thing I notice is the opening sequence. It's startling, catches my attention and even throws me out of the loop a little bit. The way we're presented to the characters is not much of a big deal, it's actually quite ordinary. It may be hard to relate to them all, but I've seen a lot worse set ups in my time. At least the film moves forward to a new place without wasting all too much time.

Later we are given hints of something mysterious going on, and when the violent and effects-driven parts of the film kick in, it's all driving, well-made and a strong slasher film with a few small surprises to spare. The nature of the story makes it stand out, giving you a traditional movie in an unusual environment. Before it's all over, I'm definitely entertained.
