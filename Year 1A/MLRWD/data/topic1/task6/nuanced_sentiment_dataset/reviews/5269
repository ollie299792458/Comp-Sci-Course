I did not enjoy this film when I first saw it on television, because of the incoherent plot, but my opinion has changed after watching it again years later on DVD.  After all, this is the only James Bond film that unabashedly makes fun of the world of 007 through sarcasm and slapstick, and incorporates the psychedelic atmosphere of the mid to late 1960s, with an all star cast including David Niven, Peter Sellers, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Orson Welles, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress, arguably the best known Bond girl and only actress to appear in both an official Bond movie (Dr. No) and an unofficial one.  The musical score is pleasant, topped off by Dusty Springfield's memorable rendition of "The Look of Love".  Casino Royale is a welcomed alternative to the dark and humorless official Bond entries of Timothy Dalton and now Daniel Craig.  Life is frequently somber and challenging, let's at least have fun when watching 007.

Even if you dislike this movie, you may still want to purchase it to complement your James Bond collection, and for the bonus material; the 1954 CBS television program Casino Royale, the first ever 007 production for either TV or cinema that features American actor Barry Nelson (not Sean Connery) as the first James Bond, Linda Christian the first Bond girl, and Peter Lorre the first Bond villian.
