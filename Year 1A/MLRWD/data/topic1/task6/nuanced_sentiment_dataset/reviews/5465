i have been an alice cooper fan since the early 70's. i've met him, partied with him, seen him at least 20 times, and i admire him as much as just about anyone in music. alice is unique, original, energetic, excellent in concert, and one of the nicest persons you would ever meet. i couldn't wait for this dvd release. it was hyped as a new show and an alice cooper show like you have never seen before.  when i put this dvd in, i'm seeing the same old show i've been seeing forever it seems. come on alice. how many times do we have to see you decapitated or hung by the neck? we were seeing this ten years ago. it's getting really old. no one loves you more than i, but can't you come up with something new?  maybe you have too much on your plate and are not concentrating on your music enough because cds like "the eyes of alice cooper" and "along came a spider" really suck for someone who is capable of much better.  i also think this dvd is very weak compared to the last one. i hated to give it 3 stars, but actually thougt of giving it 2. sorry alice, but you are starting to bore me.
