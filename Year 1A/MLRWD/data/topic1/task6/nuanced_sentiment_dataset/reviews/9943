I don't like it... but who the hell am I?

David Lynch put fans of the TV show on notice when he opened Fire Walk With Me with a shot of TV set being smashed with an axe.  As a fanatical Twin Peaks devotee, I remember remarking to a friend that "it should have been called 'Fire Suck With Me'".

In retrospect, that may have been a little harsh.  What made Twin Peaks so absorbing for me was, in large measure, what makes any soap opera so addictive to its fans... story!  Twin Peaks took a big complicated story and let it unfold in a stylish and leisurely way.  You got to savor the mystery.  I loved the way that the element of the supernatural wasn't even introduced until the third episode, and that was in the most low-key way imaginable, with Agent Cooper explaining his dream about Tibet.

Where I am coming from is: I consider myself a fan of Lynch's more traditional narrative work.  Loved "Blue Velvet".  Loved "Wild At Heart".  Hated "Eraserhead".

In retrospect, I admire Lynch for making a film that was not a repackaging of old concepts, that would split the Peakies right down the middle. But I don't like it.

Not everything that I don't like about FWWM is Lynch's fault. After all, it wasn't Lynch's fault that, by the time the film was made, many of the cast looked kind of silly as high school students, their undeniable status as adults all the more obvious on the big screen.

On it's own, "Fire Walk With Me" is pretty interesting, but for a certain kind of fan, it's more of a footnote than a continuation of the classic TV series.

Here's a tip: I got my DVD copy in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50.  You may want to check your local WalMart before spending more.
