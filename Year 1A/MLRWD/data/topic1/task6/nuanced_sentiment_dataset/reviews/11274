I was totally disappointed when I watched this movie. The action didn't live up hype or even came to the level of action noted in the video games. The selection of fighters was highly questionable as well as their fight scenes. There was more action in the general stunts rather than the actual fights. This was a let down. They could have used CGI to display more complex fighters e.g. Jacks (weak- used average people in military-Goth gear), Yoshimitsu (weak-used a stunt man non MA), King (not in the movie)), but they didn't.

Did I say this movie was a down. However, if you are a collector of Gary Daniels movies you might want to add this to your collection. Gary plays Bryan Fury. The casting for this movie was about 40% on target, the use of the martial artist was highly questionable. There was a lot of open space i.e. lag time scenes and not enough action. It didn't keep my attention. I stopped and pulled out one of my reference books to go over my notes at times. My wife had to ask me to watch this with her. It was disappointing when you are suppose to have highly skilled MA fighters like Nina Williams and you have her and her sister in a questionable position (unless you are twisted and have no moral you may like this suggestive scene). Martial Law's fight scenes were also questionable. Steve Scott's role was questionable and  you have an unknown Russian fighter not in any of the games in the movie. This movie was a "miss",  much like the movie "Hulk" directed by Ang Lee.
