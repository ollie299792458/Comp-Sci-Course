I was so disgusted by this film that almost walked out of my living room! I put one star because that's as low as Amazon goes. This movie get's 0.1 star for being in color. That scores one tenth lower than Battlefield Earth, which only scored higher because it had better use of metal. How does this crap make it theatres? How do awesome books get translated into this crap? Why doesn't Michael Crichton write/review screen plays for movies based on his books? And if he did for this one, why did he shame himself and all his fans this way? Why did Richard Donner direct it? Why didn't they get more money for a Crichton adaptation? I'm upset. I didn't see this movie in the theater, because I heard it was too short and strayed from the book. So later on I rented it to satisfy my curiousity. Oh My God. They simplified the time travel process to 3D faxing...with mirrors! WTF??? No alternate universes? No Quantum foam...quantum foam makes me roam? Where do they get off adding to the plot and dropping key plot points? How dare reviewers compare it to Braveheart? The whole time I was was watching this "film" I couldn't help thinking, they based this movie on the Timeline blurb! It was cookie cutter action dribble. this is something you park your seven year old in front of so you and your girl can get some alone time. They stripped away everything anyone would care about. They should burn every last copy of this F-movie.
