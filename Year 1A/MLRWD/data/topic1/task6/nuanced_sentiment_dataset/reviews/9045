I'll start by saying that I'm not easily offended, so anyone that would suggest that I am slighting this movie due to some bias towards either the zombie subgenre or feature-length independent films can rest assured that I am an avid fan of the former and occasionally enjoy the latter.

Purchased on a whim from Wal-mart [and sadly not the discount bin], this is the only "film" I have ever stopped watching. I made it to the fetus being ripped from the teen mother and another teen having her head ripped from her shoulders before I ejected the movie in a rage and threw it in the trash.

First and foremost, using children -- especially infants [and it should go without say, fetuses] -- is cheap, gaudy, and is often nothing more than a gimmick employed by non-creative people that want to shock their audience.

E.g., watching a baby carriage swept toward the camera by a massive wave during a scene from The Day After Tomorrow (2004)

These "shocking" visuals often do nothing to further the story, which is my biggest issue with their inclusion in the film.

It's quite frankly embarrassing, and makes for an awkward situation when someone walks into the room only to see that scene.

Pet Cemetery did an excellent job of this, as did -- to my surprise -- Dawn of the Dead (2004). Automaton Transfusion, however, did not. Don't try to shock me or make my care with a heavy-handed attempt to rip at my heartstrings... which leads me to my second issue.

The ~$30,000-$50,000 budget should not have been tapped until at least 3 people over the age of 18 that were not a parent/guardian of the filmmakers read the script. I fully support creative minds -- regardless of their age -- but the plot [up until the point when I admittedly bailed] was juvenile, awkwardly-constructed, and reeked of "hey, what're you doing this weekend?".

I wish the filmmakers all the best, but can not in good conscience give this movie more than 1 star and highly recommend that you stay far, far way from it.
