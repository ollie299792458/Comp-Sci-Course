As far as documentaries go, this one isn't very good.  I was expecting to see a film on the rise and fall of an internet company.  Instead, I got CEO and buddy yell into a phone.  I was very disappointed not to find out about the day-to-day operations of the company, what the 200+ employees did all day while Kaleil was meeting with VC's, or why they waited until the night before the launch to first test their site (sheesh, no wonder the business failed).  Even knowing WHO the employees were would have been nice.  Otherwise, it makes Kaleil and Tom's talk of being a family, not a company, sound hollow.  
Even for what it was trying to do, by focusing on the two founders and their relationship, it didn't do very well.  There was so much I didn't know about Tom and Kaleil, no background information was given other than they had known each other since high school.  Where did they go to college?  We find out Kaleil left his investment banking job to work on govworks.com but what did Tom do before?  How did Kaleil come up with the idea of a website to pay parking tickets?  Who were the other founders and what were their roles in the company and relationship with Kaleil and Tom?  Why should we care about these guys?  I quickly found myself not caring about them, their company, or thier dog.
This could have been a good documentary if the directors had been more focused.  So much was left unexplained, I was more confused at the end then enlightened - not a good sign for a documentary.  I give it 2 stars, one for Tom's daughter (very cute little girl) and one for giving me a chance to laugh at two of the fools who ruined our previously healthy economy.
