** CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS **

The following brief critique refers to the "Ultimate Director's Cut" edition of "The Warriors" dvd, released in Australia late October, 2005.

Pros:

* Suburb sound (Dolby Digital 5.1) and picture quality (1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen) considering this film was released in 1979.

* Interesting new documentary split into 4 parts (each of approximately 15 minutes duration) includes Walter Hill, Michael Beck, David Patrick Kelly, James Remar and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.

Cons:

* Addition of comic-style frames and freezes slows the action, diluting the tension in parts, especially The Warriors' initial sighting of the Baseball Furies outside the subway.  I always liked the line at the end of the scene when Alax is captured in the park when a policeman says "Put that slime in the back" - this line is not in this version, overridden by a comic frame introducing the next scene.  Also the ending where The Warriors are walking along the beach has been cut drastically, instead opting for the comic frames with the closing credits.  I much preferred the long walk.

* No deleted scene of the original daytime Coney Island Boardwalk opening.  Whilst I certainly agree that the movie is more effective beginning at night, I was annoyed that there was reference to this original opening in the documentary but it was not included as a separate deleted scene.  I was under the impression that this would have been included.  A couple of people have criticized us "anal-retentive" fans to "get over it" but one must take into account just how much numerous people enjoy this movie.  If you are really into a particular movie, you are interested in any deleted / alternate scene, and to have that not included on the supposedly "Ultimate Director's Cut" was a real missed opportunity.

In summary, I would choose the traditional (non-director's cut) copy of the movie (sans Greek Mythology introduction and comic book frames) if I was introducing someone to this movie.

Thank you.
