Somewhere inside Igby Goes Down there's a good movie waiting to come out.  It never does.  Igby is one of the most cynical films ever made, and it makes the cardinal sin of thinking that dark sarcasm always equals laughs.  That is not the case here.  Igby throws together a bunch of unlikable characters and tries to get you to care about them.  But it's all too smug to draw you in.  The film is also a complete mess, jumping forward and backward in time abruptly, and never lingering in one place long enough for you to make a connection with any of the characters.  Keiran Culkin shows natural charisma as the troubled Igby, but he is largely wasted on a script that refuses to let his character grow or gain our sympathy.  Igby Goes Down also earn the dubious distinction of 2002's Best Score to a Bad Film.  All the music here is fantastic.  But even that can't help the film shed its Too Cool Indie attitude.  There have been connections between Igby and Catcher in the Rye.  But Catcher was good.  And Igby is bad.
