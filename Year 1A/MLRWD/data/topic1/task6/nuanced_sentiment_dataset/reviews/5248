My 6 yr old son loved this movie!! In Bibleman Combating the Commandant of Confusion, he learned that Satan uses many different ways to confuse us &; keep us from God. The action in the movie kept his attention as well a helped him learn this amazing lesson. He also learned that Chaos & Confusion go hand in hand. When you allow Satan to confuse you, chaos enters your life.

This movie is suggested for ages 6-10 &; that is about right. It is a live action video with lots of Scripture references & an amazing message. I strongly recommend any of the Bibleman DVD's. They have helped my son to learn Scripture, as well as many different amazing moral lessons that have helped him to make right choices in life. If you have a child who loves superheroes, this is a great DVD series for them to watch.
