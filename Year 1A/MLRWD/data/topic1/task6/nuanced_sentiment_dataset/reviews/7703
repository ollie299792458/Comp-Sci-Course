The box says that tis is supposed to be a sequel to The Hobbit.  Let me tell you if the only background for this movie you have is seeing the  Hobbit you are going to be in trouble.  
I got this movie because I had  just watched Ralph Bakshi's amazing film the Lord of the Rings.  That movie  is a must-see for any Tolkien fan.  The problem is tha the movie ends  before the story is over.  I think a sequel was anticipated but never  happened.  So, needing some closure, I picked up the Return of the King to  end th estory.  The characters aren't even comparable toBakshi's.  Roddy  MacDowell (an amazing actor) was terrible as Samwise, he was trying to turn  the lovable bumkin into Hamlet.  The Orcs and Ring Wraiths aren't  frightening.  Gandalf's character hasn't changed since The Hobbit and every  three minutes tehy break into a mindless song (How many times can we hear  Frodo of the nine fingers?).  This movie is good for a true Tolkien fan but  everyone else should just read the book.
