Murder by Numbers has an interesting, if derivative premise -- two high school students plotting what they think will be the perfect murder. The dramatic device lets the audience in on the crime and the investigation, so the tension arises as the antagonists and protagonists get closer to each other. This is nothing new and director Barbet Schroeder doesn't improve on the convention, but he overcomes a possible extended cliche by getting very good performances from most of his cast. Ryan Gosling is especially compelling and his subsequent work bears out the notion that he is a major talent. Sandra Bullock adds a new facet to her standard screen persona by playing a more aggressive character and her foil, Ben Chaplin, adds a nice touch as her sympathetic if puzzled partner. I was not much enamored of Michael Pitt's performance, though that may be a function of the way the character was written. His inwardness, if I may call it that, seemed overplayed at times, and the revelations of the character's actions and motives felt forced. This was probably, however, the most difficult role of all. I also had some problems with the final set piece at the ocean house, especially the sequence on the crumbling porch which looked very stagy and incongruous in style with the preceding pieces. But it is good, if not great, film. Bullock is always worth watching and her sparring with Gosling in this film was, for me, its highlight.
