All things considered, this flick has held up extraordinarily well over time. It's one of those rare, multi-faceted gems that has memorable characters and a great flow to it. Warning: if you aren't personally aware of the limitations of computers and communication technology in the 80's, you are probably going to be turned off by the revelation of several aspects of the plot. The "Why don't they just" syndrome will overtake your poor young brain.

But for those of us who remember (or can visualize) a world without a (readily accessible) internet, the espionage plot is adequate to further a larger story: that of master and student. The interactions between Remo (who begins his martial arts training at the lowest level) and his teacher Chiun are priceless and heartfelt, slapstick and simultaneously deep. They provide much of the lubrication for the clunkier espionage plot, wherein Remo is tasked to eliminate a corrupt official. I think the screenwriters knew this was the more important story (within the story), as the score of the film is very evenly split between two main themes... those of the aforementioned characters.

There's a lot of great action, especially for those afraid of heights. No cheesy CG effects... all real camera work. Just don't rack your brain too much and enjoy the characters, they really pull it off.
