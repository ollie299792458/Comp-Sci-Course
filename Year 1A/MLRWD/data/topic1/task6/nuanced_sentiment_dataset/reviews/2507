Okay. This film is undoubtably the most disturbing film I've ever seen and arguably the most harcore sexploitation piece of the 1970's. The rape scenes are so brutal and violent that they actually induce pain in the viewer.

The most interesting aspect of this movie is the viewer's motivation for viewing. It's one of two:
1) The viewer has somewhat perverse and violent sexual tendencies and only watches the movie to "get off", using it like a tool, a porno. This person does not care about the heroine's acting or gender implications.
2) The viewer is interested in astetics and a wide range of cinema genres and sub-genres, for that matter. This person observes the acting, cinematography, symbolism, gender implications, and is so knowledgeable about movies that he/she is familiar with 1970's cinematic underground including exploitation, sexploitation, blacksploitation, grindhouse, and slasher features.

So, the question is... are you a sexual deviant or an educated movie-goer?
