I just bought the Alien trilogy and began watching them starting with the first film.  The original Alien was just as good as I remembered from my childhood days.  The atmosphere and suspense is simply unmatched by this, the second movie.

From what I remembered from the second movie I was expecting much of the same suspense and creepiness but what I found was a cast of predictable if not altogether annoying characters.  Paxton plays the "hothead marine"(one of the most annoying of the characters), there is a "tough as nails" drill sergeant and a "tough as nails" woman marine who don't take no crap from nobody etc etc...Their antics hold up well with the general atmosphere of the movie which is akin to a Terminator movie rather than the first Alien film.  Overall I felt the acting was forced.  The first film didn't try to give much depth to the characters which was great.  This film tried too hard to make me feel sorry for characters or dislike characters...but I guess if Cameron didn't try to do this he really didn't have much else in the film that would draw my attention.  Basically by the end of the film I wanted the aliens to kill everyone so I didn't have to listen to any more predictable, shoddy dialogue.

I was surprised that this film recieved all the rave reviews that it did considering its far departure from the first.  I, for one, will take the original film any day over this one.
