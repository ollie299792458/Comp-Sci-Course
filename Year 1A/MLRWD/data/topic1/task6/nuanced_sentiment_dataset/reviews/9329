Robin Williams takes time off from hammy overacting and decides instead to bore us to tears with this trite melodrama. Phony to the core (it felt like a high school play rather than a realistic WWII setting), it lacked a  narrative flow and failed to generate any interest in the poorly drawn  characters. As said, it was refreshing to have Williams take a break from  his relentless mugging, but here he is so obviously employing a bad accent  that it is just as difficult to take him seriously. Scene after scene  passes before our eyes without drama or even a compelling reason to exist.  Moreover, the alleged hope that Jakob's radio "reports" was to  have inspired is neither demonstrated nor felt. And the ending? While it is  meant to be fantasy, it is difficult to imagine that the young girl had in  her memory an American jazz band complete with fashions she had never  witnessed. On what does she base this final delusion? Little makes sense  and when a film is this dry and lifeless, one is not inclined to figure it  out.
