A great little update of sorts for The Exorcist, featuring a half hour documentary [Very intriguing, especially if you liked the movie] on the making of the movie with interviews from the cast and crew. Now on to the movie itself, which is great of course. For any horror fan, this has to be considered as the ultimate movie. Upon seeing it again years later, I still get goosebumps and I can't imagine people laughing at it in recent screenings. It has and is no comedy.

 The female leads are excellent, particularly Linda Blair in the infamous role as Reagan, the possessed child. Mercedes Mcambridge is excellent in the horrific role as the demon's voice, and Ellen Burstyn gives a very believeable and respectable performance as the obviously distressed mother. The priests as well, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are also excellent. However, if you take offense to or have very strong religous beliefs, then this movie may offend you. Just a warning.

 The famous parts of this movie are the effects [Spinning head, demonic face, flying vomit and then some], and the excellent score all around. The effects still hold up well today, although the shock value has obviously been lessened. The score itself is chilling, the best since Psycho. Jack Nitzche does an excellent job with it and should have been awarded for his work. The novel has been excellently adapted to fit the screen by Blatty, the screenplay is believeable and excellent, and the novel is another must for any fans of the horror genre.

 Overall, the scares in this movie are frequent and the very thought alone can scare some people. I'd say rent it for any real movie fan, but don't say I didn't warn you if you think its over the top. To me however, this movie is perfect and could not have been made better, and I hope others can recognize the talent and hardwork that went into this movie.
