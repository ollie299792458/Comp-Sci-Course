"The Tooth Fairy" just barely earns a worthy place beside "The Santa Clause" on families' DVD shelves.

However, make no mistake, Dwayne Johnson is not Tim Allen and Twentieth Century Fox is not Walt Disney Pictures.

Johnson stars as minor-league hockey player Derek Thompson who is sentenced to serve two weeks of tooth fairy duty after crushing the dreams of one too many children.

Derek sprouts wings and is transported to fairy-land where he meets Fairy Godmother Lily (Julie Andrews) and his case worker Tracy (Stephen Merchant).

It is only when Derek decides to embrace the fairy spirit - albeit in his own unique way - that magical things evolve in his life.

It is the kind of movie that pays no attention to logic and relies heavily on the audience's willingness to succumb to an outlandish story.

Speaking of which, the story is nice enough and Johnson carries the character well but the flick was produced on a seemingly limited budget, negatively impacts its believability.

Nonetheless, "The Tooth Fairy" deserves commendation thanks to a message related to restoring humanity's ability to dream.

Moreover, the DVD's bonus features include a hilarious deleted scene in which Johnson and Merchant belt out "Wind Beneath My Wings."

It is a bright spot on a satisfying yet unexceptional cinematic experience.
