This looked like a good movie, really it did. But in the end i wouldn't even do it the pleasure of calling it a Se7en wannabe. the plot was semi-interesting, the acting was crap. Aaron Eckart was weak, the guy who played the killer was eh, and Carrie-Ann Moss was dull and had no personality. She needs to stay in Matrix-type movies where she's supposed to deliver lines that dry. The movie used too many token plot tricks. For example, as Eckart explains his theory on the killer, which makes a whole lot of sense with all the evidense he has and is damn near proven already, the head cop has to deny it, because thats how the other movies do it. Merhige screwed up what could have been a decent flick. There are so many things that don't make sense at all. How is it that Eckart thinks he can derail a semi-truck in his SUV? Why is it that after an ugly looking car wreck, both of the guys inside don't even have a bruise on them? Explain to me how Eckart can chase someone and then lose them...in the middle of the desert! dumb, dumb, dumb,and did i mention dumb.
