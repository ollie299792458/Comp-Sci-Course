Family Guy is clearly on its last legs. While previous seasons were somewhat clever, this season goes all out on mindless pop culture references, toilet humor, and just plain offensive "humor" if you can call it that. By that I mean in many episodes, it seems as if the writers are trying to be blatantly offensive, sometimes without a joke attached. This is not saying that humor can't be offensive. Some of my favorite shows are The Boondocks, American Dad, South Park, and formally Family Guy.

The reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of a few episodes that are still pretty funny, such as Road to Multiverse, Stew-Roids, Quagmire's Baby, and Brian's Got a Brand New Bag. These have the funniest moments on the DVD with humor that is not just offensive or a reference to something, but combine everything Family Guy is famous for, and doing it well!

However,I have almost no hope left for this show, as the parts of Season 8 left out of the DVD for Volume 9, are even worse than these. Whereas in some of the episodes in Seasons 7 and 8, I plain just got bored, the episode Brain and Stewie just pissed me off. I know I'm know the only one that hopes that FOX and Seth MacFarlane can lay this dead horse to rest, instead of repeatedly beating it.
