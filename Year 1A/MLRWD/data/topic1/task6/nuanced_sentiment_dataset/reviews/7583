Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla: DVD Movie Review

Grade: A-

Another one of the unofficial Godzilla Millennium series, Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla has to be one of the best so far. The special effects in more recent Godzilla movies have been getting a lot better, even though the campy 60's, 70's, and 80's Godzilla films are still fun to watch.

Once again erasing all of Godzilla's past battles and assuming that he's only attacking Japan once, GXMG takes MechaGodzilla to a whole new level.

This time armed with an arsenal of new weapons, most notably a new type of gun that freezes things to absolute zero, and then shatters them at a molecular level. Can Big G stand up to the improved (for the fourth time...) MechaGodzilla? Of course not, but there will be some pretty awesome battles along the way...

Another Godzilla film that features more action over story-just the way I think we all like it-GXMG is definitely a step up for the Godzilla series. (Godzilla-50+ years!!)  I guess I'll just never get tired of Godzilla fighting MechaGodzilla. (Godzilla's best foe,-yes, he even beats King Ghidorah!)
