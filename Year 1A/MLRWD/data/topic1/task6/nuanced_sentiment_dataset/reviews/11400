I love Mel Brooks. When I heard he's having a collection coming out on Blu Ray, I was excited.

If you're a Mel Brooks fan, this is a no brainer. Now for the dissappointing aspects.

This box set WILL NOT fit on your DVD rack without there being some major changes to the layout of your entertainment center. The Blu Ray/book/jacket/thing is roughly the same size as a hard bound coffee table book. It's clunky and it falls apart easily (the binding agents "glue" was weak on my copy. To top it off, you're sliding Blu Ray discs up against straight up card stock inserts to get them out. It's more of an annoyance than anything, but if you can see through that, you're set.

You'll also notice that there's some movies missing. I'm not saying that Dracula: Dead and loving it should be wiped clean from human memory, but it's the completitionist in me that would like to see all his works in something named "Collection". It's really not a collection, isn't it. More like a "greatest hits", or "The ones we want you to remember him by". I was somewhat suprised that The Producers wasn't in this collection either. Was that 10th or 11th movie going to disrupt the balance of the box set and set the world ablaze? probably not, I'm guessing it was those two timing Hollywood lawyers that kept my dream from becoming a reality.

Long story short, Terri Garr was insanely hot and everybody knows that Druish princesses are attacted to money and power, and Darth Helmet has both.
