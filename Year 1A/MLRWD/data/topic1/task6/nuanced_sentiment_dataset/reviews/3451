Maybe it's just me me but it seems that all the movies I've watched about Ireland are very sad. Goodness knows the people over there have gone through a lot but so have other countries. And weren't The Matchmaker and  Waking Ned Divine fairly happy Irish Movies? So maybe I'll adjust my  statement and say that I've never seen a happy Irish drama. I've rambled  enough so on to the critique. The family of five sisters in this film is  interesting in that they all stick together through thick and thin. But  when the Meryl Streep, the eldest sister exherts  too much control over her  sisters and those around here, everything falls apart. The performances are  mostly good although the father and the second-oldest sister stand in  particular; the former for his depth and wisdom, and the latter for her  warmth and humor. This being Ireland, the movie looks good and it makes you  want to take a vacation in the Emerald Isle. Weighing against it all is the  unremittingly depressing pall that hangs over the whole movie. There's  nothing wrong with a sad movie but this movie literally sees no happy  ending for it's characters. Well-made but don't see it if you're happy.
