Unfortunately, in the satirical "Jakob the Liar," we are yet again engulfed with negative portrayals of the Nazi regime - they are all, without exception, demonized as monsters - and the Jewish occupants of the Warsaw Ghetto are hoping for the Jakob's lie to come true, that the Communists come and 'save' them from their captors. As history has shown, Communists brought exponentially worse barbarism to these persecuted folk and, if anything, the Germans had behaved like gentleman with them in comparison; these latter would often be remembered for turning a blind eye to the odd son, daughter or mother who pleaded to be set free temporarily for any small reason - and never, of course, to return. In "Jakob," there is no compassion on the part of the troops. No laughter or camaraderie among the Jewish people (the character playing the barber follows the trend of suicides en masse, without even saying goodbye to his pal Jakob), and, in the end, the prospect of a positive ending - the type of ending the film makes you believe is coming - is foiled instead for yet another shot at the beleaguered Nazi militia, though I won't specify in what sense exactly.
