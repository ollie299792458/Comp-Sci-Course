I read many reviews of this 1968 Don Siegal opus and all were enthusiastic.  I like Dirty Harry from Siegal, but was extrememely disappointed with this film.  It feels like a pilot for Sunday Mystery Movie (of course the nudity in one of the first scenes ruled that out), and it never got better.  The parallel stories of detecitve Richard Widmark trying to find a criminal who had made him look the fool, and the moral dilemnas faced by Henry Fond (the police commissioner) never come together.  In fact, I never understood why these two characters were in the same film.  In one scene where they meet at a black tie social affar, the dialogue and acting between the two are so uncomfortable, I actually laughed out loud.  In fact, that is my big gripe with the whole movie.  There seems to be so much unmotivated conflict and unexplained resolution, I was left, at best, confused.  Why Henry Fonda lets one of his best friends off the hook after he learns he is "on the take" is unresolved.  Why Madigan has such a temptestuous relationship with his wife (Inger Stevens) is likewise unmotivated.  I just felt the scriptwriters had two or three story lines and strung them together.  I know life is filled with many parallel stories and events.  These just don't seem to have anything to do with each other.  And if that weren't enough, Don Costa's bombastic score constantly calls attention to itself, actually distracting me from the movie.  All in all, my wife and I were left flat and we did not care about any of these characters, even after the surprise ending.
