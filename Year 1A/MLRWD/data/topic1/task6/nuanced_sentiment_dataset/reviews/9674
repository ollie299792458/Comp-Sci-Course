Ok I love all of the Saw movies, however I was very disappointed that we did not get to find out what was in the letter that made Amanda cry.  Why else would we learn in Saw IV that Hoffman placed the letter?  I thought for sure it was a perfect set up for an answer in Saw V. (maybe Saw VI?) Am I the only one who feels this way?  Also I find it very puzzling that we still hear Jigsaw's voice on the majority of the tapes in Saw V, though we do see Jigsaw on his death bed in a flashback scene handing Hoffman a file with information on the five new people whom will play a game, so I guess he could have.  This brings about another point: SPOILER ALERT.  If Hoffman had set up Seth Baxter's death to look like a Jigsaw game, then why do we hear Jigsaw's voice on the tape?  We know Seth was killed before Paul from the original Saw and before Hoffman had met John, so this does not make sense to me.  And of course like everyone else, I am curious to see what was in the box that Jill had recieved as a result of Jigsaw's death.
