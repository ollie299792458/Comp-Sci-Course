"Dead Silence" is director James Wan's private joke.  The punchline is the movie and the disheartening enthusiasm many horror fans have for it.

Comparing this comical and bluntly Grade B movie with that great episode of the "Twilight Zone" ("The Old Switcharoo"), "Saw" (which was good but overrated), or even "Magic" with Anthony Hopkins (which wasn't really that good at all), is to do a gross disservice to all three.

Donnie Wahlberg can't catch a break.  Ryan Kwanten turns in such a plastic performance here that not for one moment do we believe in Jamie Ashen or Det. Jim Lipton.

The premise of the movie is so ridiculous (a woman who owned dolls, preferring them to children, wreaked terror on a small town with the really creepy dolls that come alive and bark at people until their faces look just like the victims in "The Ring") that whatever expectations the viewer had of another "Saw" goes right out the window.

In my humble opinion, the only one who deserves any accolades or praise is the dummy.  At least he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut and stay under blankets half the time.  Starring in this movie, he made a smart move.
