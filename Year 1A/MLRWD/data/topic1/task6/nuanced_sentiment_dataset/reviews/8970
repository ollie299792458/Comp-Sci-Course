The Alamo is a fine historical movie and it's also a fine dramatic movie.  I'm actually an American historian, and although I specialize in the American Revolution, the Alamo has always held a special interest for me, ever since I first saw Fess Parker as Davy Crocket.  That version of the Alamo is the idealized version.  I love it.  The John Wayne version I hated.  This version is as close to historically accurate as possible.  While some dramatic license is taken, I think the fact that John Lee Hancock focussed on a more character driven rather than action driven movie is too his credit.  There are some great characterizations including Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston, Patrick Wilson as William Travis and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie.  The actor's take great pride in their work and the attention to historical detail is astonishing.  This movie is about more than just the Alamo.  It is about the entire war of Texas liberation, concluding with the capture of Santa Anna at San Jacinto.  This is an astonishing movie and is very well done.  It did not deserve the box office drubbing it received.
