"Death is rarely the end of the story," says the Canadian notary entrusted with presenting the will of his secretary Nawal (Lubna Azabal) to her twin children. Indeed. The tragic secret carried by this deceased Lebanese immigrant will sear her children forever.

The film's major weakness is its setting in a fictionalized Middle Eastern nation. By removing the story from the real-life context of war-torn Lebanon, director Denis Villeneuve (and playwright Wajdi Mouawad) strip away meaning and historical framework for understanding the mother's ideological strivings. I suppose the idea is to universalize the harrowing outcomes of war, but the fictionalizing device only heightens confusion in an already hard-to-follow plot.

In searching for the truth about their family, the twins ultimately realize that they did not really know the woman who was their mother. Not only that, but her understandable quest for revenge risks destroying not just her intended victim, but her innocent twins as well. Because this is a mystery, I do not want to reveal too much. But I will warn that this movie is not for the faint of heart. It is best conceived as a horror story.
