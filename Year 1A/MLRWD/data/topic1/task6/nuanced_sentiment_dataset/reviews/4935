Admit it. Willow is the best fantasy genre movie ever madesince the 80's, next to The Princess Bride.
All around, the actingis excellent.  Of the lead roles, Val Kilmer nearly steals the show, playing one of his best roles ever as legendary Madmartigan as if he was born for it.
For the fantasy gamer out there, this movie has it all. Powerful swordsmen, novitiate wizards and mighty sorcerers, thieves, brownies, fairies, trolls, worgs, castles and kingdoms, and more -- everything a fantasy story should have to stimulate the imagination of young and old.
Willow doesn't make the mistake that they made in the Dungeons and Dragons movie that came out at the end of 2000. If you know the good guys are going to win, you just can't expect to capitalize on drama, suspense, and beating sheer odds -- Hello Hollywood, that's only fun with dice! In Willow, the jokes and dialogue are playful, colorful, and plentiful. And they don't go anachronistic! Argh! Don't expect to sustain yourself on drama and suspense when writing a kid's fantasy movie.
Willow of course makes none of these mistakes. The soundtrack is great, the replay value is excellent, the jokes make you laugh out loud. If you know what's good for you, you'll eat your blackroot and watch this movie!
