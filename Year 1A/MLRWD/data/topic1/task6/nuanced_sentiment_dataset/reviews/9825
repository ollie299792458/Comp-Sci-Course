I had heard many good things about Vicky Cristina Barcelona, that it was Woody Allen's best film in a long time. I also looked forward to seeing more of Rebecca Hall, who was outstanding in Frost/Nixon.

Sadly, the film is very disappointing. The premise is somewhat ridiculous, with two American women in Barcelona being crudely propositioned at a restaurant by a moody Spanish painter with a "past." Soon they're in a private jet with him for a little interlude in a quiet town.

The character Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) is a scatterbrained neurotic who will sleep with anyone who gives her attention, so it's plausible she would fall for the Spaniard's tired line. But it's absolutely incredible that the level-headed, and engaged, Vicky (Hall) would hit the mattress with him. Is Vicky so bored by her one-dimensional husband-to-be that she'll bed a total stranger? Is this a "what happens in Barcelona stays in Barcelona" scenario?

As to Penelope Cruz's performance as the painter's estranged and suicidal-homicidal wife, it's OK, but it's nowhere near the stellar acting of Amy Adams or Viola Davis of Doubt. Both ladies were robbed at Oscar time this year.
