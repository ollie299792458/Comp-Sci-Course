I picked this movie up in a bargain store for a dollar a used VHS tape. and never having seen it before I was deeply surprised by the final out come. First off in my honest opinion the first 25 minutes was really depressing but still good. robert redfords excellent direction by hiding the horse in the shadows was not only a brilliant idea but also scared the hell out of me. like I said a brilliant piece of directing. then once the mother decided to be strong and do what most mothers would not do. we are talking about true faith. a ( I will not take no for an answer ) atitude. then the movie started to pick up and I was hooked on the movie ever since. I'v also noticed that this movie is not for everyone. don't ask me why, it just isen't. personally this is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. It had the same emotional effect on me as the movie ( the miracle worker ) with ann bancroft. now I am buying the DVD.  anyways enjoy it. the movie is memorable. P.S. the scene where the teenage girl is laying on the horses neck towards the end of the movie just totally blew me away !!!
