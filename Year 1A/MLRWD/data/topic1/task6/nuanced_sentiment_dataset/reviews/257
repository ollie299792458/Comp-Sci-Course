Well, I have little to add that my fellow critics have not already mentioned.  The movie truly did convey a sense of magic and wonder.  Sometimes I think this play is so well loved because it takes the mind back  to its earlier child-like fantasies.  And this movie succeeds superbly in  creating for today's visually oriented viewers the fantastic world that the  Bard's audiences would have visualized clearly with their ears alone.  
I'm sorry to hear that many still consider Shakespeare's poetry more an  obstacle than a pleasure, for the words truly are the music of the play.  But it IS unfamiliar to many, and if movies such as this are able to bridge  the gap between today's audiences and Shakespeare's verse, to spark the  interest of the average viewer and prompt him or her to discover the magic  of the poetry one-on-one, then it's a good thing.  
Speaking of music, I  was delighted as much by what I heard in this film as what I saw.  Using  Mendelssohn's incidental music to this very play was a welcomed treat and I  found the operatic selections equally effective.  
I enjoyed this movie  tremedously from first to last, and thought it handled both the comic and  the sublime with a masterful touch.  I recommend it to those who venerate  the Bard as well as to those who are now just getting to know him.  For  those who prefer the comic vein to the tragic, it is as good an  introduction to Shakespeare as any I know of.
