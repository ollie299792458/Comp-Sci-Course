You notice all these other people who review this said it was great because of the scene when they go down into the basement and see all the crazy people? Well, Why don't you ask them what else was so great about this movie besides the beginning of this movie? Its starts off good and interesting, but by the time you get closer to the ending, you soon get to see how this is nothing more than a generic B horror with bad acting and FX. It starts of great. It hooks you in, you thinking "wow this is cool...and insane asylum".  I was nodding off about half way into it because it was to slow and boring. By the time I woke back up I was looking at the main characters battling it out (I finally was woke up by something actually happening) and the battle was very stupid. You will see what I mean. the movie loses all its serious atmosphere the further it drags on, its not even close to scary.
  Besides the flawed acting and bad plot, I had a major problem with this movie. Due to the fact it is a B-horror, you tend to either get bad sound or bad picture on a low budget horror movie. In this case it is definitely the sound. The picture is great, but the sound utterly ticked me right off. It is muffled and hard to hear the people talking. So, you crank it up to hear what they are saying, then when some action or "make you jump" scene comes it is blaring annoying loud!! Hollywood is doing this with all horror and action movies these days, however, you seem to notice it more on this movie than most. The sounds levels are insanely uneven. You go from extremely muffled mumbling actor talk to wall shaking, earth pound noises in split second. I bet my neighbor heard as much of this movie as I did.
  I gave it an extra star for the asylum sequences and everything that fell outside of the boring moments. Otherwise. It's a stupid movie!
