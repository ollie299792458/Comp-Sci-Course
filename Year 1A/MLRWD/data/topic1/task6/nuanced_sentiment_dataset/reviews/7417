Ever since I first heard about this movie I wanted to see it. All the things I read or heard about sounded great. Who doesn't like a good horror movie? Well after hearing and reading about this movie for 3 years there was no way it could live up to my expectations. I had actually heard it was awful and I almost didn't go see it but I talked myself into it. It was ok, not good but also not completely bad either. Zombie had some killer visuals in the movie. Some shots and things he did reminded me a lot of Oliver Stone's work on Natural Born Killers and U-Turn. I can't recommend this movie however, becuase of all the edits it had to go through to hit the big screen. What it left us with is a mess of jumbled images that just don't work. There were several things in the movie that I could tell had more to them that was left on the cutting room floor. With that said if Zombie puts out an uncut version on DVD, I will buy it for sure. Zombie should have stuck to his guns and put it out uncut as a NC-17 feature. I think that alone would have made this movie great and would have doubled it's opening gross.
