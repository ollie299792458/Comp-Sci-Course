I'm not really a fan of Star Trek TNG but I have some episodes that are very good and TNG movies are very good too since I'm mostly a fan of Star Trek's original series and first 6 movies but Star Trek Nemesis was pretty good despite a few disapointments which were no explanation how the Romulan's got Picard's DNA to clone him, Shinzon's purpose to destroy humanity, no Ambassador Spock in a few scenes since he is on Romulas trying to reunite the Vulcans and Romulans, where Sela is or what happened to her after Data Vulcan neck pinched her into unconciousness 12 years ago, and lastly Shinzon is in no way like Khan he was more like General Chang. Tom Hardy was good as Shinzon though and the space battle was done very well as well B-4 Data's retarded brother played so well by Brent Spiner. If you have seen Black Hawk Down Tom Hardy played Specialist Lance Twombly the soldier who got caught mocking the commanding officer. Data's sacrifice was nearly as good as Spock's was in Star Trek 2 and he was alot like Spock. Will I buy this movie? Yes I will so I can add it to the rest of my Star Trek videos and DVD movies. Star Trek quotes for the day regarding Data's death "Of my friend I can say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels his was the most human." and "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one."
