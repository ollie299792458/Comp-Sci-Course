I accidentally stumbled onto this movie during the latest PBS pledge drive.  As an avid LM Montgomery fan, especially her Anne novels, I was extremely excited to see Megan Follows bring the character to life.  The movie's one problem is its accuracy with the novels themselves.  Characters are deleted, added, and mixed together to the point where it's not Anne's story at all anymore, but rather another one completely.  That's not to say I did not enjoy this movie...once I got past the "WHAT?!? You cut Little Elizabeth?!?" stage I was able to separate the stories they blended together and appreciate the movie in a new way.  For anyone not familiar with the novels, the chronology in the movie moves back and forth between the three books it encompasses.  I think it's easier to follow the events in this movie if you have not read the books; you don't waste time asking yourself questions like "Why in the world would they blend three or four different story lines into one family?" e.g. the Mrs. Harris/Pauline story, the Little Elizabeth/Grandmother story, the Royal Gardner story (what? he's a widowed old man now?), the deletion of characters (e.g. Dora and Davy, Rebecca Dew, Aunt Kate, Aunt Chatty, plus the characters listed above), and the insertion of new plot devices (since when does Anne teach at a women's college?  What happened to Summerside High School?  What happened to Anne getting the principalship? Gilbert really WAS engaged to Christine?!?)  The other avid Anne fans know what I'm talking about; the rest of you have no idea.  Suffice it to say, this was a good movie by itself.  Ignore the Anne of Green Gables part of it, and you'll save yourself a whole lot of headaches.
