Let me start off by saying sorrying if my spelling is incorrect and oh yah this is the most terrible jaws movie I have ever seen and it is a disgrace to the first movie and how dare the women who played Brodys wife could ever sign a contract wanting to be in this movie. Second of all throughout the whole movie the shark is "supposibly" trying to track down the Brody family and trying to eat every one of them like it did to one of Brodys sons in the first scence of the movie.  And throughout the whole movie Brodys wife some how has some sort of psychic ability to know if the shark is close or something bad is happening that has to do with the shark its a know doubt one 100% quality corny movie.  And another thing when they are killing the shark the shark is making loud moaning noises which really goes to how how much the director knows (hey a little hint sharks don't have voice boxes so they cant make any type of noise what so ever). The movie is terrible so please I beg the people who read this review please and i mean please dont buy this movie it is a huge disapointment to all you shark movie fans because I am a shark movie fan myself but in final words don't by the movie
