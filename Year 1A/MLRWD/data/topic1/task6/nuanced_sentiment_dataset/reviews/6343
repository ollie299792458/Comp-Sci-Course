There have been many "surprise ending" films in the last few years, but just knowing that tends to make a viewer more alert.  Unlike most films of this sort, that lay their clues so with such subtlely and you may only pick them up in retrospect, this one allows you to realize the truth as it unfolds before the hero.
  While the to story is not deep and you will probably figure it out, at least if you haven't stumbled on it by chance, before the hero does, it does have an interesting point to make "cogito ergo sum."
  In terms of the proformance itself, Muellar-Stahl and D'Onofrio are as great as ever.  Even Moll shows talent in playing two ( or three ) distinct rolls.  While the lead realy is the weakness it may only be in comparison to the strenghths of Muellar-Stahl and D'Onofiro, so give him a chance.
  As to the plot itself, it is a typical cyber whodonit.  Telling you more would ruin it.  There are some films out there better seen with no idea whatsoever about the plot, even if that is only so you can pat yourself on the back if you figure it out at the end. )  In all, I do recommend it.
