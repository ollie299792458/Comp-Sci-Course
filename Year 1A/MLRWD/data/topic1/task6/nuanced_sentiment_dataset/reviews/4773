As far as film noir goes, this is it. The contradiction of Raymond Chandler's gritty gumshoe Philip Marlowe comes across at the hands of Dick Powell far more easily than it did with either Bogart or Mitchum (who was in a remake of this film, years later). Powell's performance of the detective is lighter than others, and though he certainly doesn't evoke the feelings of menace that other actors do, I can't imagine anyone but him playing hopscotch with the tiles of a stately home.

Mike Mazurki's turn as Moose Malloy is fabulous - a real-life ex-wrestler turned meathead-for-hire-under-false-pretences. If you want a great strangulation, he's the man.

So why only three stars? As a film this is a beautiful work - the opening shots of a blindfolded Marlowe, appearing as if in front of a firing squad, are gorgeous. There's a lot of expertly-crafted noir stereotypical setups here. But the story seems particularly convoluted, and to not hang together too well. It's forgiveable in a book where your mind fills in the blanks, but on the screen it seems that something is lacking. It definitely helps if you've read Chandler's original before tackling this one.

One thing that could be a spoiler but isn't but sort of is: watch out for the drug scene. It's one of the most breathtakingly good:bad pieces of acting and camerawork I've seen. It's so close to genius and failure at once that its inclusion makes viewing of this film necessary.
