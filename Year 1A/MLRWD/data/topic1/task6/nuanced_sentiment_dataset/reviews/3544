In 1992 a group of first time directors released their movies to a fairley captive Sundance Film Festival audience. And two years later a few of them had some spare time and thought "Lets have a party and call it a movie!" Four Rooms is that movie. Either loved or reviled, I actually like it. Sure it's a little silly in places but that's the charm of this obvious secret film crew party movie(theres an oxymoron if i've ever seen it). But this is what Four Rooms is! Think about it - a movie set on new years eve, every scene involved drinking alcohol and ALL of the actors would have worked for scale if they were paid at all(money I'm sure went on buying MORE alcohol to fuel the back-stage party). I'm not being sarcastic at all when I say that because I get this movie. It is not the follow up to Pulp Fiction or El Mariachi or In the Soup, ect. It IS funny for what it is - Four friends doing something they love and not trying to live up to their small past success. Tim Roth in a part originaly intended for Steve Buscemi(turning it down only because he felt he had already done the bell boy part in the Coen Bro's Barton Fink), really has fun in this role. His range is evident in all of the rooms from bliss to screaming bloody murder, and no matter what anyone says I think he ties the movie together quite neatly. Don't expect to get a cinema classic but insted top up your champagne glass, adjust your paper hat and and enjoy the party
