I was feeling sick from the camera spinning and droning noises, while guiltily enjoying the anticipation and excitement of the extreme sex and violence that made me rent this, when I started enjoying how smart and philosophical the movie is, which is when I began to despise its manipulative and fake picture of the world.

It goes in segments back through time like Memento, with a similarly sadistic plot but more so. The three characters and their relationship are richly developed in a way that tells an interesting story, which feels 'profound' (and the framing of the movie emphasize its 'philosophical' quality). Its formal film-making heavy-handedly illustrates the regression through time from chaos (the camera and sound in the beginning are hard to endure) to pastoral, such that you see the seeds of chaos in the pastoral: the lovers in the hedonism of their happiness and the ex-boyfriend, a professor of some kind, in the way his 'philosophy' gives free rein to the masochism (and with it sadism) of his clinging to the lovers. The long takes are great, and are edited together digitally so that the whole movie seems to be one take, which isn't as great because it requires the camera twirling around into the sky a lot.

But when I think about it it occurs to me that neither people nor Paris is as chaotic as the movie wants to make a philosophical point of -- people follow lines of conversation and desire self-indulgently, but even on drugs or under great stress not as aggressively for as long as in the movie -- I doubt any parties are quite as hedonistic as that one, nor are there S & M clubs as alienating as that one nor any named 'Rectum' -- and pimps on their own street corner don't, I think, attack random women in sidewalk underpasses, rape them at great length and beat them into a coma. To make those the premises for philosophy is wrong.
