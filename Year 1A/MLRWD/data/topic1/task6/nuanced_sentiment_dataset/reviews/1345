Close Encounters has great special effects and an amazing light show but the story is so humorless, cold and sterile, I cannot recommend this movie.
We're supposed to sympathize with Richard Dreyfuss's character who becomes possessed with a vision imparted within him by super-intelligent, super-sensitive aliens.  But how can anyone sympathize with a man who willingly throws away his wife and children to follow some vague abstract space vision.
And yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're "sensitive" and intelligent, we're supposed to go "awwww" and think how wonderful they are.
The acting is fair but nothing special.  The only truly good acting performance is by Teri Garr who realistically and grippingly shows what is like to have one's life turned upside down by a spouse who's caught in the grip of an obsession.  Other than Ms. Garr, the rest of the cast is either way over-the-top (Dreyfuss) or forgettable.  
Close Encounters is long, pretentious, sometimes dull, but often visually interesting to look at.  If you want to see a great light show, rent it.  If you want to watch a compelling movie, look somewhere else.
