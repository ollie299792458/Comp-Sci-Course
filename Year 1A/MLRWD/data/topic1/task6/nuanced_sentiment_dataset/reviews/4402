Nothing to do on a Wednesday night, I watched Fried Green Tomaotoes on TV.  The movie has an intriguing beginning, great acting, and a positive message.

Dumpy housewife Evelyn Couch befriends Ninny Threadgoode on her visit to see her husband's Aunt Vespa.  While waiting for her husband, Evelyn converses with Ninny and the two become friends.  Throughout three quarters of the movie, the audience is told of the life of Idgie Threadgoode and her frienship with Ruth Jamison.  Ruth is a victim of an unfortunate marriage.  After the death of her mother, Ruth decides to leave her husband.  She is also pregnant with their child.  After leaving her husband, Ruth and Idgie open the Whistle Top cafe that soon becomes famous for its Green Fried Tomato recipe and bar-b-que.

A murder pulls the events in the story forward followed by the search for the killer and Idgie's blame for the victim's death.  We are also shown the change of Evelyn Couch from dumpy housewife to don't-push-me-around-I-love-my-feminie-organ power woman.  At times her new found feminity may seem overboard but it is not without a personal triumph that is shared by the viewer (the grocery store parking lot incident).

My pet peeve with the movie is its feminist message, especially through Evelyn Couch's transformation.  Granted, I was most convinced by Idgie and Ninny's portrayl, but there is this evident lack of respect for men, namely Evelyn's husband.  Perhaps the man is incapable of change, but in this day and age, men have made progress and have learned to co-exist (if you will) with their female significant others.  There is power in being assertive and making up your own mind, granted, but not at the expense of making the jerk look even more like a jerk and somehow making him incapable of change.
