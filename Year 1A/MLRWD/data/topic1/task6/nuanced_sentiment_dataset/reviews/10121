Meet The Feebles is a great movie, but this DVD is abhorrent!  Unfortunately, it is also the *only* version of the film on DVD.  The transfer by Dead Alive Productions (not to be confused with anything Peter Jackson) is horrible.  It is incredibly dark, grainy, and full of spots and lines that sneak into the picture.  Most of the movie takes place in the dark backstage area of an old theatre, and the transfer makes it very difficult to see what's going on.  Feature-wise, this disc is bare.  You never realize how much you value Chapter Headings as a feature until you get a disc without them!  That's right folks, this movie is one big chapter, 1 hour 30 minutes long.  Want to stop and do something else?  You can't, or you'll lose your place.  I should make a correction: there are chapters on this disc, but they're in the preview section for other Dead Alive Productions "films" like The Ice Cream Man, The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, and Blood Camp 2.  Overall, this is a great movie almost ruined by a terrible transfer.  Shame on whoever is exploiting Peter's great work like this.  Here's hoping for an official release sometime soon.
(Note to person remarking about lack of widescreen: I may be mistaken, but I am pretty sure that Bad Taste and Meet the Feebles were not filmed in widescreen, so that's most likely why the format isn't available.)
