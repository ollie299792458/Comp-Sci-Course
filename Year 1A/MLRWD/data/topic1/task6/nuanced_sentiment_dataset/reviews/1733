I am a big David Mamet fan and I have loved the other movies that he's directed, but I was very disappointed with this movie. David Mamet's movies are always very interesting with twists and turns in the plot, double crosses turn into triple cross and triple cross turn into quadruple-cross. You get the idea. One of my favorite Mamet movie is 'The Spanish Prisoner' and this movie starts off in the same vein but ends up disappointing you.
This movie has a great cast including Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito and Delroy Lindo among others. The movie starts off great in typical Mamet fashion, but something happens along the way. The ending of the movie is just abrupt, rushed and comes out of nowhere. The ending left me feeling like the director didn't have time to finish the movie, explain the sub-plots.... I wish I hadn't bought the movie now as it's probably better to just catch it on [tv]. If you're looking for a great movie, get 'The Spanish Prisoner' instead.
I wish I could have given this movie 3 and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't allow for that and so I'm giving it a 3.
