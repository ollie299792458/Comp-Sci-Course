Jennifer Aniston has been a leading actress for comedy and romantic comedies for the last few years.  She is still beautiful and charming.  That's good enough for me; if you love her or Gerard Butler AND you are seeing it with your kids or your loved one, then it is good enough(though just good enough).  No, it is not Gladiator, Ben Hur, or Doctor Zhivago...it is not intended to be timeless, or to age like fine wine.  It is an "outing" for these stars to make a film and for us to see it.  If you are going with the intention of taking notes and judging it on an absolute scale of cinematic quality, then skip it...save your money.  However, if you just want to take a break from something(shopping?  school?), it is a pleasant diverson.  My real objection is that I could not believe a woman as fantastic as Jennifer Anniston(OK, I'm a fan) would ever go back to, or ever have been associated with, Gerard Butler.  His demeanor and appearance in the film is abhorrent compared to the, as usual, flawless Ms. Anniston.  Of all of Ms. Anniston's films, this is the only one where we get the slightest glimmer of her sex appeal.  Amazing, but true; in all the films she's made, she's kept a lower profile than Meg Ryan, another beautiful star who has been kept totally under wraps.
