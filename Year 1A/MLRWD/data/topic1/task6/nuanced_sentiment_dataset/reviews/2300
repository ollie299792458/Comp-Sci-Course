I remember seeing this movie when i was a teenager many years ago and for some reason it really stuck in my head. Upon watching it again recently it all came flooding back.  The gratuitous nudity and gore on display here is much in line with most of director Paul Verhoevens other work, notably the seedy Showgirls and Basic Instinct.  Flesh and Blood is a medievil tale wallowing in its own squalid setting with plenty of swordplay and lashings of sex.  Rutger Hauer is in fine form but the casting of Aussie Tom Burlinson in the lead role is simply mystifying as his forays into serious dramatic acting here prove simply hammy.  Overall this film for all its over the top scenes (the lightning breaking the heroes chains free...please!) and dodgy dialogue is very entertaining and at times quite unintentionally amusing.  Flesh and Blood captures the period well with great set design and locations but fails to rise above anything other than B grade exploitation. But hey, whats wrong with that.  Put you brain into neutral, kick back with a coldie and have a fun few hours.
