Ok, the movie Dodgeball... Can you say collosal waste of time? Thank goodness we NetFlix'd it and didn't waste any money at the theater or on buying the DVD.

Now, when I heard about the movie, and saw the previews, I thought, "hey, looks pretty funny." I mean, hey, I loved dodgeball as a kid and some of the movie trailers looked entertaining, but this movie, probably all courtesy of the freak Ben Stiller (who has his entertaining moments), was so laden with profanity, sexual innuendo, and filth that we ended up fast-forwarding through several scenes.

Sure it was entertaining in parts. Who doesn't think seeing someone laid out with a wrench or a big red rubber ball isn't funny?? Sure the David vs. Goliath moral of the story is great and heartwarming to see them win, but hey were the inflatable "cup", the S&M uniforms, the crude references to bodily functions, sex, etc. really necessary? Oh, and the girl/girl kiss with Christine Taylor(Kate) and her "girlfriend" was just down right repulsive.

So once again Hollywood takes an entertaining film idea, and stuffs it so full of crap that it's hardly entertaining. Good Going..
