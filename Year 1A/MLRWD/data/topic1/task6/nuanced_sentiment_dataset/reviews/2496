I still can't believe they edited this DVD.  I remember this movie well - I saw it 5 times in the theater.  It is a good oldfashioned B movie.  Decent plot you can follow with poor special effects trying to be 'top notch'.  I was suprised at the quality of the acting at the time, and not shocked when I saw Quaid break through soon after.
The plot is basic horror stuff.  A man (Van Sydow at his 'nerdy proffesor' best) studys dreams, to determine if one person can actually enter another's dream.  Then comes in the Government agent (Christopher Plummer at his most evil) representing the true source of the study's funding.  They want to use this information to attempt to determine if they kill someone in their sleep will the person die.  If so the plan is to use this information to assassinate those not 'helpful' to America. Dennis Quaid plays the young college dropout who is recruited for the study, and Kate Capshaw his love interest.  The battles are fought in dreams.
If you've never seen it in theaters, rent this one tonight.
