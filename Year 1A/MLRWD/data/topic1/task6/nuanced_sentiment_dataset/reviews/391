Holiday Inn is a great movie for holidays, especially Christmas, and quite fun and cheerful.  It's also a movie with a lot of internal contrasts.  
Portions of Holiday are quite sophisticated and surprisingly modern; the  self-referential movie subplot is nicely tongue-in-cheek and wouldn't look  at all out of place in a modern film.  
Quite a lot of it is naive and  highly sentimental, particularly the love triangle and the traditional  holidays.  Astaire and Crosby almost make you believe in chivalry.  And  Bing Crosby singing White Christmas is enough to give anyone a memory  transfusion - you'll find yourself remembering idyllic Christmases past.  Even if they didn't actually happen.  Even if you don't actually celebrate  Christmas.  
And, of course, one part of is totally enmeshed in the nasty  political and moral sensibilities of its time.  That would be the treatment  of the blacks in this movie, with a special emphasis on the song for  Lincoln's Birthday.  This is the part of the film that requires a step back  and a very deep breath.  Yes, it's horribly insulting and rather degrading;  there are lines that will make anyone born after 1950 squirm with  discomfort.  It's also very typical of the time in which the movie was  made.  If you aren't capable of accepting that, you will hate this movie.  Don't bother with it.
On the other hand, if you're willing to forgive the  past its faults, this is a really sweet movie - with just enough wit to  guard against total sugar overdose.
