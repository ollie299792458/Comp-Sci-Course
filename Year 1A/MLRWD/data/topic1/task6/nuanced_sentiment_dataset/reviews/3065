First of all, the book on which this film was based was the best football book that I have ever read.  But, the viewer should realize that the movie is "based" on the book's story and takes liberties so as to have a climactic finish.

I fully support another reviewer who was troubled by the shaky camera style of filming.  Unfortunately, this seems to be new method of filming football movies since Any Given Sunday.  It's meant to have the viewer "feel" the emotions of the frantic life of the football player, but it only leads to motion sickness for me, and it makes me doubt the strength of the script that shaking the camera is needed to draw the audience into the scene.

The acting is generally good, but while the coach's character was central to the film, no attempt was ever made to better understand him.  How, for example, did he really feel about the racist comments made in his presence, and was he as ambivalent about his players outside of their playing abilities as he was portrayed in the film.  Because he is a real person and the film used the coach's real name, it is possible that they did this film without his cooperation and this would be why not more is given to us by the filmmakers.  That's a shame since he is made so important in the film.

I also would have liked to have known more about the only Mexican-American character in the film since he was obviously a positive figure.  For those wanting more information on the character Boobie check out the Sports Illustrated magazine for October 4th.  In sum, I recommend the film, but not as strongly as I had hoped when anticipating its release.  For those who have not read the book, do so soon, the movie does not give you half of what's in the book.
