(Review written by Ted Buchanan, Karyn's husband)

This was one of the first of many 'No- Budget' sci-fi/horror movies that
shamelessly ripped-off the original 'Alien'. I remember seeing it at the local grindhouse paired up as a double-feature with Fulci's 'Zombie'. This film would have been lost years ago if it wasn't for some amusing casting: Ray Walston ('My Favorite Martian') Erin Moran ('Happy Days')and
Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger-'A Nightmare on Elm Street'). This crew takes off into deep space right away and we are soon on the surface of a dismal, ash colored planet. Our crew then is face-to-face with creatures that turn into each character's greatest fears. My personal favorite was the hot blonde crewmember who admits that she's 'afraid of worms.'  What
comes slithering out of the darkness to greet her on a very personal level, is an 8ft. tall slug with dripping tentacles. Now this is a cinematic first: The worm then savagely attacks her, rapes her, and leaves her for dead lying in a pool of the worm's DNA.(I found this scene strangely erotic) There isn't much of a clear story, and the ending was clearly written while tripping out on mushrooms. No way of knowing that for sure,only the screenwriter would know the answer. Englund is an average actor at best, and it would only be a huge lucky break 3 years later that made him a household name (and also typecasted him for life!) as Freddy Kruger. The FX are really well done considering the budget. Erin Moran literally loses her head over the terror and we even get to see Sid Haig (Rob Zombie's horror flicks)do battle with his own Karate Stars as they take on a life of their own!
Ok, so it's cheesy at times. If you're a B-movie fan like me, you'll love watching this 80's gem from the Roger Corman school of filmaking. The biggest surprise is the credit of Second Unit Director going to James Cameron! Everybody has to start someplace. Enjoy this guilty pleasure at your own risk!
