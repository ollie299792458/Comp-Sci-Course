First of all...this is not a reveiw of the actual movie. Or pehaps it is. This has nothing to do with the sound quality, which is very, VERY GOOD! This has to do with the DVD version (and maybe the actual movie, although I don't remember noticing it while watching it at numerous mid-nite showings so many many years ago). This is not my opinion....THIS IS FACT!! I am a guitar player (for nearly 40 years), as well as a dabbler on the keys. If you are a musician, you must have noticed it. The sound is NOT....I SAY THE SOUND IS NOT IN-SYNC WITH THE VIDEO! What amatuer let this slide by. There are many places where this is noticible. You can's miss it. Plant bellowing out a howl (like during RnR), yet for a split second, the mic is still near his waist...it's not anywhere near his mouth. I thought that this was just an overdub. But no because during the intro to Stairway, Page (my beloved guitar GOD himself) is doing his little riff on the  6 of his EDS and....my gosh people, the sound and video are no where near in-synch with each other. There are many other moments just like this. I can't believe Page let this thru the out door (pardon the pun). I enjoy this concert. I don't believe it deserves the bad rap it has recieved over the past 25-30 years or so. If you like live albums that have been totally redone in the studio, try Rush's Exit...Stage Left or Show of Hands. Live albums were (I say WERE) meant to be made in the raw!...mistakes and all. And there are many of them (LEAVE THEM IN...THIS IS LIVE BABY). Musically I rate this as a (LIVE album) a 5 star PLUS! BUT THE AWFUL PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS PLANT CROTCH SHOTS ARE A TERRIBLE DISTRACTION....1/2 star.
