James Cagney will go down as one of my top 5 favorite actors of all time. I mean this guy did it all where do I stop? He revelled in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" as George M. Cohan, he was terrific in "Mister Roberts", riviting in "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye", but this was his masterpiece. After 7 years of movies that didn't do too well he roars back as Cody Jarrett who worships his "Ma". He could make even the meanest sociopath pee his/her pants for a long time with the venom he packs into this movie. He starts out with wanting to rob a train, and then in the process he murders the engineer, but one of his gang ends up scalded to death by the steam1( I have to quote Johnny Cash here. excuse me.). He has it all planned to where he would surrender to a charge in another state, but asks his girlfriend to look after his "Ma". However, the girl proves to be unfaithful, and cheats on Jarrett, and allows "Ma" to become sick, and die. Jarrett realizes he's be duped, so now he unknowingly becomes friends with an undercover cop who sticks real close to Jarrett, and the both of them plan an escape, and through the help of another convict make it back, and now comes the next plan to rob an oil refinery, and Jarrett has the foolproof plan, but then he's betrayed again as the cop identifies himself, and next comes one of the best shootouts ever, and with one of the best movie endings in history "The Top Of The World Scene". I mean I've had fantasies of using that as the video of Cream's version of "Sitting On Top Of The World" because it just belongs there as far as I'm concerned. This movie as far as I know didn't take any oscars home, and that's a real crime. This is number 28 on my all time favorite movie list.
