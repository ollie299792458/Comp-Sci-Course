When I first saw this miniseries being promoted on television, it irritated me. New York and fairy tales and a dog-prince? C'mon!

But, being an avid reader since childhood of fairy tales and myths and the strangest stories I could find, I knew I was going to watch the movie.

And I did. Every night.

It was an unexpected mixture of modern and medieval, fun and dead seriousness, outright silliness and intelligent humor. As a writer, I appreciated the intricacy of the plot, of what was required to blend all those familiar fairy tales into this new and magical story.

Although most of the humor is aimed directly at the adult viewer - and, let's face it, this is the grownup version of the Brothers Grimm - children will find much to enjoy, too, such as the dog whose really a prince, or the three troll siblings who fall in love with a boombox.

For those who think it's too silly, learn to laugh! And for those who think it's too juvenile, there are profound themes that will resonate in the mind long after the credits have rolled.

I highly recommend this movie.
