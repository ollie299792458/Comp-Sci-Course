This is an Epic on Film! The film gives you a great look at a couple of young street punks who band together & go on to create a crime syndicate. Now there may be a bit too much drama for those who like mostly action type mobster flicks. But anyways, this movie gives an excellent presentation (although the DVD version could & should have been better)despite some flaws in the DVD version. (namely when the first disc ends right in the middle of an action scene after the jewel robbery).

Also, the film is not perfect....

There are some scenes which in my opinion are just unneccesary, such as the rape scene in back of the limo & the film starts out very ackwardly & most probably won't understand the ending. Robert Deniro should have Narrated parts of the movie to give it more of a story telling feel.

I doubt any better DVD versions will be released soon, so basically your only option is to buy this one.

I also recommend "Miller's Crossing", "Good Fellas", "Casino", & "Scarface".
