I first saw this film in a packed cinema and I was encouraged by the response at the end from the audience. They remained in their seats riveted not moving for a considerable period of time and were obviously moved by what they had seen. So many Hollywood films portray schizophrenia incorrectly and those who suffer from this terrible disease as scary, violent, and often not redeeming people. Finally, audiences were able to see a film that accurately depicted this tragedy in a man of considerable intellect.

This movie was a breath of fresh air from the likes of Me, Myself and Irene with its perpetuation of the schizophrenia stereotypes.

I saw a similar reaction by an audience at the end of the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FWY09Y">Cutting For Stone</a> when it appeared at the Montreal Film Festival a few years ago. This was the story of a young teen developing schizophrenia who did not do as well as John Nash. What it did show was a more typical example and the two films together paint a realistic image of the disease and its impact.
