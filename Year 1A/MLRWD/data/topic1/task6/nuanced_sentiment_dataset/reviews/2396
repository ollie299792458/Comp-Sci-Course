I remembered this from years ago, and was quite excited about seeing it available on DVD. It really is a wonderful show, and I enjoyed it as a 40 year old adult as much as I did when I was 9.

Overall it is a great piece of 1960's kitsch which is great fun. The action is a bit jerky, more so than in Rudolph or other Rankin productions, but it is so fun that isn't an issue. It's similar in ways to "The Munsters" or "The Addam's Family" and other 1960's monster comedies, but it has it's own unique atmosphere and style, so you cannot say that it attempts to copy them in any way.

The monsters are based on the the classics: Frankenstein's Monster, his wife, Dracula, the Wolfman, the Creature From the Black Lagoon, King Kong, etc. and are presented in Rankin Bass's rather silly style, with Phyllis Diller's over the top corny humor and a knock off of Peter Lorre for comedy relief. There are some original elements as well, such as the Zombie Air Corps. I cannot say that it is first rate humor; it isn't, it's really cornball, but in a fun enjoyable way.

Another reviewer made the claim that it hasn't aged well, and I cannot in all honesty dispute this. However, you can say the same about the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, but that does not necessarily make them any less desirable or enjoyable.

In summary this film is not an award winner, but it is quite fun and enjoyable, and if you are like me you will have fond memories of it which will allow you to enjoy it all the more.
