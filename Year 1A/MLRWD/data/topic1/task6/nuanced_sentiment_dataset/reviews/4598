Perhaps my favorite romantic film of all time, on par with Ever After and Only You (also highly recommended), that I've watched at least a hundred times since I was a little girl.  It is Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock at their best, along with the rest of the amazing cast, Peter Boyle, Peter Galagher, and Jack Warden.  This is the ultimate family romantic comedy, tieing in a lovely Christmas theme-Bullock's character doesn't have a family and is 'adopted' by Bill Pullman's at Christmas, along with an interesting twist on what would be her ultimate romantic fantasy.  Bullock has eyed this gorgeous man, Peter Galagher, everyday at the train station ticket booth, attempting to make the first hints of conversation-but fails-until she is forced into his life by a freak accident where she must rescue him from impending death on the train tracks.  A mix-up at the hospital makes her family believe she is not only the now comatose Peter's rescuer, but fiance!  She attempts to tell the truth but gets so emotionally pulled into the family with her needing them to have someone to spend a lonely Christmas with, and them needing her to hold onto Peter while they wait for him to wake from the coma, that she simply plays along with the lie but oops! Eventually starts falling for her dream man's brother!  It shows many moral lessons, one that love is getting to know a person, not falling into an infatuation with their image everyday, and the appreciation of having a family to come home to for Christmas.  I highly recommend this movie for children and adults, it is filled with heartwarming and hilarious (as in the case of Joe Fusco, Jr.) characters that you will love for ages.
