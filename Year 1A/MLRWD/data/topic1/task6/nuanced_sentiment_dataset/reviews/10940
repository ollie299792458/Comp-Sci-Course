I've seen Ron Jeremey in porn since his waist was 32 inches.  Starting with Suzy Superstar in the late 70's where he was studly to today's performances that aside from his phenomenal penile performances, usually amount to freak shows.

I have to say it does appeal to my purient interest to see a 50 something guy, with a 40+ waist putting it to a young 20 year old.  Reminds me of the story of Grendel and Beuwolf.  Jeremy being the hairy Troll of course.

Don't get me wrong, I have the same body hair and underwent the same metamorphosis as Jeremy, but thankfully my waist has stabized at +- 36.  LOL.  But I do look in the mirror and wonder at how the stud I once was has disappeared beneath the sweater of back and shoulder hair.

Ron Jeremy has always been a hero of mine.  I fell in love with his performances, one in particular in "Snatchbuckler!"where he played a Captain Jack pirate character, Shadbelly,  long before Johnny Depp began acting.  His dialog was a plethora or ARRGGs! and creative salty langurage, as he gleefully impaled many a british lady prisoner on his massive "rudder post".  Great stuff.

This movie, while humanizing Jeremy, also shows his emotional frailty, and other things, like his apparent narcolepsy.  It hardly endeared him ot me to watch as he drove recklessly down the highway and shoulder while fighting to stay awake.  I'm glad I don't live and drive in L.A.

That aside, the movie is a hoot.  I plan to purchase the uncut, unrated version just for the titillating scenes of Jeremy with the latest female porn flavors of the day.

There will be no other Jeremy's simply because he is probably the only one that doesn't drink or do drugs.  North and Byron may join him on the pedestal eventually, but Jeremy will be on the top step.
