I never saw this in the theater, which is a good thing. The movie is hard to follow, and if you only see it once, you are probably going to leave scratching your head. I think that this was the director's intention. You are supposed to be wondering throughout most of the movie who wrote the proof, and has the daughter inherited her brilliant father's insanity?

Luckily, I have the DVD, so I was able to listen to the director's commentary, which clears up exactly what he was trying to get across in the movie.

The first time I watched the move, there were too many scenes which did not quite make sense. I had difficulty understanding the character motivations in places. This is a drama with a lot of emotions swirling about, and I think it is difficult to make sense of it in one viewing of the movie.

I give this 3 stars because if you buy the DVD, you can watch it multiple times and gain a better understanding with each viewing. I think the themes of the movie are interesting. Why don't people believe that she wrote the proof? And if she cannot prove that she wrote it, what can she do?
