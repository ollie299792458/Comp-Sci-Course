I rented this movie after reading a fairly animated op-ed piece in The Guardian regarding the dispute after the movie's release. Being one for truth and dissent, I thought I'd give this movie its fair shake.

To begin with, I am aware of the incident that the movie depicts.  I understand the goal of this movie and what Brian De Palma intended to accomplish by releasing it.  However, pontification aside, the movie must be reviewed on its cinematic merit and not simply because it is intended to be a message delivering vehicle no matter how noble the intentions of the director.

Several reviewers have already nailed it: if you're looking for an expos&eacute; of the Mahmoudiya incident or of the overall wisdom of George W. Bush's Iraq escapade, I respectfully suggest you look elsewhere.  The very much underrated television series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNE0RO">Over There (13 Episodes)</a> or perhaps Thomas Ricks' book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038915">Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq</a> or George Packer's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GQLCY6">The Assassins' Gate : America in Iraq</a> are better starting points.

While De Palma captures the feel of Iraq - the grittiness of the terrain, the harshness of the conditions, and the gulf that exists between the ideal of the American mission in Iraq and the reality of those who have been sent there to carry it out, sitting through the movie, I couldn't get past the agonizingly cartoonish portrayal of the American soldiers. Their comments and actions fall into every clich&eacute; and stereotype that one could imagine.

Beyond the cartoonish depictions of the soldiers, situations are presented that simply are not realistic.  An Al Jazeera-type news crew embedded with an American platoon as it conducts a house-to-house search that sets the foundation for the later tragedy. Drunken soldiers conspiring to commit murder while being videotaped by a fellow soldier. This list goes on.

"Over-acting", "bad acting", "bad directing," call it what you will but the depiction of the American soldiers and the events surrounding the Mahmoudiyah incident are simply not believable.

The most ridiculous line from the movie, supposedly an off-the-cuff, extemporaneous remark made by the movie's protagonist unknowingly while on camera: "A Band of Brothers, losing their moral compass and trying to reap vengeance on a fifteen year-old girl."  Despite the gravity moment I actually found myself laughing at the absurdity of this statement given the context within which it was made.

There's a message here, most definitely. The Mahmoudiya incident that the movie depicts was horrific. Iraq remains an American tragedy. Unfortunately, both the lesser and greater messages have been delivered credibly elsewhere. One star.
