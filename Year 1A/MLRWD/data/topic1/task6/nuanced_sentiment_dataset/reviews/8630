Never having seen the "late, great TVZ" live, I ordered this to learn more about him and at least see videos of him performing. As fans of TVZ know, his music gets you right in the gut and this video biography came close to breaking my heart.

In one scene, he is shown smiling while he is playing, "Waiting Around to Die" to an audience of 2 and as I listened I came close to tears. In fact, the man who was behind him, started out smiling as he listened and ended up with large tears rolling down his cheeks.  His music has the power to do that to you, even in a video.

The film doesn't minimize his addictions and the effect it had on his life and the pain inflicted on the people who loved him.  It was also clear that he cared about them too.  He inspired loyalty because, in his own way, he was loyal.

Early in the film, he is heard saying that he didn't expect to live long and that his life would end before his work was finished because "I've designed it that way." True to his prediction, he was still trying to finish one more record when he left us.  I'm sure he is still writing and performing his songs in that other place.

If you are a fan of TVZ, get this movie. It's one you will want to see more than once.
