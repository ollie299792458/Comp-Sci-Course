Unfortunately there is no negative star rating on Amazon reviews... and if there were I doubt it would go as far into the negatives as I would care to rate it.
This was by far the suckiest bunch of suck that ever sucked. I can usually find a redeeming quality in even the worst of movies, but this one had nothing. Why did I even watch it all the way through? I was just waiting for something to make sense and for some surprise ending... but the best part of this movie was that I didn't pay to see it so the idiot that made it got no money from me.
There's really just no need to go into detail as to why this movie sucked... if you need to find one reason to watch this movie you've come to the wrong place, because this one isn't even worthy of spoofing on MST3K... 
AHHHHH!!! Suck isn't even a good enough word to describe how bad this movie was. Imagine a great movie where you get so consumed by it that when it ends you realize you are back in the real world and the adventure is over... now imagine the complete opposite of that... where right from the beginning you are trying to figure out why you are watching it, what better things you could be doing with the time you are wasting watching it, and how much longer will it be before it ends... counting every second hoping it's a short movie. 
Shame on you movie people for allowing such shlock to even be billed with real movies.
