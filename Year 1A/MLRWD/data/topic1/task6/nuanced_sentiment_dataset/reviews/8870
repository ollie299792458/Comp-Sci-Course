It is a very powerful story as it challanges how strong one stands with their own beliefs. Even though Sergent York believed in God and peace and saw the wrongness in taking another person's life, he came to see a bigger picture and that is that not everybody holds to that same belief, infact the the very things that we believe in and hold dear, the right and wrong as we know it can become threatened. What are we going to do about it?
This is the very heart of the movie, it is about putting aside our personal veiws to see a bigger picture, it is about not just giving verbal support, but about putting your life on the line of what you believe and understand, it is about standing up for what is right. It can cost, but it can also come with unexpected rewards. The fact that it is taken of a true story adds greatly to the richness and depth of the story.
The documentry side of this dvd package, adds to the veiwing of the movie and the story behind the movie. Overal the whole package is well put together and well worth watching.
