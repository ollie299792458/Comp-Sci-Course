After seeing My Bloody Valentine 3D, I couldn't believe how far 3D films have come in the last 50 years. I was in my local video store last night, saw this for sale, and immediately grabbed it up.

I specifically avoided getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JP572">Friday the 13th box set</a> because they didn't offer the third movie in 3D. New Line Cinema had the right idea when they released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780626966">The Nightmare on Elm Street box set</a> with "Freddy's Dead" in 3D.

I must admit, I was very pleased at finally seeing this not only in 3D format, but widescreen format as well. I've watched the pan & scan version more times than I could possibly count - with roughly 66% of the scene getting trimmed to fit on a standard tv screen, that's a lot of lost material. The 3D glasses have Jason's hockey mask design on them...a nice touch.

Some of the better 3D sequences are as follows:

- Andy & Shelly's juggling scene
- The harpoon bolt scene
- The "pass the joint" scene
- Rick's "eye pop" scene

Here's the main issue I had with this version: unlike the newer versions of 3D films like My Bloody Valentine which were done in digital format, Friday the 13th 3D used an "over and under" technique which eliminated the need for dual projector set-ups, and produced widescreen, but darker, less vivid, polarized 3-D images.

Basically this means that in this edition, we have images that don't jump out like newer versions do. It's hard to focus your eyes on the action during the movie, people's faces are blurry during many sequences, and the color scheme feels like we're watching a movie in sepia tone.

Old-school Friday fans like myself will be happy that this version is finally out, but the lack of special features and the older format of 3D shows us that Paramount clearly wanted to cash in on the hype over My Bloody Valentine. I own it, I'm glad to have it, but I'm still waiting for a better version to come along with more extras.
