Throughout his relationship with Sharon Tate, Roman was completely unfaithful and as often as possible. His lack of integrity and disrespect towards women in general has always disgusted me. It was said that Sharon thought having a baby would make Roman finally show her some respect and was very hurt when she realized nothing was going to change him. He always copped out and said "well Sharon knew what I was like" or "she said she didn't want to change me".  All the while he knew how she really felt. I'm sure when they first met Sharon was naive and said a lot of things about relationships that were considered cool for the times, but everyone who knew the two of them personally also knew that his behavior hurt her. He's a male version of a slut and a total narcissist. I'm glad he finally got some karma action by getting tossed in prison and then prevented from returning to the U.S.  Some years after Sharon's death he said one thing that really shows what he's like, "It's good that Sharon died before our love could die" or something very,very close to that. Incredibly stupid. He thinks anything he says is pure art. He really must have thought that was a clever statement. Sharon wasted her time and she wasted her life on this pathetic excuse for a man. He's simply a pervert.
