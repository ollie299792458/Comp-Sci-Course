So many plot holes!  If somebody was murdered by hundreds of heating lamps... maybe the FBI should try to find out who the heck bought all those lamps?  If somebody got burned to death in a pool of sulfuric acid, maybe, just maybe, they need to find out who purchased tanks and tanks of sulfuric acid! It's not one of those everyday items you buy at your local walmart! Who the heck wrote this script?  A middle schooler?  Are you kidding me?

The main character, who is a trained FBI agent has no idea how to protect herself knowing that someone's out there to kill her!  Her computer gets broken into...and she's supposed to be a cybercrime expert?  Her car got broken into and reprogrammed (huh?) and now that it's started back up again.. she enters the freaking car without even checking it out!  And of course the killer was hiding in the back seat the whole time!  What?????  Are you kidding me?

I understand what they're trying to say... yes, things are getting perverted and people are getting more and more desensitized. It's scary.. But come on... at least put some effort into writing a decent script...

And what's with the FBI agents cheering as the main character kills the killer at the end?  Do they think it's a football game?
