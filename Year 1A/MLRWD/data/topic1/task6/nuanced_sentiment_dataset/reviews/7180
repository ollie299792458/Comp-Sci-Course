Having studied the ill-fated Titanic since I was a pre-teen and seeing every film and documentary of the "ship of dreams",  I wanted to like this movie but going into this film I knew what to expect from Shane Van Dyke. If the story, acting and special effects weren't bad enough, Van Dyke just seemed to go into this film without a care in the world. Cameron's "Titanic" was a bad enough film to begin with (and although "Titanic II" is in no way related to that film) and a different league of it's own, the worst and most obvious part of this movie is the fact that Van Dyke paid no attention to hide the fact that this film was shot aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach, CA. Several long shots of the exterior of the ship are obvious that this three-stack, yes three-stack not four, ocean liner is, in fact, the Queen Mary. The funniest part of this movie was when the ship left port to set sail on the high seas. The rock wall that houses the Queen Mary around her resting place in Long Beach is clearly visible. I guess the "Titanic II" ship was suppose to break through the rock wall and set sail on the open seas!! The other obvious factions of the movie is the sign "Queen Mary Hotel" {or something to that fact) is visible (where real tourists visiting the ship board when checking in to get to their rooms) as the "Titanic" passengers come aboard ship and the city of Long Beach is clearly visible in several scenes. I realize that Van Dyke was obviously not given much money to film this 'film'?? but cameras could have been positioned to not show these intentional errors as they were in the original "The Poseidon Adventure" back in 1971. Van Dyke really needs to learn a lot more about film-making, and acting for that matter, if he intends on making this his career.
