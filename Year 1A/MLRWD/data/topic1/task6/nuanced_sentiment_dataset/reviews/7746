Look, I understand with most movies in today's age ... you get your typical fill of conservative bashing with how the world is full of racist, homophobic, ignorant religious  folks AND they in Hollywood are the smart folks (now that's funny) ...  who advise the masses, what the world is really like... Seriously ... I would just be happy with a well written movie with good acting ... THIS MOVIE WAS A BIG BORE and poorly written... I WANT MY $$$ BACK ...!!! ...

My update to a recent posted comment ...  I certainly have the ability to distinguish whether a movie is "smart, funny and deeply moving" ... smart = Mad Men, funny = Bridesmaids and deeply moving = Kissing Jessica Stein ... I just expected more from a Yale writer ...

Additional, thoughts for those considering the movie ... Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig were barely in the movie so a bit of bait and switch when viewing the featured picture ...plus, Adam Scott's character was so unattractive, immature, misogynistic rendering him completely unlikable leaving one to ponder could ANY chemistry actually exist between the two main characters ...

And as a sidenote ... the movie was peppered with references about Bush/waterboarding/anti-organized religion comments ...which probably will not offend the typical demographic who would seek out this movie ... I just find it funny that hollywood can't help themselves when dishing out this stuff ... it's similar to a comedian who uses profanity ... when the true talent can eliminate this from their act and still attract audiences ...
