I finally saw this on Youtube, and there isn't much for me to say about it.  I saw the original incarnation of the TV series on PBS when it was first imported to the US, and found it appealing on a number of levels.  It had a very dry and droll sense of wit.  The kind of underspoken humor that was so popular in British comedy; i.e. you were told the joke and given a moment or two to churn it in your head and then laugh as you saw fit.

So, imagine my surprise when this comedic style was held over as an afterthought for a feature film, but predominantly replaced by a huge Hollywood like production with grand SFX, a giant score, massive amounts of CGI and props permeating with a kind of high energy zest harkening from screwball comedies.  What do make of a film like that?  In a word?  Interesting.

It wasn't bad as such, but I had a hard time connecting with this film.  When I read Douglas Adams' books there was a kind of movement and energy to them, but again a more literary type of humor that you had to translate from the author's imagination to your own.  The original BBC series had found a formula for that, and gave it an appropriate low budget gloss to finalize the product.

This film, however, explodes with production values.  So much that said production values actually explode and drown out the humor in all its forms.  That's not to say that there isn't a laugh here and there, because there is, but the movie that might've been is pushed aside in favor of wowing the movie goers with massive amounts of special effects and high energy acting.

Well, the film is what it is.  If a revamping of the series were to be done, or rather a fresh take on the original material, I think a TV series dealing with installments would be more appropriate than trying to cram all of the books into one huge two-hour plus long feature film.

Not a bad film, but a bit too much for me.

Take it for what it is.
