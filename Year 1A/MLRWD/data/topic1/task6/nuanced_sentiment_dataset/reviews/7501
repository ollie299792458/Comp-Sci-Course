Back in the stone age... 1989, to be exact...  I was in college. Two friends and I decided to take some strong acid and climb a mountain. Well, we did that, and it was an amazing experience, but nothing could prepare me for what happened upon our return back to the dorm (all wild-eyed, sweaty and grungy like a trio of psychotic wildmen).

A friend of mine had a VHS copy of "Killer Klowns from Outer Space". He had just watched it, and decided that, in our state, we were definitely the target audience.
So we settled in, mixed ourselves a cocktail, and pressed play...
WHOA!!!!
This movie rocked our worlds in ways that cannot even be expressed... Sure, the drugs helped, but the movie was already so uniquely out of its mind, that it hardly needed a psychotropic concierge. It already existed in a truly bizarre universe, with a hint of made-for-TV David Lynch, constantly straddling the line between absolute s**t and sublime parody. It was campy B-movie strangeness that alternated between generic 80's fodder (anyone who went through the 80's knows how formulaic and mind-numbing the films and TV were...) and freaky deaky, nightmarish imagery that played like a come-to-life Bruegel painting -- a rogues gallery of haggard, alien clowns
If you want a heapin' helping of a bizarre nightmare told through the lens of "Who's the Boss?"-style moviemaking, I recommend that you buy the DVD, drop a tab of acid, and just let go...
