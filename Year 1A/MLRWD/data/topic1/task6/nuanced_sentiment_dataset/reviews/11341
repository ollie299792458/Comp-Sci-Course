When I saw the previews to this movie I just had to have it.  I am a Sci-Fi fanatic, and it has been quite some time since I have seen a great Sci-Fi movie!  Unfotunately that is still the case.

The whole story about our sun dying is quite intriguing.  The movie gets a pretty strong start, even though it lacks any sort of prelude.  It simply starts with a picture of the sun and an actor saying "Our sun is dying."  A high tech ship flying straight toward the sun, with a somewhat skilled crew of only moderate acting abilities.  Their ship, the second launched by earth in an attempt to save our sun, contains a payload which holds our last chance at saving mankind.  The first ship had failed its mission and it is assumed that the ship and all crew are lost.  The remainder of the film is filled with unfortunate yet somewhat predictable events.  I didn't mind that the movie lacked the mystery and suspense that I had hoped for, but the special effects were extremely dissapointing.  What is a Sci-Fi film without stunning special effects?  One that will collect dust for years in the very back of my DVD cabinet.

I am not sorry that I watched this film.  It is certainly worth a watch.  I just wish that I had rented it, as I will likely never watch it again.  I cannot recommend this DVD for purchase, but I do recommend renting the movie and watching it, if you are a die hard Sci-Fi fan.  If you enjoy a great Sci-Fi space thriller then you will surely enjoy the film, but I think you will agree, once finished, that it is definately rental material.  I hope you enjoy the movie.

P.S.  If you ever saw the movie "Solar Crisis", released sometime in the early 90s, then you will definately see strong similarities in this movie "Sunshine."
