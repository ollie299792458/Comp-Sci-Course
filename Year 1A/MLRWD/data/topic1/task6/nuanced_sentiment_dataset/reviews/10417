Scary Movie 2's attempt to cash in on it's predecessor doesn't work.  At least not for me.  While some moments are truly funny, the Exorcist rip-off mainly along with Chris Elliot's scenes, it still falls short of a funny film.  I did find myself laughing at times, but however my conclusion is that this is a very weak film that is just trying to cash in on the blockbuster original.  I sat there most of the time thinking about how bored I was.  Some of the jokes and scenes intended to be hilarious weren't even funny in my opinion.
Some of those characters who supposedly died in the original were back in the sequel with no explantion of how they managed to live.  Most of the scenes in this movie are downright tasteless and nasty.  But then again, so were those in the first.  And I admit, I liked the first.  And I liked Scary Movie 2 -- perhaps to a certain extent, but it's still a very weak film.
If you're looking for a nasty and crude comedy, then this is for you.  But my advice is to stay as far way from it as you can.  Or you can go and check out the original.
