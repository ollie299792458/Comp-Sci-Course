I live in the heart of NASCAR country, North Carolina, and where this entire film was made and based. Although I care nothing about NASCAR and everything about basketball. This movie has its moments. But, all in all, it isn't good. The jokes are recycled again and again. And again. Definately worth seeing once; definately not worth owning.

It starts out with great potential: "If you ain't first, your last". What a saying. But it goes downhill and is really not that funny. The movie drags on and becomes boringly predictable.

Even people who worship Will Ferrell will find this movie not worth owning. I know because I saw it with two people who view anything Will Ferrell does as gold. Except this.

And, to prove that isn't a good movie, Sony had to release an unrated and uncut version. If you have to resort to more cursing or sex or violence, you didn't do a good job to begin with. The movie should carry itself without the need to add that extra stuff. Anytime you see "Unrated", you know the movie is lacking somewhere.

If you got this movie with your PS3, fine. You didn't have to pay for a subpar movie. Although the Blu-Ray version doesn't really show what HD movies can do. There are plenty other Blu-Ray and all other HD DVD movies out there that clearly show the superiority of HD discs of standard DVD's.
