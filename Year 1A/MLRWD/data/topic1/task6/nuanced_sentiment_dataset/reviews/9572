. . . if I am going to watch the next season. Get some adults to write the next shows. I was a Dexter fan from the beginning but had a problem when Rita came into the picture. Dexter as a family man? Anyway, I stuck it out and rate the other seasons 4.5 and 5 stars (glad to see her go). However, Season 6 is a contrived mess. When your whole show depends on the title character surviving by being picked up more than 5 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean by a random boat when he is going under and about to drown . . . Really?  Burning gasoline in a nice circle in the middle of the ocean . . . Really? This season is filled with this sort of fantasy writing to advance the plot. Showtime is lucky they haven't been sued by the producers of Fight Club and The Sopranos for stealing their story ideas. On the other hand, Brother Sam was one of the best characters ever to appear in this show. He would have been great to keep around for seasons to come. It was nice to see Dexter talk to a real person instead of the dead people in his mind. Sam would have given this show a much needed genuine character who demonstrated the possibility of redeeming oneself regardless of your past. No, kill him off. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, about 2.5. Some reviewers gave this 1 star and complained about the beginning promo that spoiled the whole season. Maybe they bought bootlegs. I always skip the ads and did so with these discs by simply pushing the Skip button. I didn't know about the spoiler until I started to write this. One last thing. The carriers for the set I have will not hold the discs in place so they come loose even when you close the case. I had to tape them in place to keep them from sliding around and getting scratched up.
