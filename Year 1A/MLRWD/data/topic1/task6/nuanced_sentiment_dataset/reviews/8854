I'm not about to go into the detail another reviewer did regarding Sensurround, etc. on this release but I just recently purchased the Universal 100th anniversary edition of this release, which apparently is the same one which was released in 2006! And while the picture is fine, the audio is not.  The volume level of the center (dialogue) channel is very low in the so-called 5.1 version (I didn't even bother to listen to the so-called 3.1 Sensurround track).  I really had to crank up the level on my receiver way higher than normal.  The low frequency effects which were there weren't at all impressive and I didn't hear any surround at all.  Of course, this movie was made before the days of Dolby stereo in theatres.  Also, I didn't remember that this was such a bad movie.  The cast seemed to almost limp thru their parts, the plot was a bore and even the earthquake effects weren't all that exciting, although I kept hoping that Ava Gardner would be hit by a giant falling slab of concrete.  Even Chuck Heston was off his mark.  This film was part of the disaster movie wave which was sweeping thru theatres in the 70's and had it not been for the great Sensurround effects which were played back in equipped theatres, it might have just been a .1 on the Richter scale.
