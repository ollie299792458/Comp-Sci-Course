Thankyou Aardman for laying waste to one of popular theories of film making. My  previously unblemished idea that all animated pictures would be of a nothing less than superior  quality has been crushed. 
What happened? It looked incredible - but I now  realise the trailers only showed the very best  bits from the film, which I felt was hurried along way to quickly, and very little character development actually occurred (particularly in the case of Rocky). There were a few amusing touches, such as the constant references to other films (indy jones, star wars, star trek etc - see if you can spot them). In some peolpe's eyes I can see how this film is considered as excellent - all the ingredients are there - but for me it just didn't work. 
The story follows the plans of Ginger, a determined chicken, who is desperate to escape from a battery farm, but is visited by a certain Rocky the Rooster, who poses as a flight expert in order to gain various things. All the while the farm owners have other plans, involving a chicken pie machine. 
See it by all means, and draw your own conclusions, but there is better material out there (namely the CGI stuf by Pixar - Toy Story et al).
