Like many others, I never watched Veronica Mars until reading these reviews and then renting the DVD set from the local library.  I have to admit it took me a good three episodes before I got hooked, then there was no tearing me away from my TV until i had completed the entire season in only 3 days time.  I have to say I am so upset I did not discover this show until going into it's thrid season.  After watching season 1 on DVD I then ordered myself a copy of amazon so that i would have it to watch over and over again until the copy I ordered of Season 2 comes out at the end of August.

This show really is a buffy and nancy drew meets OC. It contains the highschool drama, romance, mystery, twists, and excitement. Veronica is very witty and intelligent making this show amazing! Aside from the season long mystery that veronica is always working on, each individual episode has a mini mystery that is solved by the end of the episode. On top of all that you are following the lives of veronica, her friends, boyfriend/ex-boyfriend through highschool, break-ups, suicide, and murder.

BUY this DVD and Season 2 and watch them, you will not be disappointed, you will surely be hooked and anticiapting the next season. Season 3 starts October 3rd, TUesday at 9pm on channel 9. Be sure to tune in!
