For fans of "The Venture Brothers" this DVD set will not disappoint. Thirteen excellent episodes that surpass the first season, starting with the season opener "Powerless in the Face of Death" that begins with the song "Everybody's Free" and a great montage of what everyone is doing, the return of the Underbhiet in "Love Bheits" & Molotov Cocktease in "Assasinanny 911", a wonderfully titled "Twenty Years to Midnight", and the final two-parter "Showdown at Cremation Creek"

The packaging and cover art are simply great. The line "Love never blows up and gets killed" is hilarious considering just how the Venture boys make their return.

The "Extras" consists of deleted scenes and a "tour" of Astro-Base Go which is a very cheap, but funny video.  It certainly appears that the creators don't take themselves that seriously which is a good thing. I do get the feeling that they've been bitten by the same "performance" bug that Trey Parker & Matt Stone from "South Park" got. Guys, just because you can create funny stuff doesn't mean that you come across as funny.

My one complaint is about the DVD commentary which is pretty bad on virtually every episode.  Its one thing to go off on tangents, but most of the commentary is just the guys talking about nothing in particular.  Hopefully they'll think of DVD commentary a bit differently on the next season, which will probably come out in the Fall of 2008.

If you're a fan of the Ventures, then buy this DVD right now.
