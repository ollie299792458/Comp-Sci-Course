If you like excellent character acting, and are a Jack Nicholson fan, you'll love this movie. Nicholson BECOMES this character named Schmidt, a retired insurance type who thinks his life has made no difference to anyone else and finds out just how wrong that feeling is at the end. The movie is alternately hilarious, then sad, then both. The depiction of the Denver natives, into whose family Schmidt's daughter is marrying, is right on! I've lived in metro Denver for 18 years and I can attest that there are thousands of people who act, and look!, just like them. Too long mustaches, long hair, pseudo-mystical, never been anywhere outside of Colorado and are generally clueless when confronted with anyone from out of state. Nicholson's character handles all of this with a classy, unpretentious grace, and Jack's expressions convey exactly what he REALLY thinks. Excellent, well-directed film with superb acting by everyone throughout. I'm buying this one for it is a movie that will never bore me.
