After a long speech by John Travolta's Gabriel Shear about the realism of hostage movies, particularly Pacino's 'Dog Day Afternoon', he gets up and leaves the coffee shop. Following him, is Stanley Jobson (the superb Hugh Jackman), looking rather worried... Outside, a huge police blockade! Snipers, helicopters, squad cars and an excellent Don Cheadle co-ordinating the police. "Step aside, I won't ask again." Travolta says, clutching some hand held device. Shear and Jobson then walk into a bank across the street, hostages by the dozen wrapped in C-4 and ball bearings waiting there... Shear's men leave the bank,with the hostages, then one of the hostages is grabbed by the police. "Let her go!" Jackman shouts. "Release the hostage!" Cheadle shouts. "It's done, take cover!" says Travolta... Then, BOOM! The hostage, out of range explodes... Then, in slo-mo and flo-mo, we are treated to a 270 degree pan of the scene- ball bearings tearing up the SWAT team, the cafe, cops flying over their vehicles. Jackman, on the floor, looks up and sees a ball bearing rolling over to him... and there ends the greatest opening to a movie ever seen... The rest of the film never lives up to the first ten minutes, but it's still pretty damn good though!
