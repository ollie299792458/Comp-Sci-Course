The Beginning of the End.......
Off starts the second season with more gadgets and more guest stars but somehow this probably started to hurt the popularity of the show. It got into a rut, the plots became very similar, heres a breakdown of the plot,
1) Villain enters town
2) Gordon calls Batman
3) Batman and Robin go to the Commissioner's office
4) The duo go after the criminal
5) They get caught and put in a trap
6) By some incredible means they escape
7) They chase the villain
8) A fight with the bad guys
9) Justice prevails and off to prison the villains go
In the first season, everything was fresh and new but after a while, it became too predictable. They added a ton of huge guest stars the second season which did keep viewers coming back to a certain extent. Another reason the show slipped in the ratings had nothing to do with the actual show ! Other networks deciding that since Batman, a superhero, was a great hit, why not introduce their own version of a character in the new fall line up of 1966 ( remember, Batman came on in January before the regular fall release in September ). These shows included, Mr Terrific, Captain Nice, then the cartoons followed suit with no less than 6 super hero cartoons.
The American public was overloaded with Superpowers.
