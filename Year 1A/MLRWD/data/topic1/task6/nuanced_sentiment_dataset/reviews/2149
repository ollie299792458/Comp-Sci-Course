If you're looking for a decent film on obsession, this might entertain you. It is by no means the best and I have seen better, but this is a decent effort which will hold your attention once.

The acting is a bit over the top especially from the stalker, but if you're looking for a story that's a bit contrived and you actually like that kind of thing, then this should be enjoyable for you. Basically it's about a white woman who becomes obsessed with a successful, good-looking black man. One thing - he's already married. Does that stop the white chick? No.

At first, his association with her seems harmless. He is flattered by her attention and praise, but then soon enough he realizes that it's not the innocent admiration of a fangirl and has to deal with her ever-increasing threats against him and particularly his wife. Ali Larter does a nice job as the crazy stalker, but this movie made me laugh out loud a couple of times without meaning to. at 3/5 stars, this movie is worth watching once - depending on your tastes.
