I just watched this DVD and I was appalled at the men I used to revere as my musical heroes.  At every turn they seemed vain, childish, self-centered, and invariably spoiled by their success.  As a reviewer before me put it, Lars, James, and Kirk have lost touch with reality.  Worse still is having to sit through their pointless rationalizations for their juvenile posturings while cobbling together the worst material they've yet written for an album.  The film alternates from lame psycho-babble and disingenuous shows of affection or anger to scenes of a burned-out group of musical hacks slogging away in laughable attempts at musical "experimentation."  ...Only, Metallica's new direction has less to do with expanding their musical boundaries than it does with their pure laziness.  They've gotten too lazy after the Black album, which in and of itself was a let down from their previous efforts.  They put a ton of work into their older material, and I think they pussed out since then.  Their old material truly was experimental for its time.  The stuff now is just thoughtless in comparison.

But, I digress.  This review is really about what an utter waste of time this movie is.

The only highlights were the interviews with Newsted and Dave Mustaine, the two people who've suffered most at the hands of Metallica's twin jerks, Lars and James.  Kirk didn't seem so nuts, and I appreciated some of the stuff he had to say.  His segments in the film were a refreshing change of pace from the melodrama between his bandmates.

I have a lot of sympathy for the poor schmucks dealing with Lars and James.  That poor therapist was working with men who had the emotional capacity of 9-year-olds!  Heaven help him!  ...And it's too bad about Trujillo.  I think he's a great bass player with a lot of energy, and I hate to see it wasted on a sinking ship...Metallica that is.

This film is a joke, and a self-serving one at that.
