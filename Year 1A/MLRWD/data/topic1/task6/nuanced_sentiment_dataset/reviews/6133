The first two seasons of nip/tuck were awesome but season three took things in a terrible direction. The writers changed the charecters and slapped us in the face with the outcome of this carver deal. The show used to be upbeat and still had a playfull tone even though there were some major issues. I would still find myself laughing or smiling about something every episode. But every episode in season three was so depressing and dreary that it was tough to make it through to the end.
 The character changes through me off big time. example: Dr Troy's hair was tore up the entire season. I know its kinda nitpicky but he was a player and he seemed like more of a loser. Dr McNamara and taking in the witness protection family was plain dumb.
The kicker for me was when you find out the secret of Quentin. It seemed as if the writers ran out of ways to shock their viewers so they came up with something very stupid. I was shocked but at the writers for being brain dead.
sorry bout the rant but I felt cheated as I watched season three.
Makes me not care about season four.
