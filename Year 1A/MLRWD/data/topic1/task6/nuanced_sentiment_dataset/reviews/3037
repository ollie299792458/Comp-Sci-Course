OK - in 2003 France came out with a gem of a horror movie called Haute Tension (High Tension in the U.S.). High Tension is one of the best horror films of the decade if you ask me, and a lot of horror critics would agree. It came out swingin' with tasteful cinematography, believable anguish in the wonderfully casted characters, a haunting soundtrack, and the most glorious brutality to grace the silver screen in years.

INSIDE - recommended to me by several people, simply steals the same editor, steals the same music composer (the soundtracks sound almost identical), and then tries to double the gore. Unfortunately, this plan is a little too obvious to me. The majority of the gore feels unnecessary and forced. I began to feel like I was just watching some goons have fun with special effects for no reason at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the director even had his actors watch High Tension and try to copy their expressions of pain and agony to a T. I couldn't help but be turned off by all of this, leaving me feeling like all I have left with the film is an uncreative chain of gory killings, which is no longer anything special in modern horror.

The plot with the car accident and the unborn child starts out seeming like it could go somewhere very visceral and powerful, but instead it stops dead as soon as the villain is introduced and feels trite and pointless. Because of this, the movie loses its emotional aspect and loses a lot of its appeal.

So in the end - What Inside lacks is emotion, depth, and purpose - which unfortunately are probably the most important things in movies! What is strong about the movie and gives it it's 6 out of 10 is in the music, the editing, the violence, and the style - which are all stolen directly from High Tension. See that film instead. PLEASE.
