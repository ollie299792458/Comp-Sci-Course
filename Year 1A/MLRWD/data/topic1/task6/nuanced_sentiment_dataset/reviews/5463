Upon a recommendation from my father, who, like me, is a big Sigourney Weaver fan, I took my allowance one Saturday, walked to Blockbuster with a friend and bought the Ghostbusters DVD. I watched it at my friend's house and once I started I yelled at her about not putting on subtitles.  But I loved the movie.  By the middle of the movie, my friend's dad and little sister were watching with us.
  Ghostbusters is the hilariously clever, brilliantly designed, interestingly casted movie.  They plot was a little strange, but that just added to the enjoyment of the movie.  With Sigourney Weaver starring as Dana Barrett,  Dr. Peter Venkman's (Bill Murray) 'would-be-girlfriend' and Rick Moranis as the lovestruck, nerdy, neighbor of Dana Barrett's, Louis Tully.
  After Dana encounters a strange creature in her refrigerator, she calls on the Ghostbusters, a business dealing with the removal of paranormal pests for help.  When one of them, Venkman, sees Dana, he immediately falls in love with her.  But when he is unable to locate the ghost in Dana's house, she shuns him with a 'You son't act like a scientist.  You're more like a game show host.'  Venkman leaves, still thinking about her.  Later on, when Dana is possesed by the creature from her refrigerator it's up to the Venkman, along with his coworkers, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler (and Winston Zeddeman)to stop the evil Gozer from destroying the world.
  This is a very interesting DVD.  It's absolutely HILARIOUS!  I was laughing nearly the whole time.  If you need some laughs, buy/rent this DVD.  You won't be sorry!
