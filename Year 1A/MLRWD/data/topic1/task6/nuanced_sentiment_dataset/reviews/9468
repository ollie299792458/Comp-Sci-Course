Sorry Mies Van Der Rohe but I disagree whith Less Is More after seeing this edition of Fanny & Alexander!

Well... This edition is worth every single $ or £ or ! The transfer is perfect! Perfect! The colours of the movie in its splendour comes alive! Yes! Those reds and yellows and whites and deep blacks takes my breath away...

The story is seen through the eyes of the young Alexander and is told in dreamlike sequences!

The excellent photography of Sven Nykvist and his looking for the most special angles and the happy cast perfectly synthonized with Bergman's direction (seen on The Making Of Fanny & Alexander) is amazing!

This is the BEST EDITION when compared to the Artificial Eye one! It's (more) cleaner and brightfull! Criterion always wins!

This package is brilliantly designed and beautifull!

Does everyone noticed the white figure of Alexander's father inside the DVDs box? Amazing!

Everything that we should want IS HERE: The Complete Edition of 5 hours long (in 2 DVDs) + The Theatrical Edition (1 DVD) + The Making of Fanny & Alexander (2 DVDs)! And a very beautifull booklet with many photos!

Now the story comes closer to my heart and this special - or should I say Definitive - edition are here for us to commemorate this masterpiece!
