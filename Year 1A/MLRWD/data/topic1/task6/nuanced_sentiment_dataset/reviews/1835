Just showed the film to my girlfriend. This is my fourth time watching it. I just got this movie on dvd a few months ago. Decent transfer. I'm glad they did the transfer though. Not many people know of this movie. They rather do a transfer of "American Pie" than this movie! Overall, this is a great movie. One of Kurosawa's best! I rank this movie up there with "The Seven Samurai". It's a beautiful story with great characters, beautiful sceneries, and a touching ending. It's basically in my top ten movies of all time! If you haven't seen it, check it out, be patient and the reward will come. I think that's the key. With any good foreign movie, you have to give it "patience". Let the images go through you, transform you to another time and place. That's what you get when you watch poetry at work. It's a painting; all the colors and movements form to give you the whole picture. And this movie is like that. It moves you. I promise--you'll remember it for the rest of your life!
