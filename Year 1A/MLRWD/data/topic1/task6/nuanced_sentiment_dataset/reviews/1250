The series itself is great, but the decision to release this Blu-ray edition in cropped format (reframing the original 1.33:1 source material to 1.78:1) means that it's not worth buying. Sadly, it's probably too late to convince the disc producers to change their minds on this point.

The worst part is that the Blu-ray producers wouldn't need to do any more work to put the series out in its proper framing: as noted by one of the people working on the restoration...

"...all of the grading and restoration was done to the original 4:3 material, before it was cropped to 16:9. So, if for some reason we ever need it, we do have the restored version in its original aspect ratio."

I can understand that they might need the 1.78:1 framing for broadcast, if TV channels won't accept pillarboxed 4:3 framing (as the above article suggests), but I'm frustrated that they won't put out the correct framing for the home collector.

So I'll be keeping my DVD edition of this fantastic documentary and not laying out the money for this Blu-ray: the DVD is perfectly watchable and correctly framed, and that trumps any resolution gain or audio remix.
