I enjoy some of Miley Cyrus' work and I appreciate her effort in the entertainment business.  I was neutral going into this movie, didn't form any opinion when I saw the line up of actors and was very excited waiting for this movie.  I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books, this one included and I was thrilled when I saw he was the screenwriter.  However, after watching the movie I can't help but feel disappointed.  The story line fell in the teen/family genre of movies, whereas the book story line would have been appropriate for teens, but also touching and effective for other demo-graphs.  The acting was ok.  Ronnie's Dad was great!  Will was good.  Miley did all right.

*SPOILERS BELOW*

  Markus was hardly in the story and the mention of his fire activity was seen briefly, the severity of her father's  illness was downplayed, and the girl Ronnie left behind to be the supportive daughter was hardly understood.  The story was changed a lot, and in doing so,  they went in the wrong direction.  Of course the book is always better in any adaptation, but if you are going to put a  book to screen you should at least follow the story and stick to it.  It would have worked better then what they came up with.  I also thought the music was oddly placed at times and too much of it.

*End Of Spoilers*

I gave this 3 stars because, just like Nights in Rodanthe it brought a book I fell in love with to life in a sense, so because I read the book I can fill the gaps in.  Others I am sorry for you.  Read the book.  If you are looking for a movie like The Notebook, don't look here.  That was a great book adaption.
