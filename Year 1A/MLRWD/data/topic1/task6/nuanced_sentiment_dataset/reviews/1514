There's a rugged sense of authenticity throughout the 1953 adventure film "Island in the Sky" as World War II vets fly through brutal terrain. During an ice storm, a crew guiding a hulking C-47 is forced to crash land in uncharted Canadian wilderness. Trapped by the elements, they must survive sub-zero weather and pray for help. It's a simple set-up aided by the dependable presence of John Wayne as a no-nonsense pilot holding his grounded team together. It's clear the film was made by men who notched more than a few hours of flight time, and the efforts of a clique of fearless pilots attempting to find the lost crew are fascinating scenes of suspense.

"Island in the Sky" was one of a handful of Wayne films held out of circulation for decades and re-released to video with fanfare in 2005. While it's not a great film, it was piloted by a storied crew of legends. Foremost is Wayne, the gregarious workaholic lug who to this day is one of the most beloved actors in history. It's always a joy to run across his lessor-known films and see him out of his element, and sometimes they are surprisingly good (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O599X0">Trouble Along the Way</a>). "Island in the Sky" has multiple, head-scratching elements severely dating it, most notably the surreal narration explaining the obvious. Director William Wellman voiced the dialogue, and there are times you wish you could throw a brick at him. There's not a single scene where narration was necessary, and it dilutes the drama. But that doesn't stop Mr. Wellman, who ponderously recites endless paragraphs as if reciting Shakespeare.

Wellman was approaching the end of a long career perhaps best known for his colorful personality, an adventure-loving World War I flyboy in his youth. He famously landed an airplane near Douglas Fairbanks' home and insisted on a job in the movies. And so he was hired, working his way through the ranks with uncommon drink and tempestuous determination. In spite of himself, he forged more than a few classics (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067MLCD4">Wings</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HBV2S">The Public Enemy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008LDO3">The Ox-Bow Incident</a>). He was undoubtedly a fan of Ernest K. Gann, a scrappy author (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345322533">The Aviator</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671636030">FATE IS THE HUNTER</a>) whose book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553288571">ISLAND IN THE SKY (Bantam Air and Space)</a> this film was based upon. Gann and Wellman were cut from the same cloth these two, and one can imagine these adventurers' arguments while hammering out the screenplay on a Corona Typewriter. Wellman recites dogged dialogue straight from the novel, itself based on a true story. He also injects multiple flashback sequences as ridiculous as that disco scene from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001K37CT8">Airplane!</a>. This opus is corny even by 1953 standards.

Now for the good. Wellman and Wayne recruited one of the great supporting casts to portray the fearless flyboys risking their lives to find the missing crew. James Arness, Lloyd Nolan, Paul Fix, Harry Carey, Jr., Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer and the wonderful Andy Devine are equal parts hilarious and eccentric as they brave storms in their desperate quest. Devine, usually providing dramatic relief in a John Ford western, steals the film as the cool, no-nonsense pilot who treats the treacherous rescue as another day at the office. His character's quirks are so unique they must be based on fact, though I could have done without the shot of him in swim trunks. I appreciated the impressive on-location filming at Donner Lake, of all places. There's also a brilliant scene when the pilots gather around a map after a long, unsuccessful day. A prolonged silence reveals the harsh reality of their predicament. If they choose the wrong search area, their friends are going to die.

Wayne, Wellman and Gann would team again a year later with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J13RCI">The High and the Mighty</a>, another airline drama involving a pilot's attempt to muscle a crippled plane across the Pacific. A precursor to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN05A">Airport Terminal Pack (Airport/Airport '75/Airport '77/Airport '79 - The Concord)</a> disaster films of the 1970s, it suffers from similar issues of endless narration, goofy flashbacks and mile-high corn. While fascinating time capsules, these Wellman/Wayne films are too turgid to be considered classics. Where "Island in the Sky" succeeds is its gritty portrayal of World War II-era pilots. One suspects Wellman, lounging in his director's chair, was adorned in a scarf and leather flyboy helmet while barking orders at the Duke. What an era it must have been.
