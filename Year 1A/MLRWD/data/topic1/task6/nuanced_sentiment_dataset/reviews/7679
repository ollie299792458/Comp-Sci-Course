These are the absolutely worst Christie dramatization ever.

1.  Miss Marple has been injected into two stories where she is not in the original written stories.
2.  Strange sex practices are presented where a man and a woman fully clothed and standing bump their hips-bottoms together with great vigor and have bored expressions on their faces.
3.  The characters are dull as dishwater.  Not a single even slightly colorful or eccentric character among the British lot. They are dressed and made up to look bland.
4.  Some of the upper crust Brits have culturally lower class confrontive behavior and unnecessary foul language.
5.  The plots are simplified so as to not stress the intelligence of a twelve year old or an adult body with a twelve year old mind. The clues are presented with blatant emphasis.
6.  As stated by the comment on this review, Miss Marple is played more like Nancy Drew who was a schoolgirl amateur detective in a series of children's stories.

I threw all four DVDs into the trash after trying to watch each one twice.
