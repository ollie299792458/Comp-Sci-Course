In order to appreciate this movie, you must understand that it is not a romantic comedy, no matter how it is advertised.  Yes, there is romance and there is comedy, but that is REALLY not the focus of the film. In fact, viewers may be fooled when male characters are introduced--they're not all potential love interests, like you'd expect in other movies. Life is not that simple!  
It is really the story of a woman who proves to herself that she can make it on her own, without a man, anywhere and anytime.  On a trip to Italy, trying to take her mind off her recent divorce, she spontaneously buys an Italian villa...one which needs a lot of work and repairs...and settles herself in this country.  She slowly makes it her home, while making friends in a foreign land and learning a new culture.
I really enjoyed this movie for the scenes of Italy and its faithful presentation of Italian culture (not just the stereotypical view of Italians you get in American T.V. shows and movies).  Besides the Italian people, there are Italian cuisine, beautiful villas, tours of the countryside, and people of other nationalities.  I don't know how anyone can watch this film without seriously considering hopping on a plane and moving to Italy permanently.
