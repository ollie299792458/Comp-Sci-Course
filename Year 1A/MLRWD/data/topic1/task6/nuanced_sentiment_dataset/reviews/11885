I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.

I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a "Heather" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....

I LOVE Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.

The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as "Mr. Rochester", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, "Edward."  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.

If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.
