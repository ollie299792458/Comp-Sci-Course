alright so i saw this movie simply because i like Brendan Fehr and Kerr Smith as actors, but this movie...alright to put it bluntly it [was bad]...it was probably one of the most horrible things i've ever seen. i went ahead and gave it one star because the acting was good despite the movies complete lack of plot. there were random scenes were the actors would be doing something simple and there would suddenly be heavy guitar music, all that did was really confuse everyone who was watching the film with me. about half way through it i decided that i would just consider one of those movies like BATS or Eight Legged Freaks, devoid of any real plot but it made you laugh anyways at how ridiculous it was and unbelieveable. 
so if you really must see this movie, go into it thinking that its going to be dumb and perhaps youll enjoy it. you'll laugh, i do guarantee that, but thats about it. If you're into vampire movies see something else like Interview with a Vampire, Dracula 2000, or the Lost Boys, just try and avoid this movie at all costs
