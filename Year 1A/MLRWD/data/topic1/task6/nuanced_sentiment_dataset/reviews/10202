This was one I wasn't too interested in watching. My younger brother rented it off of netflix, but I chose to watch another movie instead of joining him and watching it.

Then, several of the little kids in my church got copies, and ADORED it, so, I thought to myself. Why not just pick up a copy and see what all of the buzz is about?

It was a very enjoyable film, and one I'm going to be buying once I finish saving for my computer. The animation was nice, but this is coming from somebody who didn't bother with the movie "ANTZ". The perspective is nothing new.

It was a nice tale, decent-quailty animation and a cute story. Some gross-out humor (ANOTHER 'false teeth' joke? How many do we need?!) and minor language, but nothing too bad that I caught. (And I'm one of those people who looks at a movie twice, once watching it for my own enjoyment, and another watching it from a little kids point of view to see if it's okay to show babysitting.)

Good for a watch, and I'm going to add this one to my video collection!
