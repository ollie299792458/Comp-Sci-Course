Now that films about Soviet injustices following the second world war are finally starting to trickle into the public consciousness following decades of films solely concentrating on the Axis powers, it is fulfilling that such a film was finally created in English for all those who shy away from subtitled efforts. Put simply, this well-executed film based on the memoir by Red Army imprisoned Slavomir Rawicz is very much reminiscent of "As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me" (see my review), but follows a group of Soviet labor camp escapees rather than a single individual, and so much of the plot involves relationships within the band rather than the individual psychological hardships depicted in the earlier film. Some of the melodrama that surfaces in the earlier film is also absent here, although I was not particularly fond of the roles played by actors such as Colin Farrell and Ed Harris, who presumably were cast to appeal to a broader viewer audience, although if doing so prompts more interest in this story it was probably worth the sacrifice. As I mentioned in my other review, the scenes of Soviet labor camp survivors traveling through the Siberian wilderness caused me to ponder the plight of the Donauschwabens in my own immediate family (descendants of Germans who had immigrated to an area that was later Yugoslavia, far removed from the political climate of the time who shared similar fates following the war due to their ethnicity), and the last segment of this film, involving some of the best closing scenes of all time, will be especially emotional to anyone who shares such a similar family history, and is one of the many reasons I will proselytize "The Way Back".
