As the credits rolled down the screen, I told myself that I just saw a movie that threw a bucket of reality in my face. You Can Count On Me offers very little of what could be considered life affirming or great about the human spirit. 
Just because some scenes were accompanied by classical music doesn't make it a great movie. Granted, not all good movies need to have the uplift effect but this one brought me down. Maybe that is where it intends to leave you.
The Sammy character (Laura Linney)and her younger brother played by Mark Ruffalo have their share of self-inflicted problems. This dutiful daughter casts judgement on everyone she encounters including the boyfriend that asks her to marry her. "You have to grow up," she tells him after telling him she won't accept his proposal. 
Meanwhile, she never takes the symbolic step in the movie of growing up herself. Throwing her brother out of the house didn't really count. He is a guy with his hair constantly on fire and probably would have left anyway. 
The brother is a rebellious spirit who rejects the small town conventionality of his sister. Living the wild, eternal youth existence of the wandering stranger somewhere else appeals to him more than being the troubled townie from Scottsville. 
Either way he is a pathetic spirit with inner turmoil. Mark Ruffalo does an exceptional job playing the guy that likes to get things all shook up as, in the scene, he brings the young Rudy to see his uncaring father Rudy Sr. on the seedy end of town. The way the movie was shot was very good but the plot didn't do much to tie up lose ends. Don't let the classical music fool you, this is a film with too few redeeming qualities.
