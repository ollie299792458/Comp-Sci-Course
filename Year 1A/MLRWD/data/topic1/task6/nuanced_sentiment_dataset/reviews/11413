Good grief, what an awful movie.  After seeing the mess that was Transformers, I went into this movie merely hoping Shia wouldn't let me down again.  Honestly, that was the only expectation I wanted fulfilled.  Not that I think this kid's a bad actor or anything, but his character, Kale, is exactly like Spike from Transformers: a rude, disgusting, horny prick who frankly deserved to be knifed by the end of this flick.

I find it amazing that we're supposed to believe Kale's been constantly suffering after a tragedy early on in the movie, but by the very end, it's like nothing's happened to him at all!  This movie is filled will holes and scenes that ultimately add nothing to the plot.  My biggest gripe: Haven't ANY of these characters heard of 9-1-1?  Everyone has a cell phone that practically lives on them like a symbiotic parasite, but suddenly nobody can call the police.  Gimmee a break.  And I have a hard time believing the tech-savvy Kale in the film wouldn't have had the entire incriminating video of the killer on YouTube by the time the badguy made it to his front door.  I try to check believability at the door, but Disturbia pushed and pushed until it broke at the scene where the girl very obviously follows the killer and we're actually supposed to believe he doesn't see her snapping photos of him at the hardware store.  (As if a killer like that wouldn't already own a shovel.  Why would he need to buy one right after the murder?  Ridiculous.)

Unless you reeeaaally like Shia, skip this turkey and go with Rear Window instead.
