Another oldie I adore. What a great concept, to do a wedding movie from the father's perspective.  Spencer is the head of the household, or so he thinks, who gets steamrolled into giving his most beloved daughter, Kaye (Elizabeth Taylor) a wedding bigger than anything he could have ever even dreamed (or nightmared) of!
Spencer narrates the story, starting from a scene of frightening carnage, at his home after his daughter's wedding reception. From his daughter's annoyingly coy announcement of her impending marriage to Buckley Dunston, yup, that's right, Buckley, to the wedding rehersal, Spencer hardly knows which end is up. 
This movie, although in black and white and made ages ago, still rings true.  While buckets upon buckets of movies show the mother daughter relationship, this movie shows the ties that bind a father and  daughter, and the difficulty and emotion that ensues when that relationship changes forever.
This movie is funny, touching and very sweet. So if you're an old, crusty cynic, this is not your cup of tea!
