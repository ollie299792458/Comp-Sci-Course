A review of the Ultimate Versus

I had originally purchased the 3 disc "Special Edition +" version due to some confusion here on Amazon but had since returned it in favor of the "Ultimate Versus" version.

The problem is that Amazon states in the product description that the Ultimate Versus running time is 119 minutes when it is in fact 157 minutes.  Check the photos next to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBXP5W">Ultimate Versus</a>

Put simply, though both versions contain 3 discs, the Ultimate Versus is 157 Minutes, whereas Versus Special Edition + is only 119 Minutes.  That's a 28 minute difference, basically a half hour!

Hopefully this clears up some confusion for those looking for the "longer" version.

So how was the movie....???

I'll keep it short - Its 3 main characters in supernatural tale of zombies (or resurrected souls?) + martial arts meeting in a battle for good and evil in a forest of "resurrection". The acting, and action, is a little over the top, but not in a matrix type of way. Hint - zombies use weapons and martial arts.

This is definitely a B-rated martial arts movie, though the story line is actually quite good. And oddly enough, you find that you can't stop watching... and may watch again!

To me, this is one of those movies that you'll either love or hate, thus my advice would be to rent it if you can find a copy, then decide if you want to spend the 35+ dollars for the Ultimate version.

4 stars for story
3 stars for acting/action
