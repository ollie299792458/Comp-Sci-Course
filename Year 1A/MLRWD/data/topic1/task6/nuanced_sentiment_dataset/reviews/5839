20 years from now, you might get to see this on TV Land. Obviously, this show is worth buying into. You get all 23 episodes from season one. You get an up and comer-like Ugly Betty trying to become big in this cut-throat world of modeling, fashion, and making it on the front-cover of MODE magazine. Think of this show as a mixture of Ally McBeal, The Devil wears Prada, & Just Shoot Me-all in one. This show is all about Ugly Betty, and one of the show's 2 main stars, America Ferrera. Ferrera plays the strong-willed girl show a lot of bravery from the inside out. Betty Suarez is a very-brainy woman who shows off her ideas and tries to get coffee for everybody at work-now that's using her head.

This Show also Co-Stars Vanessa Williams (The Singer & Former Miss America) as Wilhelmina Slater, Betty's Arch-Nemesis. As you can see, Wilhelmina happens to be a back-stabber, and a schemer. The incredibly-tanned sister tries to do everything to become a high-level executive by hook or crook, and she tries to do everything she can-Even Marrying Brad Meade, The Chairman of MODE publishing. Brad's son Daniel happens to be Betty's Boss at her job. Wilhelmina also have her own assistant, Marc St. James-her so-called "Personal" seeing eye-gay.

Betty also have issues at home, too. She lives with her dad, Her big sister, Hilda and her gay son also lives there as well. I gotta hand it to you, People are buying their favorite shows so they can watch every single episode, without the distraction of commercials. I believe ABC has done something imaginable-by putting this and other great shows (LOST, Desperate Housewives, & Gray's Anatomy) out on DVD. I hope this show will win big at the Emmys in September.
