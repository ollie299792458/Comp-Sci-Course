Zombie culture aficionados rejoice! Your movie has arrived.

If you are a reader of zombie books, a lover of zombie movies, a player of zombie video-games (esp. that last one), you are in for a treat. Off the top of your head, how many rules can you think of for interacting with zombies? If you can think of more than 5, "Zombieland" is for you.

Unlike your uninitiated friends, you do not panic when confronted with zombies. You are well aware of their limitations. You understand that the situation calls for a cool assessment of priorities and resources, and suitable action. You've got to unlock a door while being chased by zombies. But they're closing the distance too fast. Do you turn around, scream horribly, and wait to be devoured?

NO! This is not some goofy B-movie!

You take a lap! Zombies are not bright! They don't know to just wait by the door until you come back and then eat you. They will follow you! All you have to do is put some distance between you and them, run back to the door with more time, and calmly let yourself in.

If this all makes sense to you, buy "Zombieland." If you fantasize about finding a massive cache of large caliber weapons and ammunition during a post-apocalyptic scenario, buy "Zombieland." If you plot what you would salvage from grocery stores after a zombie attack, buy "Zombieland." In fact, just buy "Zombieland." You'll thank me for it.
