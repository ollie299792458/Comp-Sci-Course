"Are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?" To some of us, we quietly get together in closed-door sessions and hushed tones and truly believe that this is the greatest western of all time.  It certainly is Clint Eastwood's favorite movie.  It has stood the test of time and true Western fanatics quote lines from this movie.  "Not a hard man to track. Leaves dead men wherever he goes."  Eastwood runs the full gamut of his emotions and turns in a great job of acting including spittin' chaw on everything that moves.  Rottentomatoes.com has a perfect 100% score on the critics "Tomatometer" with Roger Ebert stating, " Eastwood is such a taciturn and action-oriented performer that it's easy to overlook the fact that he directs many of his movies -- and many of the best, most intelligent ones. Here, with the moody, gloomily beautiful photography of Bruce Surtees, he creates a magnificent Western feeling."  It was also one of the few Western movies to receive critical and commercial success in the 70's at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.  Orson Welles while on Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson proclaimed Josey Wales the best Western ever made and admitted to seeing it over 4 times!!!  Jerry Fielding was nominated for an Oscar in the best motion picture score category.  In 1996, this film was placed in the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.  "Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy."
