I first read the book several years ago and loved it. When the movie came out, I wondered if the film maker would adequately appreciate and take the time to reflect the author's wonderful melding of passion for food,  love and longing. The movie almost "got it", so I felt it met the requirements of a true "foodie movie." I know that some of the descriptions in the book would be a challenge to interpret, especially on a limited budget (as was the case for this film). So, I was going to buy it for my "true foodie movies" collection. (e.g. Big Night, Babette's Feast, Chocolat, Eat Drink Man Woman.)

Now, in reading these reviews, I realize that this version cuts food scenes... YUK! The sensuality of touch, desire and sexual consumption intertwined with that of lovingly prepared and consumed food is the whole point of the movie! The title says it all -- trying to sublimate one via the other is like substituting water for chocolate. Those pesky food scenes ARE NOT fluff. They are half of the film's equation. I am SO thankful that I read these reviews, since I won't buy a version until I know it is an uncut version.

To Amazon: Somehow, the buyer should know that they are not purchasing an orginal version.
