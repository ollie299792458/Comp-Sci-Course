Every time I watch this movie, it really amazes me how much it looks like it was filmed in 1984. Such is the attention to detail, the costumes, the props, the fantastic music, the acting, everything. And it's a gay movie to boot! Filmed in the most professional manner possible, don't expect cheap camera work, screenwriting or acting. Everything here is top-notch. Also, you don't have busy star performances, you probably won't have ever seen or heard about most actors in this movie, and that may be a good thing, nothing will distract you while watching it.
That doesn't mean bad acting, guys: everyone here from the stars to the extras are incredibly professional and it's pure joy to be able to say that.
I can't help but think that all these are things that you usually take for granted, but they are usually not all things you can say about the same movie! Think about it! :)
The movie doesn't shy away from touchy subjects and could-be uncomfortable moments either but they are dealt in such great manner that they are not uncomfortable to watch, and make you think about what is going on.
Like a previous reviewer said, this could have been a John Hughes movie (you know, the guy who did those wonderful cult high school movies in the 80s) filme right in the mid eighties.
All the rest has already been stated, to perfection, by the most-helpful reviews.
If you think you are interested in some of the aspects of this movie by reading the reviews or the plot, buy it, you will NOT regret it.

I only wish they would issue this in a deluxe edition with a soundtrack album included, because that has been out of print for years and it's an awesome soundtrack!
