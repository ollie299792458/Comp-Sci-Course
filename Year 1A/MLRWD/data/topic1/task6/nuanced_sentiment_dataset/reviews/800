This was an interesting movie to watch because of Jet Li's amazing martial-arts skills. He truly is gifted. Unfortunately, Jet Li alone can't keep this from being unbelievable and silly. I was hoping it was going to be more along the lines of LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL, two very good movies, but I was wrong. They both had better scripts and plots that were well-developed. This movie seemed to be ad-libbed as the camera rolled. It was just too hard for me to suspend disbelief willingly. For example, at the end of the movie, after Jet Li fights a small army of goons half-destroying an aprtment building in the process while beating most of them up, a handfull of gun toting bad guys shoot hundreds of bullets through windows and doors and then vanish. Danny (Jet Li) confronts his master Bart (Bob Hoskins) and pummels him before Sam (Morgan Freeman) smashes a flower pot over Bart's head to knock him cold, preventing Danny from killing him and thereby saving Danny from reverting back to his previous trained attack-dog nature. What happened to the other members of the gang? Where were the police during the battle? Why, in the next scene, do we see Danny and Sam in tuxes at Sam's step-daughter's piano recital? Was the connecting scene left on the cutting room floor? I guess you'd have to really like martial-arts action to enjoy it. The movie just didn't work for me. 1 and one half stars.
