For the life of me, I cannot understand why this movie didn't receive more recognition.  The book was fascinating, the story was translated to the screen beautifully, the characters were amazing, the soundtrack was awesome, and the cast...well...what superlatives does one use to describe an ensemble including Sir Lawrence Olivier, Anthony Quinn (for once rising above his usual Zorba the Greek-like character portrayals), David Jansen and Oskar Werner?

Even if none of the above virtues appeal (and I cannot imagine that they wouldn't), Shoes of the Fisherman is an enthralling peek into the workings of the Vatican and the election of a new Pope.  This would have been the perfect movie to show during the election of John Paul II (who was, indeed, the first non-Italian Pope in over 400 years...as was the character elected Pope in the movie), and after his death when the recent Pope was elected.  Step-by-step, the viewer is taken through the election process, which is made all the more poignant by the characters and the intertwining of their lives.

One doesn't have to be a Catholic to enjoy Shoes of the Fisherman.  I am not, and find myself watching it at again and again.  It is a well-crafted film, splendidly acted, beautifully scored and WELL worth a look-see.
