This movie should have been prefaced with the words "Warning the following movie is a work of fiction. Any similiarity between the characters here in & any person, place or organization living or dead is purely coincidental."

While the basic story is there, there have been a lot of really big liberties taken with Darwins character, that are not backed up by even Darwins own writings about his life at that time. Whats more Origin of Species was not the main book Darwin was writing at the time, he was in fact writing many scientific works, which eventually lead into what we now consider his seminal works: Origin of Species.

The actors who were chosen were all good choices, but in general its not what i would call a great movie, even if i was not aware of the true history of Darwin. This has a very backhanded christian overtone, constantly beating into the viewer that Darwin was constantly miserable & possibly insane. The truth of Darwins story is a lot more interesting then the fiction we have been presented with in this movie.
