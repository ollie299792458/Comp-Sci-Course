In reference to the "Basic Moves" portion...

This is a half hour dance *instruction* video.  Some moves may tire out your shoulders and hips, but it isn't much of a "workout," and definitely not cardio or strenuous.

~10min of head/neck & shoulder/arm movements .

~10min of rib/hip movements.  ~5min of basic steps.

~5min of floor moves (Cleopatra/outer thigh lift, cat, leg stretch)

They introduce individual isolated moves, and repeat them several times for users to practice; most moves were easy to pick up (but will take time & practice to make it look graceful).  I don't know if it's the instructors or if it's because they are demonstrated isolated motions, but they look a bit robotic/jerky.  This seems is an  Intro to belly dance for total beginners.

I think people with previous belly dance experience will find this basic video too slow/boring and stiff.

I would much rather RECOMMEND "BELLYDANCE BASICS AND BEYOND: Technique for a Solid Foundation" BY JENNA, which is a 2.5hr DVD with much better technique and practice options; it provides a teaching portion of all the major belly dance moves, as well as a drill/practice section.
