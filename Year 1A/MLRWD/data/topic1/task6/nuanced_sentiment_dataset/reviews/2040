It'd be deceitful to really claim this film was a book adaptation.  I mean yes it has the same title and yes Abraham Lincoln does indeed kill vampires, but that's not really what the book was about.

The key feature of the novel, what caused it to receive so much acclaim, was not the vampires but that it was so well grounded in the historical data we already know about Lincoln.  So well done in fact that, if one were to entertain the existence of vampires, it could have easily been a feasible account of what happened.  Like a conspiracy that was hidden from us all these years

To the films credit it tries to retain the overall serious tone of the book, but is filled with so many awkward historical inaccuracies the audience can't help but laugh.  The cinematography is well shot and pleasing to the eye, but not enough to distract you from the abysmal plot and horrible acting.  It's a fine example of Hollywood's tendency to be melodramatic and over the top, but even if you're looking for a "so bad it's funny" film I suggest you look elsewhere

I hope in 20 years or so some producer is brave enough to do a remake, I'd honestly like to see this film done right.
