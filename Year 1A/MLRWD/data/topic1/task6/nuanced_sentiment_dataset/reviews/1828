This was probably my favorite show from the 70's and I have worn out the dvds I have of the first season of SWAT. I have been waiting and waiting for the second season to come out and I am still waiting but in the meantime these downloads are the next best thing.  I first found out you could watch the second season of SWAT over at AOL video for free and so that is where I was watching them. Then someone asked me about the ones over here at amazon and I was so happy to find them since these episodes are far better than the ones I was watching and they don't have any commericals. I had no problem at all paying 1.99 per episode because the quality of this player is amazing and so easy to use. Over at AOL you never knew if the player was going to work or not and most times it didn't. I have never had any problems with the episodes I have downloaded from amazon.  Like the other reviewer said the main thing is how much space they take up on a hard drive.

One other problem is that some people can't get them to work. After I found out about the episodes being here I told everyone I knew to come get them and only one other person has been able to get them to work for them. I don't know if they don't have new enough systems or what but they certainly have been disappointed.

As I said I have watched the first season over and over and as much as I love the first season I have noticed that the quality of the program really improved in the second season and they branched out more and tried a lot of different things in the second season. It really is a shame that my friends aren't able to watch these episodes and enjoy them as much as I have been.

I hope that eventually the second season will be available on dvd but until then I will continue to enjoy the downloads.
