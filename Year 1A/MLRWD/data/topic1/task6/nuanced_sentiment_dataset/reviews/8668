I rented this one (good thing too!), and it really is the most preposterous plot.  Bad movie!  Really bad acting too!  It appears that they just threw this one together and went through the motions to try to milk a few more bucks out of the franchise.  Even the costumes barely fit any of the actors (Note even Sean Bean could barely lace up his tunic; too much curry?), and the gear of the native 'Lancers' looked like the tag end of a Halloween clearance sale (Lancers are ordinarily equipped with lances for one, though not a lance was to be seen, and the commander of the Lancers was carrying a ridiculous infantry small court sword, rather than some sort of tulwar or saber).  The villain of the piece is a renegade British officer serving as the general of a rebellious Indian princeling.  His identity is supposedly unknown, and part of the 'mission' of Sharpe is to find out who he is (although he has been in command there for some 15 years, raising hell in the local area) and rescue his old comrade Patrick, who had been sent previously on the same mission. Good idea!  Send an Irishman to India to work undercover!  Who would know?  And despite months of exposure to the Indian sun, neither Patrick, nor Sharpe have so much as a light glow, let alone a tan or sunburn!  Pasty people in Peshawar?  Oh please!  Caricature characters, poor acting, poor costumes, silly plot, and altogether a pointless letdown for fans of the other Sharpe adventures.
