... What Mr. Cage was thinking when he signed on for this. Oh yeah, I'm going broke and gotta make some money. It baffles me that an actor of his caliber who does two or three film a year can't manage his funds. This movie is a weird one. Herzog was goin for a Fear and Loathing vibe but I wasn't feeling it. Cage's character is a PD Lieutenant who is addicted to drugs. He steals, gambles, and hustles people like he's a Tijuana cop. In reality no one that messed up would be a police detective. The movie has a very thin plot. It involves  murders, witnesses, a hooker girlfriend, drug dealers, mobsters, bookies ect. There's appearences by Val Kilmer, Eva Mendez, Xzibit, and a couple other familiar actors. This is just another of the many mediocre post Katrina New Orleans films. The only good one I can think of is "Deja Vu" with Denzel and Val Kilmer. (who also did the one with 50 cent). He must live in New Orleans. I reccomend this as a rental. That's if you can tolerate watching constant drug use. If you're a fan of Nick Cage and drugs then knock yourself out.  Oh yeah, Cage looks ridiculous walking around with his pistol stuck in the front of his pants the entire movie.
