I love Seann William Scott.  I think he has great comedic timing.  But even with him sugar-coating it, he can make this show's message tolerable.

Mr. Woodcock is a gym teacher that verbally abuses, and sometimes physically abuses his kids.  But hey, that's ok when we find out that his father was even worse that he was.  Oh yeah, let's not forget that Woodcock make Seann's mom sooo happy... so he Seann must help them stay together.

Let me give you a dose of reality: How someone treats the world is eventually how they will treat you.  Maybe not in the first year, maybe not even in the second year, but eventually you will find yourself on the receiving end of the personality.

To many women already go into a relationship with blinders on, we don't need a comedy saying it's okay to marry a jerk as long as there are reasons from his past that are sad and he treats you good.

Also, the fact that this show paints this students as grateful for the push they needed.... I was verbally abuse to the point of tears by a teacher and although I got past it, it certianly didn't help me in any way!
