Bad Boys is yet another action comedy that follows 48 HOURS &amp; the BEVERLY HILLS COP mode. The viloence is a non-stop fury from start to finnish and the profanity that anyone comes to expect films of this nature. This film benefits greatly from Will Smith and Martin Laurence`s chemsitry, as long as they`re on screen together things move along but when they`re apart the film ends losing crediabillty. The film is two hours or so long has more complications it needs.The storyline surounds the theft of millons of dollars worth of drugs confiscated from a Miami Police warehouse by an evil french crimminal named Fouchet,  sounds more like a name for expensive french chocalate than a French crimminal, played awful by Tchelky Karyo. BAD BOYS doesn`t stay focused halfway it comes up with what somebody must have thought was a brilliant move and proceeds to beat it to death for reasons not worth mentioning are forced to switch identies. So the ladies man Mike(Smith) moves in with his partner`s family while Marcus(Laurence)spends day &amp; night at Mike`s place guarding a material witness an attractive annyoning woman(Tea Leoni) From this point its a mix-match of endless guns blazing foul language and the same style of film i`ve seen endless times before.
