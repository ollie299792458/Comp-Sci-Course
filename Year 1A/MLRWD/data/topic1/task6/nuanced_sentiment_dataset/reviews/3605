I have to say that this is one of the greatest films I have seen. It speaks to us!  It's about love, passion, honor, courage, dignity, failure, old age and plain old heart wrenching hard work!  The story of Rocky is universal and we have seen it many times in other films but Sylvester Stallone works an incredible magic into this movie.  Incidently he was in a very similar situation as Rocky when he made this movie. 
Rocky is basically a man who let the years go by and found himself a clubfighter and muscle to a loanshark at about age 30. He is basically a bum and a failure in life.  No one treats him with respect because I suspect people could sense the greatness that could have been.  Even Mickey the trainer sais this.  The woman he loves is incredibly shy and he is going nowhere fast. The heavy weight champion of the world, Apollo Creed picks his name by chance out of a book and Rocky is picked to fight him.  
I love ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and Rocky is suddenly given an incredible chance to prove himself one last time.  He knows that he can not beat Apollo but if he can only survive the fight he will know that he was not just another bum.  It is really a battle of the human spirit.  A battle against ourselves.  The fight is incredible.  The mucial score by Bill Conti is breath taking.  Rocky is beaten (badly) and in the final two rounds he falls down but (ignoring his trainers pleas to stay down) he agonizingly gets to his feet.  This is a moment in the film that will make your heart stir.  I always tear up at this sceen.  You see, Rocky had been down his whole life.  This was his last chance to prove to himself that he wasn't a bum.  When they are announcing that Apollo Creed is the winner it is insignificant because Rocky won the greater battle.  The battle of the human spirit.  The last scene of the couple hugging is a beatiful scene of friendship and love.  As you can see I love Rocky.
