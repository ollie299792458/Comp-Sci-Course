This movie takes you through a interesting situation of a life of a man. I found the "superpower" of Daredevil - his unique heightened ability to sense things as one of the most interesting superpowers. His way of fighting is most entertaining as he cannot see. His way of "seeing" also is cool - he sees almost the full form of a person through through the presence of surrounding rain, as he can sense some sort of image when the drop hits.

Ben Affleck played his part well - very natural and believable. Thus I command the actors and how creators came up with the idea of Daredevil's disability (or superpower).

I give it three stars because I thought the plot of the movie itself was not great. The way the radioactive just spills in his eyes, was not very exciting. If he had fallen into a vat of radioactive substance and had to climb out would or something along those lines would be better.

Also, while his ability is cool and unique, I find his weakness a turnoff as a superhero. Superheros have a human side, yes, but I feel like his inability to withstand noise is a little much. He could be too easily defeated.

Not up to par or at the same level with Marvel's other movies, but nonetheless, decent.
I actually enjoyed watching Elektra more, so I recommend that one after watching Daredevil.
