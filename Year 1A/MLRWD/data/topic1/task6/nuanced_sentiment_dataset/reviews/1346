These last few nights I've been watching the DVD of 'Unfaithful' (directed by Adrian Lyne, a British Francophile who lives in Provence, and this is a remake of a classic 60s Chabrol film 'La Femme Infidele' which I'd now like to see.  I think Lyne likes women a lot, too, just like the French do.)  It is very interesting, for its theme (infidelity in a happy marriage), story structure (the first half is the wife's story, and the second half the husband's--and this shift doesn't work for me), as a movie (crisp photography and editing, though I think the second half is flatter, maybe because Lyne isn't as interested in that part of the story, or maybe because for me the crystalline focus of the first half is dissipated), and most of all for a luminous performance by Diane Lane that must be seen--she IS what makes the first part of the film work as a story.  (Oh, and there's also a gorgeous young French guy.)  The director's commentary is engaging, and helped me appreciate the film more deeply.  Now I want to write to Lyne and tell him how he should have handled the second half of his film.  I'll just say here that I preferred the alternative ending on the DVD.
