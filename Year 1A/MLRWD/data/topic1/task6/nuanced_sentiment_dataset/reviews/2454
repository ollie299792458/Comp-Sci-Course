The setting was gorgeous.  But, unfortunately the movie became  a "star" vehicle, with two veteran actors  (Freeman, Redford), one actor on the rise (Lucas), and one actor who can't be ignored even though you would like to (Lopez).

Robert Redford is capable, but doesn't get to expose as much edge as a character with his flaws calls for.  Morgan Freeman also seems somewhat shortchanged with a character who does little except talk in sweeping generalizations, a zenmaster cowboy, if you wish. Josh Lucas does his best driving around in a jeep. And Jennifer Lopez is completely miscast and thoroughly unbelievable in the role of the daughter-in-law. From her perfectly shaded hair, to her little outfits on the Wyoming Range in what is the cool weather of autumn, Lopez is out of place. Her part should have gone to Camryn Manheim, who handles her part as the waitress/ owner of a caf&eacute; with the right amount of nuance and strength. But again, we feel shortchanged. Manheim's character is there only as window dressing.

The movie felt rushed, shortchanging the actors to develop their characters as much as they should.  They easily could have cut out at least three characters and the story would've focused on the leads, with a lot more intensity.
