Anna May Wong was born in the wrong times. In fifty years she would have been seen in a movie or two, maybe even TV. But her age was one of the "Yellow peril", with lurid novels depicting acts of barbarism and depravity by asiatic peoples. And who's to say they weren't right? Anna was relegated to roles of treachery and deceit, and she played them well. In "Piccadilly" she steals the show from the major stars,  cast as a poor scullery maid that is given the opportunity to advance in life. As an exotic Chinese dancer,  she grabs her role  with gusto. The obstacle to her success is the club owner's girlfriend, a manipulative fading star dancer the movie trys to make the heroine. Yeech! Shosho (Anna) is blatantly stereotyped and relegated to a villianess who seduces the owner of the club. Nobody is too moral in this movie and Anna emerges as the most sympathetic charactor. At least she has the motive of moving up in life. Her expected murder only illustrates the degenerate culture of the late 1920's, and the prejudices of another age. This silent film is almost modern, and has a good soundtrack that doesn't interrupt the show.
