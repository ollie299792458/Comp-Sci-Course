This was one of those "turn out the lights so no one can see how NOT scary the action really is" types of movies.  Fortunately, it's not as bad as one of those "shake the camera a lot during every scene so no one can see how NOT scary the action really is" types of movies.  Oh wait, this movie had both darkness AND shakey cam effects, but it was so damn dark the entire time that you can't tell it's shaking too!  Yes, 95% of this movie was shot in the dark with glimpses of moonlight or car lights or flashlights or cellphone lights thrown in just so you know that the movie is still playing and that you didn't buy a defective DVD.  This movie is equivalent to having a friend walk downstairs in your basement, turn off the lights, then flicker a flashlight on-and-off while running around naked.  You then are upstairs and get down on the floor and scream under the door at your friend in the basement.  There, I just saved you the price of this DVD.  Honestly, the creatures in this movie looked good and some of the scenes had some good effects, but the story suffered with a few hiccups along the way and the last half hour was a dud.  Sorry, can't recommend this.  Try "I Saw The Devil" if you want to see some recent great scary filmmaking.
