OK, so Moonraker isn't one of the better 007 outings, but it certainly has some good points.  This was the first Bond adventure I saw in the theaters, and, for that reason alone, it has a lot of sentimental value for me.  From the beginning, it seems like we know where this one is going, and it certainly walks that way, by way of an overabundance of comedic gags and one-liners, and an overly simple plot.  The makers obviously took advantage of the popularity of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, as well as trying to top the sci-fi flicks of the 70's, but it captures some of the hugeness and vastness of a super-spy doin' good in outer space. It also is an example of how a Bond film captures the danger and sense of doom and villany.  The chases are classics, despite the one-liners, but the flow of the film is well-paced.  The space battle is not the quickest but it makes up for it in the brilliant special effects.  Roger Moore is not in his best-his humor having got in the way.  But he is dynamic when it comes to the ladies. Check out some of his more successful acting scenes, some which you wont see until his next, more ground-based 007 film, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  In fact, this movie is an important preview to some of the next two, dynamite epic 007's. John Barry practically saves the film and gives it the sense of danger and excitement not seen since the Connery days.  Roger Moore stays on for the next, more tightly delivered two Bonds, leaving this one in the dust.  The best part: The return of Jaws!
