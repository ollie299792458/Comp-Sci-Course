I downloaded this as part of a promotion to check out Amazon Unbox, and I have to say that I'm not impressed.  The film itself is great; it's a classic that I've loved since I was little.  My issue is with the video transfer.  When you have a file size of 2.2 gigs, there's absolutely no reason that the image should be so blocky and pixelated, nor that the sound should be wavering so much.  There are so many compression techniques available that actually create smaller files of higher quality -- .avi and .mkv for example -- that the use of such a substandard compression technique is inexplicable to me.  If this video is representative of the quality available through Amazon Unbox, I won't be downloading any others.  It's a shame; I really didn't want to have to drink  the iTunes kool-aid but this just can't compete.

NOTE: I am reviewing the UnBox download, not the DVD.  I don't understand why Amazon combines reviews for radically different products.  If you're grouchy that I'm not talking about the product you're actually looking at, gripe at Amazon about it, not me.
