OK, another movie about how powerful love is and what it can overcome, and a movie so disjointed, a reasonable viewer can't figure out what is really going on. What to do?

Well, if the movie grabs you in any way, watch it again, and if it grabs you some more, watch it once more.

For me, it was the opening 20 minutes or so, which grabbed me. Such a bizarre couple, but with a special chemistry that made me want to learn as much about them as I could. Plus, the photography, bits of music, etc., were also inviting in those minutes.  So, I was willing to see the film through, even though at times it tried to lose me.

After seeing it the first time, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars or so. However, I still had a desire to see it again, now that I could revisit scenes with a better understanding and from different viewpoints.

So, the second viewing really did hook me, now that the plot was clearer. Two people, so different and so flawed, yet finding that special bond, with the unconscious figuring out things that somehow eluded the conscious. I personally can relate to that, remembering I had a dream once, where, in the dream I actually recognized that I was in a dream, so that my unconscious was indeed plugged directly into my conscious.

I have always questioned how in a two minute conversation, talk show pseudo-therapists can tell a caller to drop a deeply flawed mate. Aren't even the deeply flawed, allowed to experience love? Of course they are, and this film really does capture that.

Someone commented in their review that there were no words worthy to remember from the film, however, I will never see the word, "nice," in quite the same way again.

Without the performances from Carrey and Winslet and the chemistry they generated, this film likely would not have succeeded in capturing the power of love in quite the way it did. I give it five stars.
