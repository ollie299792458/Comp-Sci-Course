Ok, so in was back in (?)....40 years have passed since I first saw this little opus, back then I WAS IN the Union Army, of course the next week I was Confederate, always camped near the "company hearth"...(tv set to you newbes).  I even had a navy colt side arm and blanket bed roll, with the standard issue peanut butter n' crackers...hardcore huh?  Anyway I first saw "Horse Soldiers" broadcast on "Saturday Night at the Movies", or was it at the drive-in?  Duh...at that time I thought it was fantastic, outstanding, and keen!  I especially liked the "southern trash" portrayal by Denver Pile and Strother Martin as comic relief.  Now what do I think?  Well I still think this is an interesting movie and I still like the little comic bit with Pyle and Martin.  But this was not one of the "Dukes" best films by far.  Bill Holden, as a "progressive" doctor who fights n competes "Duke" for the had of a "forgotten starlet" beauty as-love-interest is wasted.  Lots o' rough n' ready action.  But for the most part the whole effort is predictable and a little boring.  The true story was amazing and worthy to be told...ah but then there would be no bloodly battle scenes!  So it's an ok movie to fall asleep to...heah compared to "The Ring" or "Kill Bill"...I'd have to give it 20 stars!  Ah youth, lost the plastic colt n' ma bed roll but still got a store o' peanut butter and hard tack!
