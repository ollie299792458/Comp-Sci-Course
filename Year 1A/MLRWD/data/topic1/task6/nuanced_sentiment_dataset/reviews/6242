I don't know if Amazon is just transferring the customer reviews of the shredded, cut original release of this film on DVD/Blu-Ray...

But this version, the one that says UNCUT, as far as I know (and I actually spoke to someone at Invincible Pictures; the company releasing this UNCUT version), this is the complete, UNCUT, 104 minute version, with every single scene intact.

As far as why it's only on DVD and not Blu-Ray, I haven't a clue. I would guess that if you really care that much; wait, and an UNCUT Blu-Ray will surface in time. Or, if the DVD makes Invincible enough money (it's hard not to keep my cynicism in check. Sorry.) it will appear, also.

But for everyone who complained about the first release being cut (you know who you are), you can rest assured that THIS DVD is the real film with every scene in all its ridiculous, laughable glory.

TRUST ME! I did the research to say that with 100% conviction. This is not a cut version.

NOW... I could write 1,000 words on why this movie does NOT deserve all this kerfuffle. I could try to convince you all that "A Serbian Film" is actually mediocre trash. But I'll save THAT for the people who PAY me to write reviews.

Enjoy this while it's available.
