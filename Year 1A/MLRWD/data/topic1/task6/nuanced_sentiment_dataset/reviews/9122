This movie was good but it seems as if the director was not sure what path he wanted to take, did he want to go into the relationships that evolved around the rave or just show what it is like to experience it.  The director starts the movie by showing us how the party gets started and then builds it up from the average DJ's to John Digweed who finishes off the party.  But between the beginning and end, we get introduced to all these different characters, but he only skims the surface and we never learn much about them. This movie needed about an added 10 minutes at the beginning to give us some background on the characters, then it would have been much better and not just a rave with people we don't even know anything about.  The soundtrack had a few good songs, 2 of which were played at the end by Digweed.  But I don't think it is worthy of your purchase and neither is the DVD movie.  I would reccommend waiting for this to come on Cable or just rent it if you are really interested in this movie.
Buy If you saw it and loved it - Rent If you like Digweed and the idea of the movie really interests you -  Cable If you want to see a decent movie with some pretty good music -  Skip it If you hate trance/techno, and dislike the idea of raves.
