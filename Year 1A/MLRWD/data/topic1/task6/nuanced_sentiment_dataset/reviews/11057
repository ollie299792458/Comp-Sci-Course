This story wasn't told in chronological order. That works in some movies, but not this one. It just made things confusing.

A few things I disliked:

Bland Characters

First of all, there were several young, female characters who were indistinguishable from one another. They were all about the same age and nothing stood out about them. There was such such a lack of character development, (they were introduced sporadically throughout the film) and I had hard time keeping track of who was who. By the time I started to understand what was going on, the movie was half-way over.

Abandoned Story Lines

The sex scandal, the stalker, the detective--it's like they started writing one screenplay stopped then started writing another one then just spliced the two together.

I did like the latter part of the story and seeing how the husband's infidelity had actually caused the problems he was having with his young daughter and wife, but it's hard to see how this is related to all the other deaths and cell phone number being possessed. It should have been one or the other, a reporter stalked by someone she was exposing or the ghost of a schoolgirl takes revenge on the married man that dumped her. As with a lot of Japanese and Korean horror films, there were too many story lines going on to make a coherent movie.

The name of the movie is Phone, but actually, the use of phones as a scare tactic seemed out of place with everything else that was going on. (Besides the fact that this theme has been done to death.)

Definately rent this movie before buying it. It was ok, but you'll probably never want to see it again.
