Since I love the books of Terry Pratchett and really enjoyed the Hogsfather movie, I had great expectations for this movie duo. But it was a disappointment to me and my wife fell asleep before the end.

The good points
- most special effects are well done, especially the turtle scenes. The exception was an old fashioned shot of Rincewind riding towards the camera on horseback with the background obviously added in later.
- The luggage was believable.
- The first archwizard gave the best performance of the cast. Cohen was OK.

The weak points
- I'm very disappointed in Sean Astin's performance. Was he acting at all or just saying the lines? He gave real depth to Sam the Hobbit but Twoflower was just flat
- Rincewind. Better but still not much character there.
- The evil wizard. Also felt strained. Trying too hard to be evil?
- Death - hated the echo effect. (Not the actor's fault) What was he saying? I wish the subtitles worked for the DVD.
- Much of the original humor was removed. Even with 3 hours of film things had to be cut but I really liked the book scenes with the trees talking to Rincewind and he refused to listen. Or the rocks talking to him. Or death & the four horseman playing bridge. Or sunlight slowed by magic. This gave depth to Rimworld and made it seem more real and magical.
