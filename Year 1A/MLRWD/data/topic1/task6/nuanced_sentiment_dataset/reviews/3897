This movie is a magnificent mystery horror movie. The starring actor is the legendary Dennis Hopper and directed by Steven R. Monroe. This movie was so well produced and the cast performed extremely well. The plot was magnificent and full of many twists. The story is basically about nine strangers getting locked into a mansion and are forced to kill each other in order to leave. The last survivor is promised 5 million dollars in cash prize and their life back. The story line was great because it gave you the horrific visuals as well as a point unlike many other films where they miss the whole plot. Loved how everyone gets desperate in trying to find a way out creating tension among them all. This just shows us what humans are willing to do in order to survive. Sometimes acting like savages and doing just about anything. This film brings tension and drama that will have you sit on your couch with your nails at the tip of your mouth. Overall I was really surprised on just how well this movie turned out and I would definitely recommend everyone to pick it up. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. Very tense!

What a thriller!
