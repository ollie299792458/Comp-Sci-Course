In my opinion, this is not a well-crafted story or a movie worth watching, unless you really like a certain actor or actress or really want to see Fred Astaire dance in his last role.  I thought it would be interesting because Tommy Steele was so great in Disney's musical The Happiest Millionaire and because Keenan Wynn can be very funny, but in this movie, Tommy Steele acts more like he is on a drug high, and the songs in this had less to do with the plot than in most musicals.  For example, there's a lot of good dancing and there are some good tunes, but when everyone's spending the day running through the fields, and it has so little to do with the plot, you have to wonder what the point or current plot is.  The point at that particular part seems to be that everyone's happier in communal living, and the rest of the movie clarifies that communal living is specifically Marxist.  The messages of the movie are Marxist, and the writers of the musical also managed to put in a bit about witches overcoming discrimination, a big deal to the feminists of the 60s.  The Marxist message is more blatant than some of the reviewers here suggested, portraying Fred Astaire's character as greedy for wanting to keep his money and calling the rightful owner, the leprechaun (Tommy Steele), a member of a "subversive underground group" for wanting it.  The writers of the musical were Marxists or socialists who were portraying capitalists as selfish, accusatory hatemongers.  One last thing:  I felt that the movie's subplots weren't very well connected to each other until the end of the movie, and that the cuts in the movie were done in a very psychedelic, disjointed fashion, reflecting the hippie era that director Coppola apparently embraced.  All of these things were negative aspects to me.
