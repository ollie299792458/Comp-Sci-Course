I only bought this DVD because I'm a huge Jewel fan and I knew very little about the movie except that she was in it. While her performance was very good for an acting debut I got a lot more than I expected in terms of the rest of the cast and the movie as a whole. This film was marvelously done in pretty much every way. The story flows well and really captures some of the horrors of war as well as the way friendships and people develop and change over time. It has something for everyone as it mixes action,drama,and humor along with some wonderful cinematography to make a thoroughly satisfying movie. I was struck by the contrasting elements in this film that mirror the human experience. It's beautiful and brutal,touching and tragic,and there is love and loss. And then there's the acting. 
I had seen Skeet Ulrich in Scream and Chill Factor and he does well in this movie but I was far more impressed with Tobey Maguire as Jake and Jeffrey Wright as Holt. They are both great actors and worked well together. As I mentioned before,Jewel was surprisingly good as Sue Lee. Last but certainly not least;I was blown away by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Pitt Mackeson. His performance was menacing and intense with just a touch of icy charm and he may have stolen the show if he had a bigger part. I really love this movie and I think if it had gotten wider distribution and a little initial publicity word of mouth alone could have made it a big hit. Everyone involved in making it should be proud of their work and I highly recommend it.
