Have you noticed the credits at the end of every movie letting you know continuity (how well a plot line or action flows together) is being done.  This film was supposed to have continuity too.  In my opinion, this film had problems with this aspect.  Being a zombie fan, the remake of Night of the Living Dead is a good film to have in your undead arsenal. The zombies were scary, the action driving and the characters believeable. But continuity problems made the movie appear disjointed (no pun intended).  For example when Ben arrived at the farmhouse, Barbara was dragged back into the house.  Tom's uncle had just hit the floor a few minutes before.  He was conspiciously absent from the hallway then appeared when Barbara picked up the fireplace poker. Did he go back into the kitchen to turn the stove back on after Barbara turned off his burnt bacon?  Another striking scene was at the end when Barbara, armed to the teeth, left an injured Ben in the house.  Some key zombies were very close to the house and could have walked in sooner, which could have made more tension and an interesting fight scene, but some of them REALLY took their time to get to the door. It appeared that they were close and then far and then close again.  I know zombies are suppose to be slow moving, but not that slow.
  Sometimes the action and plot flow of a movie can make a difference between a good and great film.  Even with continuity problems, I still like this movie.  Blooper alert! Look for the cameraman visible in the kitchen door window when Ben was kicking the crowbar zombie out the door.
