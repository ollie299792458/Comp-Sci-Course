If one spectacular special effect could make a movie, this one would be great.  The scenes of experimental subjects going from invisible to visible are wonderful, they bring things into being anatomical layer by anatomical layer.  It's a shame that's virtually the only thing worth seeing about this movie.  
Kevin Bacon's potentially interesting role as loose cannon scientist was too shallow to keep my interest.  The other characters in the movie are much more impressed with him than the audience should be.  Even the transition he makes from merely egocentric to violently grandiose is largely unconvincing.  It isn't clear 
As shallow as his character is, the remaining roles were cartoons compared to him, and the story is simply awful.  For the science fiction minded, there was not the least explanation or development of the "quantum shifts" that are supposed to allow invisibility to occur.  For the drama minded, there are lost opportunities galore to allow an invisible man to exploit his situation.  Having him unbutton a woman's blouse is hardly creative use of the potentials in this situation.  
If there's an award for a movie making nothing of its great potential, this one would be close to the top.  I hope they use those wonderful effects in another movie that has more of a plot and better developed characters than this one.
I gave this two stars because it is high gloss and visually interesting, and keeps you thinking about how the character might next exploit his situation ... but he never quite does (does sneaking into a woman's apartment and then just outright attacking her count as an interesting way to exploit invisibility ?)
