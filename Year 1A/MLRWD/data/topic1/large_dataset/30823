First off, this is an oratorio, an all sung production of the original movie, "Life of Brian" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S55X0I">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a>
If you not a fan of the Pythons or that particular movie, this just isn't your cup of tea and you would do well to forget it. This version is not rated so that means some curse words fly and if that bugs you, don't watch this.  I would suggest while watching this performance that you turn on the subtitles. The singing word sounds a bit different than the spoken word, so you need the subtitles to get every bit of humor.
The singers for this performance are soprano Shannon Mercer, mezzo Rosalind Plowright, tenor William Ferguson. bass Christopher Purvis and "baratonish" Eric Idle. They are backed up by the BBC orchestra, a 100 voice choir and Scottish bagpipes. All of this contributes to a first class performance.
If you know the movie, than you know that Mandy finds herself "great with child" by a Roman soldier and has Brian Cohen a man who will grow up to be mistaken for the Messiah. You'll listen as Brian falls in love with Judith and as Brian tries to convince his followers to be individuals and to think for themselves.
But there are some special guests on this live performance such as Michael Palin,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGBM22">Michael Palin's Around the World in 80 Days</a> Terry Jones, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010V4VJY">Terry Jones' Medieval Lives</a> Terry Gilliam, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898">Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> Neil Innes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ULDK4Q">Stories from East of the Moon</a>and Sanjeev Bhaskar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0752876430">Help Yourself with the Kumars</a> and Carol Cleveland <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Y7TA">The Life of Python</a>. You could consider it a Python reunion except Graham Chapman (for obvious reasons)  and John Cleese were not there. I don't know how they could have made it any better with their presence than what it was, but that's my opinion.
One thing I really like about this concert is that most of the time, the camera is focused on what's happening on stage. No long audience shots, no panning and scanning to make the concert seem bigger or grander than what it was - it was grand and glorious on its own merits.
But don't think just because you saw the original movie there is nothing new for you in this presentation. Yes, it does have "Always Look on The Bright Side of Life" which I probably will be whistling for the next week - the sheep bit as well as the Bob Dylan bit are great and worth the price of the dvd alone.
If you like the Pythons, I recommend strongly you buy this dvd. You will be missing out on a lot of laughter if you pass up this dvd. Buy it, you'll like it.
