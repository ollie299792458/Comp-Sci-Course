As someone who studies infectious diseases like flu for a living, this movie was a long time coming. As good as Hollywood is likely to get as far as a 'realistic' portrayal of a pandemic. Certainly much more realistic than 'Outbreak'. I have minor quibbles with the rate of spread of the disease as well as the relative ease and speed with which a vaccine is developed, manufactured and used. But it's nothing like the liters and liters of antisera that Dustin Hoffman gets out of one little tiny monkey in a matter of minutes in 'Outbreak'.

Was it a possible candidate for Best Picture? No. As others have noted, the film has a decided lack of focus which makes it more difficult to care about the characters as much as you might like. In trying to portray all aspects of the pandemic, it reaches for more than it should. It might have been better served to focus on one story (ala Legend or Walking Dead) and leave the rest alone. And I don't think it would have mattered which one - Matt Damon's story was certainly foremost but the others were potentially interesting. Esp. Marion Cotillard tracking down the spread of the disease from Hong Kong and being taken hostage. As previously mentioned, the spread is too fast and the vaccine developed too fast to be entirely realistic. The speed with which time passes is also difficult to grasp and at times weeks or months appear to have passed but to the viewer it feels like hours or maybe days. And it's obvious the producers realized this and that's why they added the handy time scale in text at times although it still doesn't help with the disorientation.

Not that there aren't aspects to like. Jude Law's unscrupulous blogger hits all to close to home with today's 'blogosphere' which seems to have an 'anything goes' mentality. Gweneth Paltrow's cheating wife gets her 'reward'. Not exactly 'Fatal Attraction' but still...
