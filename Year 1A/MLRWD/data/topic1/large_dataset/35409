Okay, first things first.  I LOVE the 21 Jump Street series.  At first when I heard it was announced, I thought to myself, 'A comedy?  And the cast includes Channing Tatum and Rob Riggle?  THIS MUST BE STOPPED!'.  And so I was against it for months.
Then, the first trailer came out.  Had some funny-looking scenes, but what really got me was the red-band trailer.  I guess it's an acquired taste, but I love the vulgar humor style of Jonah Hill, and I was cracking up at the trailer.  At that point I went from being totally  against the movie to counting down the days til it came out.
When the good reviews came rolling in, I got a bit worried.  Only because, I usually hate movies that everyone says "Oh, it's so great, you must see it!".  Case in point: Anchorman, Avatar, the Hangover.  All got rave reviews, and I hated them all.
But opening day came, and when I left the theater afterward, I was not disappointed.  Actually, I was sure it was the most fun I'd had at the movies since I can't remember when.  The laughs started early and never let up.  And though the main focus is comedy, the action scenes don't disappoint, though it never stops making you laugh.  And, surprisingly, Channing Tatum was actually really funny.  At one point you even start to feel bad for his character -  something I never thought I would find myself saying.  I loved it so much that I went back and saw it three times in theaters.  And you can bet that I'll be pre-ordering the blu-ray, and it will become a mainstay in my movie collection, and sit proudly next to the 21 Jump Street TV series.
