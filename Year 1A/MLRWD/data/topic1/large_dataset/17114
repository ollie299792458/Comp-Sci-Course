I saw this film at a special pre-screening in Boston, with writer/director Peter Hedges and actor Oliver Platt present to do a Q & A after the film.  I was pleased and relieved that when the lights came up at the end, I was able to compliment them on their work.
"April" feels like a traditional Thanksgiving movie, so much so that you wonder, why hasn't anyone done this before?  The parallel stories of the family's road trip from Connecticut to New York City and April's chaotic attempt to cook the Thanksgiving dinner compliment each other nicely as the film reaches its emotional conclusion.
It's a bit of a happy-ending film, but that's okay.  It's a holiday movie, and Hedges -- using some of his own personal experiences -- brings together the tragic and the comic to build a surprisingly heartfelt and accurate holiday scene.  Each character is specifically built, with distinct traits, but none ever slide into charicature.  The dying mom, the stoic father, the good boyfriend, the perfect middle sister: these are all figures each of us has known in our lives and, likely as not, in some way in our own families.
I would hope that Hedges's "Pieces of April" is a small, heartfelt film just big enough to touch the world.
