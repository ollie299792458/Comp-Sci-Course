I have loved the X-Files since the pilot episode. I watched the entire series and adored the first movie. The first time I watched IWTB, I was disappointed because I was expecting something else, BUT the second time I saw it, I really liked it. Once I got past the fact that this plot was not about aliens or any of the alien mythology from the show (it is really a serial killer plot with a paranormal twist), then I was thoroughly entertained. I loved seeing Mulder and Scully's life as a couple and I thought that their personalities played out in a way that was true to the series.

I saw this movie as a redemption story for all of the characters. Mulder was still on his quest to make up for the fact that he couldn't save his sister as a child, and Scully was still struggling with her issues of faith. Although these two have some turmoil and their usual conflict of personalities, in the end they still have each other. I thought that theme was very sweet and in line with all things X-Files.

The plot was strange and the logic was questionable in some areas, but it came together after a while. I also liked the introduction of the other, younger agents. My only real complaint is that Skinner really only made a cameo and did not have a major role in the movie. Beside that, I liked the film as a stand alone.
