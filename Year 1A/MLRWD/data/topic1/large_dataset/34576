Excellent story and they followed most of it fairly accurately.  Good job with the repercussions of David's adultery and how it affected his entire household for a long time thereafter.  The dynamics of the sons were well-done with only minor omissions in the plot here and there but not enough to damage the story badly... except in the case of Goliath.  With all the information about the account you'd think they could get one detail right but I'm not sure any aspect of it was accurate.  First of all, they show Goliath no larger than anyone else.  Also, there is no real context of a war and battle here... Goliath is just ambushing Saul's soldier's a couple at a time.  There is no forty days of taunts, David is already here, and Saul is about to bravely charge off to face Goliath (never showing the least fear of Goliath) when David says to let him.  He doesn't even try on Saul's armor (though Saul mentions it while ridiculing David about the impossibility of David fighting).

The only other major issue I recall was the presence of some excessive spirituality.  For example, when Saul is overcome by the Spirit he never prophecies, he just dances rather provocatively (a similar presentation when David dances but it is at least slightly more accurate in David's case).  I'm not counting the Witch of Endor scene in that, since it is supposed to be spiritualistic- as per general suppositions, her spiritualistic nature is extremely freaky and witch-like with her screaming and chanting and so forth [but try to remember all witchcraft is not so blatant]).

Remember these are wars and adultery, etc. and they are true to the Biblical account in that sense so they are not meant for family viewing.
