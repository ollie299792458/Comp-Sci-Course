I think I expected a little more from this Gus Van Sant directed movie.  There were tons of similiarities between this and Good Will Hunting (troubled young man taken under wing by brilliant tutor) though there's a little more role reversal here (the student helps the teacher at least as much).  As if to remind you that this is a variation on the Will Hunting theme, Matt Damon even shows up in a cameo.  The movie is shot much like Good Will Hunting as well -- those sweeping shots of the teacher's bookshelves look a lot like the ones of Will's bookshelves at the beginning of the movie.
But I enjoyed the story if for no other reasons than the performances.  Connery was appropriately gruff but lovable, and the newcomer (whose name I forget -- probably because he hasn't done anything big since) was wonderfully subtle.  Rent this if you've already seen Good Will Hunting and looking for more on that troubled kid/helpful mentor theme.  Or if you've ever had a really arrogant arse of a professor who you wish you could've outsmarted.
