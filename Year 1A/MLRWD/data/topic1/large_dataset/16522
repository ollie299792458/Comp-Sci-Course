Ralph Fiennes and Natasha Richardson star in this film. Fiennes as an ex- U.S Diplomat named Todd Jackson and Richardson is Countess Sofia Belinskya, the tragic, lost and exiled Russian Countess. The story starts in Shanghai in 1936. Richardson is working at a gentlemen's club to support her daughter and husband's family, who have no qualms in telling her that what she is doing is wrong and if they had the choice she would be no part of any of their lives. Even though she is the only real money maker in the household, even then it's not that much money.

 Fiennes is just as tragic if not more so. He meets Richardson one night as he is leaving the club where she works and she sees 2 men following him suspiciously and intervenes to help him. This begins their involvement. His dream is to open a gentlemen's club with real essence and class and with her as the centerpiece.

 As with most of Fiennes films, it's supposed to be some sort of epic love story. Although there is a romantic aspect to it, it wasn't central to the film. My favorite parts of the film were between Fiennes and his mysterious, randomingly appearing Japanese friend Matsuda played by Hiroyuki Sanada. When they are together they discuss dreams, hopes, wishes and regrets.

 Although it's not exactly the Tour De Force I think it wanted to be, it is an exquisitely simple tale amidst the background of a world in turmoil and on the brink of war.

 Watch for some interesting casting. Richardson's mother-in-law is played by her real life Aunt, Lynn Redgrave and her aunt in the film is played by her mother, Vanessa Redgrave.
