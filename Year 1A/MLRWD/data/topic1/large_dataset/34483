I am -- or was- a really big fan of the X-Men comic books, [had the complete run from January 1980 to January 1995] So I didn't really know what to expect from the X-Men movie. I came away pleasantly impressed.
The acting was top-notch. When I heard that Patrick Stewart was to portray Professor Xavier, I had mixed feelings. I had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role, but I was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie (&aacute; la Sean Connery in "The Avengers"). I was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasn't the case with X-Men. Stewart gave a stellar performance, opposite the equally excellent Sir Ian McKellen ("Magneto"). Other good performances were put in by the really splendid Hugh Jackman ("Wolverine"), Anna Paquin ("Rogue"), and Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly).
Turning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor (again, look no further than "The Avengers"), but X-Men pulled it off just right. The movie takes itself seriously (but not too seriously), and--from what I've heard--it remains pretty faithful to the existing X-Men story, without alienating the uninitiated. It also makes the viewer think about important issues, such as racism, instead of just being a brainless, explosion-filled, ammo-laden action movie. Yet the action is there, and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issues.
Visually, X-Men is stunning, featuring some really slick computer animation, particularly Wolverine's claws and the scene where Xavier uses the mind-machine to find Rogue. The sound and music complimented the on-screen action. The plot and the explanations of the characters' backstories were interesting, and left things wide open for a sequel.
Overall, X-Men is worth your money.
