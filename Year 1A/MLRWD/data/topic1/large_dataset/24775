Instead of 5 stars i give 3 to this edition, and here's why:
I am a fan of the original stuffs, in this case, i bought this edition thinking about the entire classic movie, with a new and improved transfer and without modifications, you know what i mean, just THE apropiated subtitles, additional opcional bg music and the DVD original special features.
I have to tell you that this is transfer of a 'colored version' of the movie. Sometime long ago,  someone gave color to the movie: instead of the original black &amp; white, there's black &amp; red when the scene happens during the afternoon, black &amp; yellow in the morning, black &amp; blue in the night...etc.
Another thing, for example: when a caracter reads a letter , this edition replaced the original close ups of the letter and it's contents for a computer generated draw of the letter and its's content, as you can imagine, with funny word fonts in english. This makes a great contrast between the really old movie and the clear old-simulated texts. I think this is a lack of good taste. 
If you don't care about this little details, just buy it, it's a good and improved editon. A really new way to see and apreciate this classic.
