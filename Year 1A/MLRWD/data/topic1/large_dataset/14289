This DVD show is from the PBS series which I have watched and is really not about Spain. Most of the Spain you will see will be zipping by as a background in a moving car. This series is about the fours hosts and their egos. I found most hours of this show the hosts are talking about themselves and their discussion have nothing to do about Spain.

Case in point

Mark Bittman and Gwyneth Paltrow are in the Alhambra. Do they walk around the Alhambra to take in the magic of this place? No and spend a 10 seconds talking about the interior details of the palace. They find a window with a view and then spend most of their time talking about if Gwyneth would in the future write a cook book with Bittman's help. Does anyone really care if Gwyneth writes a cookbook? Does writing a cookbook have anything to do about Spain? Bittman and Paltrow seem not to care how lucky they are to have visited the Alhambra.

Then they go to the gardens and pilfer some persimmons. This is Gwyneth after taking a bite:

"Oh my God, God, God, God, God."

That's pretty much the kind of stuff she says when she tastes something because she does not have a movie script to explain the how good "oh my god" tastes.

This show is about four people that spend hours talking about themselves and you soon realized five minutes into their discussions it has nothing to do about Spain. Most of what you see is host talking about themselves with little about Spain and in the background..

They are good point of the show but is would fit into less than hour.
