I love my Yoga Booty Ballet!

To preface, I'm a person who doesn't work out very much, although I'm in decent shape. I don't have much in the way of a yoga background, and I've seen some reviewers who come off as having more experience with working out than I do (maybe?) who don't like their style. I can see that it might seem a bit lame for more advanced folks. However, as a laid-back beginner, it works for me. I usually have trouble sticking to workout routines and don't normally like exercise videos (I'm not what you'd call coordinated and most go way too fast for me). After a doing this one a couple of times and learning the names for various moves, I had no trouble following along because they are good at giving advance notice of the next move. I like that it opens and closes with self-affirming meditations and keeps things mixed up in terms of the workouts. I appreciate that they have an advanced section, so that when I get bored with/used to the basics, I can up my game. They are cheesy at times, and Ravi on the drums makes me giggle, but I like their chatter--it's encouraging to me to not have a drill sergeant at the helm, but someone who figures I might fall over during the ballet routine and is perfectly okay with that. :-)

Practically speaking, it's not that strenuous of a workout, but it gets me toned all over and I feel it when I'm done. I'm losing more inches than weight, and that's more important to me. I'm really toning up my abs, which is my worst trouble spot--they're looking awesome, by the way. :-) Also, I feel great when I finish and other people have noticed my physique has been getting more fit.

I highly recommend this for people who are just looking for a fun, low-stress, low-stakes way to get fit and be healthy, possibly easing into a more serious routine.
