I've recently gone on a foreign language film binge, and this one settles with the cream, near the very top.  Plot wise, there are three stories that interconnect on the basis of a big car accident, and each revolves around dogs and their owners.  The first piece is about a guy who lusts after his older brother's wife while also making big money in dog fights.  The older brother gets more and more angry while at the same time the younger brother has made an enemy at his side job.  The second story is about a middle aged man in the magazine industry who leaves his family and moves in with a beautiful model.  Things get hectic when her lovable ball of fluff disappears beneath a hole in the floor and won't come out.  The final tale is about an ex-professor turned radical turned nearly pennyless hitman who wanders the streets with his group of trustworthy dogs.  Things change for him when he unknowgly nurses a very dangerous mutt back to health.  Now, these stories may not sound intrigiuing at first, but the strengths lie in the tone, cinematography, acting, and atmosphere.  Give it a chance, and I think everyone can take something positive from the experience.  Of course, this takes us to the WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS BLOODY IMAGES OF DOG FIGHTING.  The question is, can you handle this sort of thing?  I was prepared, and it wasn't as bad as I thought, but if you go in expecting Fido and Lassie frolicking in the hills at sunset, you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.  In the form of mauled carcasses.  Yep, quite nasty.  But consider the fact that the animals were trained and not harmed, and that the rest of the movie is excellent, and you should be able to bear it.  Also, this film has many levels, and warrants repeated viewing, thus making it a quality purchase.  BUT--because of the dog fights, I can't just flat out recommend that everyone buys it on a whim.  If you're not sure, RENT IT FIRST.  Otherwise, it's a guranteed positive experience.
