I love this movie because of one thing: the cars.  There are a lot of very cool cars that I will never own in this movie.  This movie also has one of the coolest looking Mustangs (or any other car for that matter) ever made in Eleanor.  Between this movie and my die-cast model of that car, they're probably the closest I'll get to having my own Eleanor...my wife agrees.  Though I should remind her that Eleanor is a CAR...maybe that's why she didn't take too kindly to the suggestion of "having Eleanor in my garage."

Anyway, the storyline is decent, plausible, and not overly-done (like a Fast and Furious movie).  I like the character Cage plays, even though it's the same in most of his movies.  I really like Robert Duvall's character in this movie and he brought a lot of...what's the word...class(?), dignity(?) to this movie.  And the chase scene with Eleanor rivals the best ever done (Bullit), and personally I think it beats it.  Fun movie I don't get tired of watching over and over.

And really, this movie has been out for 10 years...I'm just brushing up on writing reviews.
