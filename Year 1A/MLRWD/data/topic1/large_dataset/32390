I am offended by the reviewers who have referred to this movie as a "chick flic."  
I am a guy, with red blood, and I am exclusively heterosexual; yet this movie is my favorite movie. 
Anyone who doesn't give this movie 5 stars must have never truly kissed a woman.  Have you ever kissed a woman, just kissed her gently, and you both were sent high up into the air, even above the clouds, you both could feel your bodies floating up and up and up.  Your hand was on HER back, but you could feel that same hand on YOUR back, as if you were her, for that moment.  You experienced it both through your own lips, and hers.  It was magical.  
If you HAVE experienced this, you will relate to this movie.  
If you have NOT experienced this, you are missing out on LIFE...
This movie speaks to me on the deepest level of who I am.  I consider it so sacred a movie, and unlike any other, that I don't mention its name to my friends.  Even the few who have discovered my connection with the movie have been asked by me to not talk about it, even in the most positive terms.  Pearls are not meant to be cast before swine, and if you don't keep pearls tightly clenched in your fist, you never know when the swine are around you, which might snatch the pearl.
