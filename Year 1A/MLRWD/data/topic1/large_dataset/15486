Paradise Now is one of the best movies to come out of the Middle East in a long time.  Although it had been hyped up for me by friends of mine months before I actually saw it, the film far surpassed my expectations.

Not only was I surprised that Warner Bros. would put out a film about such a controversial subject, but the cinematography retained a certain "indie" quality that made it a pleasure to watch.  The editing is absolutely superb, and you will probably sweat in your seat for the full 90 minutes of the film.  The excellent production quality and tight suspense contrasts with the long-winded opus "Munich" by Spielberg, but both are good films in broaching the difficult topic of terrorism and retribution.  I also recommend the Israeli movie "Cup Final" for a poignant look at Israelis and Palestinian guerrillas before the era of suicide bombing (which began 1993-94).

The political message of the movie is actually quite powerful, for those who can handle a little nuance.  By showing a snapshot of the lives of two Palestinian men who decide to become suicide bombers, the film refuses to condemn them as nameless, faceless terrorists.  Rather, it demonstrates the horrible political tragedy of which their decision is part and parcel.  In the end, the film proves that they actually DO have a choice to contribute to the cycle of violence (or not).  The film is not a documentary (although it was shot on location with Israeli Jews and Arabs), and so it fails to articulate a clear political alternative to the current situation.  However, by illustrating in stark terms the agency of the characters involved and the difference that their choices make, it points the way toward an ethical rejection of the status quo (violence) in favor of an alternative future.
