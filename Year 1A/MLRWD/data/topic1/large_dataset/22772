A couple years back, in 7th grade, during History class, everyone in the classroom was introduced to one of entertainment's greatest stars, Charlie Chaplin. And how did we become aware of this man's works? By watching Modern Times. After watching the movie, I must say that it is one of the FUNNIEST movies I've EVER seen in my life! In fact, I think I've gotten the most enjoyment out of the film than anyone else in the classroom. Why haven't I seen this earlier?

Honestly, I don't think there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but I still highly recommend this movie. Not only is it extremely wonderful and hilarious, but it is also one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, too. Think about it: Can we students imagine what the 1930s were like, let alone Little Tramp's world? It would be pretty bizarre to visualize ourselves force-fed by a "feeding machine", as well as TRY to get arrested by doing ridiculous things!

You can just watch a few clips of the movie before buying a disc, or you could go and see the other Amazon reviews for further detail about this classic. Either way, there's no doubting that you're in for a great time while it lasts.
