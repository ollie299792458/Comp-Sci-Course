I purchased this movie online for 15$ because I absolutely love Lindsey Lohan and her movies as well as I am a huge Desperate Housewives fan. I found this to be a great mother/daughter/generational movie in which a angst ridden teen travels to a small town to live with her Grandmother and finds herself. There were a few looseends at the end however with Dermot and Felicity's characters and what actually happens between them. That I thought should have played out somehow which it didn't and I found that dissapointing. Lohan's love interest was adorable as Harlan and they were a cute match. I think Lohan is an incredible actress and I can't wait to see her again in another film because she has the makings of an Academy Award Winner if she gets her act together. Jane Fonda did a great job too and it was nice seeing her in a movie again. She definately wasn't the evil character she was made out to be in the beginning but thats expected.
  The plot kept you guessing about what truly happened between Lohan and her step-father but I think deep down the audience knows the truth from her actions. I also really loved the scenery in this movie and it was getting lost in the Northwestern mountains. I would recommend this movie even if you have to buy it to watch it because it is really good and you will enjoy it:):):):)
