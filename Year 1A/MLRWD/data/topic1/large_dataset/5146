This movie, "Outland," starring Sean Connery, takes place in the not too distant future, on a planet being mined by a corporation for a substance greatly needed back on earth.  The mining operation is huge, and so is the structure(s)for housing hundreds of employees, from common miners, to doctors, and a police department.  Connery plays the role of the 'chief of police.'  The corporation clandestinely imports illegal drugs to the mining complex, inducing men to work harder and therefore, produce more.  Every important person, including the manager of the complex, and each former chief of police, were aware, but did nothing for fear of their lives- until Connery arrives, stumbles upon the situation, and attempts to shut down the drug shipments.  It is, in parts, very suspenseful, has a good share of action sequences, that finally end in a showdown between Connery and 'hit men' sent by the corporation to eliminate him.  The script is made more intricate, and therefore more interesting, for having Connery's family at the site, relationship with wife, and a friendship developed with the head doctor, a woman, who helps him accomplish his goal.
