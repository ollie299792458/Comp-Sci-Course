Brad Anderson is one of those directors who seems incapable of making a bad movie, yet never gets the exposure he deserves. His brilliant, intelligent frightener 'Session 9' should have won him acclaim, and his Hitchcockian nightmare 'The Machinist' drew an astonishingly painful performance from Christian Bale. If 'Transsiberian' has a fault, it's perhaps that it builds a lot of fear and then plays a little safe, but it's a great addition to the 'Peril On A Train' sub-genre.
Woody Harrelson and Emily Mortimer are journeying back from Moscow on the titular express, and become entangled with wild child Kate Mara and edgy Eduardo Noriega, who are running away from a deal-gone-wrong. But just when you think straight-laced Woody is going to fall from grace, the script pulls a trick you didn't see coming...add solid Ben Kingsley as a pursuing Russian cop and you've got a nice 'spiralling out of control' situation brewing. The DVD cut is longer (and better) than the theatrical release.
Incidentally, every Anderson film seems to contain one shocking scene - in this one, wait for the moment when Emily takes a walk through the train!
