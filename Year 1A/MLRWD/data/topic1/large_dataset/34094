I remember seeing the trailor for 1408 in theaters, and absolutly couldn't wait to see it! John Cusack played an amazing role in this movie! Very good acting through-out each scene.. very funny attitude during the beginning of the movie.

My only issue with this movie, was the dead giveaway during the elevator scene with Samuel Jackson. The lines that were spoken in the managers office seemed like a very convincing story, until I heard what I heard in the elevator.

I'm not one to guess what happens next in every movie I watch.. I LOVE being suprised! But mannnn-- I was disappointed when Jackson talked about the way him and the maids treat room 1408. The first thing that hit me was "I wounder if..", which with each following scene made that WHAT IF piece together much sooner that I wanted it to.

Sooo.. if it weren't for the dead giveaway, this movie was an incredible story, with some of the best acting from Cusack I've seen in a looong time! Definatly a muct see... if I haven't already spoiled it for you yet. My apoligizes!
