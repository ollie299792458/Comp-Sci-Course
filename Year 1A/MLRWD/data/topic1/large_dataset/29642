Well, I had quite a nice compilation of The State episodes I had recorded on VHS when it aired. I edited out all the commercials and still had over 5 hours of quality scenes. I even paid to convert to DVD and gifted out to all my friends who adored the show as I did. Lots of good memories and lots of terrific skits.

So, the DVD has everything you remember. The popular skits and the smaller personal favorites. We all had our own. I haven't even had time to watch the entire set yet. My only beef, hence the four stars instead of five, is the music has changed.

Where once you'd hear a song you actually recognize, it has been oddly replaced with an acoustic version of a similar styled song. Like the "I Love Pants" skit, for example. It originally included a Breeders song, now it plays an odd rendition meant to mimic the original, but nowhere near the same.

Perhaps there are artist rights issues or something ...not certain, however the change in music does take away an element for me, as a State fan who has enjoyed watching poor quality VHS original skits since the show ended. For those COMPLETELY deprived of any State episodes for years, you will likely not even remember the songs that were (to me) an integral part of each skit. Thus, you may find this DVD to be a five star purchase.

Go for it. Or come on over for cocktails and we'll watch it together at my place. Swap stories about our favorite skits and characters and why. Cheers!
