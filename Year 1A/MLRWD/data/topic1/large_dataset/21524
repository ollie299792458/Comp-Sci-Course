I'm a movie buff.  56 years old. First saw this wonderful movie in 1967, and it keeps coming back to me.  There are so many memorable scenes and character actors, I could go on for an hour.  It is poignant and sad, humorous and frustrating. I really do feel this is Newman's greatest movie.  George Kennedy deservedly won an oscar for his lovable lug, "Dragline".  The "car wash" girl is by the way, Joy Harmon.  Memorable scenes: 50 eggs, Car Wash, The warden's "Spend the night in the box" speech, Luke's visit from his mama, looks like dying from lung cancer, Strother Martin's twang "What we have here...is a failure...to communicate!"  Even to this day, my buddy and I still quote this movie all the time in everyday life....."Oh lord, I know I've been bad, but please don't strike me blind for the next five minutes."  Dragline said when he sees the car wash girl.  The Boss Man.."the man with no eyes" is too real and intimidating.  Riveting entertainment.  Lots of symbolic meanings. Stunned and dazed when it's over.  Prepare thyself  for big-league emotions.  Outstanding!
