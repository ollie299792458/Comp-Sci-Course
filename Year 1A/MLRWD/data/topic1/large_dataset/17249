DARK CITY is a rare gem and the director's cut elevates it from great to sublime. It precedes the similarly themed MATRIX by a few months and both were overshadowed by TITANIC, so DARK CITY has been unjustly overlooked. I'm glad that Roger Ebert has championed the film and it has developed a following in the last ten years.

The video quality is very good. There is some softness occasionally but this rendering is superior to any that have preceded it. I am very pleased with the beautiful transfer and enjoyed noticing several details I had missed on DVD or in the theater. An Edward Hopper painting in motion. Some SFX have been improved for the director's cut. Audio quality is also excellent.

This BD has a nice selection of extras though I couldn't play the "Director's Cut Fact Track" along with audio commentary. This is another barebones disc, without a booklet or scene guide, that deserved some special attention.

DARK CITY has my highest recommendation for everyone and this BD is the best way to watch it.
