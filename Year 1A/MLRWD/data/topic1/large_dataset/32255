Just to let you know before hand, I'm reviewing the movie itself, not the DVD. The DVD itself is pretty good, but doesn't stand out from those of other movies. It's got the typical special features and commentary, like most movies. Since the DVD doesn't stand out, I'll get to my review on the movie itself.

The One was overall a pretty good movie, with lots of interesting ideas, but it had some faults as well. What I liked best about it was the fact that The One was original, as far as the setting goes. The idea that there is a copy of each person in each of the many dimensions was original. Other high points included the special effects, camera angles, and stunts. All of these were brought together in the scene where Jet Li fights a copy of himself. However, there were low points in The One as well. For one, I thought that there was too much action in this movie, which somewhat ruined the plot. For instance, most of the movie was fight scenes, which got old after a while. However, since Jet Li is relatively good at fight scenes, that wasn't much of a problem. Another thing that I disliked about this movie was that it seemed like a stereotypical Jet Li film; all action and little plot. The One was almost exactly like Hero and other Jet Li films specifically because most of it was occasionally mindless action. Also, the dialog of The One wasn't great, and occasionally hard to understand, and I thought that the writing wasn't up to par with the special affects and stunts. However, with a great story, setting and ideas, this movie kept me entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. For that, I give it seven stars. If you like action movies with intense and good martial arts sequences, then you'll love this movie. However, if you don't enjoy action sequences, then The One will most likely bore you. To conclude, I say that The One was an original movie that is worth taking some time to see.
