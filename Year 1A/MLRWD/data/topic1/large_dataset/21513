So, in seeing other reviews on this, I was actually excited to take a peek at this movie. I definitely appreciate the more mental and minimalist side of the horror genre (I hate Hollywood's current fascination with torture porn...Saw sequels, I'm looking at you). However, this film definitely does not fit the bill.

Many people have stated that this is a slow-burn movie. This is completely untrue. In a good slow-burning horror film, angst/dread/discomfort are present throughout all scenes, even ones where there is no obvious threat. In this film, the "down" scenes may just as well have been pulled out of a Lifetime drama about families coping with infidelity and/or drug use. There's no pervasive sense of threat or dread. The film's few horror aspects suffer because of this.

The film attempts to indicate rather than show, particularly with the primary evil antagonist never actually getting a full reveal. This works for other horror films because the viewer is in a mindset of dread throughout, prepping them to fill in the blanks with the most horrifying thing imaginable, even if it's not shown on camera. Without the pervasive sense of discomfort, my psyche remained unrattled. Also, although they don't show the creature, they give it a fairly definite description, further marring any chance that the audience will imagine something truly horrifying as a matter of their own machinations.

On the plus side, the premise is interesting enough and the cast does a fairly good job at their roles. Some dialog options and acting choices are recognizably "indy", but the film doesn't suffer for it. Also, the last scene was a good little piece of writing (tiny spoiler), bringing back the idea of justifications used when people go missing addressed earlier in the film.

Overall, this was a lack-luster movie and really not a good example of an independent horror flick. It wasn't a bad attempt, just lacked the atmosphere to deliver any real chills.
