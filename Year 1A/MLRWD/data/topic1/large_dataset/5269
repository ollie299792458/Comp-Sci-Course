I don't know what it is about Cellular but I watch it every couple of months-and never get tired of it.  Without question, Chris Evans is adorable, but he's also a really good actor.  And the predicament he finds himself in...well, let's just say he rises to the challenge and becomes a hero, whether he wanted to in the beginning or not.

William H. Macy, as always, just shines in his role as the detective who cares...and who also plans to open a day spa with his wife (which brings about a few comical moments in an otherwise fast paced, tense hour and a half).  Kim Basinger is also good in this movie, but it's the guys that steal the show.  I won't comment on Jessica Biel because my mom always taught me that if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  But I will say that I'm glad that her part in this movie was brief.

The only problem I had with the movie is that, after all the times I've watched it, I'm still a little confused over how Chris Evans' character was able to reconnect with the woman using the cell phone belonging to the man whose car he hijacked for a second time.

All in all, I couldn't be happier to recommend Cellular to anyone.  I think it's a wonderful movie that sucks you in very early on...then easily keeps your interest to the end.
