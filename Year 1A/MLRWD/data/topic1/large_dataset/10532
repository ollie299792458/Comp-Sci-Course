This was a great action/horror film, packed with some excellent special effects, an entertaining storyline, and at least a couple of reasonably talented actors (Snipes, Dorff).  Kristofferson is terrible as always (a  hint to you casting people... Sam Elliott would have been MUCH better as  the tough and gritty Whistler).
But you're not really reading this review  to hear about the movie -- you can get that kind of info anywhere.  What  you want to know is "Is the DVD worth buying instead of a VHS  tape?"  Weeeellll...
This movie is undoubtedly THE showcase movie  for DVD (the Mummy is another very good choice).  The picture quality is  fantastic, and the sound is incredible (you gotta listen to it in Dolby  Digital 5.1 on a nice home theater system to fully appreciate the sound).  But what really sets this format apart from anything else are the SPECIAL  FEATURES.  A ton of things like information about the different Vampire  houses, commentary from the director on the making of the film, and an  alternative ending, really show how the DVD format can add to your viewing  experience.  Many DVDs (too many, in fact) are simply direct transfers from  another format to DVD.  No extras, limited enhancements on picture and  sound...  A perfect example of a BAD DVD is Highlander!
  The DVD  versions of the Bond movies have also shown the industry a thing or two  about how to make a truly interesting and worthwhile DVD movie.  DVDs like  Blade make me happy I purchased a DVD player!
