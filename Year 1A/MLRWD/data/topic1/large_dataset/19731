Let me start by saying that I'm a huge martial arts movie fan. And yet . . .  this was a movie I had to work to sit through. On the positive side, the fight scenes were some of the best I've ever seen. Jet Li is incredible, and I'll see any movie he's in.

On the negative side, this is a movie with the kind of plot holes one expects in a 1970s-era Hong Kong chop-sockey film, not in something with Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman. At times it bordered on silly.

Among the many distracting holes, Li's character has been enslaved by Hoskins, and is then taken in by Freeman and his step daughter. In the few months that they care for him, they don't seem all that disturbed by his almost complete lack of knowledge of the world. Then, when the team reunites with Hoskins, Hoskins still has injuries from the incident that separated him from Li, despite the passage of a few months and Li's complete recovery. Silly. I could go on, but you get the drift.

This is one to rent or catch on HBO, unless you are a collector of martial arts films or a big Jet Li fanatic.
