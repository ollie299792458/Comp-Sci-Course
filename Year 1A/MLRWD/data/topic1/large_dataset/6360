Otto Preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  Dana Andrews plays McPherson, the hard-boiled detective investigating the shocking murder of a society woman, Laura, in New York.  McPherson focuses on Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a sardonic sophisticate who writes a newspaper column and has a radio talk show.  Lydecker was a good friend of Laura's but despised her playboy fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price). In  process of the investigation McPherson falls in love with Laura's portrait.  Fortunately for McPherson, Laura returns--apparently the body of the girl found in the apartment was not Laura!

The filming of this story is gorgeous black and white with cunningly utlized shadow that threatens the characters--or reveals their underlying motivation.  Dana Andrews' curt and athletic interpretation of the detective contrasts nicely with the talented Vincent Price who plays a spoiled rich boy. Clifton Webb does a nice job as the poisonous, dried-out sophisticate.  Gene Tierney as Laura is gorgeous, charming and elegant.  Unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout the film.  Laura starts out as an assertive individualist who challenges the values of sophisticated society. By the end of the film she is a docile female who has found her man.  The story is a little melodramatic, and all the loose ends are tied up too neatly--a good noir thriller leaves some mysteries unsolved.  Also, the theme song is a little saccharine and too often played.  Nevertheless well worth seeing and enjoying.
