OK!I know this movie is about Vampires vr. Werewolfs with dark settings and lots of action, BUT everyone should knows that this is more like anime parody than a normal action movie.

The main anime productions that inspired this movie were BATTLE ANGEL and BIOHUNTER (just mix them together and you will have  this).

There are another animes that also inspired the movie like Vampire Hunter D, Escaflowne and Wicked City but those were not the main ones. Just watch BIOHUNTER and BATTLE ANGEL and you will  know of what Im talking about.

Of course! Im only talking about the productions, the story and the acting are different.

If you like anime parodies then check out this ones:

* Matrix Revolutions (One of the very best).

* Animatrix.

* Kill Bill.

* Guyver 2.

* Blade (this one have very little "rip-offs" but there are very notable).

* Power Rangers (THE WORST PARODY EVER).

ADIOS.
