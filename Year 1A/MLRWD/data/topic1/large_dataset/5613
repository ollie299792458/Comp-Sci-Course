I'm very very fond of this film, both on my own and through the eyes of my four year old.  It has just the right balance of excitement, scary parts, and sheer unadulterated joy -- and that's what I love so much about it, is the joy.  Somehow they've captured, in the songs and the visuals, the exciting glorious feeling of being young and free in the world, of having a friend and an entire day to celebrate it.  There's a lot of love in this film, and that far outshines its drawbacks.  It's a little bit odd that Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit and Piglet become secondary and not very complimentary characters, and the voice talent doing Tigger is actually a little bit creepy, he sounds like Paul Winchell at 100 (which, alas, he never attained).  And my two year old finds the movie a little too scary to watch, though he'll peer at it, intrigued, from behind the couch.  But my four year old immediately proclaimed it his favorite movie of all time and said he wanted to watch it every day from now on.  And he does watch it frequently, and I continue to enjoy the music emenating from the other room.  I don't ever get tired of "We Stand Shoulder to Shoulder" or whatever the official title song is, as Roo and Lumpy celebrate their friendship.  Indeed, just hearing it, my heart sort of soars.  I remember that feeling, from so long ago -- a good friend and all the world to explore together.  And I'm glad to find that in a kids' movie.
