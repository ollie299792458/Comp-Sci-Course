This film is the second in a "trilogy" that began with Star Trek II and ended with Star Trek IV. I consider these three movies to be among the greatest Star Trek stories ever told, and this one, titled, "The  Search for Spock," quite satisfyingly continues the development of the  theme first discussed by Kirk and Spock in Spock's cabin in Star Trek  II--the good of the one versus the good of the many. Spock believed that  the good of the many outweigh the good of the few or the one, and, in Star  Trek II, he sacrificed his life to save the rest of the crew. And now, in  this film, quite befittingly, the crew sacrifice their lives and their  futures to save Spock. What a beatutiful, marvelous dichotomy the writers  have presented in these two selfless acts. Early in Star Trek IV, Spock's  mother Amanda eloquently explains to her son why his human friends did what  they did. These are the things that make Star Trek great. Harve Bennett and  Nicholas Meyer, among others, deserve a great deal of credit for making  these movies the gems that they are.
To fully enjoy the concepts and  principles dealt with in Star Trek III, I recommend that the viewer also  see Star Trek II and Star Trek IV (all in numerical order, of course).
