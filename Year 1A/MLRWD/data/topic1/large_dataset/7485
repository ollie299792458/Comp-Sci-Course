Eternal Sunshine is a great movie.  I don't understand the people that are giving it one star, and passing it off as incoherent and boring.  I'm sorry Eternal Sunshine doesn't have the usual Hollywood blockbuster formula, and it's not starring your typical bottle blonde and muscular freak of nature.

Anyway, I went to pick up the DVD at Best Buy and they were out, but what I found odd was that it was in the Comedy section.  I'm not saying it's not funny, because it has it's great moments, but I think the movie is more of a drama.  It's heartfelt and it expresses to what extent someone will go to for love.

The story is set in Long Island with Clementine (Winslet) and Joel (Jim) meeting on the train, an extremely quirky relationship then blossoms.  Joel and Clementine's relationship isn't perfect, but what relationship is?  They argue and fight, with one or the other getting blamed for being overdramatic or having no feelings.

Joel then finds out that Clementine has had every single memory of him erased from her mind.  He decides to do the same, and while he's receiving the treatment he realizes how much he really does love her despite the differences they have had.

The movie is very fast paced from then on, and it just goes to show what lengths some people will go to for love, whether it be trying to get over the pain of a breakup, or trying to keep the love alive.

So ignore all the one star voters and keep in mind that if someone thinks that a movie doesn't make sense, they're most likely not intelligent enough to grasp ideas that aren't spoon fed to them.
