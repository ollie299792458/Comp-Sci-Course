I don't think I can add any more information about the wonderful story itself in light of all the superlative reviews found here.  If you've seen it, you know it's a classic that is definitely worth owning, to be viewed and enjoyed repeatedly.  If you've never seen Babette's Feast, you owe it to yourself to see it and find out what people mean when they say they experience a film.  Yes, it's that good and that powerful.  And the best part of it all: no guns, no explosions, no sex, no vulgarity. 
The DVD is, without a doubt, THE format for this movie.  The print has been considerably cleaned up and brightened.  What a difference with my "old" fuzzy VHS copy!  The widescreen format benefits this film tremendously.  The sound is crisp and even, with no sudden drops or surges in volume.  The DVD offers three language tracks: the original Danish/French, English, and Spanish.  I personally recommend that you keep the Danish/French track with English subtitles.  It's the only real way to convey the full meaning and emotions of the story.  Avoid the English track at all costs: it's unbelievably bland and emotionless (thereby removing any and all subtleties and charm from this superb story) and it's muffled.  I did not check out the Spanish track.  
Worth much more than "just" 5 stars!
