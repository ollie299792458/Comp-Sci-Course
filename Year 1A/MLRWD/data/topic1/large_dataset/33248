From the opening scene in which a man loses a kidney simply because of a sexual urge to the closing credits, this movie is awesome.  What can I say about a film that turns my stomach in the first scene and yet compells me to keep watching.  
This movie brings out the question of whether a glass is half empty or half full.  While some reviews call this movie "dark", depressing and disburbing, I saw something totally different.  I saw a beautiful love story--an intense and almost obsessive LOVE story and there really isn't anything dark or depressing about love.  
The visual aspects of this film and the story have so many layers and so many "stories".  The question "what's real and what isn't" can be asked throughout the film.  The bartender, the homeless man, and the main characters are all stories within stories within stories.  
There is great mystery as the stories unfold as to who or what the new object of Charlie's really is.  Is he the man Charlie fantasized about while still with his lover?  Is he the man Charlie wants to pursue to take his dead lover's place?  Little by little the so called truth is revealed.  
Cutting back and forth between the grassy field and the "white" apartment builds the intensity of the film as we learn the final fate of the killer.  
This entire film is about love and the lengths a person goes to in order to honor that love and move on.  
I saw this film 7 times while it was in theaters and it was the first movie on DVD I purchased.  This is the type of film I want to watch over and over to catch every little nuance because for some reason I believe this movie is so well made and the story so strong and therefore there are valuable lessons to be learned.
