I thought this movie was actually quite enjoyable, and far better than the previous three. That probably has something to do with the fact that Depp's "Jack Sparrow" was the only character I really liked from the other films -- this is mercifully free of the love triangle that was so key to the others. It is just as full of bold adventure and outrageous stunts (some parts of this movie feel like little more than a series of elaborate, bizarre stunts) as the first, however. So be sure to watch this with your grip of reality loosed!

The movie (some spoilers) centers around a quest to find the fountain of youth. As with the other movies, these mythical things aren't just "find this and all your problems are gone"...there's a darker element here as well. Cue in monstrous mermaids, nefarious ne'er-do-wells, wicked wastrels, and our favorite pansy pirate. ;)

All in all, this was an enjoyable film. Jack Sparrow is much as he ever was -- an almost loveable-ish rogue -- and the story is what you'd expect from this series. 4/5 stars for a fun, though utterly silly, film
