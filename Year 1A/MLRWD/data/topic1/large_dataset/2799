First of all I am a huge Sergio Leone fan and I think he is one of the greatest directors in cinema history. His movies evoke such powerful emotion from the characters, who are all extremely believable. Something else great about Mr. Leone is the scenery in the background and foreground. His western films feature such beautiful landscape. "Duck, You Sucker" is no exception. I think its one of his best (possibly better than "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," IMHO).  The chemistry between the Steiger and Coburn characters is exceptional, and both actors shine in their roles:  Steiger as the dirty, vulgar peasant, and Coburn as the Irish revolutionary on-the-run, with a shady, tortured past.

Something that distinguishes this film from Leone's others is the villain. The "villains" in this movie truly have minor parts, one being a hated President, and the other being a creepy military leader.  They really aren't that comparable to Henry Fonda in "Once Upon a Time in the West" or Lee Van Cleef in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." In my opinion, the actual villain in this movie is the oppressive government, which Steiger and Coburn are fighting against.

The 2 Disc Spec. Edition of this movie has great picture and sound quality, and it also has some nice documentaries/featurettes.  This version is definitely an R-rated version, so if you are offended by a dozen or so f-words and some blood, buy the 1 disc version, which is apparently more clean.
Overall great product, 5/5 stars.
