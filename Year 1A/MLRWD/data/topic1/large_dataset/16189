This is a good movie, not great, but good.  It has a plot where you are wondering how the Chief of Police from a small town of 1800 can get himself into such a big mess and try to cover his tracks while his estranged wife is investigating the supposed murder of the chiefs girl friend.
Chief Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is constantly on the move, whether he is shacking up with his high school sweetheart or running after the money she connived him out of.
There are a few twists in the movie, enough to surprise you.  Whitlock attempts to stay one step ahead of his Detective Whitlock (Mendes) and you sometimes are left wondering how he did it.  There is interplay with these two characters, she still has feelings for her husband, yet, you are left wondering why she left him in the first place.
There are some interesting plays between characters, Chae, Whitlocks Medical examiner and friend.  For some reason, everyone is loyal to Whitlock.  You wonder if this is the first time he has been in trouble and what he has done to maintain the loyalty of his friends and co-workers.
I would recommend seeing the Profiles of the Characters before you see the DVD.  The profiles are a good introduction to the movie and gives a good foundation to build on.  
This movie is worth viewing, however, the scenes between Washington and Lathan were a little too drawn out and could have been aluded to in order to broaden the range of viewers and viewer appeal.
The trailers did not give the story away, so I was surprised at the plot and movie overall.  It is a good watch, and worth the time if you want to be entertained.
The DVDs outtakes are weak, only two, and added because they had to be.  I wondered if they were staged so they could have outtakes.  
In the end, should he keep the money or not??  What would you do?
