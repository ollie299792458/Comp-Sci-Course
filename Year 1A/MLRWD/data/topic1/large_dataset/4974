I took a chance ordering my first DVD series about the power and glory of Rome.  I felt it would be an excellent idea for my family to gain a complete perspective about the Roman Empire.  I understood it was not going to have the same quality of "The Passion" or the blood and hoopla of "Braveheart," however, I was expecting to get an excellent historical perspective about the splendor and magnificence of Rome, the greatest empire of the World. 
Instead, my family viewed a hodgepodge of ruins, black and white blurred segments, 'candy-coated' imagery to soften the senses (the hysteria and shock could not be absorbed as to how Rome really functioned on a daily basis) and colossal amounts of repetitive film clips that became so nauseating that the narrative, in audio, intellectually overwhelmed the content presented on video.
There was some beautiful footage of the countryside and fleeting glimpses of grandeur sprinkled throughout the series, but the splicing and cuts shut down any momentum.  Regrettably, even the documentary got repetitive.  Several comments were contradictory.  Important aspects of Roman society were utterly dismissed, ignored or avoided.  Many statements were biased, misrepresented and utterly false!
For example, the narrative claims that the Barbarians and other cultures were more sadistic and treacherous than the Romans.  Let us use some common sense!  On the admission of the narrators, the Romans were embedding for centuries the fine art of sadism and treachery...while the video is showing repetitive scenes of earlier periods from Disc 1, 2 3 and 4.
I was not very comfortable with the comparisons made between America and Rome.  In fact, it was confusing without deeper analysis. Some incredible comparisons were made, but like many comments given on other subjects on the DVD, they needed to be backed up with evidence, proof and further discussion.
