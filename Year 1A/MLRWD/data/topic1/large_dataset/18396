Whoever is a huge Batman fan might feel disgusted with this garbage. A total insult like my title states it to whoever was expecting anything better than this. It trully takes a complete moron (I'm being nice here) to actually flip everything that started with the original one with this crap. The music which was changed from Elfman to whoever sucks. The acting is laughable making Batman look like if his character was based pretty much like Spider-Man when he's supposed to be mysterious and serious, kinda like what Keaton did, the original Batman. The script sucks and so does the plot. Uma Thurman looks very very sexy but still that won't save this from the humiliation, being part of the worst film ever based on a super heroe, character and up to including ever made. There is no reason to own this, not even if you're a Batman fan (which would be the worst thing to do). Get the first two movies with director Tim Burton and Michael Keaton being the original Batman. This deserves to be burned and the director deserves to be beaten up. What a complete waste of time and money this was for me when I went to see it at the theater.
