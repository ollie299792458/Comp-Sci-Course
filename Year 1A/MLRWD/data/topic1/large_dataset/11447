In just one hour and thirty-five minutes one can be transfixed into such a state of movie bliss that the possibilities of any other earthly delight becomes squashed like a lima bean, becomes swatted like a lowly, little fly.  Yes, movie heaven has reached a platform quite unlike anything before or since with the outstandingly gory release of "An American Werewolf in London" on DVD.  Yes, we have reached our zenith, we have made lift off, we will not explode in the sky on some strange, Februaric morning.  The closing of our caskets could never eclipse this movie, art to its height, art for art's sake, Paterian philosophising, even, yes indeed, overt, disgusting pontificating to a degree that can only be described as foul.  Eureka!  I have found it!  Help me God!  I have sinned and the pound of flesh will be repeat viewings of this cinematic masterpiece.  Hail! Hail! John Landis, my earthly King.  Hail!  And let bygones be sitting in the back seats of our El Caminos, endlessly swerving into mini-marts and "gas and sips" across the USA.
