As you're probably well aware (since everyone was talking about this movie a few years ago) Teeth is about a teenage girl who has actual teeth deep inside of her private parts.  This means whenever a sexually active young man wants to have sex with her, you can probably guess what happens to his ding dong and the agony that soon follows.  The best scene however, is the one that involves the doctor doing an examination that is, shall we say, a little *too* thorough!

Anyway there's numerous other problems with this girl and especially her dysfunctional family.  Her father is timid, her mother is physically weak and dying of something that was never made clear, and her brother is the biggest jerk ever.  Well apparently the teeth inside the girls private area grow stronger and hungrier over time, and yeah, the hunger reaches a point of STRONG desirable lust towards men.

It's a whacky concept, but a daring and original one too.  Overall the pacing is really slow-moving and quiet but that's probably the charm of the movie.  The storyline is probably slightly undeveloped.  I mean the girl DID have a few scenes where she was crying because she was overly concerned this problem would only escalate and she didn't know how to stop it, but nothing serious or conclusive ever came of it.  The ending is pretty good but it's also how I thought things would wrap up.  Nothing surprising about the ending at all.

Well it is how it's described, haha.  Nothing's really offensive.  Well I mean, other than the chopping and massacring of susceptible dingalings.  An original concept elevates the overall rating to a 4 out of 5 but come on, this can't possibly be a 5-star movie!
