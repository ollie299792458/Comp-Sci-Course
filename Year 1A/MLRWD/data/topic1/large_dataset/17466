The negative reviews about this movie are way too harsh. Sure, this 1976 remake did not need the sexual undertones that it had. And yes, the beard that Jeff Bridges was sporting was pretty nasty (ick). But this movie really was GREAT for it's time. Remember all the sweet moments between Jessica Lange and Kong? How about when Kong took her to the waterfall to rinse her off? Or how about when Kong was causing a ruckus in the oil tank and she felt compelled to go to him and when she did she said..."Hey Kong, remember me, your blind date?". And how about at the end when she was screaming to Kong... DON'T PUT ME DOWN!!! DON'T PUT ME DOWN!!! They'll kill you!!!". That will bring tears to anyone's eyes! This was a great movie for 1976.  I think Peter Jackson may have fibbed just a bit. He claims that his phenomenal remake is solely based on the 1933 classic with Fay Wray. Really? Well, if you recall, Fay Wray was terrified of Kong from the moment she was sacrificed to Kong until the moment he was killed. It was Jessica Lange that started the caring for Kong thing in this remake of King Kong.  Jessica Lange did a wonderful job! Especially since it was her very first movie ever! I absolutely LOVE the latest King Kong remake with Naomi Watts! Then again, Hollywood has come a long way since 1933 and 1976. So please, cut this version some slack. It was a wonderful movie for it's time and still makes my eyes fill up to this day. And after seeing all three incarnations of King Kong, I think it's safe to say that Peter Jackson got some inspiration from this version and Jessica Lange.
