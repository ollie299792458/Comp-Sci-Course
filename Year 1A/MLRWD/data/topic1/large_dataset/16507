When this movie came out, the local paper's review was scathing. The critic said that the theater had the "distinct smell of 'moms basement'". He also attempted to compare Hitman to the Bourne series. The movie was not intended to even come close to rivaling the genius of Robert Ludlum. What truly annoyed me about the critics of this movie was that they seemed completely unaware of the existence of the video games that the movie is based on.

Personally, I really enjoyed the movie. Its the only movie on my iPod, and it never ceases to be entertaining. There are shoot outs with fully automatic weapons, explosions, a hot russian chick, and some brutal fight scenes. Maybe the plot isnt as deep and complicated as one of the Bourne movies, but its still entertaining.

Its far more entertaining to fans of the game series. There are things in the movie that you appreciate more if you have played the games that other people wont see. When I first heard that a movie was in the works, and that Vin Diesel was being considered for the lead role, I cringed. Too many steroids and he is too easily mocked to be a decent action star. I think they chose well for the lead role.

Anyway, in short, its a fun movie, and i think it looks amazing on Bluray.
