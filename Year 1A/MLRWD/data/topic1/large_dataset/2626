I saw this movie when it first came out, and it marks the beginning of my fascination with the game of poker. I notice that they are releasing a "collector's edition" with commentary from poker pros - I can't wait!

Matt Damon plays a law student who - sort of like his character in "Good Will Hunting" - can figure out the hand of everyone at the table using some kind of mathematical or intuitive genius.

However, he can't seem to figure out that his relationship with Ed Norton, his old best buddy who has just been released from jail, will be the end of him. The two get involved in the seedy dark side of big-stakes, late night, semi-illegal poker, while Ed runs up huge debts to a seriously bad guy that Matt becomes obligated to pay off.

The tension builds as Matt tries to gamble his way to a significant stake, so he can fulfill his long-time dream of going to Vegas to play with the pros.

The acting is good, the story is captivating and the poker is fun. And I am addicted to "Celebrity Poker Showdown" because of this movie!
