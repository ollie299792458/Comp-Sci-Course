Double Indemnity is a film to introduce to the post Baby Boomer generations, sharing it in such a way that illustrates that sharing it is as vital and natural as sharing The Facts of Life.  The youth of today will never understand what really good Film-making is until they see a film that has a solid story, genuinely inspired direction, and nothing short of tour de force acting by the likes of more than mere stars like Robinson, Stanwyck, and MacMurray....In viewing this utterly brilliant movie over and over again, I find myself choosing and re-choosing favorite bits, not unlike a jewelry lover in a huge jewelry emporium; it's all so good that I don't really know how to choose.  Well, here's one scene that I think of often: The look on Walter's face after Phyllis' stepdaughter unknowingly rocks his world with revelations that threaten to forcibly disengage his fragile grip on a new life that is vanishing as if by osmosis.  MacMurray is remarkable here; you literally see in his eyes trust, and the deep mistrust born of betrayal "duking it out" like boxers in a ring, with denial acting like a referee all the while... This is the most fascinating must-see film of a lifetime.  Enough said.
