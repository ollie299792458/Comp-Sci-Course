"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" is a classic that never grows old! Charlie Brown, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy and the rest of the Peanuts gang gear up for another Halloween full of adventure and "tricks or treats." Oh, lets not forget the infamous football kick. As "tricks or treats" go, Lucy, Violet, &amp; Pigpen rack up and of course, poor 'ole Charles gets nothing but a bag of rocks. Sally, consumed by her love for Linus, decides to skip "tricks or treats" and sit out in the punkin' patch w/ him to catch a glimpse of the Great Pumpkin. Snoopy, a World War 1 flying ace out on his dawn patrol, ensues the Red Barron to shoot him down. After the trick or treating, it's time for the Halloween party. In the end, Sally is furious and Linus is left in disbelief as another Halloween passes by without a visit from the GP. Lucy awakes in the wee hours of the morning to find her "blockhead brother" shivering and asleep in the patch. As any big sister would do, she brings Linus in and puts him to bed. 
This 1966 Charles Shultz phenomenon is so enjoyable, I can't hardly wait for Fall each year so I can pull it out. My brother and I grew up watching this every year. Call me a grown-up kid, but it gives me such a warm, cozy feeling inside. Brings back those cherished memories of being a child and the excitment that Halloween always brought. I can't wait until my nephew is old enough to discover "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown."  Another wonderful joy is the music of Vince Guaradli. As with all the Peanuts cartoons, he composed and performed all of the musical scores. The world of jazz is opened to all who listen and watch. "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" is one of those simple little joys in life, as are "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" and "A Charlie Brown Christmas." If you don't own them, get them. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed! I just love it!
