I'm sure that you can find more thorough exploration of the details
and reviews about the movie la strada at [...], so I'll keep my
comments brief.  I love this movie.  I found Giulietta Masina's
performance as Gelsomina subtle, yet powerfull.  Anthony Quinn's
performance fits the role well, without the overbearing presence
found in many of his performances, so don't let his inclusion as
a lead actor turn you away; his performance is spot on.

The film tells a hauntingly poignant story of the development of
a relationshiop between the one man traveling circus played by Quinn,
and his acquired sidekick of Gelsomina.  I won't give away the
ending other than to say that it was deeply emotional and
very satisfying.  This movie set me thinking about life and
my choices in relationships for a few days; there are some
powerful messages and subtly provocative questions presented.

I fell in love with this movie and it is on my 10 best movies list.
I imagine however that it is a movie that you either love or hate;
there are likely few inbetweener's.  The performances in this movie
are excellently understated, and it is a moving story.

If you're interested in Fellini, Italian cinema, or foreign movies in
general, this is a good place to start.
