30 minutes or less is an awesome comedy. It features Jesse Eisenberg, danny McBride, and 2 very funny comedians, Aziz Ansari and Nick Swardson. It is also directed by the talented Ruben Fleischer. One thing great about the movie is the acting. All of the actors have great chemistry. A lot of people complained and said that the characters are not like real people. Well, I guess it's true, but they're not completley fake. Like the character Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) seems real, and is someone I can relate to. Chet (Aziz Ansari) isn't exrtremeley realistic, but feels like someone who has the same reactions to the situation as any normal person would. And lastly, Nick Swardson and Danny McBride's charters are hilarious. You can tell they both have a great chemistry working with eachother. It's so fun watching them pull improv off of eachother. And Michael Pena, who plays the character Chango. He was suprisingly hilarious too. Other than the cast, the action scenes were fun. One is the beginning, and the other is the car chase scene. You can tell Ruben Fleischer dircted it, because of the almost slow-motion, similiar to Zombieland. This Bluray is great too. It has a nice video and audio quality. The picture in picture video commentary was also a great touch. It's cool seeing the actors watch the film. All around, "30 Minutes or Less" on bluray gets a 5/5!!!!!
