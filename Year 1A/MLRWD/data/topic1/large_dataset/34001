"The Bad News Bears" is a heartfelt, poignant movie about how one man comes to find redemption through that most hallowed of American institutions, little league baseball. The film is anchored by Walther Matthau who is perfectly cast as Morris Buttermaker, a washed up ex-minor league pitcher frittering away what is left of his life cleaning pools in suburban southern California. He agrees to coach a little league baseball team to make a few extra bucks.

All Buttermaker wants to do is show up, drink beer and collect his money. His attitude changes, however, as he watches his team get laughed at and humiliated by the little league "powers that be." He decides that he is not going to stand by and watch his players start down the same path to nowhere he has taken.

Matthau is supported by a great cast including first and foremost, the child actors fronted by Tatum O'Neal as the daughter of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriend. The kids pull off the difficult task of portraying the collection of misfits, social outcasts and ner-do-wells as both obnoxious and yet endearingly innocent and charming all at the same time.

Vic Morrow is excellent as the coach of the Bear's archenemies the Yankees. The scene where he forces his pitcher son to intentionally walk Engelburg, the kid he most wishes to strike out, is one of the most powerful in any movie about children, sports, and a "win at all costs" attitude. Joyce Van Patten is also wonderful as the annoying busybody who runs the league.

Overall "The Bad News Bears" is a terrific movie not just as a nostalgia trip for those like myself who grew up playing little league in the '70's but also for its positive message. I highly recommend it.
