I own the DVD of this film, and was looking to add it to my Kindle film collection, as well. I've seen the film several times, and find it an excellent film, entertaining, compelling, and thought provoking on so many levels; and the symbolism alone makes it worth viewing, as well as the wonderful and human portrayals of the characters by the superbly talented cast. And while the story is fictional and based on the novel 'The Haunting of Toby Jugg' by Dennis Wheatley, this historical time period of the story is presented so vividly that you feel transported back in time.

While some may find the symbolism and plot twists confusing, making it difficult to ascertain the stories truths, as it fluxes between reality and perceptions of reality, upon the first viewing of the film, if you give the film a chance, truly look at it more than once, listen carefully to the dialogue, and pay close attention to the visuals, the stories truths and meanings, as well as the reality itself of what is really happening, become apparent.

And, for any doubters out there as to Robert Pattinson's acting ability, this film proves he is more than just a handsome face known for his role as Edward Cullen, in the 'Twilight Saga' films. If you need further proof that this young man has talent as an actor, I'd also recommend 'Little Ashes,' in which he plays Salvador Dali the eccentric artist, and 'Remember Me,' which he co-produced as well, and 'Water For Elephants.'

I teach cinema, as well as literature and I'd highly recommend this and the other films I've mentioned.
