As a lover of classic, classy, well-made movies that are hardly every made anymore with a story as huge as life - I've been waiting for THE BIG COUNTRY to arrive on Blu-ray for at least 2 years.

The only reason I ask this question here at Amazon is because this classic has the release date (on blu-ray) of May 24, 2011.

The following was borrowed from a well-respected internet hi-def site simply called HighDefDigest.com (bluray.highdefdigest.com/4918/big_country.html):
