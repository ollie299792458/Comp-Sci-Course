An amazing gem of a film.  "You Can Count On Me" is an incredible story about loss, familial love, coping with one's own failings, and being alone.  The acting is so well done, I was drawn into and held in the story.  Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo embody their characters so completely, the actors melt away.  Matthew Broderick and Jon Tenney play equally engrosing support roles.

The film overall is artful and well-conceived.  The soundtrack complements the sometimes whistful, sometimes brutally honest, sometimes playful tone of the whole film.

Probably one of the most striking elements of Lonergan's movie is how true-to-life the stories maintain.  The characters remind us of our own flaws: our inconsistencies (despite our efforts), our floundering attempts to cope with our lot and our failings, wrestling with somehow finding ourselves alone.  The remind us of our own desires: to simply be happy, to love and be loved.  And in the end, follow our truest sense of direction in life.

One of the best movies I've ever seen.  THE best film I've ever seen about coping with being in an modern American family.
