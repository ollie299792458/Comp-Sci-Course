the reason your getting this obviously is that youve seen this show on sci-fi and found it entertaining... now the only difference i found between this and the broadcast version is the sound is a par fuzzy... sometimes you need to turn the tremble/bass down a bit to make the sound a little easier to understand when the fellas are talking loudly... but on the most part its not too terrible...

visually its pretty good but a little pixelated during night/dark room scenes, but you have to take into consideration that these sets are giving you 4 dvds for $20 dollars...

If you wanted a remastered video/audio edition, youd probably be paying the price of other seasons of tv shows that are in the mid $50 dollar range...

so i just try to not be to complantive about things and enjoy the show for its substance...

its worth the price and very entertaining... so i highly suggest picking up a copy so when season 3 is finished we fans can get the next season on dvd...

hope i helped you decide on this...
