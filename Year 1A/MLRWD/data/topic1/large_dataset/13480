Charles Bronson (Chato) is one of my favorite actors. Something about the way he carries any role makes the movies he's in so much fun to watch.  From Death wish to the dozens of 'supporting' roles he maintains the gentle but tough man.  Not many can carry that off.  Jack Palance plays Quincey Whitmore, a former Confederate soldier who feels for some reason it's his obligation to track down and capture Chato.  Three brothers go with Palance to track Chato and the brotherly sparring and converstion between them really fills out their characters and in some cases is really funny and fun to watch.  The overall plot is that Chato is being hunted for shooting a white man (sort of self defense) so because Chato is indian, Palance and his rag tag posse chase him through the desert and plains of indian country.  The locations and scenery is excellent.  The posse is no match for Chato in his home land but they continue chasing and in some ways become the hunted instead of the hunters.  This is one of Bronson's best movies.  His screen presence, look, and mannerism make this an excellent choice for all who enjoy good westerns, movies with a subtle message, and a chance to see the little 'right' guy come out okay.
