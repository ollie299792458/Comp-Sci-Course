This is the most horrible remake I have ever found.  I assumed the English version could be close to the German version of Wings of Desire and was completely wrong.  This movie is the worst waste of film I have ever found!  The whole trench coat angel thing that was so critical to Wings of Desire made no sense in sunny hot Los Angeles.  The characters were massacred to fit into Los Angeles but none of the obvious things that would not fit in Los Angeles were touched.  This movie is way too much Hollywood with over exaggerated romance and of course death at the end.  I nearly died too.  It was sappy as Hell and even as a girl, too much for me.  It was too typical Hollywood with exaggerated romance, a stupid sex scene and death.  Wim Wenders is not Hollywood and thank God for it.  The cast of Wings of Desire took so much care with every element of the film.  The City of Angels cast just shot out their lines in a brainless manner without though of the big picture.  Maybe a complete redo of the whole Wings of Desire concept could have saved this movie.  Changing some parts and keeping others made for a horrible boring and annoying combination.  One star is being generous!
