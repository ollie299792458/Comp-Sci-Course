Hesher ia an indie film that brings out a vastly different Joseph Gotdon-Levitt. He is a wild manic/pyromaniac/wise guy who despite his bizarre behavior, attempts to pull a neurasthenic deeply depressed husband and a bullied and confused son out of grieving the loss of their mother and wife. Almost like a wild-eyed Jesus with shoulder-length hair, Hesher is given to loud metal music, smoking cigarettes and marijuana when and wherever he wants, foul-mouthed, dressed and undressed, Hesher moves in on the family unit. What a huge difference from his previous clean-cut character in "Inception" and the shy, introverted role in "(500 Days of Summer." He unleashes his raging uncouth self steeped in destruction and stark anger. Also featured in another turn is a meek bespectacled grocery cashier played Natalie Portman. What a difference from her luminous balletic award-winning "Black Swan." Piper Laurie plays the sweet and very ill coping grandmother whose demeanor reminded me of a frustrated Doris Roberts. This is so far from her early role as the murderously sanctimninous mother in "Carrie." I was so very impressed how these fine talented actors prove that they can portray such a wide depth of characterization. I highly recommend "Hesher," which had poor and limited indie art-house distribution. This is not your usual adventure, rom-com, or mystery/horror commercial film.
