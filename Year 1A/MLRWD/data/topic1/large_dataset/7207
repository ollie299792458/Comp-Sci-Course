Based on the 1970s TV series, S.W.A.T. is a great story with just enough action to keep you going, without overdoing it.
Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) are partners on the Los Angeles Special Weapons and Tactics team. When a successful hostage rescue results in a lawsuit for the department, hot-head Gamble quits the force while Street accepts a demotion, hoping for a 2nd chance. That 2nd chance comes in the form of Lt. Dan "Hondo" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), a departmental war horse assigned to restore the division's reputation. He hand-picks a new team with Street as its top dog. The other members include Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez of Blue Crush and The Fast and the Furious); David "Deek" Kay (Rapper L.L. Cool J); T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles of Dead Poet's Society); and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt of Basic and Windtalkers). Throughout their training period, we get to know a bit about each team member. Their individual personalities really come to life.
Meanwhile, a French criminal kingpin named Alex Montel, played by Oliver Martinez ("Unfaithful"), is caught and imprisoned, and offers $100 million to anyone who can help him escape. The Team is now up against a bunch of money-hungry LA mercenaries which will include some familiar faces.
Great action movie. Naturally, most scenes are stolen by the legendary Samuel L. Jackson and the young, hot, Irish actor Colin Farrell. But the other team members shine as well and add so much to the team and the film. Definitely worth it.
