The movie was fun.  It's not great and it's not a must see.  It's just fun.  The scenery is fantastic and the acting is pretty good.  If you like Sci-Fi / Fantasy then you will enjoy this.  If not, then probably not.  It's a shame that a sequel will not be made.  Also, I do not understand the fury over billing this as an anti religous movie.  Opponents tried to paint this as a picture (and book series) aimed at convincing children that religion is silly and bad and that all intelligent people should be atheists.  Perhaps I don't try hard enough to find messages in movies - I sit back and enjoy them - but the anti religion aspect on this movie seems like quite a reach.  This will no more corrupt your children than Harry Potter. Personally, I think the true hatred of this movie by religous supporters stems from the fact that the author of the series is a confirmed atheist and they don't want to see him succeed and / or gain any type of forum.  My belief is to each their own and I would have loved to see a sequel.  Although, I must say studios are generally bloodsuckers so I'm guessing they quashed a sequel not out of pressure from the Vatican or religous advocates but rather because they felt like it wouldn't be profitable.  I'm sure if they could make money from it, they would do it in a heartbeat.  To me there is some irony that the same parents who were duped into keeping their children away from this movie are the same parents who allow their children to worship all things Harry Potter much like my generation worshipped all things Star Wars!

P.S. I grew up worshipping Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars and have enjoyed Harry Potter in the last decade.  Somehow I didn't turn out to be an atheist.
