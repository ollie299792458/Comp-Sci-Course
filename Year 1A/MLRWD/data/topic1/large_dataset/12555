I saw it about 10 times already. It's unbelievable, but i do find always something new in it. I would like to see it again with all my life experience growed during those 5 years, but i want to see it for the FIRST time again. This is the case where the time travel would be helpful. There is something you could call "charming" in this movie. The whole story is just beautiful (you'll need to watch it several times before you'll really like it however). Every single moment is something different you find attractive, (well, at least i do). I like Willis in 5th Element and in Die Hard, and in Blind Date, but James Cole by him is something special. Same is about Brad Pitt, - special starring in 12Monkeys. The quality of montage and sound editing; Cole trying to escape from the hospital- just get real drunk and try to get out your own house to understand how brilliant was this scene filmed. And the music. It's not a background - i never saw such a simbiose of the music and the movie anymore. The main theme (based on Piazzolla's Punta del Este) made me start listening and love this great composer's music. I show this title to everyone i like, and i always find a lot about the person by their reaction. Most of them like it.
