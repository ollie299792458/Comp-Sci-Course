I  have seen all 4 "Highlander" movies (including "Endgame").  I just re-watched 1 and 2, and finally saw 3 yesterday. So I know what I'm talking about when I say "Highlander 2 Renegade Version" NEVER HAPPENED.

  I have not seen the original "Highlander 2" so I can't really compare  this version to that. This version does have a pamphlet that  explains the changes made in each scene, so I have an understanding of  what the original version was like. So I feel I can safely say that both versions  should not exist.

  Here's the thing. The plot of "Highlander 2"  contradicts both "Highlander" and "Highlander 3".  It acts as if the first movie never happened.  For  instance, Conner and Ramirez's interactions took place in Scotland in the first movie. In this movie, they  are somehow  in  a desert place in the distance past. This obviously never happend. Plus,

a character dies in the first movie that is somehow alive in this one. And I mean REALLY dies, as in head cut off. Also, it is said that Brenda, from the first movie, died of radiation poisoning. In Highlander 3, it is said she died in a car crash.

  As a matter of fact, there is no mention of the events from "Highlander 2" in "Highlander 3". Actually, "Highlander 3" seems to take place right after "Highlander". There are references to the first movie, and as I said, none to the second. In fact, you really could skip "Highlander 2" all together and go straight to 3. And that is what I seriously suggest you do. "Highlander 3" flows seemlessly from the original, making you wonder why it wasn't  number 2 instead. It's as if "Highlander 2" never existed.......oh, wait. It dosn't.
