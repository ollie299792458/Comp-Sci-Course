This is not a review of the series, which in my opinion is the greatest Crime Drama ever made.  As for the VERY long-awaited DVD release, I've been Very disappointed.  Stated in the fine print on the boxes, unfortunately Paramount/CBS decided to offer us an INCOMPLETE (missing episode(s)) and EDITED collection.  In addition, it's NOT-SO-SHARPLY "remastered".  Compared to broadcast recordings, it doesn't appear to be remastered at all to me.  I'm sure that Jack Lord, being the perfectionist he was about this show, would NOT approve.

If I like a show enough to want to collect it and to pay hundreds of $$$ for it, I expect a few minimum basic qualities.  Those are:  EVERY EPISODE, UNEDITED, and digitally remastered at least to the resolution at which it is noticeably clearer than my own recordings.  This collection is missing all of those essential qualities.  So it seems VERY expensive to shell-out ($36 x 12 Seasons == $432) for it when I can record the same thing free.  It's kind-of insulting for Paramount to offer an INCOMPLETE collection at that price.

Unless you don't get re-runs (you'd have to live in Mongolia) and you just can't wait to see the edited episodes they chose to include, it may be well worth just waiting another 2 years or so for the inevitable boxed set.  Of course, a series this popular, will be offered in a boxed set (and for Half that price) after they've exhausted all the individual season sales, as we've seen every Christmas with even less popular series.  Those always include "Previously Unreleased Episodes", "(Complete) Director's Cuts", and "High Resolution Digital Remastering", etc. to compel even those who paid $432 for these first cuts, to buy it too - Exactly what they're withholding from this collection.  And they always come packaged in some collectible tin or box.  Maybe a die-cast Mercury in this case.

* UPDATE 2/5/09 :: MISSING SCENES - THE EDITS INCLUDE CONTENT *
******************************************************
Paramount has told us they've further edited these.  So it hasn't been a surprise that I've noticed quite a bit throughout.  Just for examples I'll point out a few I noticed recently while watching 6 sequential episodes.  This is not intended to be a complete list or recount of details.

1) Ep: "Forty Feet High and it Kills!" Scene: A humorous back & forth between Wo Fat and the Quirky Professor in which Wo Fat confronts the professor regarding his deliberate attempts to foil "Mr. Fat's" machination in the on-going game of mental chess between the two.

2) Ep: "A Bullet for McGarrett" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

3) Ep: "The Singapore File" Scene: McGarrett outruns Victor in a car chase, then tensely negotiates, without his ID/papers, for passage on a ship from Singapore.
