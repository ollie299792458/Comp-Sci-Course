This was the first film that the Coen Brothers released after their wildly popular 1996 hit "Fargo", which was a huge success from both a critical and commercial viewpoint.  Unfortunately, it didn't garner the reviews and press that it deserved, and was a box office disappointment.  Deservingly, it seems to have found a second life as a cult film, and has even spawned an annual gathering of fans of the file called Lebowski Fest.
The plot is deceptively simple, as suggested by the description on the box - a hippie that's down on his luck gets mistaken for a billionaire with the same name as his by a couple of thugs, who "soil" his rug after he doesn't automatically comply with their demands.  He goes to the home of the billionaire Jeffrey Lebowski hoping to be compensated for his soiled rug, and what follows is absolute insanity - the film is punctuated by several eccentric characters and the clever dialogue that has become associated with all Coen films.  Some have said that this movie is pointless, but I think of it as being ambiguous and open to interpretation.  This movie has the rare achievement of being at once simple and complex.  The Dude is so leisurely and laid back, Walter is the confrontational member of the group, and Donny is the mild-mannered introvert - part of this movie's appeal is that it's easy to relate to the character ... either you know someone that displays similar behavior to one of these characters, or maybe even you have the similarities.  John Turturro (Jesus) steals pretty much every scene he's in - I just wish they would have built up more of an on-screen rivalry than they did. 
All told, this is one of the most innovative and original films that has come out in the past few decades, comedic or otherwise.  I can't recommend it enough.
