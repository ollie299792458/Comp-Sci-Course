"Night of the Creeps" is one of my favorite horror-comedy films.  It came out in 1986, when I was a senior in high school, and due to a lot of the in-jokes with the film character names and just the volume of eminently quotable movie lines, swiftly became very popular with my group of friends.  It was often on Showtime or Cinemax later, and then it just...disappeared, having never received a wide release on video.  One of the most memorable things about "Creeps" for me was that one of the lead actors was portrayed as having a physical disability, which was rarely, if ever, seen in film.

But we 80's kids never forget, and finally we're getting "Creeps" on DVD, and even Blu-Ray!  If you recognize the male lead, Jason Lively, but can't place him, it's because he was "Rusty Griswold" in 'European Vacation.'

Fun fact:  "Night of the Creeps" and "Gossip Girl" are related!  Jason Lively is Blake Lively's half-brother, per IMDB.

Oh, and don't confuse "Night of the Creeps" with "Night of the Comet."  Although both are cheesy, "Creeps" is far superior.
