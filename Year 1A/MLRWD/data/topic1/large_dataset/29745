I truly can understand other reviewers negative comments about this film.  Unfortunately, the film industry has been putting out heaps of [stuff] like "The Fast and the Furious" and "XXX".  However, unlike those movies, Swordfish isn't a [poor] teen flick that makes you feel retarded after watching it.  I mean, this film has some definitely interesting ideas about dealing with terrorism.  Ironically, made before 9/11, Swordfish involves a black ops agent who acquires the help of a hacker who's down on his luck.  Mayhem soon follows as Hugh Jackman's character realizes the kind of mess he's gotten himself into.  I gave this film 5 stars because I actually apprecieted the fact that the characters were comprised of thirty something actors.  These days, Hollywood tries too freaking much to appeal to teenagers by having films featuring meat heads like Vin Disel.  Plus, in a wierd way, this movie stands out for me since there's sort of no real qoute on qoute "bad guy" in this film.  The director of Swordfish also did the incredibly awful "Gone in 60 Seconds".  However, he definitely makes up for it with this movie.  Take the time to watch Swordfish, for an action flick, it definitely has some interesting views about such important topics like global terrorism, which is something that's lacking in today's films.
