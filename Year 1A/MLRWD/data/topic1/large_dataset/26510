Sure - some of the boogeymen choices might have you scratching your heads but you can't resist this slickly produced DVD that's perfect for your ghoulish Halloween bash.  It's got animated menus that burn and crackle with hellfire, some great clips that'll wet any gorehound's appetite (rest assured - this disc is filled with the red stuff!), and it's just packed with ghastly facts and ferocious fun.  In classic Pop-Up Video fashion you have the choice of turning on and off special "Flix Facts" that run at the bottom of the screen during the clips.  And, if you're tired of watching the clips over and over, you can flip on the Robert Englund commentary.  Cackling like his crispy alter-ego, Englund provides running commentary THROUGH EVERY SINGLE CLIP.  A good thing and a bad thing.  He drove me a bit batty with his bad puns and Freddy-isms but if you're an Englund fan you're in for a Halloween treat that's spiked with razors.  For years we've been making horror compilation videos at home...now someone's doing it professionally.  Like our "home cut" videos, 'Boogeymen' could have used a little more work to make it just right.  But as it stands its got good intentions and a great presentation.  This disc is literally wearing its heart on its sleeve.
