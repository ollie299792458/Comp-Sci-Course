The Condemned is a WWE Films product so my expectations could not have been lower. But instead of a gory no-brainer it was surprisingly clever gorefest and very critical of the violence-driven entertainment industry; something that WWE itself is part of. Those accustomed to European movies may think it drives its message home too strongly but I was still pleasantly surprised to see that kind of thinking in a Hollywood product.

Acting ranged from fair to good and while practically most people didn't get very many lines of dialogue, they did what they could with their face time. The protagonist is a little cliched but considering it was played by Steve "Stone Cold" Austin it could have been much, much worse. The antagonists were, for the most part, delightful and the setting had more than one layer to it. Action could have benefited from less shaky-cam and more choreography but still got the adrenaline flowing.

I actually think this film tops Battle Royale, heresy though that may be and earns bonus points for having a message that runs counter to its obvious target demographic. The Condemned was a box office flop and judging from various forums, pro-wrestling fans really hate it. I guess the message struck a little too close to home.
