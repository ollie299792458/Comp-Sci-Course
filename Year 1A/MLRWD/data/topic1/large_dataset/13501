Free markets or central planning?  Hayek or Keynes?

I have seen this documentary a couple of times since it came out and found it very informative and absorbing for it's world historical/economic/political perspective.  I should say, I never look to just one source of information no matter how persuasive.

I brought it out again yesterday to watch in particular Part 3 which brought the film to it's then current times during the GW Bush administration, just after 9/11, the Seattle Summit demonstrations, and after the market collapses of Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Russia. This film was so pertinent, it could have very easily just continued on to the 2007/2008 US and world economic collapse and the devastation and adjustments that we are still living with today right up to the Summit demonstrations in Toronto.

I highly recommend this film.
