Quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I was halfway through this movie, wondering why there wasn't a single character I liked or could identify with, when I realized that Segal had somehow managed to win a bet: That he could get the Studio to finance a film with himself as the lead, send him on an extended, all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii, fund his expenses, indulge his adolescent sexual fantasies to simulate having sex with his favorite young, nubile actress, satisfy his fetish for nude exhibitionism, and generally glorify every bad habit he has, while somehow making himself the "hero" of the piece. This is just one more film in the current vein of taking a major male Loser and elevating him to some kind of icon via self-indulgence, lazyness, studpidity, cruelty, inept socialization and disgusting habits, giving all some kind of modern stamp of approval. Way to go, Segel...you pulled it off. I supposed you managed it because the Studio and the target audience are just the same sort of people that you are. Me? I wish I had my time back wasted on this garbage film.
