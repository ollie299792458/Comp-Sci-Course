This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Everything about it - acting, directing, costumes, screenplay - is absolutely stunning!

The story goes as follows: young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is hassled by an in-debt theater owner to finish writing his play.  Unfortunately, Will finds himself cursed with horrible writer's block, a problem which is further aggravated by the discovery that his muse, the fair Rosaline, is cheating on him.  Then he meets Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young woman that yearns for the theater, but is unable to follow her dreams because of the laws against women on the stage (female roles were played by young boys).  What follows is a magnificent love story complete with mistaken identities, disguises, and laugh-out-loud comedy in which Will Shakespeare finds the inspiration to write his most romantic work: "Romeo and Juliet".

Every actor is superbly cast.  Joseph Fiennes has a sort of boyish charm and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely perfect.  Both are wonderful actors that pull off the entire range of theatrical emotion (from comedy to despair) during the course of this 2 and 1/2 hour film.  Needless to say, the supporting cast (including Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Ben Affleck) is just as wonderful.  In addition: this is probably one of my favorite screenplays - it's extremely well written and has a perfect balance of comedy, romance, and tragedy.

Shakespeare in Love is completely worthy of it's seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actress).  It mixes hilarious comedy and heartfelt romance and will dispel any association between the words "Shakespeare" and "dull".

5-stars...I love this film!
