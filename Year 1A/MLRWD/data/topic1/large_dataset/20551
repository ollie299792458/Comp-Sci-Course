Fox should be ashamed of what it has done to these movies!  All eight of these movies are presented as being "wide screen".  However, for most of them this is achieved by removing the top and bottom of the old full screen image.

I compared all eight of these DVDs to the VHS releases, and found that five of the movies have been cropped to make them appear "widescreen".  The VHS formats are in a 16 x 12 ratio (the proportaions of the old-fashioned standard US TV screen).  Fox has removed the top eighth and bottom eighth of each movie to make them fill the new 16 x 9 ratio widescreen TVs.  The following five movies in this set have been cropped:  Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, Silent Movie, To Be or Not To Be, Robin Hood.  The DVDs in this set present only 3/4 of the image that was shown on the old VHS releases.
The other three (Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, History of the World, Part 1) appear to be true wide-screen releases.  The DVDs show the full picture from the VHS releases, but wider.

When will studios understand that what most buyers want is the full image of the original movie, regardless of its proportions?  Cutting part of the image to make it appear to fit your TV screen is butchering the original product.  Please do not promote this practice with the purchase of this set; wait for a proper release.
