Every one who sees this film should relate to this type of nervousness.  Everyone dates and every one has to face the parent or parents of their significant other at one time or another.  I thought this film was very good.  De niro's character is very realistic.  The movie has a lot of laughs because of the genre background of the actors.  I think Jay Roach definately knew what he was doing when he casted Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Both of these particular actors carry an opposite approach on comedy. When you put the two together you will have a hard time keeping a stright face.  Just as the actors did in the making of this genious comedy.  If you watch the extras on the dvd you will see the how hard it was for two totally different styles collaborating to bring you this type of "de ja vu" experience.  I highly recommend the purchase of this dvd to anyone.  It was all the round funny for the whole family.  Fathers, daughters, boyfriends, mothers, and even children can relate.  Nothing less than brilliant for strategic marketing.  As an actor myself i can say clearly that everyone in the film was casted perfectly.  The story is as simple as any really.  Greg Focker wants to marry his girlfriend and has to face her (ex cia agent) father.  He is gonna be very mysterious and pschological in determining whether Greg is right for his little girl or not.  Trust me, you'll love this film.  Of course at the climatic point Greg experiences nothing more than just a thorn in the Burn's eye's.  He must quickly think of solutions to capture their hearts and acceptance into the family.  Everything he does negatively turns around on him.  I dont want to spoil any more of the film, you will have to watch to see the turn-out of this hilarious addition to cinematic archives.
