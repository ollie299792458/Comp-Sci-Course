First of all, pay no attention to the *morons*...yes, let me repeat myself *morons* who wrote reviews of this dvd back in July, 2 months BEFORE this dvd version was even released. This is the real version of "Return Of The Jedi". If you are here, I won't watse time about plot spoilers. If you have a pulse, then most likely you know what this movie is about. There were several key scenes that I had to make sure were untouched by Lucas's eveil CGI crazed hands.

First off, in Jabba's Palace, no extra cgi dancers with Max Rebo's Band...all original stuff.

Second, no new tentacles or venus flytrap looking mouths with the Sarlaac Pit!

Next, when Anakin has his mask removed by Luke, Sebastian Shaw who portrays Anakin has his eyebrows back! Yah!

The Ewok celebration scene...this was the one scene that disturbed me most by George's evilness. On this version we finally have the original Ewok celebration music! Finally!

And finally, the one scene that disturbed EVERYONE is the SW Universe...the Jedi Spirits. The late great Sebastian Shaw is finally once again shown as Anakin as a Jedi Spirit! This was a change that George really should have been kicked in the head about back in '04 when de digitally erased Shaw & replaced him with a new shot of Hayden Christiansen. Anakin returned to good, a Jedi when Luke brought back the good in him, hence Shaw as the spirit. Luke had never even seen what the young Anakin looked like, so why would/could Luke even recognize a young Anakin, yet alone smile at him!?

Thank you George, this is what I've been waiting for for years...the original version of "Jedi", my personal fav in the SW series. It only took petitions & angry posts by diehard SW fans.

Just remember, the story is what makes a movie, not the fancy SFX.
