I have to agree with many of the reviewers that this Thomas movie was very disappointing.  The four new characters are extremely flat with no endearing qualities, and even Thomas was at times extremely rude and unlikable. The story telling was poor with too many cut scenes, unrealistic snenarios (an old, wooden, underwater tunnel between Sodor and Misty Island? That hasn't collapsed under the water? Really?) and annoying dialogue.

I've also seen a few reviewers remark favorably about the music, when it's actually just a rip-off of the theme from Disney's "Pirates of the Carribean." Listen closely to the opening credits. It's changed slightly, probably in hopes that no one would notice.  Is that even legal?  It's just another example of how unoriginal this entire movie was.

On the other hand... I have to admit that my 3 year old (soon to be 4) daughter loves anything Thomas, including this movie.  She laughs at the new engines while I'm cringing, and she enjoys the ending when all the engines are reunited.  And she sings and dances with the singalong "Misty Island Rescue."  This is the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of just 1.  My advice to parents: Pass on this one and buy "Hero of the Rails," which is truly heartwarming and closer to the orignal Thomas.  If your curiousity gets the better of you like mine did and you have to buy this for your child, look away.  Don't watch it with them because you'll only regret it.
