"Read it, roll it and hole it."
So says little Eddie Lowery in this extremely well-made adaptation of the Mark Frost book of the same name. There were only a few questionable choices in my opinion and one glaring omission. Why was the lady bug shot in there? What does that mean?
The glaring omission was choosing to not have Walter Hagen in the story. Hagen was in 4th place in the tournament and is a giant of golf history. They could have put in his famous locker room speech.
Other than that and a slight difference in opinion with the director in the way he handled the romance with the rich girl (far too much sap in my opinion, although it did provide another great line by eddie when he handed the broach to Francis:  Francis: "She gave this to me?"  Eddie: "Just put it on. Don't get all sloppy about it."), this was a great movie. Every performance was excellent as was the script.
I have recently written a non fiction golf book so I can identify with the creators of this story in struggling with what to put in and what to leave out. Its not easy.
This is the best golf movie of its kind that I have seen. Every member of your family will enjoy it.
