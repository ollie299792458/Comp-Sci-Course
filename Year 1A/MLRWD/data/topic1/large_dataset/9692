I'm not really a history buff but when it comes to depression era gangsters I would say I know my stuff.  This film dissapointed me, In fact I would go so far as to say that whilst sitting and watching this film I felt like I was being abused. (not literally of course but mentally).  Maybe its too much to expect films to be historically accurate but this was so far off the mark it's not even funny.  Floyd, Dillinger &amp; nelson were only together for one robbery and even that is hotly debated amongst historians.  At one point nelson &amp; dillinger are having a fight and baby face ends up cowering on his knees crying like a baby whose just wet himself ???- is this the same baby face who was a mob enforcer for al capone, the same mob enforcer who was let go by capone for being to violent, the same baby face who had guts enough to leave the ample cover provided by his car when face by two special agents with thompson submachine guns, the same baby face who had kept on walking toward these agents even after having 17 bullets in him &amp; who eventually killed both agents -DONT THINK SO! im not gloryfying the real baby face but to me he seems like the kinda guy who stares death in the face and enjoys every minute of it!!
some other reviews have already mentioned major flaws in the movie.  Maybe i'm being too harsh, maybe not - either way I feel I have wasted my money. At least theres another dillinger movie being made for 2004 and a seperate pretty boy floyd movie set for 2005!! i just hope they are a little more accurate.
