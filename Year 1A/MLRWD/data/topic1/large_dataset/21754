We had a friend tell us to watch this movie. We bought it for our DVD and  sat down several times to watch it, however we have three daughters, one an  infant and it was dubbed the "hexed" movie because something  would always happen when we would get it started, and would prevent our  seeing this movie. (More than three seperate nights) I was eager to see it,  because our friend had said that if I loved Shawshank Redemption, (which I  did) I would love this one more.  Impossible, I thought.  Well with the  baby in bed and the other two gone for the night, we sat down in our  skittish attempt to see this movie.  How worth all that was it?  Sooooo  very worth it.  We sat eyes forward, mostly quiet and at times open mouthed  in our amazement about some scenes.  The next day at lunch, I asked my  husband if he cried. He said he did.  I said, "I did too." (I  only cry sometimes) He told me that I didn't cry, I sobbed like a baby!!!!  I knew I did.  I was so taken into this movie, my emotions got ahold of me  and made me feel as though I was crying for my best friend.  Michael Clarke  Duncan made me want to reach in there and hold him like a little baby. This  is without a doubt, the absolutely most intense movie I have ever seen.  You will be moved.
