this is a collection of great films in the most horrilbe package that could possible be designed. the box is badly sized, extremely heavy and utterly unnecessary. the way the dvd's are packaged within the box is sheer idiocy: suspended (or not) on weird, gel-like, rubber spindles that make dvd removal and replacement extremely difficult. additionally, fox was too cheap to put each film on its own dvd, and the packaging has no labeling, so one is also faced with the prospect of trying to read the miniscule printing around the spindle hole on the dvd.

overall, this idiot collection offers yet more proof that sonny bono hit that tree a few years too late.

the modern day fox company doesn't deserve to have the rights to these pictures under its control. this is particularly true as one discovers how little care fox took of the negatives and original prints, and how indebted we are to the universities and museums that preserved this stuff.

this box is an utter and complete waste of money.
