Twenty years from now, film students will continue to appreciate the skill by which Bruce Beresford and his team realized Brian More's novel on the physical and spitual manisfestations of man and environment. I bought the VHS as soon as it was available and have analyzed portions of the film shot by shot, marveling at the almost symphonic mastery of theme and structure. Now I enjoy the DVD regularly and am constantly loaning it to friends.

I would commend three scenes as indicators of the more subtle qualities of this film: (1) The scene where priest Black Robe flagellates himself when he finds himself becoming excited watching others having sex. Note that he does this under a bent spruce about to fall into the river, a symbol of abnormality (compared to other "trees"). (2) The handling of the sun--the Native Americans' source of spirituality and life--as Chief Chomina at last approaches the island of his visions. The whole sequence on and off the island (remeniscent of a famous Boecklin painting) is exquisitely structured. (3) The deliberately ambiguous ending, the cross in front of the sun. Is it bringing light to the world, or blotting it out?

One final note. Parts of the film were photographed in an estuarial portion of the Saguenay near the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 100s of miles from the supposed route to Lake Ontario. The mountains are too high, but appropriately stunning, and the tidal fluctuations are apparent on shore from time to time.
