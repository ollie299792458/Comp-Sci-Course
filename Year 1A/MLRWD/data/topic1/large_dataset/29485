I Finally saw "Beyond Borders".  I was never reticent because of luke warm to tepid reviews, rather, just didn't get around to it.  Happy to say that once again critics sometimes (read: often) just don't... get... it.  I recall reading some rubbish about love and war don't mix, which was laughable, perhaps the critic forgot that war as a backdrop produced some of the very best narratives in existence (Papa Hemingway would more than likely share this opinion).  At any rate, Miss Jolie gives a truly wonderful performance, she is quite still in this role, a feat not easily achieved.  Her expressions, body language and eyes (those incredible eyes!) tell the viewer everything they need to know.  I've seen pretty much everything Angie has done and along with "Gia" she can be so very proud of this picture.  Clive Owen is (as usual) also guite good, he could have phoned this one in as it is a role tailored to his talents.  Marty Campbell also shines with what I understand was a thready budget.  And, of course, perhaps the real stars of the film are the locations and the brave, amazing people that are the focus of Beyond Borders.  The film opens many a complacent eye - I encourage everyone to see it so that they may make a small (but so significant to those in need) change in somebody's life.  I also congratulate the film on being brave and daring with their female lead; the places they take her both physically and mentally and the impactive ending make this a wonderful cinema and life experience.  Bollocks to those who find it "confusing" or "uneven".  Cheers.
