Generally, i don't watch much kid-driven animation. Generally, I don't stop while channel surfing HBO to watch what is basically a musical with drawings.  But this time, I was lucky.  I stopped my HBO flipping, captured by the beauty of the images and ended up staying for them and the story.
  The story is simple (see synopsis) yet the characters are so engaging that you find yourself captivated anyway.  The animation literally causes to stop breathing, in anticipation and delight.  And the voice acting...i really can't stand Nicole Kidman, but as Mumble's Momma, I loved her. The music?  I found myself dancing in my living room with my roomate, both of us too overjoyed to be chagrined at our child-like behavior.
  Now I like all kinds of movies with dark story lines and tangled messages.  I am not easily pleased.  But this movie is exactly the type of thing to pop in when your own life is just too full of darkness, without being over-simplified or too pat. So-if you just are too emotionally exhausted to pop in "The Life Aquatic" or "Donnie Darko" put this movie in.  If "Requiem For a Dream" is just too much for you, let Mumble and his family remind you that even in the worst times, there are always reasons to dance.
