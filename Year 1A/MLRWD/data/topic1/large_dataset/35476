No, this is not Terminator 3.  There aren't car chases or explosive gun fights.  It has nuns.  But it does create intrigue and an eerie atmosphere with plenty of memorable scenes to keep the viewer engaged.

The shots of the sister ringing the bell at the edge of a sheer vertical drop of several thousand feet is brilliant even by today's standards let alone in the 40's when this was made.

There are shots in this film that I swear could only have been done in the Himalayas but if it is true that is all England then it is further testament to the genius of Jack Cardiff.

The sisters find themselves in the midst of howling winds on a Himalayan mountaintop palace.  The exotic palace and its surroundings are at once beautiful and yet eerie.

The sisters lose themselves in this hypnotic atmosphere.  They soon find it harder to concentrate on spiritual matters and begin daydreaming of more worldly times before they joined the order.

A stubborn and difficult Mr. Dean only makes matters worse as an unstable Sister Ruth finds herself attracted to him.

The film is able to achieve it's eerie effect without a sledgehammer.  For example, Sister Ruth's paranoia and jealousy comes out in subtle ways.  Even after having watched plenty of modern films I found the scene where Sister Ruth is wearing a crimson red dress un-nerving and effective.  A simple thing as seeing her pale lips changing to a deep crimson red as she put on her lipstick put a chill in my spine.  Add to that the eerie shadows that seem to play in the light with a life of their own

and you've got a great film to watch, of course, on a cold, windy, winter's night next to the fireplace.  I find it very relaxing to watch and thoroughly enjoyable.

But if you're only viewing mode is in hyper spaz then this might not be the right movie for you.
