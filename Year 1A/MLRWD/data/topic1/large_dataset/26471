What is there not to say about the X-Files? It is one of the most recognized TV series of this decade, and its transition from the small to the silver screen is seamless. Mulder and Scully, flawlessly performed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, are FBI agents, who on the TV series pursue paranormal, non-mainstream cases for the Bureau. In the movie, their interests are widened to a global conspiracy involving aliens, a shadow government, and an elite group of men who may hold the fate of the world in their hands. Wonderful special effects, including a larger-than-life alien ship, vast Anarctic landscapes, and fantastically believable alien beings all add to the movie. The relationship between Mulder and Scully is highlighted in this movie; a few scenes between the two characters illustrates their close relationship and caring for one another. Duchovny and Anderson have a rare chemistry and their intelligent, teasing banter is one of the best parts of the film. The movie is filled with mysterious characters, suspenseful scenes, and is action-packed from the slightly rocky beginning to the climatic ending. The DVD edition is wonderful. Behind the scenes clips and commentaries from the creator and producer, Chris Carter, and the director, Rob Bowman, are very informative and vital to all X-Philes. It is not necessary to be a watcher of the show to understand the movie, even though the mythology of the show is long and involved; in fact, the movie has turned many a non-watcher into an avid fan of the show. This is a great movie for fans and non-fans who love a sophisticated, thrilling, action-packed movie with elements of science fiction. Be warned, this is not the typical summer blockbuster.
