Assault on Precinct 13 starring Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne is a good action movie. Hawke stars as Police Sergeant Jake Roenick who is in charge of Precinct 13, a station that is about to be demolished. He is in charge of a skeleton shift on New Year's Eve when a van carrying a group of baddies to jail is forced to take shelter because of a blizzard. Among the baddies is Marion Bishop, played by Fishburne. He's a major bad guy who is responsible for the deaths of Hawke's team from an undercover operation gone awry.

When the precinct comes under attack, Roenick is forced to cobble a defensive squad composed of his few people that are on duty and the prisoners. Things get even worse when he discovers that they are being attacked, not by Bishop's colleagues, but by other police officers who have been on the take from Bishop for years and are now afraid that his arrest means their graft will be exposed.

The story is tight, with strong performances from Hawke and Fishburne. The character of the police psychiatrist is very annoying, but that's a minor distraction. A bigger problem is that the scenes are filmed in the dark because the precinct's power supply is cut, which makes it very difficult sometimes to see what is happening. Note to filmmakers: We don't care if something is happening in a dark setting- we want to be able to SEE it, so shine a light on it, okay?

If you enjoy action films such as the Die Hard series, then you will probably enjoy this movie. There's enough action to keep things exciting, with a good plot to hold everything together.
