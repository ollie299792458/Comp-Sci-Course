I won't go into the Aa! Megami-sama (Oh My Goddess to those of us who don't speak Japanese) story itself as numerous other sources have done a better job than I at that task... however, I would like to mention some of the neat features found on this disc.
First, there's the obligatory commentary track by three of the voice acting talents (the voices of Belldandy, Keiichi, and Skuld), which though perhaps less informative than those found in some live action films, makes a quite entertaining listening.
The audio options don't stop there, however.  You can play the episodes in English, Japanese, or in "soundtrack only" mode, with the option of English subtitles.  Switching to this last mode allows fans to "dub their own Oh My Goddess" according to the disc--so if you and your friends have seen this anime a few too many times, have fun giving your own rendition of the story!
The menus work well, allowing you to skip to a particular episode or a scene within an episode.  The only extra I'd have liked to have seen that wasn't included would be an interview with the creator of Aa! Megami-sama.
