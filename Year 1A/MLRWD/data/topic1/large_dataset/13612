As a long-time, but fatigued fan of Star Trek, I was curious to see Ron Moore's (of Star Trek: TNG, DS9, and "First Contact" fame) "re-imagining" of Battlestar Galactica, although I wasn't around when the original series aired and haven't seen it.  I was delighted when the miniseries aired, and found it far more interesting and promising than most modern sci-fi (particularly the consistantly disappointing "Star Trek Enterprise").

The main cast is really outstanding and has a wonderful chemistry.  The story, pacing, sets, and atmosphere are really terrific, as are the special effects.  I'm familiar with some of the controversial changes, such as Starbuck now being a female, but from a Battlestar Galactica newbie's standpoint, the decision does nothing but enhance the miniseries (and TV series).

As of this writing, the first two TV series episodes have aired in the UK, and they very faithfully continue the saga from where the miniseries left off.  The full miniseries cast remains, and are no less well-written and interesting.  If I could choose only one television show to watch each week, it would be Battlestar Galactica.

If you haven't yet seen the Battlestar Galactica miniseries, and are a fan of sci-fi (and perhaps even if you're not), you'll likely want to watch the miniseries to prepare yourself for the US debut of the TV series in January 2005 (I'm sure it'll air just before, as it did in the UK).  Here's hoping the show has a long, providential run!
