I highly recommend this show, though I don't know what your tastes are like. Each episode is like a forty-five minute horror movie, but the difference is this: I really don't like horror movies. I LOVE Supernatural. I've watched every episode several times and am not even close to tired of it. The stories are interesting, the writers and actors do a great job of keeping up the dynamic between Dean and Sam, and the guest stars are always well-cast. I have a strong urge to buy the second season, but it isn't out yet.

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles do much of the work to make the show fun to watch. (Not diminishing the work of the directors or creators...) They have a certain brotherly chemistry that is perfect for the show, and they both have a talent for the contrasting comedic and serious tones that tend to inhabit most episodes, if not every. Once in a while I note the delivery of a particular line that is just perfect, that another actor might not have done. Jared and Jensen also perform the action well, which also pops up in every episode - maybe several times. And (come on, it has to be said) they are very pleasant to look at. Wink.

In terms of DVD features, they're pretty good. I always wish there were more commentaries, but the ones they included are good, so I won't complain. The behind the scenes features are informative and usually fairly interesting. A few of the deleted scenes are quite worth watching, and the gag reel has several hilarious moments. Good extras, all in all. In conclusion, yes, buy it!
