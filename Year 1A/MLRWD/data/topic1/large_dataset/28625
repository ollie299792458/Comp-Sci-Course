Let me set the scene:  J-Abs and Nook are enjoying a cold one talking about this cult classic when no other than Sam Jones himself walks up to us commenting on how cool we were and how we have the laydays at our disposal.  So he goes on to tell  us that Ming had a son and that he was planning on destroying Earth as revenge for his father.  So of course we are sitting there as the ladies are wrapped around us begging us to save the world going hey we got nothing planned tonight and it is a nice night for space travel.  So Nook calls up former Kansas City Royals Buddy Biancalina and Steve Balboni (who act as Zarkoff and the main bird man) and we take a little trip to Mongo to take care of this chump.  So as we arrive we notice that Ming's son Ring Ring has all these beauitful women around him and Nook tells me that he will go the 1st 2 rounds with Ring Ring while I keeps the ladies happy.  After Nook initial barrage of DDT's and Hogan leg drop he tags to J-Abs and kepps the ladies company.  J-Abs then basically went into finishing move after finishing move which started with the powerbomb and ended with a Figure four led lock while Nook had him in the camel clutch at the same time.  After disposing of Ring Ring we decided that these chicks were too weird for us and we headed back to earth to let the laydays at the bar know just how darn good we are.  Balboni and Biancciala wanted to get in on some of the action but we told them there services were no longer needed and that there was plenty of Nook and J-Abs to go around.  Don't thank us for saving the planet and don't be mad when your women leave you for the Rock N Roll Express!!!  whoooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
