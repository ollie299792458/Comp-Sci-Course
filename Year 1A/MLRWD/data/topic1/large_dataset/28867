The DICK CAVETT SHOW: ROCK ICONS DVD set is a must have especially for Janis Joplin fans because DVD #2 has her on three shows, along with Raquel Welch, Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. among others.

DVD #1 has the legendary show that was taped the day after Woodstock, which is why Joni Mitchell didn't perform at Woodstock because she didn't want to miss this taping, and also features Jefferson Airplane, Stephen Stills, and David Crosby. It's interesting to watch because at the time no one really knew what a huge and legendary event Woodstock was and would become, and how it would put some performers on the map (like Santana). Cavett does discuss it briefly with the guests who did perform at the festival and you can tell by the look on their faces, and how they described the scene, that they had just experienced something big. Poor Joni, she must have been kicking herself for missing it!

Also on DVD #1 are shows that feature David Bowie and Sly And The Family Stone (on separate episodes). The Sly interview is interesting to watch and he becomes a little combative when the other guests come on because he felt like he was being ignored.

DVD #2 features Janis Joplin on three different episodes. These are great and you really get to see how intelligent Joplin was. At one point, Cavett asks her who her favorite singer is and Janis says that she really likes Tina Turner from "The Ike & Tina Turner Band" and Cavett was like, "Who?" Too funny! Also interesting was to see Joplin interacting with acting legends Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Gloria Swanson (both on different episodes) -- Janis was right at home and, although decked out in bracelets, feathers and beads and things, she never seemed out of place or uncomfortable.

DVD #3 has Steve Wonder on one episode with Allan Delon, Tex Ritter, and the "Bride Of Frakenstein" herself, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester. But the stand out for me was the other two episodes -- one featuring George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, and the other that featured Paul Simon. Ex-Beatle and soft-spoken Harrison performs with Gary Wright & WonderWheel, and then joins Cavett to talk a little about his days with the Beatles and why they broke-up (although this is just bare-bones) and his current project at the time, which was a benefit concert for Bangladesh. He makes some cracks about John Lennon and Yoko Ono, all in good fun, and had the audience laughing. Shankar performs and then joins the panel and discusses the influence of Indian music to pop and rock at the time.

The final episode on DVD #3 features Paul Simon, who performs and plays a sample of a song he was currently working on, but the stand out for me comes in the next segment. Cavett wrote his first book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006WHSOI">Cavett</a> and becomes a guest on his own show! He gets interviewed by three authors Barbara Howar, Jerzy Kosinski, and writer of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393312836">A Clockwork Orange</a>, Anthony Burgess, and it's interesting to hear Dick's take on things.

As with their other releases, "Shout! Factory" does a wonderful job with this set! Picture quality is pretty good and there's "play all" or "episode" selection, and Cavett does present day introductions to each episode. Also included is a booklet with liner notes by the DVD's producer Robert S. Bader, a written introduction by Cavett, and episode information including airdate, guest list, and synopsis.

If all that weren't enough to get you to buy there's two special features:

***  BONUS FEATURES  ***

33:09-minute -- Bob Whitey (Produce, Director of "Curb Your Enthusiasm") Interviews Dick Cavett
Present day interview (2005).

14:38-minute -- Dick Meets The Rolling Stones
Behind-the-scenes footage of The Stones 1972 concert at Madison Square Garden in NYC. Cavett gets to spend time with the band and interviews them. Too bad this wasn't longer.

Anyway, this set is definitely worth it. Not only does it feature some great rock acts, it's a historical document, and what's not to love about Cavett! Another great DVD set is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0O5EG">The Dick Cavett Show - Hollywood Greats</a>, which is a must have if you enjoy seeing Hollywood's Golden Age stars. Although not in their prime, they're just as fascinating to watch, which is why their legendary names have endured.
