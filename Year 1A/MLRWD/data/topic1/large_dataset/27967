This is probably one of the greatest movies of all time, not because of its plot or characters...no...it's because of the perfect balance of the element of reality, the portrayal of the adolescent mind, and the little experiences the characters go through that allow for a very deep and personal connection to exist between the viewer and the screen. Once you start seeing this movie, you are quickly transported to your past (assuming you are now an adult), you begin to live your childhood through the characters, memories flood your psyche, and inevitably you are consumed with nostalgia. An immediate consequence of this is that you, now an adult, are able to achieve an amazing persepctive of your own childhood...you become enlightened...you place yourself in the shoes of these four kids and sit in amazement of the innocence of early life. You begin to think of your childhood from a new frame of reference...the film is enlightning!! This is why it is such an amazing movie!! 
I do regret some reviewers missing this point and instead criticizing the film for a weak plot (which is completely uncalled for), and finally awarding this movie a rating of less than 5 stars...it's a tragedy if you ask me. If there were a rating of "Perfection", then this film rightly deserves it.
