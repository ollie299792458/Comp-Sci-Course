Every once in a while, you get a so-so looking film that, somehow, turns out to be one of the best things you've seen all year. Before long, friends and co-wokers are borrowing it; quotes fly across the staff room. Granted, it's the usual sex-comedy fare: too-nice-for-his-own good guy tries to break his duck, lady-killer mate and 'gal-pal' tag along, wackiness ensues. So far, so Animal House.

But it's the characters that give the film heart, and none more so than Ian and Felicia. The film handles their relationship with tender care, and just as well - without them to supply the emotional core, the film would have been as awful and hollow as Superbad. By the time you hear Vega4's 'Life is Beautiful' playing near the end, you feel like punching the air. It's been a long time since any film made me care more about its characters' love lives. Sex Drive (based on the novel All the Way) isn't a 'message film'. But you can't help but notice the way the film hangs on the difference between love and lust, and which one wins out. (Am I the only guy who found Felicia more attractive than Ms. Tastee?)

Perhaps there'll always be people happy to rant and rave about films like this. You can only shake your head at what they're missing out on. This is a true under-rated gem of a film.
