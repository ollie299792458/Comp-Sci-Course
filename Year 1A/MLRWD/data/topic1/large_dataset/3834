Fantastic blend of romance, drama, suspense, comedy, and special effects in this decade old stroy about love after death.
When Sam (Patrick  Swayze) is brutally murdered, his spirit, which is trapped between 2  dimensions, returns to earth to investigate the crime and protect his  grieving girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).  After discovering that his death  wasn't just an accidental mugging and his killing was orchestrated by a  seemingly unlikely culprit, Sam realises that Molly's life is very much in  jeopardy.
Desperate to communicate to Molly the danger she is in, Sam  seeks the help of Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg, who won a deserved Oscar  for this role), a confidence trickster/storefront psychic with big hair and  an attitude to match.  At first Molly is sceptical of Oda Mae's ability to  hear Sam's voice (and so is everyone else) but after discovering that it  isn't fake, she and Oda Mae team up to thwart the evil intentions of Sam's  murderers.
"Ghost" was released cinematically at around the  same time as "Always" and "Almost An Angel," and it is  by far the best film of the 3.  Its story and messages combine to assure  the viewer, no matter what religion they may be, that although we will all  physically die, we will never be truly dead unless we are forgotten and  that love is immortality.
