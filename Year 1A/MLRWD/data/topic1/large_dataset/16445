After the sinking of the HMS Hood, the English seek to put all their units in quest to sink the Bismarck. She had 13 inch welded armor, so the task is set. With her 15 inch guns she would reek havoc in the sea lanes, if she gets into the convoys. Also, she can sit back and shoot 1,700 lb projectiles before most ships can get into range. A chase and strategy ensues ending with a lucky hit on the rudder of the Bismarck by a biwing torpedo plane, just in time to prevent her escape to a French port. This caused her to steer in circles until the pack closes in and ...

The movie action shifts from the war room to the ships at sea carrying out the orders. The hunt strategy is well put forth in the English war room in London. The personal elements of the English combatants are handled nicely. The Germans, Captain Lindemann and Fleet Commander Luetjens, however, are portrayed as less human and with an ax to grind for the glory of Germany, the Fuehrer, and their own careers, particularly with Fleet Commander Luetjens on the Bismarck.

This one has superb acting by Kenneth Moore and reflects the war room scenes quite realistically. Kenneth More interacts with his attractive female assistant. A work relationship develops that has an implied future. The feeling of the movie is definitely "documentary" mode.

By the way, the Bismarck was found and photographed by the National Geographic Magazine on the bottom of the sea. The photographs revealed her forward 15 inch gun turrets were missing. Only two holes showed. The heavy turrets were kept in place simply by gravity. As the ship went down, she rolled and the turrets fell out.
