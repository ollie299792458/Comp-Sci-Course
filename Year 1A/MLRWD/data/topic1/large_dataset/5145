I heard about this movie for years.  Comments of every sorts, even the unconvincing parody from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange, finally got me.  I checked for it and bought the DVD.  As you may guess, "An american in  Paris" followed shortly.  I began to discover the rich art of the  american musicals of the 40's and 50's.  I'm now hungry for dancing scenes  and singing/dancing numbers.  And let's recognize that the acting is really  good, acknowledging the fact that the intent is not to depict a dark and  hopeless existence (which is only a "part" of reality, i'd say)  but the story of human being with a good measure of optimism and  appreciation for life... Why not!  Gene Kelly is a monument. Amazing,  totally amazing.  O'Connor is perfect, and make an astounding job in sync  with "Kelly Dancing Machine", ("Make'em laugh" is a top  number, "Moses supposes" is incredible).  Did you know Debbie  Reynolds is the mother of ... Princess Lea.  A little deception: few  noticed JEAN HAGEN, which did exactly the contrary of her role in the film  - she overdubbed Debbie Reynolds when she sings in the film...  She had a  fair pleasant voice but who remembers.  Anyway, definitely one of the 25  best films of all time.
