I have been reading these books since I was in college, and I think I've seen every attempt at dramatizing "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" that's ever been created.  This one left them all in the dust.

  It had a similar effect on me as the first installment of "Lord of the Rings," and the first shot of Lantern Waste has me in tears much as the first shot of Rivendell did.  Both had kind of a "Yes!  That's it!" quality, as if everything I'd ever envisioned was being brought to life.  However, where Peter Jackson eventually went completely nuts with the plot, in effect writing his own story and saying Tolkien did it WRONG, this film has interpolations I did not find particularly intrusive.  The basic plot remained intact, and the whole film conveyed a sense of bringing to life what CS Lewis actually wrote.  I was a little worried when I saw that Disney was producing this that they'd dumb it down, but the story remains essentially, beautifully intact.

  I have to add that CS Lewis is my all-time favorite Christian theologian.  I feel that the reviews that have said this is anti-Bible or pro-witchcraft or whatever really need to be taking issue with CS Lewis' writings rather than the movie because the movie is presenting them very faithfully.  The good lion Aslan, son of the Great Emperor Over the Sea, gives his own innocent life for the life of a traitor and is subsequently reborn.  "The rules" for this sort of thing antedate the beginning of recorded history.  If you're a Christian, what is there to take issue with here?  If you're a fantasy enthusiast, could you find a better parable or allegory for sin and redemption?  Despite its few dramatic departures, this was a wonderful realization of CS Lewis' book, and I hope and pray that they continue with the rest of the series!
