In the slums of Rio, Brazil, teenagers and children barely old enough to be in school wield guns and war against each other in a twenty four hour battle caused by drugs and striving gangsters. When violence is the only way out and the government has fogotten about you, where do you draw the line?
When watching this film, it is not hard to see why it was used as a peice of political propoganda for both sides of the recent Brazilian election. It exposes the absolute underbelly of Rio, and its style is so close to documentary that it could clearly have been shot in the City Of God (although the area is to dangerous to film in). The entirty of the film is summed up in the Tender Trio's claim near the beginning of the film, that they will never get out of the slums by robbing gas trucks. They, debatably, deem themselves too 'stupid' to work legitimatly. Meirelle's method of using "kids from the hood" who were not trained actors adds to the absolute realism of the peice, and his upfront, blatent approach is informative in the utmost, if not a little disturbing. It's shocking to see that the only optimism these children can get is through a path tainted by the blood of their neighbours.
