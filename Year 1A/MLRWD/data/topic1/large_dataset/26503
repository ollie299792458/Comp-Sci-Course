There is a sight gag in almost every frame.  At Mrs. Whisby's (she is played by Moore's mother), Peter Cook (The Devil) sits at the table and uses HER tableware, but hands Dudley Moore (Stanley Moon) a large wooden spoon he has withdrawn from his worksuit.  Dudley accepts and employs it without notice--like it was a normal thing.  I had seen the film over ten times before I took just the right friend who had heard the old Dutch adage that applies.  It takes many viewings to catch all the gags--visual and entendre.
My favorite line from any movie, in the song (they were all written by genius concert pianist Moore) by rock group 'Drimbel Wedge and the Vegetations (The Devil, of course):'  "You fill me with inertia."
This, funnily enough (as they say in that quaint land where this film was made), is also what most movies do to me these days.  Seeing most of them even one time is too often, but I've seen Bedazzled more than fifty times in the quarter century I have known about it.
I hate to add to the already too many reviews, but this is a MUST POSSESS, desert island, type classic.
Happy repeat viewing
