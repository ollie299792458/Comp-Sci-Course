{Flash! Ah-ah...}

How many years have we been waiting?

{He'll save everyone of us!}

How long have we heard about that "awesome UK release" with all the cool extras?

{Flash! Ah-ah...}

And what do we finally get?

{Savior of the Universe!}

The Savior of the Universe release with crappy cover art (give me the original poster art any day), a featurette about the artist who made the crappy cover art (doesn't Flash look wicked and more like Ming in it?), and a featurette about the screenwriter who also wrote the 60's camp classic Batman, as well as Never Say Never Again.

Worth the money? No.

Now that this is out, the people who have been selling the original DVD release for ridiculous amounts of money on eBay will have to settle for much less, and those who want to replace their old ones thinking this one will be a great buy will probably be selling their old ones for pennies. And that's the only thing good about this release!
