Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the greatest of the 4 Indiana Jones epics. In my expert professional opinion, Temple of Doom is the greatest movie ever made in the history of motion pictues and cinematic theatre. This second installment is better than Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, and Death Wish 4. Temple of Doom made me want to join the Thugee Cult and I have dressed up as Mola Ram for Halloween for the past 19 years of my life. Talk about inspiration!

Temple of Doom also saved my life from ruins in the gutter. Many a night I spent wandering the underbelly of the concrete jungle, only to find myself at home curled up in the fetal position watching Temple in the dark. Indiana takes a backseat to Short Round (played by Jonathan Ke Quan - greatest living actor of our generation) as Harrison Ford finds himself second fiddle to a 12 year old taxicab driver from Shanghai.

Indiana joins forces with a night club singer named Wilhelmina "Willie" Scott and the aforementioned Short Round. Together, the 3 heroes wind up in a small distressed Indian village, where the locals believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after the sacred Shankara Stone was stolen! I have decorated my house with dozen Shankara Stones and believe you me, they indeed have power! My home has survived earthquakes, mudslide and forest fires and all praise goes to the power of the Shankara Stones. Indy, Willie, and Short Round discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding Pankot Palace, which is a booby-trapped ghoulish temple known as our beloved Temple of Doom!

Temple of Doom defines my existence and has transformed life and saved me from ruin. Shankara Stones will make you believe in the power of Thugee. Watch this movie and perhaps it will change you in ways only you could dream of. Oh, what a cinematic feast for the ears & eyes you have made for us Mr. Steven Spielberg, what a feast indeed!
