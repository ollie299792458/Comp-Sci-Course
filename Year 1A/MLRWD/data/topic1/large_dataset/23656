This adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel with the same title is stunning visually, and emotionally wrenching.  It ends with brilliant simplicity, leaving your mind and heart still entrapped in the story -- it's the kind of film you'll still be thinking about 2 days later while sipping a cup of tea.  Curran creates magic with his sweeping scenery, efortlessly emphasizing the isolation and loneliness Walter and Kitty are facing - both physically and emotionally.  Edward Norton truly becomes Walter, somehow managing to make clear Walter's growth through the film without losing the simple, quiet character he is.  Norton deserves every one of the awards he won for this movie and many more.  Naomi Watts is given the somewhat easier task of presenting Kitty, whose transformation is more active.  She too brings her screen persona to life beautifully -- moving from selfish young woman to shattered soul to simple strength without emotional manipulation or losing the essence of the story.  The two together bring a chemistry that touches the audience at the core of our being - and does so with a degree of subtlety that is rare today.

If you are a fan of the big budget, overproduced, special effects laden films that are so prevalent today, this will not impress you.  The film simply flows -- no forced action or rush.  If you are willing to ride along with the current, however, it is unforgettable.  This movie is a flashback to a day when films managed to convey in few words much meaning.  Curran's cinematography is a blend of a strong, simple script, poignant use of color and camera placement, and powerful actors.  With that recipe it is no surprise that for those of us looking for a true experience film, Painted Veil is a hit.

PS-- the title itself refers to a sonnet by Percy Byshe Shelley called "Lift not the Painted Veil," which is well worth googling if you want a glimpse at the movie's depth.
