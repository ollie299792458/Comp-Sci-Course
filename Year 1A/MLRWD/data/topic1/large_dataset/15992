OK - a good deal of fight scenes and chases cross the lines of belivability (after all, it is just a movie), but both the chase scenes and the fight scenes are delightful to watch as are several of the actors.

Jason Statham, plays Frank - a transporter who will transport anything without asking any unnecessary questions and following few simple rules - one of which is never to look into packages he is transporting.

His problems begin when he decides to take a look, because in the package he was transporting there was obviously something alive and moving.  The package is a chinese girl Lai (played by delightful Shu Qi), whose father is involved in smugling Chinese slaves.  She wants to stop his father and in a process involves the transporter, who happens to be very well trained in combat.  Here the chase and the non-stop action begin with one good guy fighting against a whole organized gang of bad guys.

Other than the chases and fight scenes, and in spite of the unbelievable scenes, I liked the Frank's character - his head is screwed on right - he is focused on what he is doing, he is well-organized, he plans whatever can be planned and when things don't work out, he just moves on - there is no waste of time or energy on bemoaning one's destiny or planning vengance for damages suffered. If something is gone, you simply create a new thing and a new life - a healthy attitude.
