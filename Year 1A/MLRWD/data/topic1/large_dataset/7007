A novel twist on the alien invasion trope.  Spoiler alert: It doesn't break out of the boilerplate arithmetic of survival/horror movies, wherein new characters can only exist for a short period before the character list gets trimmed down again to a comfortable number.  This leads to scenes of avoidable death after improbable survival.  However, I felt it created a true sense of post-apocalypse and the absolute devastation that would be wrought if spacefaring aliens decided to invade.  The plot was suspenseful and characters were likable and more fully realized than a collection of tropes.  It didn't really impinge on my enjoyment of the film that (a) aliens would be able to find lots of metal-rich spacerocks without travelling to an inhabited planet (unless they need oxygen for their machines or something) and (b) Given the aliens are engaged in planetary core mining (and spacetravel, of course), it doesn't seem likely that a few hundred survivors in each city would be able to dampen the aliens' operations on earth, even after we find out ways to survive.  But one can come up with plausible in-universe scenarios for this.  A really excellent genre movie.
