First, this review's about the DVD COLLECTOR'S EDITION of Conan the  Barbarian. I'll start with the cons. First: what complete idiot decided  that this movie could do with 2.0 mono?!?!?!? One of the greatest movie  scores ever (by Basil Pouledouris) should have gotten the dolby 5.1  treatment that it deserves. The only reason I can imagine: the original  tapes are lost; why else put out a mono collector's edition? The only  remedy: turn the volume way up there and get a glimpse of what it should  have been like. Don't let the 2.0 mono scare you off too easily, it's still  a great experience (still frustrating as well, though.....).  Second: only a  couple of errors in the picture, hardly noticeable and only irritant for  perfectionists. Third: the other extras are nice, but it's a pity that you  have to fast-forward from one deleted scene to the other. Not too big a  minus; the scenes aren't that special anyway.
Then the reasons why this  DVD edition still is a MUST HAVE for the fans:
First: the new, 52 minute  making of documentary. A+ for this one, this is what makes a great DVD.  Second: the feature commentary with director John Milius and Arnie. Hear  Milius checking out every actress in the movie and Arnie shyly and abruptly  trying to change the subject when it comes to the love scenes.  Hilarious!!
So, in conclusion: if you're a fan of the movie, the comic  book, Arnie and to a lesser extend the books you HAVE TO get this one. Also  recommended to every fan of sword and sorcery, fantasy, action and medieval  movies - this is one of the best! Five stars for the movie, 4 for the DVD.
