I cannot believe this film was made by the same people who made 2001 Maniacs.  The first film (the remake, starring Robert Englund), was clever, funny, bloody and ultimately, a lot of fun.  It was a B-movie horror comedy which knew exactly what it was and made for an excellent film for any horror / splatter fan.

This film, 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams, is, quite frankly, a piece of garbage.  The camera work and direction make it seem like it was made by a high schooler taking his first shot at film making.  The writing is absolutely atrocious.  It isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't witty.  It's lame.  The special effects are basically non-existent.  The few scenes which do involve special effects are primitive at best.  The acting is the worst part of this pathetic film.  I understand that this is a B-movie, and it knows it is a B-movie and the acting is supposed to be cheesy, but for acting this terrible, there is no excuse.  The acting in the first one wasn't going to win any academy awards, but it didn't leave you cringing with each horribly performed line of dialogue.

Even Bill Moseley couldn't save this train wreck.  If you enjoyed the first one (as I did), steer clear of this one; you will be severely disappointed.

If you absolutely MUST see this film, I recommend downloading it for free.  That way you won't feel ripped off, and if Tim Sullivan decides to make a third installment, maybe he'll actually put a little bit of effort into it and create something clever and inspired like the first one.
