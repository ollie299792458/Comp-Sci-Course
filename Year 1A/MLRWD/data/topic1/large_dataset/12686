I loved the book and read it many long years ago. At the time I wondered why no one had made it into a movie. Seeing the film finally make it to the screen was a joy for me although the book was a different experience in some ways - but the film is no less enjoyable. I was never a huge fan of Brad Pitt - I like his movies like Ocean 11 and such but I just saw him as one of those younger actors - however, he pulls a performance out of himself that is one of the best; certainly his best effort ever.

The film captures such beauty in its landscape shots and those of people; however, it has that underlying spiritual tone to it as it unfolds - that brings the viewer closer to people on the screen and the story and action. This story, of course is true, which makes it even more impressive.

I would rate this as one of a couple of dozen best films ever made - even though few people went to buy tickets to see it at the box office. In time, people may come to realize that this is a classic film and that Brad Pitt did an outstanding job.

I have seen this movie many times and still seem to get something new from it each time. So, owning the DVD is a good idea - then you can view it as often as the mood strikes you to do so. I fully recommend this movie for anyone searching for his or her own life adventure and spiritual journey.
