I know little about Idi Amin and don't pretend to know whether this movie was accurate or not.  I can only say two things about the movie.

One, I enjoyed quite a bit about it.  I found myself interested nearly the entire movie through and never was I disinterested with any of the characters.

Two, at a certain point the movie becomes disjointed and difficult to understand.  That's when I started to dislike the movie - because I couldn't understand what had just happened.  One moment Amin was a beloved leader, revered by the people, looked up to and hearalded, the next he's off killing people as traitors.  There is no real transition to this event; it's never 100% clear exactly what his motives are.  It's like he just snapped one day and became paranoid after something happens (can't say exactly...would spoil it), but that's not realistic at all.  I know from what I've read that people regarded Amin as constantly thinking everyone was out to get him, and maybe that was true...maybe it wasn't.  But at least portray a possible motive in the movie, and let the people watching decide for themselves.
