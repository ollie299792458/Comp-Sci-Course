"Bulitt" is undoubtedly a landmark film including three slick and impressionable ingredients of the late 60s: star power with presence, a widely imitated car chase in the hilly streets of San Francisco, and a highly stylistic approach to cinematography and music.  Whether you like the movie is one thing but the aforementioned ingredients successfully make you remember it.  I happen to like it.  The late Steve McQueen provides the star power, the presence (largely lacking in current-day actors), and injects a sizable dose of naturalness in the interpretation of his character to the stiff and contrived style common in the 60s to lend a gritty and edgy feel to the movie.  It works for the movie.  The now infamous car chase has been imitated in one of the last "Dirty Harry" movies and in 1995's "Jade" as well as other movies.  Although the later car chases have managed to one-up the original in terms of action and camera work (due to more stable equipment), the later movies do not hold the same appeal.  And as anyone can tell you, imitation is pale.  While watching the opening sequence of "Bulitt", you'll also notice a strange similarity between this movie and "Oceans Eleven" in terms of musical style and even title transitions and movement.  But like I said, imitation is pale.

The screenplay for "Bulitt" serves its intended purpose but it is really propelled by the good direction, acting, and Lalo Schifrin's memorable musical score.  Watch this movie and you won't regret it.  If you have a habit of watching movies multiple times, this one may grow on you.  A great classic!
