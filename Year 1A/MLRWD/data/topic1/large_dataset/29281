It doesn't have special effects.  No fight scenes, no sex, no hot chicks, no giant plot twists, no chase scenes.  It's not particularly inventive or revolutionary as far as a movie goes.  However, it is perfect in what it  does.  The performances are absolutely flawless, and the dialogue is simply  genius!  Mamet is like a modern day Shakespeare.  I watch lots of movies,  and what I like sci-fi and action the best.  So why would I say this is my  favorite movie of all time?  Well, it is the only movie that I can watch  over and over without getting bored.  There is always something to analyze,  and the creativity and timing of the conversations never gets old.  Admirable!  If you are open-minded and really like movies, I would  recommend this.  But don't expect to get blown away when you see it.  I  didn't really know what to make of it the first time I saw it.  I thought  it was neat, but not very interesting.  I had to watch it again.  And  again.  And again.  Now, where is my DVD version of this with two  commentary tracks?  I'm dying to see this in widescreen.
