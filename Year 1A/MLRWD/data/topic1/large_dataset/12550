The first pairing of Bogart & Bacall is electric, the on-screen chemistry is undeniable. Of course, we have hindsight now & we know that they did have an affair & that they did get married in real life. Bacall's first performance as a mere 19 year old is fascinating & magnetic.

The movie is based on an Ernest Hemingway novel on the same name. The director, Howard Hawks, had been wanting to make a movie based on a Hemingway work for years & he finally got to do this one. The movie itself is dramatically different than the novel. William Faulkner, a favorite of Hawks, was brought in to make changes to the script to make it more acceptable, not only to movie goers but also the Roosevelt administration. It was noted early on in the filming of the movie that something magical was going on on-screen between Bogart & Bacall, so the part of Slim (Bacall) was increased while the part of the other leading lady, Dolores Moran, was decreased.

The story takes place during WWII on the tiny island of Martinique in the Caribbean. Martinique was a French possession but France had already fallen to the Third Reich at the time of this story. An agent of Free France is sent in to rescue a man from Devil's Island. Bogart is hired to pick up the agent & delivered to Martinique to institute the plan. The agent is wounded so Bogey ends up doing more than he bargained for.

The story lingers on the budding romance between Bogart & Bacall. The rest of the story becomes secondary to this. Walter Brennan is featured in a role of a drunk who nearly ruins the plans of Bogey. There are many similarities between this movie & Casablanca, fans of Bogart should know this, many of the characters are even physically similar.

Enjoy one of Bogey's best movies & remember, "You know how to whistle, don't you? You just put your lips together and blow."
