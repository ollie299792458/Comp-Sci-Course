Make no mistake, this tantalizing minuscule budgeted movie is one of the worst things ever put on film. I will not attempt to match some of the other excellent reviews of this film. However, as a lifelong Los Angeles resident and long time Griffith Park hiker, I marvel every time I walk into that rock quarry cave which is "alive" and "well" as of 2011, and imagine the horrid bubble machine that almost destroyed our planet. Also walking the same hallowed ground that robot monster tramped some 50+ years ago is a trip. The whole area should be designated a national treasure for all future movie buff tourists. The "cave" has seen the likes of "William Shatner" Star Trek, "Broderick Crawford" Highway Patrol, "George Reeves" TV's Superman, and so on.
  However, the great irony of this movie is Elmer Bernstein's Robot Monster film score. Just think, he went from composing a film score for what many consider the worst, cheapest film ever made to the legendary Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments", which I regard to this day as one of the greatest film scores ever made. Why Mr. DeMille picked him to do his film score is a story on to itself for another time.
