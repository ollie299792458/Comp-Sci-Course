I'm suprised at how much criticism there has been of this movie.  Entertainment Weekly gave it a C, reviewers here have made their complaints as well.  I'm not sure what people expect, but it is a made for T.V. movie that had a very short production deadline.  With that in consideration, I think they did an amazing job.  I give it five stars because there is so much positive about this and the first movie.  My daughters are 5 and 7 and they are beginning to get into some of the "tween scene" things.  HSM and HSM2 are movies portraying teenagers that are squeaky clean and pure.  The focus is on friendship, not the horny dating scene.  I don't have to explain anything inappropriate or too adult to them.  The music is catchy and I'm not embarassed to hear them sing adult lyrics that they don't understand.  I know my perspective doesn't match everyone else's, but as a parent, I can't say enough good about these two movies.  Speaking of the two movies, I think the second looks more professionally done and the songs are even more catchy.  The dance numbers are explosive.  I'm sure this version will be under our Christmas Tree and my husband and I will tire of hearing it over and over again, but they could choose much worse!  (I still can't believe that at their age, my friends and I were repeatedly watching Grease on VHS!  Talk about racy lyrics and situations!)  I would sleep a lot better in the next decade if high schoolers really were like they are in HSM and HSM2!
