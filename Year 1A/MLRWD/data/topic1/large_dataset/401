So many people begged me to see this movie because I am such an animal lover (all animals, all types, birds too), and I resisted because I had heard that it was "sad." Finally, I got the DVD, and it is everything I had heard, but it is upsetting as well.

The photography is truly breathtaking. The intimate shots of the parent birds sheltering their chicks beneath their stomachs was both fascinating and awe-inspiring, in fact the entire feat of making such a movie in such a climate is awe-inspiring. I cannot praise the artisans who created this movie enough.

However, nature is cruel. And even though I know it is in nature's design to cull the weakest from the flock, and even though I know that it is a natural process, it was very hard for me to watch baby penguin chicks tackled by a predator and freezing or starving to death...and equally horrible for me to see a full-grown female who left a chick behind eaten by a sea lion. If I were watching a sea lion movie, I would have understood it had to eat...it's not like I am ignorant, but it truly upset me. What can I say.

That having been said, I also question whether this movie is really appropriate for very young children. It would have deeply disturbed my own children at a certain age, and myself as well. I know the fashion is to expose today's children to everything...and I wonder if that is such a good idea.

Brilliant watching for adults and older children, but don't expect a fairy tale. This is real, brutal life.
