This was one of my first sci-fi movies and it caused me to love the entire genre.  A couple years ago I saw the VHS in K-mart and had to have it!  Watching it again brought back so many memories.  
Ok so it wasn't a real  blockbuster but man did it stick out and become a cult film.  The  screenwriting aside there was some spectacular sets and costumes designed  for this film, not to mention the actors chosen.  Hmmm, never heard of Sam  Jones before, heard he used to do commercials but he did a good job being a  jock/space hero.  Melody Anderson as Dale was satisfactory to pull off the  role.  Topol as Zarkov made things more interesting, good choice.  
The  real shiners were the supporting cast who seem to really be having fun.  Brian Blessed as a jovial Hawkman leader, and the debonair Timothy Dalton  as Prince Baron, the suave hero-like Arborian leader.  
The bad guys were  even better!  Peter Wyngarde giving the comic-looking Kyltus an evil edge,  and I love Max Von Sydow as emperor Ming.  That is probably the best  casting choice in the entire movie.  He just fills the role with every  ounce of evil as the comic character, great performance!  My mom wouldn't  let me watch Flash Gordon as a kid when she saw Ornella Muti as Princess  Aura in her dazzling array of sexy ensembles and relentless teasing.  Now  that I'm moved out I can drool all I want. Yummy! 
If you remember the  80s with any nostalgia at all this movie is for you.  This pokes fun at  sci-fi bringing some humor back into it after Alien (1979) shocked and  scared everyone.  I recommend this movie for anyone looking to just  watch  something fun.  Great for parties, fun to laugh at, hard to forget, the  immortal Flash Gordon.
