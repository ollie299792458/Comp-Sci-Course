This movie was BEAUTIFUL and insprational!! I have never been a big fan of Thamas Kincade's painting, preferring more modern art, but - The acting is superb, and the story is a lovely triumph of a single mother who understood the gifts of her children and supported tham with everything she had. A few of Peter O'Tooles segments brought tears to my eyes, and Marsha Gaye Hardin's performances were excellent.  Jared Padelecki is beautifully cast and performs his role with dexterity. The director, Michael Campus, has great vision and seems to feel the warmth and love in this story, and has been able to move that to the screen. I have purchased multiple copies of the film to add to my holiday baskets for friends and family.  I do think everyone will enjoy!  I must have missed the profanity spoken about by a few folks - I guess maybe it is the "God Damn" that is said by the wayward father in the church?  Not a nice comment, for sure, but it did not affect my feelings of the movie at all.  Great Job!!
