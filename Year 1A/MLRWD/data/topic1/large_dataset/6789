What can I say about this masterpiece of a movie? I love it, It's intelligent cinema, and some people just don't get it. I don't want to attack anyone who has reviewed the movie because, everyone is entitled to an opinion.
  But there is a review from someone in Illinois, that obviously did not pay attention to the movie. They comment on the fact that Judy does not grieve the loss of Buzz, Duh! Thats the point, the feeling of isolated youth and the confusion that youth brings. Judy has lost someone so close to her and yet she is not able to cry for him or even show any signs of loss, (Kinda deep huh?)
  This same reviewer pointed out that all the actors in the movie overact, What movie were you watching? With all the fake soap opera type acting we see in todays cinema the acting in Rebel seems low key given the circumstances.
  Another fact pointed out was the script and lack of quality it showed. Sorry, But I'm gonna have to disagree with you. The script was a combination of other ideas and I feel it has important structure and symbolism that is sometimes missed by the less intelligent viewer.
  As for the character played by Sal Mineo, we know from the opening scene that he is a powder keg. He blew away a bunch of helpless puppies because he was upset and distraught. He felt abandoned by Jim and Judy (Just like his mother and father!) and those same feelings made him feel like killing something or someone else. Totally believable.
  In closing I would suggest that The reviewer take another look at the movie, maybe three or four more looks. This movie is much deeper than a lousy script and some overacting actors. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a strong and open mind.
