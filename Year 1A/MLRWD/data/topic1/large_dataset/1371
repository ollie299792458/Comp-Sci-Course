Ten years ago, I dropped $40 on the fancy, deluxe Criterion DVD of Life of Brian and loved it. The multiple commentary tracks and bonus features were great, and the picture was definitely an upgrade from my VHS copy. Several years later, I was disappointed to see that Criterion didn't assume the task of releasing Life of Brian on Blu-ray, leaving it to Sony instead. Well, having finally jumped on the Blu-ray bandwagon, I decided to pick up the new disc. All I can say is wow. This completely blows the Criterion DVD out of the water. This is a crystal clear, spotless transfer whereas the Criterion version had plenty of scratches, specks, and whatnot on the film. I had no idea this movie could look this good. Most of the bonus features have been carried over, and there is a new retrospective featurette with interviews of all the living Pythons, so parting ways with my old DVD was a piece of cake. To make it even better, the Blu-ray retails for half the price of the Criterion DVD, so if you are at all reluctant to double-dip on this one, I highly suggest going for it.
