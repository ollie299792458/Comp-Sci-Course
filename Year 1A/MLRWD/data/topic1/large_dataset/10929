I have loved this movie since when I first saw in on cable. I was way to young to see it in the theatre. My being born in 1972. Even if I did see it at 4 I would be scared out of my wits!!! Also I would not be let to see it because of the nudity it has in the beginning.
However seeing it in my teens, I saw it as a horror flick and a good suspenseful movie. Then in recent years I realized how well all the elements presented here are breathtaking. Elements such as direction, acting, setting, music, cinematography. I feel it is a movie that you need to see over again to really grasp the chemistry of all that. Here the direction is such that one slip up and you do not get the right feel and tempo, especially during the prom scene. That famous scene, where the building up of the blood spill is very much Hitchcock worthy. Music cues lighting, it all is just wonderful!!!
It is one of the very few times where you are rooting for the monster/villain. I find it hard to categorize this film as horror. In my adult years I see it more of a Psychological Thriller.
It is also surprising of the oscar nods Laurie and Spacek received. A true rare in a "Horror" film. I do wonder if Hitchcock saw this movie and if he did what he thought about it.

A lot of people around think I am crazy for liking this movie. I tell them it is like a paining you see in an art gallery. One likes it, one hates it, one has a single word for it and one has a thousand. To me this movie holds a million!

Foot note:
If you ever come across the soundtrack and you love the movie as much as I do get it. I ordered mine here on Amazon. I must tell you the tracks are very well engineered! They are true to the film. It is a masterpiece, and wonderful addition to my library.
