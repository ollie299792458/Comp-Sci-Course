I have just read all of your reviews for this EXTREMELY WELL-DONE, FAST-PACED, FLAWLESSLY-WRITTEN, SUPERBLY-ACTED movie, and yes, you have the right to your opinion, but I can't accept the reasons for your disapproval.  You obviously didn't watch the movie because not only are the characters utterly human, funny and emotional, they change and GROW considerably, vying for the viewers' sympathy.  You can't help but watch and see how each turns out.  
And it could've been any one of us.  I'm not saying all of us have the capacity to become addicted to a drug, but it DOES happen, and these guys (we'll focus on the men) are REGULAR, football-playing, Sean Connery-loving guys who happen to have a lethal and expensive drug habit.  But what's so wonderful about this film is that the title character, Renton, WANTS to give it up, wants to come clean, and you WANT him to do it, of course.  He fails sometimes, but once he kicks it, you cheer for him, and you hope he has the capacity to stick to his guns.  You almost want to grab his hand and lead him to the end of the movie, making sure he'll be okay.  How powerful a character is that? 
It's really brilliantly done.  In all honesty, the first time I saw it, I didn't understand it (the accents and the story-line), but seeing it again made me only want to see it more, because with every viewing, I fell in love with Mark Renton (not Ewan, but Mark).  And that's damn good movie making.
