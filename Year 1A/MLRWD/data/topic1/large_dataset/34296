First, I put my feedback on the seller profile "Plenty of Toys" I gave them a negative rating because the disk they sent me was not the Sony Pictures 50th anniversary listed in the description. Instead what I received was what appeared to be an illegal bootleg from China. This copy had no subtitles or menu and was English dubbed only. They did eventually get back to me after I left the 1 star rating. Since they did respond I told them I would edit my feedback. But, there was not an edit option just a "remove feedback" option. There is no way to resubmit seller feedback for this item and I suspect the person who contacted me knew this during our correspondence.

I would stay away from this seller for this particular item. After back and forth emails I found out that they don't have the "Son of Godzilla" that is in the description at all. They did, however, offer to give a full refund with return if I removed the negative feedback. I expressed that it wouldn't be worth the hassle to send it back and they then offered to let me keep the disk with a full refund. I declined this as well. I wanted the 50th anniversary copy, but this is what I have so I'll keep it and pay for it.

About the disk I did receive: They video quality is actually really good, Which surprised me after seeing the photo copied DVD cover! The sound isn't bad, but I prefer the original Japanese with subtitles and that isn't an option with this disk.
