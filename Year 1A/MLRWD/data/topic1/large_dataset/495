When I saw this movie in 1971, I didn't like it. It was darker than anything I had seen to that point in a children's movie. However, my feelings about if have changed, especially my appreciation of Gene Wilder (even more after seeing Johnny Depp's decidedly 'weird' take on Willy Wonka - I can't believe that people buy that version for their children). But there are many fans of this movie. My review is about this box of goodies. The movie in blu-ray is spectacular - unbelievably restored after so many years. The box of scratch and sniff pencils and eraser is something I think many children would enjoy. I liked the book "Pure Imagination" by Mel Stuart, the director, and read it as soon as I opened the box. The gold ticket is a fun addition. I also enjoyed the features and seeing the children grown up. The box is sturdy and everything is wrapped well to protect it. I sent one to my grown daughter and one to my granddaughter for birthday gifts. One I kept for myself. This set is highly recommended.
