This film does an excellent job in projecting what it sets out to do. The characters are strong and the viewer can easily relate to them.  As a science fiction story, we have to accept certain things that we would otherwise term 'unrealistic'. However what I feel that was grossly overlooked in this movie, were the ethical considerations that 'Andrew' (Robin Williams) was confronted with. In particular, going in front of a legislative committee in his efforts to be granted the right to be a human.

Now, while I can see some of the technological advancements as those projected in the movie as possibly coming true - I do not see how the overwhelming influence of religious fundamentalism would ever permit a positive result for our hapless android - irrespective of 'human rights'. The future may progress technologically, however human attitudes will never escape the ever-growing neolithic belief systems that plague us today.

Jodie Foster's science fiction classic 'Contact' addressed certain religious aspects, so it's not too far-fetched to suggest the inclusion of these considerations. Perhaps they needed to be at least mentioned in Asimov's original work? I don't know - I've not read it. However if anything is going to prevent us from reaching a plateau of wisdom, (as eventually demonstrated by the legislative committee in Bicentennial Man) it's going to be these obsolete beliefs.
