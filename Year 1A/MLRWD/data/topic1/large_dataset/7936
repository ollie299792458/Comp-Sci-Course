I'm NOT a 'scary' movie person or a 'thriller'... I'm a comedy or lovey movie person. But mostly comedy.

I saw this at my Dad & step moms house, years back, and fell in love with it. I was hardly visiting with them, my eyes were glued to the tv!! I recently bought this and I was sooo excited to see it again after about 2 years, and hardly could remember the movie, let alone the title! I was so excited to have the movie, and I watched it right away. it's the perfect amount of everything!! There are some little parts that you're suppose to laugh, I did. There were the lovey parts that your heart was suppose to fill up and tingle too, mine did! And the parts where you're scared and want it to work out the way it should, and wish you could help (even though it's a movie! ha) and... well... there I sat... I did feel/want all that.

I see a movie in theater once a year or not at all. I don't waste the money on something that could suck, or be good and just see once with nothing to show for it but a laugh. This movie is great. And worth every penny.
