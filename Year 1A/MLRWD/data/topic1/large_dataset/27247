Funny at times and sterotypically offensive at others. Things I learned from this movie.
1) Most white people are racist.
2) No black people are racist.
3) All Southerners are racist and homophobes.
4) If you get a white southern racist stone, they suddenly cease to be racist and thus can see the error of their ways.
5) All black people apparently know someone who has drugs. Who can then give the white southern person some weed to make them not racist anymore.
This movie was very much about offensive sterotypes. I normally don't care about that kind of thing, I mean Hollywood is going to make what they want to make and they don't care about how it potrays blacks or whites but this was just over the top.
Think I am kidding? Rent the movie. Count how many times a sterotypical action is given from a white person to a black person. Anything from " Yoo Gee..." Or the famous " Look Aunt Jammia". Very...very....typical hollywood crap.
Outside of Steve  Martin and his lawyer partner all the white people are portayed as being racist or having racist views. Contrast that with all the black people who seem to be the only open minded persons.
The lady from Athens Georgia in the movie is just over the top hollywood painting everyone from the south as still running around with hood and cloaks.  From her singing  a "negro spiritual" about how her servants would come off the field and wonder about if they were being sold today, to her the next door neighbor complaing about Mexicans and her line of the movie " I thought I heard Negro!".
Steve Martin's performance is the only thing that saved this film. That and Queen Latifas Fight scene in the bathroom with the money grupping sister in law.
