"The House of Mirth" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I rush to its defense when I hear accusations of lackluster performances, miscasting, etc.  The only criticism I agree with is the regret that Gerty Farish and Grace Stepney were merged into one character.  The relationship between Lily and Gerty is sincere, and both women in turn look out for each other, a stark contrast to the manipulative relationships featured in the book and movie.

Eric Stoltz plays a refined ("metrosexual") Selden (I read a review that criticized him for portraying Selden as effeminate). Both Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz use great intelligence and emotional depth in their roles.  Gillian's face is so expressive, and I agree with a reviewer (for "Bleak House") who praised her beauty as "Pre-Raphaelite."  She captures Lily's integrity as she politely shoulders slight after degrading slight and makes the fatal choice to do "the right thing at the wrong time."  I always thought Eric Stoltz one of the most handsome redheaded men of my awareness, but in this movie, he transcends handsome and appears beautiful. The scenes between Selden and Lily are charged with unconsummated romantic tension; Lily asks why they always play this elaborate game together. Both actors are brilliant in these scenes as they exchange quips and intimations and confessions of their mutual feelings.

The movie aptly explores the theme of the oppressiveness of the upper class, the social stratum that ultimately arranges for Lily's demise when she refuses to stoop to Bertha Dorset's level (especially as exposing Bertha would implicate Lawrence Selden).
Lily is demoted from eligible bachelorette to fired milliner. Few actresses could have engaged the (receptive) audience's sympathy as well as Ms. Anderson during Lily's downward spiral. The supporting cast is wonderful and undergirds this modern masterpiece.
