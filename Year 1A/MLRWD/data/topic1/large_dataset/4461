I almost didn't go to this movie, thinking that it was for teenagers, but I was wrong.  I went and discovered that, although the lead roles are teenaged girls, the movie has a much wider appeal and hits on some universal themes.  The four main characters are life-long friends whose mothers met in a pre-natal aerobics class before they were born.  They have always been together, but for the first time three of them will be having summer adventures in other places.  Carmen is going to stay with her dad for the summer, but some very unwelcome surprises await her.  Bridget is at a soccer camp in Mexico where she looks for love in all the wrong places.  Lena visits her grandparents in Greece and gets in the middle of a 2-family feud, and Tibby stays home to work in a local discount store and make a documentary.  All of the girls have life-changing experiences which cause them to reflect and to grow.  Through it all, they are there for each other via the "traveling pants", a pair of jeans which miraculously fits all four of them.  The acting by each of the girls, along with a younger girl who plays the part of Bailey, is excellent.  Take my advice, grab a good friend or two, and see this movie!  You won't regret it.
