The bad boy duo that you once witnessed took it there, and were back to take it there again.  These thrillers are action packed from beginning to end.  Bad Boys and Bad Boys II are must haves in every DVD collection.

 In the premiering Bad Boys movie, detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) of the Miami Police Department partner up to take on a mission to retrieve 100 million dollars worth of missing cocaine and save the Narcotics Department from being shut down.  When their jobs are on the line, a couple of murderers and a witness will only make them focus on putting their "bad boy" skills to work.

 In the sequel, Bad Boys II, there is more action and a bigger crime to be investigated.  Between the emotional and short fused personality of Marcus and the calm but aggressive behavior of Mike, negative issues in their partnership are on the rise.  Issues hit a climax when Marcus is revealed a shocking secret about his sister Sydney, who works for the DEA, and Mike's affair.  But not a bullet, some ecstasy pills, or a few crashed cars will stop these two detectives from fulfilling their prestigious bad boy reputation.

 If you recall, when Bad Boys was released in 1995, Sony Productions made a total gross profit of $68,647,413.  Bad Boys II opened in 2003 and made a total gross profit of $138,608,444.  Director Michael Bay shot and hit the target of most American movie consumers.  Both movies did very successful.

 Some final words for all action seekers.  If you have it, keep it.  If you want it, go get it.  If you've never seen it, rent it.  Because once you watch it, you will not regret the purchase.
