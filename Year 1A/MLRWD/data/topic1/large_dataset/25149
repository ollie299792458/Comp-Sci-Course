The Glamorous Life Of Sachiko Hanai is a fascinating and entertaining slice of Japanese filmmaking. Combining humour, erotica, theories of evolution, existentialism, action, secret agents, hit men, nutty professors and a gorgeous and talented leading lady whose transformation (ala Cliff Robertson's Charly) from a simple fun loving call girl into a voracious knowledge seeking femme fatale is first rate.

She is ably supported by a talented cast and the film itself keeps one's interest til the last scene.

The special effects are an homage to 1960s escapist fare and the erotic interludes range from subtle to completely over the top.

Interestingly the film is also a learning experience as we discover things at the same time as Sachiko including The Chaos Theory.

The idea of George Bush's cloned finger, which is painstakingly dispensed through a squeaky lipstick holder is both clever and hilarious.

I especially like the U.S. Flag on the fingernail!
