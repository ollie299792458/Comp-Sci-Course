Those of you looking for "Band of Brothers" Pacific Edition will be disappointed.  This is a much more ambiguous story than Band of Brothers, and why?  And why?  Is it because the Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who swallowed Tom Brokaw's "The Greatest Generation" before 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq, suddenly remembered that they were bleeding heart liberals, and that the Japanese in World War II were just as wonderful people as US Marines?

It's noteworthy that the American soldiers in Europe didn't hate their German enemies nearly as much as the Marines and soldiers in the Pacific hated theirs, but you'd never know it from this series compared to Band of Brothers.  These Marines seem to have a deep sense of guilt and shame about killing their enemies that has seldom been reported in the histories or individual accounts.  Hanks and Spielberg seem to have found a deep vein of American guilt and shame about Guadalcanal, Pelelieu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  I'm glad my father's not alive to see it.
