Ice Age 2 had some big shoes to fill, seeing as how the first movie was great on so many levels. As with many sequels, it couldn't quite match up.  Yes, there are some great lines, and some cute situational scenes.  Scrat steals more of the show in Ice Age 2, perhaps because the show itself isn't quite as captivating.

The first movie had a strong plot line with some more compelling character development threads -- lonerism vs depending on others, loyalty vs betrayal, & a doofus turning out to be valuable after all. The second movie's premise (fleeing a pending flood) was potentially as strong, but the character threads felt flat.

The three main characters: Sid, Manny and Diago, already had their characters formed in the first movie, so little was done with them. In fact, they sometimes seem a little too comfortable with each other for much "chemstry" to come through.  The two opossum brothers came across as fairly two-dimensional punks for whom the viewer has a hard time caring if they survive or not.  The fact that they do, gives little joy.

Ellie, as the identity-confused mammoth is interesting, but her beligerence gets a bit tiring.

The survive-the-flood plot line gets cut off at the knees in the end. The flood -does- occur, but another ice dam breaks releasing all the water. The danger proves to be very temporary, so the heroics were far less necessary.  Similarly, once the herd of other mammoths appears, it seriously undercuts the value of Manny and Ellie learing to like each other. In the end, so much that went before just didn't matter.

Still, for fans of the first movie, there are some great lines. Scrat is irrepressible as ever. His time-travel short is hilarious.
