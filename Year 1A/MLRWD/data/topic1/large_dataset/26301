Okay this movie is a hilarious and fun horror trip, you have awesome actor/rapper ( Ice T ) who with a friend in an underground subway line break through a wall in search of a magical golden flute that can control peoples minds when played. They find more then that they also find the pot of gold and the leprechaun ( Warick Davis ) who was turned into a statue thanks to the 4 leaf clover necklace around his neck. Ice T's friend takes it off and the little monster is free again but during a struggle and as luck would have it the necklace that was sent flying during the struggle lands on the little devil right around his neck turning him into a statue again

Later on three young rappers seeking to get a recording contract go to Ice T aka Mack Daddy who has since become a big time record producer, they do clean positive rap but boss man Ice T wants them to perform hardcore nasty stuff. While there they see the leprechaun inside a glass case sitting on the floor. They don't want to do hardcore rap there is a disagreement then they leave. Late at night the three break into Mack Daddy's office to rob it while searching the glass case is broken and the leprechaun is set loose upon the earth he reaks bloody havoc and leaves a trail of bodies in his quest to retrieve his flute and gold, the leprechaun and Ice T wind up in a battle, and trying to survive the boys wind up in a life and death battle against Mack Daddy, and the leprechaun

During his search the leprechaun goes to a neighborhood where he is introduced to new things reefer being one of them and the little devil smokes marijuana loves it and get's stoned he is hilarious. He also has his own harem made up of the sexiest prostitutes in the neighborhood under his control. High on weed he is a fun loving joking holy terror, and one lecherous lusting little dude, this film also features some great rap music, at the end the leprechaun/Warick Davis performs a rap piece that is really quite good while the girls dance,

I strongly suggest when watching this comic horror masterpiece make sure you aren't drinking anything because you will be laughing so hard it will fly out of your mouth ( Leprechaun Back To The Hood ) is good and it's actors are top notch but I favor this one. I am very happy with this
