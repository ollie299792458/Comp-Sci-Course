This movie does not use surrealism.  There is no contradictions of time and location. There is no acting out of dreams.  It only feels surreal.  This movie is Satanic, not surreal.  It feels surreal because of some stylistic decisions the director made, but primarily because of the contradictory and opposite emotions associated with all of the suffering and torment that the characters experience.  When tragedy strikes instead of sadness, regret and compassion, there is laughter, glee and revelry.  This movie is philosophically Satanic.  It embraces the torment of others: when the fires are burning up everything and everyone runs for their lives in horror, the star is rejoicing and explicitly professing his extreme happiness and just soaking it all in. There is even a cameo of Lucifer laughing at it all.  It embraces suicide.  It laughs at the pain of others. Betrayal is not denigrated.  Promises mean nothing. This is not a "dark comedy"; it is just plain dark and twisted. Wash up after watching this sick thing.
