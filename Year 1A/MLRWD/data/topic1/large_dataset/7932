Everything about this film is picture, absolutely, Perfect.  The character Harold is beautifully, yet realistically, acted by the talented Bud Cort, and Ruth Gordon makes the movie a classic with her portrayal of the life-loving Maude.  There are many things I adore and "Harold and Maude", from the costumes to the hilarious lines to the ageless (literally) love story, but I think that it's ability to make an impression on people of any age, my parents love it and I absolutely adore it, is a rare quality in a film.  To the people who say that Harold and Maude's relationship is "creepy", they obviously do not understand the point, or much else about life, I'm afraid.  I would say that this movie would be entertaining, and maybe even life changing, to anyone who contemplates death a la Harry Burns in "When Harry Met Sally", likes the satiric and alternative look at the world as in "Fight Club" (without the violence), is un peu depressed, or just wants to see something really fabulous, uplifting, and incredibly delightful!
