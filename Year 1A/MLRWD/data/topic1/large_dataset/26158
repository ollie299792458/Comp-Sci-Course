Where on earth did you get "John Barkley"?  Amazon should enlarge and look at it's own pictured product. They will see Walter Huston who plays the main character "Dodsworth" magnific
ently. Any movie lover should be familiar with his name if only because John Huston is his son. He directed his own father in the much loved classic "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre".  He plays the old geezer who almost steals the show from Humphrey Bogart which is quite a feat.  Dodsworth is one of his many outstanding performances, which he played on Broadway before the movie.

It is unexcusable not to credit him, and I will not buy this product from Amazon until it gets its information straight.  The main stars of this great and very appealing even now movie are Huston, Mary Astor, Ruth
Chatterton and Paul Lukas, and it was directed by William Wyler. It is a superbly acted and unusually mature must see for any true movie buff.

Will Amazon read this?  I doubt it, and it will continue to insult a great actor and a great movie with ridiculously wrong information.
