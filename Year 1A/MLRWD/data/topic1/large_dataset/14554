This is one of only a handful of movies that I continue to pull out and watch time and again. I haven't seen the DVD version and my VHS version is recorded in EP format from another VHS and even though the picture quality  is slightly less than I would like, it still in no way diminishes the fact  that this is a true classic and comedy masterpiece. Anyone who  "experienced" that era (i.e. mid 70's thru mid 80's) would have  to enjoy this movie. The opportunity to see great stars in the earliest  stages of their career, not having even the slightest hint of what a great  movie they were making just adds to the movie's greatness even though it  seems like most of the actors and actresses involved now try to distance  themselves from this movie. Especially Judge Reinhold, who has nothing to  fear. He has established himself as a great actor and a similar scene in  "Something About Mary" has all but made Ben Stiller a star. All  the characters are well developed and acted and so, so believable. I think  that's what really makes the movie work...it's believeability. Ignore the  cultural naysayers and just "...wing on over to London and party with  Mick and the Stones...". Buy It, Rent It, Live It!
