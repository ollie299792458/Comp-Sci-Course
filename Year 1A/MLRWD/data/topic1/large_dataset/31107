I watched this movie after having heard a very great deal about it: that it was the best movie ever, that it was incredibly over-rated, that it was good only for the innovations in direction and cinematography, that it was plotless and boring, and (of course) that Rosebud was Kane's sled. My conclusion? This film is amazing. Honestly, I know very little about the movie making- I'm not in film class, I have never directed anything, and I don't even particularly enjoy behind-the-scenes documentaries; my qualifications lie far more in literature. As a result, I was interested more in the plot and characterizations in this film than I was in the manner in which it was filmed. It was my feeling that not only was this movie breathtaking in it's portrait of Kane, one of the most fascinating characters I have come across in movies or books, but the narrative structure was entrancing without being gimmicky- it jumped through time with as little pause as a Tarantino movie, gradually revealing backstory a la Memento without the inherent inhumanity of a movie about a person to whom virtually no audience member can relate. All in all, I thought this movie far from inaccessible, and I think that one can justifiably call it the best American movie ever made.
