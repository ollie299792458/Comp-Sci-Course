I love this book.

Some background: I took up golf a year ago. I'm a self-taught golfer, 0 lessons, and I learned my swing from a few books. For full disclosure, the ones I referred to most often were <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743267125">Golf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KE5UCM">Practical Golf</a>, and this one.

Well, all credit to where credit is due for Mr. Nicklaus, and I think Practical Golf is a very good book as well. They're both classics in the golf instruction world, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671723014">Ben Hogan's Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf</a>. But I found out that this is what I needed, and is the only book I refer to now for the full swing.

I shot an 80 from the back tees two months ago, a feat I directly attribute to the long game improvement I gained from this book. I'm a 14 handicap and dropping. I gave it to my dad for Christmas; he's been golfing for 20 years, and he hits the ball farther than he ever has at almost 60 years old. Now he's consistently shooting in the 70s for the first time in his life.

This book is not about gimmicks, and it's not a "new" swing (such as Stack and Tilt). Rather, it provides a clear and excellent explanatory model to help you develop the feeling of a professional caliber conventional swing, and get the sort of easy rhythm you see from guys like Fred Couples. Using the lighthouse turn drill, which is literally the ONLY drill I use for swing practice, you develop the easy, flowing, coordinated turn required to hit crisp golf shots.

Learning the swing this way helps you get rid of all of those obnoxious (frequently negative) swing thoughts about your knees, your head, your elbows, your hips, etc., and just focuses you on turning freely. You don't think about your knee flex and your elbow angle when you shoot a free throw; you just trust your shot to take the ball to the target. This book will help you play golf that way. Good luck, and swing easy.
