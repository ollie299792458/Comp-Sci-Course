One story from 5 different character's points of view. The most significant event happens at 11:14pm, hence the title 11:14. This is a story about how each character's actions happen to affect the fates of the other characters. One night, 5 different perspectives, and all the actions that determine their fates. This is 11:14.

Personally, I thought this was a great movie. But if you happen to be the type of person who will only watch movies with a dramatic story and deeper meaning to it, then this isn't the movie for you. Technically, this movie has no true point to it. It's really hard to explain but there's definitely something about this film that just grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the entire story.

Now, if you happen to like or don't mind movies that don't have a deep & meaningful story, then you'll absolutely love this movie. I would have to say though, that most people will watch this only because one or more of their favorite actors/actresses are in it....

You've got Henry Thomas(E.T., Gangs of New York), Patrick Swayze(Dirty Dancing, Ghost), Hilary Swank(Million Dollar Baby), Rachel Leigh Cook(She's All That, Into the West), Shawn Hatosy(John Q, Faculty).
