"Treasures" has long been one of my FAV Films. The Ansel Adams photography, the classical greed plot, the marvelous dialogue, the swift, sharp lines from Bogey--all thing these things embraced with Max Steiner's score and you have a masterpiece. My favorite lines are Howard's warning about what gold can do to a man's soul, and then later, when he finds traces of the evil stuff, he himself is the first to spin out of control as he dances his famous jig.
Even so, this particular album includes a spellbinding story of John Huston's career as a director. His forte involved going to remote locations like jungles, mountain sides, the great plains, even the ocean. His cast and his crew even his friends went on these rigorous expeditions sometimes lasting for weeks or months. Huston seemed to enjoy these parties even as he scrutinized every detail.
Of special interest to me was the interview with Arthur Miller, the famed playwriter and sometime husband to Marilyn Monroe. Here he expounds on Huston's  belief that Humanity does not fit into this hostile universe. The powers that be have created a world that engulfs and destroy's people without mercy. He then goes on to explain how (after shooting "The Misfits") Gable dies of a heart attack, and Marilyn OD's.
There is even a lingering suggestion that Huston's passion for rugged action killed both of them even as it gave them a measure of immortality. Helluva a price to pay just to star in a movie! All serious students of great film should study this entire album, a Treasure extracted from Terror with a delicate touch.
Remember Howard's line,"You gotta tickle her."
