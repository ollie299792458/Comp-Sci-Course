The earliest days of heavier-than-air aviation were romantic indeed, with the aviators of the time being the cultural equivalent of today's astronauts.  In that context, an air race is organized from England across the English Channel for a variety of airplanes, in order to see which designs would advance the art of flying.

Invitations to the race are sent worldwide, and entrants from many countries bring their airplanes to the starting field, and al,l practice before the race is scheduled.  Of course, each entrant's hangar and vicinity reflects the entrant's country, and the cultural differences make a fine contrast.  However, what's interesting is that while the culturres are contrasted, nothing is done maliciously.

The film was shot before GCI, and many of the old planes actually were airworthy.  There are numerous views of colorful models of early airplanes in flight.

But this is a comedy, so many of the situations are humorous, but the humor is gentle, provoking chuckles rather than belly laughs.  Once the race actually starts, the difficulties that some of the contesnders face are believable, but humorous.

The very end of the film is not as effective as when the film was first released, but that shouldn't affect the film's basic story.  It's a film that can ve viewed by the whole family, but it's not the standard "family film."  Just a lot of fun.
