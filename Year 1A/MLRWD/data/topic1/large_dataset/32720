I didn't kind this movie to be scary. I imagine this movie is considered scary because it was fresh and terrifing BACK THEN. If this film were released now, i doubt it would be a "horrifing thriller" if it were released now. People remember it as scary because nothing like it was out.Tobe Hooper did an excellent job though.  I was only scared once during this entire movie. Sure, that wonderful shot of Carol-Anne in front of the TV in the night is super-creepy, but thats it. The clown scene was not all that scary, but when the little boy finishes looking under the bed and the toy is right there, I jumped. But, i was never actually SCARED. I was suprised. In fact, not to bash on this movie, but I was more scared in Three Men and a Baby when the "ghost child" appeared.

  This movie is very entertaning. It is perfect for watching on TV on a lazy Saturday afternoon. I really enjoyed myself, but it is not what it is supposed ot be. I find it wierd i'm now one of those people who watchg horror movies to pass the time, but this does it for me.
