"Dark Corner" is one of the weaker entries in the Fox Noir series.  The biggest problem is that Lucille Ball and Mark Stevens have zero chemistry.  Her character has no depth, no past and no back story which makes it impossible to understand what she finds attractive about him.  And she's not attractive enough nor carries herself with enough sex appeal to make it believeable that he's interested in her.  Bendix is good, as is Webb, but they're not so good as to make this film worth owning.  The pace is rather slow, and there's no build to the climax.  And after the film makes such a big deal about Lucy wanting to participate in the case, she's totally missing from the payoff.  I suppose it's a curiosity for Lucy fans, but don't approach this thinking it's a good film -- it's far from it.  For some better films in the Fox Noir series, try "Nightmare Alley," "Laura," "The House on 92nd Street" and "Where the Sidewalk Ends."  And Universal has "This Gun For Hire," one of the very best in the genre.
