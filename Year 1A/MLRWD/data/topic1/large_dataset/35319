What's great about the Clerks Collector's Edition DVD is watching it scene by scene.  I did that one weekend afternoon: I'd watch a scene, then I'd go back, turn on the commentary from Kevin Smith, et al, and be entertained.  I learned several things:
1.  Smith originally wanted to play Randall, but decided that he couldn't be a major character and direct the film without going nuts.  Instead, he became Silent Bob.  The world hasn't been the same since.
2.  The idea for Mallrats came out of a guy at Sundance wanting to re-shoot Clerks as an A-movie, with color.  That's one big reason that Mallrats is just as much a "buddy movie" as Clerks is.
3.  The scenes with Randall randomly driving through town are completely incorrect--they're going nowhere near the funeral home they end up defacing later on in the movie.
4.  The guy who owned the funeral home really didn't expect them, and wasn't too happy with them.
There's plenty more, but for the insight into the world of the Jersey Trilogy, this is a good bet.
