This movie is not as bad as these reviews would make one think, as long as the viewer knows what he's getting himself into.  It's just a teen-type flick about a couple of "gamers" who play a game that eventually kills or tries to kill them in "real" life. (In exactly the order one would suspect)  Yes, the characters are stereotypically portrayed.  There's the foul-mouthed, annoying jerk who most pray will meet his maker ASAP.  The goth girl who has built up a tough exterior, creepy Eddie from "Friends" as the creepy boss from this movie, the totally annoying "Malcom in the middle" kid, and so on. It is what it is.  Don't expect more and it is entertaining. To address a previous reviewer that accused this movie of not being true to games ("first person doesn't have multiplayer...") Hello, dude.  In reality, last time I checked games also don't kill you. This isn't based on a true story. By the way, if you willingly watched a movie with that "Malcom in the middle" kid in it, you shouldn't be so shocked that it doesn't turn out to be Oscar-worthy.
