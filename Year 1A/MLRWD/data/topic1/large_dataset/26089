This season was weak. I loved season 1 and 2. In this season there is too much importance given to sex (scenes with King jerking off in bed are not necessary and greatly cheapen the overall effect of the Tudors saga). Also Catharine Howard is portrayed as a simple minded slut. In reality she was a living breathing woman with a brain who was forced into marrying the king who was double her age in order to elevate the Howard family in court. She  was charitable (she sent blankets to prisoners in the Tower), she tried to promote mercy in the king's judgements against others, she faced her destiny bravely. This was portrayed much better in King Henry VII starring Emily Blunt.  It is quite frankly degrading to women and history to turn the tragic story of a beautiful, naieve but brave queen who was forced into a marriage with an old man (king henry Vii) and turn it into a story about a mindless, giggly, stereotypical slut. No one is that one-dimensional.  I hope Michael Hirst lowers the sex craze and increases the depth of character to create a memorable and moving character as well as storyline.
