I think this is an excellent, if not close to perfect, second installment in the series. We are now drawn deeper into some of the characters, "warts and all" as they say. A big part of the Iron Man story is that of redemption; not just physical redemption from the terrorists in the first movie, but the emotional and spiritual redemption from the many vices of Tony Stark. If these aspects of Stark are only given a surface treatment, there's no idea of why Tony is driven to continue to be Iron Man. The ghost of his father, the demon in the bottle, and the self-destructive behaviors all drive Tony to a need for redemption and salvation.

True, this isn't a solid, start-to-end, nothing-but-explosions action movie. There is actually some character development and interpersonal relationship development (Tony-Pepper, Tony-Rhodes, Tony-Fury, etc.) that all tie together the motivations behind Tony Stark/Iron Man. Without this, the character makes no sense.

But, there is plenty of action. The final battle probably has more action than most action movies, it's just packed into the last 1/4 of the film instead of spread out here and there.

I think this movie seems more real, as well. People seem to be searching for words, people talk over each other instead of waiting until A is done before B starts to talk.

The additional material would be worth the price alone. There are hours of stuff to watch, and I haven't gotten through all of it yet. It's nice that instead of just Iron Man, a large part of the Marvel universe is explored and shown how it ties together.

I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo set...there is something here for everyone.
