The acting was spectacular. They played their parts well; it was like I was watching a few real teenagers goofing around.
When I first realized it was a documentary style film, I cringed. I find them tacky and difficult to watch. I don't care too much for the shaking and the lack of professionalism that comes with a commercial film. However, most of the film was not shacking. In fact, a great deal of it was smooth and moved like a camera would in a normal movie. Of course, it was because they controlled it with their minds. Either way, it really helped take away the tacky parts that usually comes with documentary films. Another thing I like about how it was filmed was that it wasn't just one camera; it was under the premise that these tapes were found later, so were able to job from one angle to another as if it was professionally made.

Now all this, along with a great story line, amazing acting, and characters that I felt like I could relate to, made it a great movie. It had enough of the documentary style to it to make you feel like it was real and like you were there with them, while still holding on to the strengths of a normal film.

This movie was awesome! I pity them, but I also envy them.
