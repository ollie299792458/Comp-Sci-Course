I did not see K-19 in theater and rented it for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from it, but what I got was a movie that I'm glad I have seen, but that I did not enjoy watching.
K-19 is painful. There is very little humor and a lot of difficult, life changing decisions. While I can appreciate the need at times to send men to their death, it is not something I enjoy watching. However, I understand this movie is intended to portray an actual event and I am glad if the crew of the Widowmaker can finally have recognition for their bravery, even if it comes long after some of them have died.
As for the movie aspects, there is little plot here, other than the crew's attempts to prepare their ship for battle and then to save it from nuclear meltdown. I felt the acting was decent, although I had some trouble keeping the younger members of the crew straight. Harrison Ford is getting older, but his age played well here.
Since I know little about nuclear submarines, the technical aspects are beyond me. However, the Russian darkness was present.
Can I recommend this movie? If you're a submarine or war buff, probably. But if you want action, a story line, and a little humor, probably not. K-19 makes widows, not entertainment.
