Through his excellent website (Word on Fire), YouTube videos, public presentations, recorded retreats, and many books (both popular and scholarly), Fr. Robert Barron has shown himself to be one of the most effective, likeable, and gifted Catholic commentators alive today.  He has a talent for explaining the core elements of the Catholic faith in the clearest and most engaging way possible, as quick to quote Bob Dylan as Thomas Aquinas or G. K. Chesterton.  One often hears comparisons between Fr. Barron and the great Fulton Sheen, and while the comparison may not apply in terms of style I would certainly agree where the substance of their teaching is concerned.  Inspired by Sir Kenneth Clark's 1969 BBC series Civilisation, Fr. Barron set out some years ago to do something similar for the Catholic faith, believing that the story of the Catholic Church is being told by too many people who are getting it wrong on a number of levels.  This series is the grand and glorious result, a labor of love by one who loves the Catholic faith and wants as many people as possible to understand it in its fullness.  There is much to commend this series, but I think what really sets it apart -- aside from the glorious visuals and the contemporary spins on traditional music -- is that Fr. Barron refuses to water down the intellectual riches of the Catholic faith in an effort to appeal to a wider audience.  This is no dumbed-down Catholicism, and yet it's not the least bit stuffy or dry.  If you want a real boost for yourself, or if you have always looked for a good resource to share with your non-Catholic friends or family, look no further than this DVD series and its companion book!
