Warner Brothers pioneered talking pictures with THE JAZZ SINGER back in 1927 and they continued to set trends in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS when they started the "Giant monster awakened by atom bomb" genre.
  A thermo nuclear bomb  brings a giant dinosaur (a fictional "Rhedosaurus" which we are told is "the direct ancestor of [a Brontosaurus] only twice the size . . .").  After sinking a few ships and demolishing a lighthouse the beast makes for its old hunting grounds . . .which just happens to be downtown New York City!  Ray Harryhausen's masterful animation convinces you there really is a dinosaur walking around lower Manhattan and the suspence is quite genuine.  The monster proves to be a double threat.  Not only is he invincible to modern weapons but he also carries prehistoric germs which spread a disease we have no way of coping with.
  Paul Christian (a German actor whose real name was Paul Hubschmidt) is the hero, Paula Corday (who would go on to appear opposite John Agar in HAND OF DEATH) is the heroine and lovable Cecil Kellaway (THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS, 1940) is the venerable old scientist.  Kenneth Tobey (THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD) represents the military and watch for Lee Van Cleef in an early role as a sharpshooter.
  This one is a must to add to any S/F collection.  Let's hope Warner Home Video has restored the colour tints to the scene where Cecil Kellaway makes his ill-fated search for the Beast underwater in a diving bell.
