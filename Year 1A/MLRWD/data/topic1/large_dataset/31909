Poor Jane Austen.  It's a pity that no one tossed a dose of dramamine into her casket to help assuage the pitching, rolling and spinning she would have to endure over this rubbish.

Shame on the BBC (and the Arts & Entertainment Network) for palming off this dog of a production onto the world.  Let's start with the first offender ... the screenwriter, Maggie Wadey.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say she actually read the novel, but I dare say she did not understand it.  She single handedly turned it into what Jane Austin was satirizing ... the Gothic novel!  This isn't Wadey's first offense either ... she has butchered more than her fair share of classic novels by consistently trying to re-invent the "concept" of the wheel, so why the BBC kept her telephone number in their rolodex is a mystery.

But to be fair, she doesn't get ALL the blame.  The direction and production values also receive dreadful marks.  Hammy acting, over the top costumes, and terrible pacing render this too painful to watch.  Whatever they spent making this lavish flop could have been put to better use, such as donating all the money to a homeless shelter or soup kitchen.

If you REALLY want to see Jane Austen works that were treated with sensitivity and respect, then you're far better off watching Emma Thompson's awe-inspiring "Sense and Sensibility" or, pick up the outstanding 1995 version of "Pride and Prejudice" ... even "Emma" with Gwyneth Paltrow's pseudo-British accent is better than this drivel.

Don't waste your money ... or your time.
