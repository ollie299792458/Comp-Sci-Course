Bereavement is an Indie prequel film to the slasher movie Malevolence, which is not a widely known film due to it's low budget. This film starts out with a kidnapping of a 6 year old boy in 1989, who has CIPA (Congenital Insensitivity To Pain W/ Anhidrosis), which is an extremely rare inherited disorder of the nerves which prevents the sensation of pain, heat or cold, in addition to the inability to sweat. There are only 84 cases in the US and most children never live to see the age of 3, making the odds of a serial slasher to kidnap a child with this rarest of diseases hard to believe.

The film then moves on to 1994, 5 years later, where the slasher seems to be living comfortably with his kidnapped child in his father's long abadoned meat slaughter plant and house. This is where the film brings in 2 more families who will unfortunately cross paths with the slasher and his adopted son. The story line moves well when introducing more characters, but when the characters gradually move out of the film, the ending becomes predictable.

Ever since seeing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, slasher fims are basically the same- waiting for the slasher to attack, seeing the slashing and waiting to see when and if the slasher will get it in the end. What makes this film different, is it begins as a kidnapping, moves into other families lives while intertwining the two. I've never seen such horrible child abuse of this little boy, which was quite hard to watch. It truly hurt to see that precious little boy tortured and scarred by a madman who listens to cow skulls, and the ending was totally predictable making it another just above average slasher film.
