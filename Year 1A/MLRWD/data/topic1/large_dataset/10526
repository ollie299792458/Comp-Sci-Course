Most of what people know about Asoka is pure fantasy.  For example, it is widely believed that Ashoka, out of disgust and sorrow over all the blood he shed, renounces violence and becomes a Buddhist.  The details about this, however, comes from text written several hundred years after his death.  Historic fact is that he probably did not become a Buddhist, and he became the model emperor in order to peacefully consolidate his conquests.  If he had renounced violence and was sorry for what he had done, why did he not return the land he had taken?  Any good history book will clarify this.

Now, about the film:

The film Asoka takes the fantasy, and fantasizes about it, creating a whole new level of fantasy, which is the story the film follows.  It is pure Bollywood melodrama:  boy meets girl, they fall in love, they get separated, boy thinks girl dies, boy eventually remarries, invades her country, and fights her army in  battle.  Okay, the last bit doesn't fit any of the normal formulas.

Having said all of that, if you accept that almost nothing of the  story is at all factual, and that it is a "heightened emotional drama", as is the usual case with Indian films, then Asoka is quite an enjoyable film.  The story has its own interest, and the song and dance bits are fascinating.  The cinematography is quite good by Bollywood standards.  So, judging it purely on the basis of its own story, and by the expectations of a Bollywood film, I give it four stars.
