This was a truly moving movie. Many others have written about that and about the triumph of the human spirit this true story shows us. So, I will focus on the fact that the true story of Antwone Fisher also shows us all (or those of us brave enough to view it) that abuse is not a gender issue.

 Mr. Fisher suffered from domestic violence and sexual abuse at the hands of women who were entrusted to care for him. Moreover, his father truly was a "deadbeat dad" in the sense that he was killed by his girlfried. And, Mr. Fisher's mother abandoned him and never took responsibility for his care.

 In this age of hysteria over domestic violence against women, we should all remember the life of Antwone Fisher. I would venture a guess that this movie did not receive recognition during the Acadamy Awards because it protrays the reality that abuse is not a gender issue, but a human issue, and this is far too controversial for a society (and a Hollywood) full of political slogans and political pandering to radical feminists that can only paint woman as victims instead of the abusers they are capable of being. Ironically, the power of this movie lies precisely in the fact that Mr. Fisher choose not to be a victim.
