Before I start this review, let me just say that at 30 years old, I still have a soft spot for most animated movies.  I have seen every Disney/Pixar movie including this one.  When I saw the trailer for Cars before a showing of The Incredibles (the ONLY Pixar movie I own), I knew I had to see it.  Now on to my review:

After last year's dark but brilliantly done The Incredibles, Pixar decided to do a lighter and more family-friendly movie.

I saw Cars the day after it was released, and the animation is just as stunning as most of Pixar's other movies (except Incredibles which was better).  The actors providing the voices were fantastic, including Paul Newman, who voices the wise Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hornet.  While the plot was not a new one, it was great nevertheless. I especailly liked the subplot of Lightning McQueen and his love interest, a Porsche named Sally Carrera. However, the plot does drag a little bit, but the kids (ages 2 - 10) that were in the theater with me were entertained.

You have to stick around for the end credits - as with all Disney/Pixar movies, you never know what they'll do during the credits!  The short that preceded the movie, "One Man Band" was cute - it used only music and animation, not dialogue, to tell the story of two one man bands competing for a child's coin.

As I walked out of the theater smiling, there was a big crowd waiting for the next showing. I knew that Pixar would have another hit, and I was right.
