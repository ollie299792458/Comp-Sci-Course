I agree with some some that the movie is slow at times but we can not watch films and expect to get the same feeling every time.  I particularly liked the innovativeness for the late fifties and the contrast between two very different worlds. This film won an award because it was witty, insightful, and again quite clever for the era.  He was poking fun at techies and their lifestyle. this is not the kind of movie that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat but it will display a side of the French that few did at that time period. If Tati did not elaborate the relationship between the characters that is because it was not his purpose, again people are used to experiencing certain kinds of feeling when they watch a movie and when they dont get it they feel as if the movie is boring.  You have to watch this movie as if it is the first you have ever seen and then you will experience the creativeness of the directors work.  Personally I appreciated it tremendously and loved the music.
