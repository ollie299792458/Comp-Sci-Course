Two decades is a pretty long time for any society in the modern world. This movie is 17 years old and much has changed in Hindi Filmdom and also in India over these years. I do not want to talk about the script of this movie or about other technical things. This is a cult movie and most of you who are reading this would have watched it at least once. 17 years on, I can't help but think why this movie was such a success.
It can NOT be for Kajol's beauty (She is no Katrina Kaif) or for her histrionics. She is downright UGLY on the first count and I would rate even Amisha Patel higher than her when it comes to the latter. So what really worked to make this movie what it is?
Obviously, a successful movie is a sum total of many parts, which have to compliment each other to make a movie memorable. Music, situations, fun moments, all are present in measured doses, but all this can not make a movie have sustainable appeal. The very fact that this movie even today holds my interest, makes me think about that overriding factor which makes this movie timeless.
I am no Shah Rukh Khan fan BUT in this movie he brought to the screen what not many before him could. ENERGY. Every shot which has been picturised on him is replete with energy - uplifting, infectious energy so much so that even in the scenes in which he is NOT there, the audience can still feel that energy as if he has kept it in a stretched catapult, waiting to release it. And because we Indians are a pensive lot, we get moved by such energy. It is something that we are so devoid of in real life that we love to experience it vicariously. In fact, Shah Rukh Khan, even to this date exudes this energy, which is why I liked "Don 2". I have never been a Shah Rukh fan , no sir, but I need to give credit where it is due.
