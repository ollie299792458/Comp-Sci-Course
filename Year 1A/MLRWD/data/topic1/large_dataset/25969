This is a great transfer to Blu-ray, despite the disc's discount price, and is likely the best this film will ever look.  It's a marked improvement over the DVD.

The picture is great.  The disc's bitrate averages around 35-36 Mbps.  The blacks and shadow detail are deep.  The color is accurate, bringing out the depressing greens of fluorescent lighting and blues of the night lighting, along with the warm natural outdoor shots of Coney Island.  Grain is very present but there is no visible digital noise reduction (DNR) applied.  There is maybe just a hint of edge-enhancement, but it's not offensive and not visible in normal scenes.  The film looks soft and hazy at times, but only due to the cinematographer's use of soft-focus filters.  When the image is meant to be crisp, it is.  You can see the detail in Jennifer Connelly's skin and Marlon Wayans' stubble.

The lossless audio is great in DTS-HD 7.1, really highlighting Clint Mansell's score and the sounds of the Kronos Quartet.  The hallucinations of Ellen Burstyn's character sound creepy and scary.

The extras are the same as on the DVD.  They include a commentary by the director, Darren Aronofsky, a very detailed commentary by the cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, deleted scenes, a making-of, an interview by Ellen Burstyn of the author of the original book, Hubert Selby Jr., and the usual trailers and TV spots, including the uncut TV infomercial that plays a large role in Ellen Burstyn's character's motivation.

A great presentation of this indie film!
