I love being scared. I started watching horror movies as far back as 4 years old. I even made it a point to rent every horror movie at both of my local video stores. And if a movie gave me nightmares for 2 days, I wanted to find one that would make it 3. It could've been anything. Later on I'd realise I was exposed not only from the standard American horror legends like Romero to Raimi, but also Bava and Argento from Italy and of course Hitchcock.

While that was a good long run, I became desensitised at a fairly early age by slasher and/or gore films. Only few films would leave lasting impressions on my psyche. Then I came across asian horror. Japanese staples like Ringu and Ju On were instantly in a different league. The off kilter timing and sincerity in telling a story wouldn't just scare the fairly jaded horror movie fan in me, it would shake every fibre of my being. The paranoia I felt after seeing movies like Begotten or Silence of the Lambs or even the last scene in Blair Witch could not compare to the atmosphere built by the aforementioned movies. With Asia restoring my faith in the genre, I branched out even further. And this is where The Eye comes in.

The Eye is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life. Short of spoilers, that's the best description I can give. For what it is, it's the perfect movie in it's genre. It literally immerses you into the atmosphere and spits you out without a moment's notice. I personally felt like a deer in headlights each time, stronger than the last. And when it's all over, life itself can feel like a nightmare. At least for a while. I no longer love being scared. I am simply terrified.

Watch this movie at 2 in the morning alone with the lights off.
