Considering a good print of this film on VHS has cost [money] for years(I bought mine 6 years ago)this is such a deal conisdering all the great extras they decided to throw in for good measure. First off I have viewed other Criterion DVDs and found the print used in the Home Vision VHS tape was actually better than the print used for the DVD!! Not the case with THE THIRD MAN, and to prove it they have given us a deminstration on the improvement of the print on the extras. What makes this truely special isnt the Orson Welles radio broadcast which you will never find anywhere, or the various vocal openings but the film itself!! I fell in love with this film instantly a few years ago after first viewing amd after watching this film monthly ever since it hasnt lost a touch of its energy and brilliance. I always feel that film although has a very serious subject matter of selling poisioned medicine is almost comic in its lightheartedness. Anyone who has seen the film has to admit they liked even some of the bad guys in it. Who can deny the ending in the genuine sewers of Viennia is filmmaking at its height, and yes there is and extra of newsreel footage on the sewers alone and the police that patrolled them in Viennia after WWII. Do buy this if you strapped for cash get it used buy it new just plain buy it.
