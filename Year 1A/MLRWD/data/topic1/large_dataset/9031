Three years after this, Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar is about to complete his new film "Mar Adentro" ("Deep into the Sea"). In fact, he took another three years to make "The Others" and of course I expect three years are a well deserved wait.
Yes, "The Others" has it. Horror scenes make your heart speed up, the sense of the story makes you thrill until the end, direction, acting and screenplay (and even music, composed by himself) make this one of the best movies of the recently started century.
What can I say of the end? It's the thing you'll never expect. It's the thing you should never say to anybody. Actually, Mr. Rodrigo Rato, former Spanish Minister of Economy and now President of the World Monetary Fund, revealed it in a session of the Congress in Spain. What a shame!
But when you can count with the "lady in fashion" to play the character of Grace, the succes is more than guaranteed. Everybody says Nicole Kidman has nothing to demonstrate in a drama movie. Her acting is marvellous, as well as Fionulla Flanagan, as the main servant of the house.
The contrast of clear and dark scenes is of a great quality. I should have even preferred this movie to be film in black and white as those are its main colours. It could be even more terrifying.
There's too much to see: rent it, buy it or even borrow it. And don't miss any scene!
