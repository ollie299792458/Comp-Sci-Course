Very Noisy, Snoringly and Extremely Boring Movie. Very Annoying Loud Swashbuckling Music Type Score keeps thundering, when people are only lumbering about, walking around, making entrances..and doing absolutely nothing

Perhaps this is why people think it's a swashbuckling movie, because of the music, meanwhile nothing is going on.It's only an illusion..

Very little dialogue, with an attempt to hide this fact, by playing loud music, and constantly showing those damn ships, that I am sure Warner's paid plenty for, and wanted to get their money's worth..

Aside from Claude Rains, who can't help but be good, the others appear to be sleepwalking, waiting for the music to start, or stop, while reciting simpleton, sparse lines, like zombies, or as if were hypnotized.

This is not a swashbuckler, but pure trash..Robin Hood, w/ E. Flynn, or Zorro, w/ T. Power, and Both w/ the great Basil Rathbone, were swashbuckling movies..not this noise box..

Don't waste your time w/ this very annoying, and insulting dudd.It was just a Warner war (WWII) support vehicle, that had nothing to do w/ the novel..God bless Warner for that. But the movie is real trash.
