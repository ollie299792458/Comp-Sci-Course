As a parent I have to screen movies before I let my children watch them and I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. There are no sexual implications, there was one cuss word "the A word" but it was pretty funny where it was placed , There were 3 occurances where God's name is used as a cuss word (easily muted) (where Robin williams comes in and he is slapping the monkey...the implications are crude you can just mute that part)(where he gives the speech to come to gether) (where the girl meets Sacagaweea at the end of the movie)..thats as bad as it got and I easily took care of it all w/ the mute button. On Ben Stiller Ive always found his humor very funny. There is really though only one scene that is classic Ben Stiller...still my children thought it was pretty hillarious. I think your kids will like it and it also gives you alot of historical topics to even further explore if your a home educator or just would like to spurn a love for history. I appreciate the movie producers on this one finally some are catching on to the fact parents want clean movies to watch with their children. This one was worth the rental fee... not worth the library (IMO) but def worth a block buster rental.
