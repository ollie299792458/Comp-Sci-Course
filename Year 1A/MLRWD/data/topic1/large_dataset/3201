I will admit that I haven't seen "On Her Majesty's Secret Service on VHS or DVD, just television.
This movie strikes me as being a stepchild of the Bond family. Only "Casino Royale" has less in common with the series.  Even the independently-produced "Never Say Never Again" had the familiar presence of Sean Connery.
From what I've read on the Internet, OHMSS was intended to be closer to the book on which it was based than the previous Bond movies, and George Lazenby's portrayal of James Bond was supposed to be more like the Agent 007 in Ian Fleming's novels.  Since I haven't read any of them, I can't make a judgment on that.
I feel somewhat sorry for George Lazenby.  He strikes me as being a man who had an incredible stroke of good luck but lacked the skills to make the best of it.  His subsequent career in B-movies, perhaps unfairly, seems to vindicate those who criticized his inexperience as an actor.
I believe Telly Savalas as Blofeld was an interesting portrayal, although he struggled to maintain the European "accent" Donald Pleseance and Charles Gray gave the character.  Diana Rigg's turn as vulnerable Tracy Draco was quite a departure from those accustomed to seeing her  as the plucky and steely Emma Peel in "The Avengers".  I think she screamed "James!" a few times too many.  I thought Ilse Steppat made her character, henchwoman Irma Bunt, as memorable as Richard Kiel's "Jaws".  Sadly, she died the same year "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" was released.
One scene I thought inappropriate was where one of Blofeld's skiing henchmen got killed in a manner that would more likely be seen in a "Friday the 13th" movie.
After watching "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" a few nights' ago, I could imagine a scene, right after the ending, where Sean Connery woke up, thus revealing the previous events to be one of 007's dreams.  That's the way the movie seemed to me.
