...I strongly believe that all the things surrounding the movie have their impact. (And the HUGE spoiler in the DVDs' cover is the only reason I haven't buy this movie yet)
Don't get me wrong. I think the movie is fantastic. Charlton Heston did a terrific job portraying the abandon astronaut in an unknown territory. The make up is also one of the greatest assets in the movie, as is the ape city and the landscapes which framed the movie.
But in my opinion, the strenght of the movie relies on its plot: three astronauts, 1 woman and 2 men, are send to another planet in order to settle down a human colony. Things go wrong and suddenly they crashed in an apparent desert spot. Only the two men survived the crash and in no time they find themselves facing a panicked group of humans fleeing from their hunters: Human-sized Apes, riding horses and using rifles and nets. Great scene. Frigthening.
Then, Heston Character finds himself alone, trying to survive an alien Ape society, and running away from the evil ruler of the apes who happens to hide a secret which can change the face of that world for ever, and the perspective of Heston as well.  
I know perhaps everybody knows how the movie ends, but I find beauty in that surprise and that's why I get so angry when I came across the DVD and saw the image. ...
Anyway, it's a movie you should see, whether you liked Sci-Fi thrillers or not. But if you like them, then you should own it... (As I would, when my angers disappears...)
