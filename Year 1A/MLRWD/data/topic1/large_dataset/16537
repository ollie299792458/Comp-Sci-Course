I have never come across more disturbingly warped and disgusting dribble in all my life.

What an awful insult this DVD must be for intelligent and educated christians (even just the barely literate ones for that matter).

My perception of the American White House and it's respectability are ruined forever. I could never think of the White House again without associating it with something awfully wanting in dignity and intellect.

I walked away from this DVD wondering whether our popular news and/or entertainment media would ever return to a standard which might again be embraced by the person of at least average intelligence.

For a while after watching this DVD I could not shake off the disturbing feeling that my intelligence had just been VERY sorely raped. Coming from a man who can endure Rowan Atkinson for hours this presents a particularly bad state of affairs.

What can the producers have been thinking? To halo polish and pompously pronounce the religious qualities of an intellectually impaired, idiotic, warmongering liar like GW Bush to an audience in a way one would reserve for someone of true faith such as Mother Theresa is simply far too much for any human mind to tolerate. I feel the embarrassment my christian friends must feel.

I literally felt nauseous with insult after this movie. The thought that there are actually some of our American cousins out there who really do believe some, and even all, of the filthy distortions in this DVD is quite horrifying.

Don't bother with this one folks, you'd be better off with a really bad porno copy of Enid Blyton's "Noddy and Big Ears" or that great American classic, "My Pet Goat"
