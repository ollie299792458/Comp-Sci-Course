I love Rob Zombie's music, but I've never connected to his films at all. Until now. El Superbeasto is such a bizarre, depraved, joyfest that I couldn't help but smile through the entire movie. It combines the best of Zombie's visual flare with his twisted sensibilities. It has luchadors, a female heroin with an eye patch, Cholos,zombie Nazis,a wonderfully foul-mouthed burlesque dancer, and a villain named Dr. Satan voiced by Paul Giamatti. What more could you ask for?

I hope Zombie will incorporate some of the story techniques he learned from El Superbeasto into his feature films. He is such a talented artist, but his features just don't tell stories that I care about and rarely have characters with any redeeming qualities. I can see him becoming a director mentioned in the same breath with the likes of Martin Scorsese if only he would turn his lens on flawed characters, but ones that have at least a shred of humanity. Travis Bickle is a borderline sociopath, but he redeems himself by trying to protect Jodie Foster's character by going after her pimp and his cronies. Zombie had a co-writer on El Superbeasto (Tom Papa, who also voices the hysterically self-absorbed luchador protagonist). I hope Zombie continues to work with writers in the future, so we can witness his incredible vision, but get out of the nihilistic gorefests he's served up so far when he is the lone writer and director.

I agree with the review that said El Superbeasto is really not an X-rated Scooby Doo, but instead would describe it as Ralph Bakshi meets Looney Tunes. And what a beautiful meet and greet that is.
