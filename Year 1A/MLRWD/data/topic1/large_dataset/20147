When I was a child, I would get up every morning and race to the tv and watch the epic story that was THE TRANSFORMERS.

The happiest day of my life was when at the age of 8 I found out THE TRANSFORMERS was hitting the big screen. When I went to the theater that day, I laughed I cryed and I felt justified by the time I left.  It is one of the most vivid memories I have.

I hadn't watched it in 17 years untill the other day, and it still effected me, the memories, and the "Oh hell ya" feelings came rushing back.

The story of this movie is one that holds together exceptionally, and is a must own for any TRANSFORMERS fan.  The fact that Starscreem gets his kamuppins is more than enough of a reason to see it, and the epic final battle between Optimus and Megatron that ALL fans had been waiting for since 'MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE', is reason itself to buy it.

The fact that Eric Idle,Orsen Wells, and Robert Stack signed on for this movie should be testament enough in the fact of not only is this a fantastic movie, but that THE TRANSFORMERS transended the relm of 22 min commercial to genuine hit.

From the guilty pleasure that comes with listening to the cheesy 80's synthisised music, to the battles, and the vocal talent genious I only have this to say: If you don't have this movie BUY IT!, and if you do WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
