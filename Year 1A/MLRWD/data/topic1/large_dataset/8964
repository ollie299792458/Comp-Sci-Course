I hesitated to buy this one at first because I thought it might be too difficult for me. But I am so glad I did. The first time I did it I felt the burn for about two days afterward. I realized that I really needed this. My navel center has always been a little weak but the more I work on it the more powerful I feel ~ physically and mentally. This DVD makes me feel like I can do anything!!! I look forward to many more wonderful hours with this DVD and a much stronger outlook on myself and my life. Do not hesitate with this one like I did. I only wished I had bought it sooner. It really is a fabulous workout for the core muscles and your mental connection with yourself and the rest of the world. It really works you from the inside out.

I use this one when I feel like I need more willpower. I also alternate it with some of the other ones that work the extremities a little more. That way, if my arms and legs are still sore I can still work out ~ just on a different area. (Then I feel sore from head to toe! LOL!)
