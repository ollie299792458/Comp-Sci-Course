"Killers From Space" is the second release from the "Film Crew".  Three of the members of MST3K have joined together to have another go at schlock.  This movie is ideal for an MST3K-type treatment, and the Crew does a pretty good job at riffing this wiener of a movie.  The plot is that Peter Graves, atomic scientist is forced by the aliens to deliver key test data after reviving him from an otherwise fatal plane crash.  The aliens are mutating a bunch of lizards and insects to destroy all life, so they can move in.  Naturally, no one believes him so he undertakes to shut down the power source the aliens are tapping.  The movie itself is some sort of early Fellini film: bizarre insert shots of closeups, Killers who don't show up for almost 20minutes into the movie and frankly aren't all that threatening, and the smoking.  My goodness, the smoking, folks are lighting up every 10 minutes or so (maybe a tobacco company was a sponsor-not unusual in the 50's).  Is this equivalent to a great MST3K episode?  Well, maybe not a best-effort, but I think it is certainly competitive with the last two seasons of MST3k.  Recommended.
