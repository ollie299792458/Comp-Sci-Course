This a disappointing collection:
"Prince of Foxes". in my opinion the best of the bunch, it could have been better if not by the fatal miscasting of Wanda Hendrix.
"Blood and Sand", as another reviewer pointed out, should have died with Valentino.
"Captain from Castile" although a nice looking film, it is so historically inaccurate and Cesar Romero as Cortez! Had the casting agent done some research he could have found that the reason why Cortez was able to trick the Aztecs was because of his golden hair and golden beard, so the natives thought that he was the "White God" that was supposed to come. But as in most cases he went for the sterotype: Spanish=Dark.
"The Black Rose", the worst of the collection.Silly!!
"Son of Fury", perhaps the most pleasant and enjoyable.
If you want to see "The Best of Tyrone Power", here is my list:
"Witness for the Prosecution"; "Nightmare Alley"; "In Old Chicago"; "The Razor's Edge" and for great adventure, "The Mark of Zorro"
This will be really a great collection to watch even if you pay much more!
