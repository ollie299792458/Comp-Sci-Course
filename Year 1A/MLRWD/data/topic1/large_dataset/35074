This is the kind of quality film I'd kept hoping to see Donald O'Connor in after his bravura performance in "Singin' In The Rain."  In whatever vehicle Donald appeared, whether it was his movies as a child or teenager, or as an adult, he always shone brightly ("A glittering, glowing star in the cinema firmament," to quote Lina Lamont!), even if the material was not top notch -- and unfortunately, much of his material was beneath his great skill.  In "Singin' in the Rain" he proved he was worthy of great "A" material -- and he proves it again here.  At the risk of gushing too much, a documentary on O'Connor says that his name spelled backwards was Talent!  Amen to that.  Here, he proves it.  One is tempted to irreverantly murmer, "Fred and Ginger WHO?" when he and Vera-Ellen dance together.  And O'Connor and Ethel Merman are absolutely wonderful together, too.  The duet they perform, "You're Just In Love" is already being worn thin on my DVD from repeated viewing!  Ethel Merman is an acquired taste, usually, but in this film she's just plain fun from beginning to end.  Funny note:  Donald O'Connor had to wear ear plugs during this scene and others with Merman because of her sterophonic lungs!  Great movie, well worth the long wait for its release...don't miss it!
