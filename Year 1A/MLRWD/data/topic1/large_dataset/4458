I've been using WATP dvd's for about 2 years on and off. I usually use the 3 mile walk, and find it to be a good workout that keeps the heart rate up without complicated moves and without over-doing it. I wanted something I could do in a little less time for busier days, so I bought this dvd. This dvd didn't get my heart rate going like the 3 mile does. I didn't really break a sweat...more like had a bit of a glow on my face...that's it! it wasn't challenging enough for me. I also found all the bouncing around and the attempt to "jog" in place was just stressful and painful. I'm only 21 years old so if I find this painful on the joints...I can't imagine somebody older finding it that comfortable! My advice, if you've done the walking dvd's for the 1 or 2 mile and are looking for a change and a bit more of workout, this is probably good for you. If you are new to leslie's dvd's I highly recommend trying the 3 mile walk. If you're pretty uncoordinated and like the simplicity of leslie's original videos, don't do this one. its not difficult, but it is a bit more sloppy and therefore harder to concentrate on targeting muscles, etc.
