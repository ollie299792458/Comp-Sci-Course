This is a disgusting, bad habit treating, you know what, film!
This horribly disgusting film, should be rated R as far as I'm concerned! If you don't mind your kids seeing people expose themselves, THEN DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mike Myers, is horrible if he agreed to do this film, and i doubt he was forced to! This, disgusting looking cat appears in their house after the mom goes to work and digs in the couch throwing out stuff(I didn't see what because I was closing my eyes) while showing his rear end. Then the fat babysitter gets their and sits down sleeping. The cat takes out these disgust little monster things (Thing 1 and Thing 2)and the cat hangs her in the closet. Ridiculous! Then the guy that is dating the kids mom is really not supposed to be how he looks. They make him expose himself and centimeter below his belly button, and make it go to his chest and pick his nose. How disgusting can it get? Do not watch it to find out! DO NOT GET FOR KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
