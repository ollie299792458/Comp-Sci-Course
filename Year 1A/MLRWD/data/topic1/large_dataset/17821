I have been a long time fan of Rocky. So when I finally got a DVD player, this is one of the first movies I was eager to check out. Especially when I noted the special features it included: out-takes, cut scenes, and "theatrical experience" stuff. The movie looked great. I have no complaints there. Frank looked extra glamorous with the enhanced picture. And widescreen is always good! My complaint is with these so-called special features. When I see the word "out-takes" I'm thinking some funny scenes where Tim Curry trips on his high heels or something like that. But really, the outtakes are little more than film from unused camera angles. The stuff from VH-1 Behind the Music was interesting enough, but it was nothing new. VH-1 runs Rocky Horror almost monthly, along with the Behind the Music stuff. And the theatrical experience, I think, should remain IN THE THEATER. That's the whole point of audience participation. It's not enjoying it in your living room, it's enjoying it with a whole room FULL of whackos. The cut-scenes were interesting. But that was the only special feature that I really found to be "special." So, all in all, the movie is an excellent addition to your library. Just don't get your heart set on the extras.
