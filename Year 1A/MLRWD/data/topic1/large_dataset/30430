This is possibly one of the best, if not THE best, movies I have ever seen. The cinematography, the music, the acting, and the directing were the top of the line. I can't even begin to imagine how Kubrick directed some of the scenes in this movie. They seem so real and intense, I forgot on several occasions that this was simply fiction.

The lighting, which is some technology I don't quite understand, is all natural. I loved this. Every scene glows with warmth and beauty, and the characters look even more fine in their finery.

And I seem to be one of the only reviewers that finds no fault with Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon! The first few scenes I was not impressed so much, but the movie is very lengthy and there was plenty of time for O'Neal to prove himself apt and perfect for the part. I think some people are mistaking the trueness of a sometimes bland character for a bland actor.

One of the things I loved best about this movie was the fact that the protagonist, if you can call him that, isn't someone you can always sympathise with. Barry is the central character, and you begin to feel like you understand him, but you definently don't always like him.

And I won't even start on the music, except to say that while in the beginning I found the contrast between beautiful soft music and violent scenes somewhat jarring, it evolved into an art. The music was playing in my head for days after I watched this. Exquisite.

This movie didn't win all of its awards for nothing!
