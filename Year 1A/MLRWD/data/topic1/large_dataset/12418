I saw this film a few years ago and thought it very good as a horror movie.

Yet as history, its nonsense.

The film is largely based on Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution (1977), except the connection with Queen Victoria's son is missing (and quite right, too).

There is no evidence that the murderous couple committed these crimes- certainly the police never thought so and Michael Caine's character, Inspector Abberline thought (almost certainly incorrectly) it was one George Chapman, a posioner, hanged in 1903 for poisoning women. One of the villians in this story had recently suffered a stroke and this elderly man would have had difficulty wielding a knofe at dinner, let alone killing anyone.So the solution presented here is nonsense.

The whole premise of a horse drawn carriage going through Whitechapel slum land is also ridiculous - not one of the witnesses in the real case mentions one.

George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilante Committee is shown here as a socialist agitator - in real life he was a local churchwarden.

Caine's portrayl of the detective is also at odds with what is known of the modest policeman.

To conclude, although a good story, this bears very little relation to the known facts of the case and merely serves to mislead the uninitiated viewer.
