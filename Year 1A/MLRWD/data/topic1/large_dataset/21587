EVERY DAY is a dramedy about "life," the every day living kind of life.

Television writer Liev Schreiber and his wife of nineteen years (Helen Hunt) are finding their lives to be rather difficult these days.

Not only has their older son (Ezra Miller) declared that he is "gay," a fact that Schreiber is having problems accepting, but now his cantankerous, incontinent father-in-law (Brian Dennehy) is moving into their home, and Hunt is miserable with that because she and Dad have never really gotten along.

Things are just as bad on Schreiber's work front.  The egomaniacal producer of his series (Eddie Izzard) is not happy with the scripts that he his turning out, so he assigns Liev to work with another writer on the staff, the very sexy Carla Gugino, who is determined to seduce him.

EVERY DAY is a fine, well-acted film, one in which virtually any viewer can identify with and care about the multi-dimensional characters and their various plights.  Daily vicissitudes, particularly when one has a family, are not easy.  Indeed, as expressed by the film's writer-director (Richard Levine), who based his sensitive script on events in his own life, getting successfully through a day can almost be "heroic".
