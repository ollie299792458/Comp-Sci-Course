Once again Paramount cheat the Friday The 13th Fans. This movie has been issued countless times on VHS and DVD now, and every time its the same censored version missing the infamous 54 seconds of graphic bloodletting.
What is the point? Friday the 13th Part 2 is a good sequel but any fan can't deny its like a burger without the meat. Suspense scenes build and build and then the censor deprives us of the pay-off - basically what we've paid to see. The footage excised from Friday The 13th Part 2 cannot be that extreme - its a studio produced 80' slasher. Its gore will NOT outdo Maniac or The Prowler - what are Paramount so scared of - or maybe they're just lazy. One things for certain, they are greedy, money grabbing corporate scumbags out to exploit the fans of a series of films which have provided them with some of their best revenue (yet they're ashamed of the films).
I for one, will NOT be shelling cash out AGAIN for another cut print of this, or any other Friday movie, just for the sake of a few shoddy, last minute extras.
Paramount need to stop just thinking about their proceeds and consider what the fans want one in a while.
