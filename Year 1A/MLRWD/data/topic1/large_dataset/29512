I love QL.  I remember when I was just a child that even then I enjoyed the show when some of the material is over my head.  Through the years I picked up watching it on Sci-Fi and when they came to DVD I bought them.  Like everyone else, I love the series but the collection of each season was cheaply put together but still high-priced for the consumers.  It's not quite fair to consumers to receive a collection that's not complete and it isn't without the original music.  Some of the tunes they used to fill in what they took out are cheezy elevator-like music that really ruins a moment.

But on the plus side, this is a dvd collection that I feared never being released to public.  I am happy with my purchases of seasons 1,2,4, and 5.  But my season 3 DVD set is messed up and it's angering.  One out of every 4 episodes are unplayable and within minutes of starting it, it stutters and skips.  I'm lucky to be able to watch half of the episode and even then I miss half the story.  Does anyone else have this problem?  If so then future purchasers of the DVD collection ought to put that technical issue to consideration before purchasing.  I'm going to try and send my  season 3 back and get another just in case the one I have is a fluke.

My other recommendations: The X-Files (series 1-3 are the best to me) and Roswell
