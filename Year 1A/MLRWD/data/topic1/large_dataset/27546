This is more a review of the DVD than the movie.  I have owned the VHS of this movie since 1990 and have almost worn it out.  I have been waiting for it to come to DVD and wondered what was taking so long.  I must say it was worth the wait.  I received the DVD yesterday and it was the best $17 I have spent in a long time.  The movie is the same old enjoyable Harry and Sally but the extra's are great.  There are about 10 deleted scenes that are very funny and there is the "It Had to be You" video but the best thing for a person that enjoys this movie is the commentary by Rob Reiner.  It's as if Rob came over the visit and you started watching his movie and he wants to fill you in on how everything came about when making the movie.  In the commentary edition Rob will speak over the dialog and tell you what he was thinking when he did a particular scene or who came up with the scene.  The movie never stops in this setting nor is the dialog ever muted you can still hear Harry and Sally in the background as Rob talks as if he is sitting beside you and fills you in on all the pieces that make up this wonderful movie.  Once again, the best $17 I've spent in a long time.
