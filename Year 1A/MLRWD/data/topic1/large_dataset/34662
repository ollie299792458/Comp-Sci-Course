just love this movie. johnny depp, marlon brando. wish marlon were still here.  had to own it.
  like johnny depp in anything.

okay, you want me to say more.
  im lookin for movies that are charming, warm, engaging enough to keep my interest all the way through, about regular people situations. light, serious, humorous, real, maybe a touch of fantasy, but im avoiding movies that make me worry every minute about what horrible thing is going to happen next or bodies rolling around in bed to feed the voyeur in the sexually numbed out,or curious, or low minded, without a life.
  watching movies with actors who are unique in themselves, just plain talented, can make a movie worth the time and cost to watch them.
  personally we wont sit there for movies or shows that scrape the bottom of the garbage can. life needs a balance. real life tragedy is always there, and we must deal with it. i dont intend to entertain myself with it. heaven help the minds of those, young or old who see nothing else.
  i keep a list of movies and others want to know whats on it and how i find them. don juan is one .

  well thats my story and im stickin to it.  nancy
