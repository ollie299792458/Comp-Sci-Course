Ok, maybe this movie is for those that like obscure, "artsie" films, but for the normal watcher, I do not advise getting this film.  I enjoy Asian film and am a fan of Shu Qi, but this was boring and tedious to watch.

The film is divided into three separate short films:
1. In 1966, where Shu Qi working at a pool hall, meets the main male role.  He goes to war, comes back can't find her, then goes around the country looking for her. Finds her, then holds hands.  Very little dialogue, and that's about it.

2. I believe, it's 1922, the film is in color, but has no speaking parts, but written, like it was a silent film.  She's a prostitute in a professional brothel, he comes to visit her while he travels the country with a famous poet.  A girl in the brothel gets pregnant, he helps the "father" to buy the other girl, but won't buy Shu Qi out of brothel, and that's about it.

3. In 1995, Shu Qi is a bi-sexual girl with tattoos, who spends most of the film smoking cigarettes and riding a motorcycle, and her "girl-friend" commits suicide because she is out with a man (I guess, it doesn't give many details).

So, three short boring films, very very little dialogue, very little action, no sex, no nudity, but a lot of time waiting for something to happen- which never does!
