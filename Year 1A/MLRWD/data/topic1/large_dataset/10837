a friend lent me this and I actually did buy the first season. It stands up pretty well to similar stuff like '24'. It is mostly well written, the action pieces are well staged, more convincing and less flashy than most US thrillers of this ilk. Michael Ealy turns in a convincing portrayal of a 'terrorist with a conscience', Oded Fehr is similarly convincing as the cold blooded extremist, and Henri Lubatti, in a typical Eastern European role, is a good solid actor. So far so good. I did feel though that the French skinhead & all American jock with a mommy problem were not particularly convincing, too stereotyped, and maybe should have been merged into one character. As another member of the cell bit the dust in Ep 1, it was a little distracting to have to head count instead of just watching the plot unfold. And then there was Melissa Sagemiller's single mother, Gayle. Which is where the stereotyping really revved up. Not only is Gayle a single mom but she smokes, drinks beer right out of the bottle and falls into bed with a guy she picked up at a party But it was a kid's birthday party, so that's okay... give me a break! Oh well, at least she didn't have a drug habit or get a job at the lapdancing club where they all adjourn after offing one of their number in the desert - saving that for next week obviously! Muslim women characters were - well, yeh, stereotyped - again. I did like it, it was cracking, sometimes thoughtful drama that got pulled after 2 seasons, which is a shame as I felt it was just getting interesting.
