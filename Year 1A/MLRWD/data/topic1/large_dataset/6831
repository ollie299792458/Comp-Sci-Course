My wife & I watched this last night. I've been a Jack Ketchum fan since 1981 when I read his novel Offseason, along with Richard Laymon's The Cellar, and thought, "at last, this is what real horror fiction should be".

It's good to see films of his works. Red was very well done and Off Spring (the sequel to Offseason) was good. The Woman is better. Psychological terror at its best.

Pollyanna McIntosh is amazing as the feral woman. My wife, a costumer, immediately noticed her walk: like a beast, not a woman (or man). Her full-body makeup should earn an Oscar, as well as her acting. Angela Bettis, as the broken-down wife, was also outstanding, and Sean Bridgers, as her sadistic, psychotic husband, had just the right amount of quiet lunacy to carry off the role. It's good to see Sean in a starring role; he's worked hard for it.

The only complaint I had was that some of the music was too LOUD (it distracted form the script) and some of the lyrics had no relation to the action. I've always believed the music should further the action, or strengthen it (The Big Chill).

There was one very gross moment early, that made my wife turn away, but that I thought was the sexiest, most sensual, eating scene since Tom Jones. Look at the woman's expression while she chews....
Highly recommended, as is the book by the same name.
