Masaki Kobayashi begins the film Kwaidan with the most arrestingly beautiful images I have ever seen in any film. As colored ink disperses in water, shapes are formed like veils, like a Geisha dancing in colored silks, as if a dragon were emerging in the water, and one watches absolutely engaged and spellbound by this ravishing imagery.

It is a seductive sequence that sets us up for the next four seductions: stories that haunt us after the film is over.

The eye in the storm is shown as a literal image in the frozen landscape of the snow witch story. Unforgettably beautiful and heartbreaking. Tatsuya Nakadai stars, and he is wonderful as the woodcutter who falls in love with a snow demon.

The story that is strangest, though, is the story of the blind singer. I won't give it away, but really, you will not forget the beauty and pathos of this story!

Kobayashi's finely-tuned aesthetic makes these four stories absolutely unforgettable. Is beauty more terrifying than ugliness? In some ways, yes.
