This DVD is already ordered - I ordered two!  All the Peter Gabriel videos, not just Sledgehammer and Big Time, all together, soon to be hitting my DVD player?  Too Good To Be True. BUT, it is.

Now, let me tell you about Modern Love.  The video was made before videos were on MTV, before VH1.  It was made as a promo for ths song from his first solo album.

True I am a fan, and I have a fairly visceral response to this video, but it is not only a lot of writhing young man on the screen, but a lot of humor and satire too.  So funny - and yet, there is the raw Peter Gabriel, young as can be, before Big Time,  before Sledgehammer, selling that song like nobody's business.

The man still sells it, if you have been lucky to see him on the last tour that just ended after two years. (Was I lucky? Saw him three times in the last two years, so, moderately lucky!).

DO NOT MISS THIS DVD.  TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS.  Get this for your family's Christmas Presents!  Buy an extra just in case you lend one out!

Order now!  Order now!  Order now!  This is not a subliminal message.  This is as liminal as I can get.  You will not regret it!
