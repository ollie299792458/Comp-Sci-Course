This is a lovely story with fun dance scenes and a talented cast. As much as I enjoyed Gere, Sarandon and Lopez in the American version of this film, this Japanese original has more soul, I think, and more interesting messages. In the American film, a key message seems to be about married couples understanding and being witness to each other's lives, while in the Japanese version a key message is about daring to love ballroom dance for its own sake -- in a culture that frowns on ballroom romanticism. And another message in the Japanese story is about dance partners needing to trust each other as they perform their roles: "The man protects the woman." This film pulls you into really caring about the simple, middle-aged accountant who dares to become a real ballroom dancer, and the traditional wife who tries to figure out and accommodate the changes in her husband. A great film to have on hand because you will want to watch it again. POSTSCRIPT: I just watched this film again -- the full 136-minute version in Japanese with no dubbing or subtitles. I don't speak Japanese. AND I STILL LOVED IT. Every single minute. I'd forgotten how touching the husband-wife relationship is and how much the lead actor, Koji Yakusho, reminds me of Gregory Peck. (His wife reminds me of Renee Zellwegger.) Yes, the American version is entertaining enough, but the Japanese version is everything a story on film should be, making you really care about the characters. The difference is like having a popsicle instead of a rich, homemade, full-bodied ice cream. Both have their place, but one is definitely more satisfying.
