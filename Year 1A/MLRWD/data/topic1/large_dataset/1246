What a treat to watch these Ed Sullivan shows again!

The DVDs are packaged perfectly, and they are very professional recordings. The audio and video quality is excellent, so it was like sitting in the living room of the 60s watching The Beatles enter our country's social and music conscience for that first time. I got chills to see them toss their floppy but manicured hairdos as they plunked on their electric guitars, playing those first great melodies like "She Loves You, Yah, Yah, Yah"; "I Want To Hold Your Hand"...oh; there are a NUMBER of great first Beatle songs in this collection! (There are two discs, with a total of four shows, all with the Beatles included in each show).

And just as fun to watch are the other acts before and after the Beatles' performances. The Ed Sullivan Show was the venue for LOTS of showbiz performers with good (or corny) acts and we see them all, minute by minute WITH the commercial breaks that Ed announces. Even witnessing the way we were sold Pillsbury cake mixes, shave cream and pain relievers back then was fascinating.

Great price and worth every penny. It's wonderful visiting that priceless moment of television history.
