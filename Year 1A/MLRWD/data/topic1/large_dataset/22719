Unlike some other detective shows, "The Mentalist" has another story other than the casual criminal cases. It's well balanced with humor usually coming from the main character Patrick Jane, but that does not mean all the other characters don't contribute, they do, they have they share of funny scenes. But just as there's some good scenes worth of a laugh, there's some depressing ones, they are just so well balanced I love it, it's perfect. The main character usually shows a great honesty that if found charming, because he uses some sarcastic remarks sometimes and it is straightforward most of the time. That is what this differences from any other CBI show, and I should say the acting... it's is amazing. All the main cast members are outstanding by their acting, and the cases are really good written. I would recommend this show to anyone, I am looking forward to watching the next season! This show is worth the time and money! Also just to point something out, this is the ONLY show that has gotten my attention until now, that's how awesome it is... not saying that you'll definitively like it, but I recommend it.  (:
