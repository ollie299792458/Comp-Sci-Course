In their glory days no band delivered a more explosive live show than the Who, and the members of the band have always felt that their studio albums never quite captured that astonishing energy.  Well, this re-mastered version of this classic rock movie captures it just fine.  The producers of this re-release did a lot of work finding old film and tape and making it all look and sound better than ever before, they deserve our thanks for putting so much effort into this.  The results make the Who jump right through your TV-audio system.  I've seen much of this footage before on other releases, it has never looked as sharp and rich, or sounded so powerful, they really did a fantastic job.  The special edition is worth a few bucks extra as it comes with a second DVD with extra features.  Hardcore Who fans have their little gripes, even more rare footage would have been nice etc., but the complaints pale beside the quality of this release, which shows just how good these old rock films can be made if somebody puts enough effort into them.  It's an erratic film, it jumps all over, sort of like the band, but it's a time capsule of one of rock's mightiest acts at their best.  Well done, highly recommended.
