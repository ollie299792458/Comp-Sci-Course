Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has been my favorite movie for about 2 years now. When I first watched it, I didint think much of it because I was pretty tired when I decided to check it out. After watching this movie and then watching other movies that have come out, I began to realize none of them could compair to the caliber of the genius behind Confessions. I watched it again (because I bought it before I viewed it, which is a very seldom move on my part) and finally realized how brilliant it truly was. Chuch Barris is my hero and it's because of Sam Rockwell's performance that I know how Chuck really was. I wasint around for Chuck's creations or anything, but Confessions showed my how Chuck was and this movie inspired me to create entertainment for the masses and work at it until I have nothing short of perfection. This movie is HANDS DOWN my all time favorite movie. And this is coming from some one who likes movies like Fight Club, Kill Bill, Collateral, Sideways, and Reservior Dogs. Check this one out, seriously, Chuck Barris is one of the most entertaining and interesting people that will ever live and if you ever like any of his work or wanted to know what he did, watch this movie. Best, Movie, Ever.
