'Dazzlingly raw, gritty, dirty, blatantly real' are the best ways to describe this spectacular flick about a bad cop whose life is spinning out of control.  Harvey Keitel gives an incredible, mind-blistering performance in the title role.  This cop is losing himself in a gambling problem and a drug problem.  These 2 problems are brutally and graphically shown on film as they drag this officer into the depths of depravity and degradation.  He steals and abuses his power as a policeman to support his self-destructive habits.  And what he does with those teenage girls who steal their father's car is just oh so wrong!  But it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  As his life deteriorates, he must face a gruesome case involving the rape of a nun.  (This crime is portrayed semi-graphically, and may be a bit much for some to handle)  The cop's faith and self-destruction clash as he faces the solution to this, his hardest case.  Vivid, graphic depictions of all aspects of a dirty cop's life are pictured as his life unravels on camera.  This movie is not for everyone...but it is a stark, raw and brutal portait of a cop in the midst of the deepest inner-turmoil.  Even though I am not a fan of cop movies, I think this is one of my all-time favorite flicks.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes brutal realism...and anyone who is not too squeamish.
