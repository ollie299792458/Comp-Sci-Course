Julie, a young, aspiring writer in a depressing job, decides to cook her way through Julia Child's book Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and to blog about it. This new activity becomes an obsession that strains her marriage, but in the end it provides her with the recognition she longed for.

While Julie is working her way through the recipes, the movie flashes back some fifty years earlier to follow Julia Child who has just moved with her husband to France. She finds herself with time on her hands and begins searching for something to do. She tries hat making, which palls, and then decides to go to cooking school, because what she really enjoys in life is, well, eating. She is the only woman in her class but is unflappable.

This is a feel-good film about how these two women used persistence and their passion for food to find personal fulfillment and the generous, understanding men who loved and supported them. The acting was fabulous, the scenes colorful and vibrant, the comedic moments well-timed and the sad moments poignant and fleeting.

What strikes me the most is how one woman making a single decision and following her passion has impacted so many of us. Julia Child was just a middle-aged married woman in Paris with nothing to do who took up a hobby. And thanks to Julie's blogging, which inspired this movie, I am now a fan of Julie Child. We all have the potential if we just follow our hearts.

This movie was wonderfully good and happy entertainment.
