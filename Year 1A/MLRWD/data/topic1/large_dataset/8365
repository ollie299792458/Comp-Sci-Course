yes, i am a HUGE fan of the show, you might say a bit obsessed with it, and once season 7 came out, and then season 8 was released, i kind of figured they would eventually release an entire series set. along the way i have purchased each individual seasons and i watch them rather frequently, and they sit proudly on my DVD shelf along with many movies and a few other t.v. show DVDs. the only thing i didn't do was pay full price for any of the individual seasons. i either found them on sale somewhere or picked up a few used ones. i don't think i paid over $30.00 for any of them. currently, i only need season 3 and of course, season 9, which i might just skip and buy the series box set which i could not be more excited about. they might release all the extras and the book seperately one day, they might not, but i want all those items, i want the entire series in one, neat little box, that again...will sit proudly on my DVD shelf. i don't feel it's a rip off at all. the price for this set is a steal in my opinion, and if you're an honest to god, true fan of the show...maybe borderline psycho about it like i am, then this is a very welcome addition to your collection. i also have every available season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and will continue to buy them as they become available, and when L.D. decides to put the kibosh on that show, and if they release a series box set, i'll be first in line to buy that as well.

to each his own i guess.
