Waking the Dead is about Fielding Pierce who is about to become a congressman, but soon we discover he is haunted by his reportedly dead lover Sarah a former political activist.
This film comes at you like a stark and haunted love story. Kieth Gordon the director flashes back and forth showing us that this wasn't always a perfect union between the two, yet they were bound together even though their political and social beliefs were as opposed as the North and South Pole. In Fielding's life post Sarah we see him as a shadow of the man he formerly was, who begins to see Sarah everywhere. This slowly wears at the fabric of his sanity. He isn't sure if he is being haunted by her ghost or if she had gone into hiding.
The amazing thing about the film is it touches on some of the real concepts of love. How you can care about a person even though they drive you insane at times. The scene between Fielding and Sarah on the subway train going home is probably the best in the film, it is very natural and speaks with a true and meaningful heart. Waking the Dead reminds us all of that one love we had that we weren't meant to hang on to.  Painful and beautiful, it is an experience worth having, one that will form who we are and who we will eventually become.
