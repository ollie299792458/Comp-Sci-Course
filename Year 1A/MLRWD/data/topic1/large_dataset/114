I've been a big fan of the show and couldn't wait to get my hands on the 7th and final season. Very, very emotional final season.

I usually don't care much for the bonus material, my expectations are quite low but the West Wing season 7t went BELOW LOW ! No interview, no look back on the 7 seasons, no behind the scene, no nothing ! The only bonus material is to watch the live debate from the director's chair (and watching him snaping his fingers every 4 seconds gets old after 1/2 a minute), or to watch a making and rehearsing of that live debate. That episode was exciting when showed on TV, not so much on DVD and it is certainly not interesting to see them rehearse (kills the legend really). Somehow I'm not that surprised by this lack of bonus material: I can't remember a single DVD season that had any good ones (and I've seen them all), and just remember that NBC refused to pay any extra money to have a special program aired with the last very last episode... That's cheap yeah.

About the subtitles, season 7, like season 6, does not have any english subtitles (french & spanish only). Since I'm not fluent when it comes to the speech speed of these guys (Josh & Toby, you're killing me !), I always appreciate having english subtitles to keep me on track with the story, and so that the small jokes aren't lost on me. Well, this time around I had to put the french subtitles (my native language) and just hated it... Very bad translation overall, and I understand that it's difficult (impossible ?) to translate jokes, but can they at least try to make it funny ?
