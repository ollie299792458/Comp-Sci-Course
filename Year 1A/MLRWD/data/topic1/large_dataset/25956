i'm not exactly sure how to review this movie, aside from saying that it is my favorite movie ever. i have watched Fear and Loathing 151 times, soon to be 152. my favorite things about this movie are... 1.) the performaces, johnny depp and benicio del toro blow my mind, they a nearly unrecognizabe (depp is bald) and almost unintelligable (i recommend watching the film with closed captioning at least once) and it all works perfectly. and the people performing around them are so real that you actually find the main characters plausible. 2.) the visuals, there is so much stuff in each of terry gilliam's frames that i find something new to see everytime i watch. 3.) the fact that  nothing means nothing. there is so much visual symbolism and so many american lifestyle icons are blasted in this movie that you'd think it was about something, or trying to make some statement. alas, the characters making these statement are so tripped out that they can never finish a though or opinion (which is the point of each of these exercises), the characters just forge ahead, making their way through based on their optimistic energy (and mescaline). this is a perfect statement in itself, illustrating the generation that hunter thompson was writing for, beautifully and without satire or malice (see johnny depp's "high water mark" speech near the end of the film). but mostly i love this film because it is bombastic and absurd entertainment about two men who just want to have fun and do what ever they please...
