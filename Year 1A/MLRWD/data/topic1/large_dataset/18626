A depressed photographer who doesn't want to negotiate with reality and tells lies with works, and a girl who speaks truth to whom she doesn't love and ceases to love when truth is demanded. What exactly is reality is not very easy to determine. It's hard to tell what "closer" really means: too close and all would become the very reality which one seeks to avoid, or fantasy or a kind of vagueness, a fiction, makes a sort real intimacy actually possible. Maybe both, I suppose. Reality and fiction are somewhat interwoven and hard to separate. Of course, the movie touches more than the issue above.

I enjoy the movie but the way the scenes are connected make it somewhat like an underlined parts of a story instead of a story that has a continuating process, which is considered to be a weakness from my perspective. However, I also think that the movie would be too long and lose its intensity.

Anyway, worth watching. Owen A, Portman A-, Law B+, Roberts B. Still, my perspectives.
