I'm really not one to write movie reviews, I enjoy them for what they are and don't usually care enough to actually publish something about them.  However, for this film I will make an exception.

First off, gorgeous scenary.  There is a scene with Tom Cruise practicing a sword kata with the sun setting in the background ... it's beautiful.  There are many wonderful scenes in the movie.

Secondly, the plot is about transformation and self forgiveness.  I don't care if it's been "done before", this is a common archetype in all cultures and times and it is well portrayed through this film.  I find it well done, quite emotionally gripping at times.

The action in this film is great, Star Wars eat your heart out.  I grew up in a traditional martial art family, and Tom Cruise did a very solid job with the sword play in this movie.  The star wars films drove me nuts, but maybe you don't need proper body mechanics when you have "the force".  Anyways, good work in the martial arena as well in this film.

Finally, I saw this film three times in theatres and everytime people cried.  Seriously.  Everytime the end came around at least one person both men & women cried.

Very well done film.
