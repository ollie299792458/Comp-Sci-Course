In addition to this I also own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00025L42Q">Elvis - The '68 Comeback Special: Deluxe Edition (3DVD)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00025L4JO">Elvis - Aloha from Hawaii (Deluxe Edition DVD)</a>.  Of the three I would rank this the best value.  The first portion of the movie takes you behind the scenes in preperation for the 70s shows in Las Vegas.  You get to see Elvis fool around and joke with his band mates, but the second portion of the movie shows you why he's the KING.
The footage is cut together from some of the best performances over the course of several nights on stage.  The editors did a great job of splicing the performances seamlessly to create the ultimate Elvis show.  There's a nice mix of songs including old Elvis staples and covers of hits like "Mystery Train" and "Unchained Melody".  This is Elvis in his prime before his health went into decline and his personal demons took control of his life.  As stated before, the Vegas shows were among the greatest shows he put on in his career, and if you like rock documentaries this is one of the very best.
