I am amazed how well this season has been received. I have been watching and loving Lost since it's beginning and found that by the third or fourth episode of season 4 something was wrong. The change was subtle at first but before long the small tumbling rocks started a landslide. The writing wasn't as good as it had been and there were substantial changes in the tone of the show. By about the halfway point in the season characters were openly defying their own established tendencies for no other reason than careless and seemingly hastily written scenarios layered with bad dialog. The mysteries were still in place but the appeal of those mysteries began to die for me. It doesn't help that there are a number of new additions to the ensemble and far too much screen time is given to them. The entire structure of the show had shifted into something far more formulaic and very few people seem to notice or care. Maybe I'm missing something here that everyone else gets but less creativity and craftsmanship is going into the show and the result is that a show I loved watching has become a show I can do without.
