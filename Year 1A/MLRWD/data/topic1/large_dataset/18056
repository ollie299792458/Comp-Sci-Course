When I heard that this was going to be a movie, I was so excited.  I have seen all the episodes off of The Disney Channel, and I was ready to see this movie!!  This movie had some great high points and some great emotions and actions!
1.)  Hilary Duff as Lizzie McGuire &amp; Isabella :  She was great playing both of the main characters in the movie.  Lizzie is just a klutz and Isabella is a pop music sensation.  When she is at the fountain, she bumps into Palo, Isabellas singing partner.  She is a great singer and pop singer.  She acts kinda different from the show but that's always a plus!
2.)  Adam Lamberg as Gordo :  Lizzie's best friend and soon to be her boyfriend along with it.  When Lizzie meets Palo, Godro is kinda jealous.  He likes Lizzie a lot and Lizzie likes him too but just don't show it.  He finds Isabella and they go and find Lizzie.  Gordo also takes up for Lizzie and say that HE'S been sneaking out to have fun away from the group.
3.)  Others :  They others acted the same way as they do in the show.  Kate is still mean, until Lizzie tells her the truth and that she will be a famous singer if she stays with Palo and gets ready for the award show.  Ethan is still dumb and a klutz.  He's totally a chick magnet.  Meliena acts a whole lot different and a whole lot less bossy.  You only see her once but she is in there.  Matt is still a noisy and good for nothing brother.  He finds out tha truth about Lizzie and Palo.  Sam and Jo is still the same as in the show.  They only want whats best for Lizzie and Matt and not to ruin their lives.
As you can see, a lot of things are different and some things are the same as they always have been.  This is a movie for the family and that they can all enjoy.
