They had finally discarded their EGOS, and improved the movie to a level where it was able to sit on a shelf along with some of the top Disney Classics. By correcting the 10th Anniversary Edition (integrating the song "If I Never Knew You" and adding all-new animation), "Pocahontas" was able to sit along side "The Lion King"; "Beauty and the Beast"; "Mulan"; "Tarzan"; and all the other Disney Animated Musicals. "Pocahontas" was no longer the "crazy cousin" no one wanted to sit near during the Holidays.

But this was not good enough. Some "Einstein" at Disney decided to return it to it's "original" form for the Blu-ray release. If you ask them why, they just answer, "because that's the way it was first released!". It doesn't matter if the first version wasn't as good as the revised version; only that it was first. So they decided they were going to change the movie back to the "original", and just include "If I Never Knew You" as an "Extra". Well for me, too little, too late.  I'll keep watching my 10th Anniversary edition until I hear that they have a NEW version out!!!
