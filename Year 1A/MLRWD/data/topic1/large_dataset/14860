Being a big fan of the books, I eagerly awaited receiving the Sharpe DVD's for Christmas. However, in parts, the films didn't quite live up to my expectations.
Looking through the Extras, there was a selection of production notes. Reading these notes, it revealed that none of the shots in the entire series used more than 250 extras, and this is quite apparant when watching the films.
The action and battle sequences are too short by far, and of a poor quality. Here I must level a criticism at Sean Bean, as the Sharpe I see when reading action bits in the book is fierce and relentless. When Bean fights, he does so a little tentatively, and not very brutally as I picture Sharpe doing.
The director, knowing he was on a tight budget, has concentrated on the non-combat sequences, which is a wise move. These parts are far better, and credit must go to the actor that plays Hogan, as the wily engineer is, for me, the best character on the first two films.
Sharpe's Rifles was a bit disappointing, especially the tussle between Sharpe and Harper. This wasn't nearly physical enough or fast enough. Again the final fight was poor as well. 3 stars is my rating for Sharpe's Rifles.
Sharpe's Eagle was drastically better. Hogan for me was the star of this film. His mannerisms are just as I imagined them to be when reading. What makes Sharpe's Eagle better than Sharpe's Rifles is that there are less combat scenes, the emphasis being on Sharpe's vendetta with Henry Simmerson and his two lackeys. The only disappointing bits were Sharpe's fight with Berry and the criminally short final fight.
Overall, these films have stood the test of time well. The battle scenes show the lack of budget, but the films are an entertaining diversion - recommended to anyone who has read the books.
