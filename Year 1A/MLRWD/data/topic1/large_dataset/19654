I first saw this film in the theater and was completely taken with it.  It is one of the most perfect works of the American cinema.  Let me explain why, first the 4 main actresses in this film are each spectacular in their own way.  Kathy Bates makes her character's transformation completely believable and lovable.  Jessica Tandy is perfect with her wispy smiles and her dancing eyes.  She is a real charmer in this film.  Mary Louise Parker performs with grace and integrity and creates a real life character out of one that could have been overly sweet.  The real star though is Mary Stuart Masterson who completely becomes Idgie. It was the role of her career and she is amazing.  The movie is visually stunning and captures the atmosphere of the old south brilliantly.  The viewer is completely immersed in the world of Whistle Stop.  The script is poignant, funny, sad and most of all genuine. When you view this movie you believe in the realness of the characters and the setting.  There is not a single wrong note in this movie.  This isn't just a great story of friendship but also a fantastic mystery that has many twists and turns.  It is a movie that is full of heart and one that you will find yourself watching again and again.
