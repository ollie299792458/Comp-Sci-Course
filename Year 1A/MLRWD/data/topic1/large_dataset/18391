I just received a copy of It's A Wonderful Life 60th anniversary edition & I'm very disapointed! I sent Amazon a e-mail asking if the movie was in color because their dvd format say's (In color) & I didn't want the movie if it was in B&W beacuse I already had it. I received a e-mail back from  Amazon & they assured me that it was a colorized version of the movie. Well, I got my DVD today & on the back of the DVD it say's B & W. This is the same movie that was released a couple of years ago. It has the same stuff on it as the last movie they released. (The making of it's a wonderful life & A tribute to Frank Capra). There is nothing different about the movie. Paramount just wants to make more money. That's all it amounts to. So, all of the questions in these reviews are answered.
THIS MOVIE IS BLACK & WHITE- NOT COLOR!!!!!!! If you already own this movie don't buy it! You will just be getting a copy of the movie you already own & they wont refund your S & H, because the movie isn't defective. Amazon needs to watch what they are doing. They need to start putting the right DVD format on things. This is the second time I've got taken by Amazon saying the DVD format is color.
