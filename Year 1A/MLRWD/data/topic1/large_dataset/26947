This version starts out well enough, but quickly goes sour.  The thing that I enjoy most about the "Christmas Carol" movies are the ghosts. This version has the WORST ghosts of any version I've ever seen. The Ghost of Marley is invisible and is never shown on screen. The viewer sees Scrooge talking to nothing and it's very unbelievable. The Ghost of Christmas Past is nothing more than an illuminated shadow that's on screen for about a second or two. The Ghost of Christmas Present is the only "real" character. He's a fat guy and does allright, but by this point I didn't really care anymore. The Ghost of Christmas Future is shown as only a dark shadowed arm & hand that points. The writer and director of this version almost skips right past the parts of the ghosts, as if they were unimportant to the story. That is the main reason why this movie is forgettable.

  Now if you can look beyond all that, then this could still be considered a decent version. Scrooge is played well and the sets are done very nicely. The best thing about this version is that the actors, sets and costumes look genuine for the time period that the movie was supposed to be in.

  Another drawback, however, is that the film is too short and feels rushed. I didn't feel like Scrooge could've made the transition as easily as he did. He goes from being a miser to a changed man like no big deal. Weak character development.

  Bottom line- Considering that this is one of the first versions of this story done on film it's worth taking a look at. Don't expect much though.
