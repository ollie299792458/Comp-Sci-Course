In one word this movie is fun, completely over the top and with a lot of silly moments, but there is a reason for all that stuff! Director Sam Raimi making fun of himself and of all the "Horror" he had put Ash trough in the previous two movies (the evil dead and the evil dead 2) that was still silly, and over the top!

 Ash being pulled by the power of the Necronomicon gets sent to a weird version of medieval England (even though he is in the states) where he has to get the Necronomicon to get him back in time. What is totally ridiculous about this movie (aside from EVERYTHING) is that Ash is such a moron that he just gets thrown back in this evil time by the Necronomicon, but when he hears mention of the book, its like he never heard of it before, but he is smart enough to build himself a robot hand, and make explosives.

 This is not a movie that you would watch for the really smart dialog, or for a well made horror flick, or even a sci-fi adventure that makes any kind of sense, but laughing out loud fun!!!
