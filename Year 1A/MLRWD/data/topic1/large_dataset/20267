This film covers the "dark" side, so to speak, of Star Trek fans.  Or so I thought until I saw it a second time.  The weird, obsessive, and utterly bizarre are on display in this movie.  But through it all this is a big thank you to Trekkies.  It talks about  the path of how the convention phenomena started.  It goes over what Star Trek means to people.  But it also revels in the truly bizarre.  You have normal fans on display.  But obsessive fans just make better entertainment.  In my opinion, the documentary does not denigrate these fans.  A lot of these people are just comfortable being themselves and like being Trekkies.  More power to them.
I have to say the sections regarding Star Trek porn, etc. serve two purposes.  They titilate.  They make an interesting film.  If the film had normal people in it, it would not be that special.  Secondly, if you have to cover the range of fans you have to cover the normal to the bizarre.  To the film's credit it did not totally dwell on the bizarre.
The film is wonderfully crafted.  It is generally upbeat, but it changes tones on occasion.  I highly recommend it for any Star Trek fan, sociology classes, or anyone interested in a good film.  One of the better documentaries I have ever seen.
