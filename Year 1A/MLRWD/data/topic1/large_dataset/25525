Notting Hill, is one of the best romantic comedy made ever, Julia Robert is so cute, and his perfomance here is better that in any other movie, Except Erin Brockovich, Hught Grant made a great Work, he is simple nice.  The Story is about the most famous actress in the world, and a simple guy,  the have an ocasional encounter, and inmediatly they fall in love.
But  all goes crazy when he come the see she again. The movie is so funny and  romantic. 
The DVD, is perfect, the image is very good, and the sound is  terrific, this comes with a lot of Extras, like Deleted Scenes, some of  them must have been inserted in the movie. Trailers. And other good stuff.  I want you discover for Yourself.
Well is the DVD is soo Good why I give  they 4 stars. Because when this movie was in Preorder they Say that the  movie will come With Spanish Subtitles, and whe it arrive to me, the movie  dont come with any Spanish. A dissapointing for me.
I Speak English. But  I prefer to have the Subtitles in Spanish.
Buy This Movie. PLEASE.
