This is a kids film!!! It's for kids...and if your a big kid and want to have a laugh about silly things then this will be the top of your list. I thought it was one of the most funny films I've seen in a long while...since...Napolean Dynamite actually. It's not everyones cup of tea, but how people can say they hate it..."The Santa Stalker "Lurking under your bed" what are you talking about? Are you trying to get a job as a Movie critic?? I guess you just don't like to laugh! If you don't like it fair enough...but you have annoyed me so much that I felt I had to write a review myself...stick to watching anime!

For me I thought it was very refreshing, i didn't find it to be racist or prejudice, but then i'm not stuck in a time warp. I thought the filming was a stylistic approach to those movies and sports films that would have inspired this parody about the lives of wrestlers and those who take them seriously! The jokes are Jack Black...dancing...singing...wearing 'stretchy pants'...getting jealous over a beautiful nun...taking wrestling seriously...it's meant to be tongue in cheek, silly and fun. AND is by no means self-indulgent or crass.

It's not meant to be a serious study of Aethism...or Orphans...or Wrestlers...or whatever...it's just silly, like when some kid farted in assembly...the whole school would uproar with laughter!! Do you remember those days?? If not then obviously you should be going and watching an intellegent and accurate movie about restoring antique furniture!
