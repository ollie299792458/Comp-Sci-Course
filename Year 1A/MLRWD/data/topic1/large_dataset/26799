I found this series really interesting. Too bad it was so short!

I would have liked to see more of the "pioneers'" lives and what they did all day. The fact that by the end of the project they were still mostly eating peas, porridge, and salted fish/pork instead of vegetables from their gardens confirms my suspicion that they were spending more time arguing than working.

I think the colony would have fared better if the Vorhees family had not been part of it. Mrs. Vorhees said right in the beginning that they were only in the project because they wanted to "live closer to the land". In my opinion, this statement shows such a lack of community spirit that they should have been excluded. All the other people seemed to be willing to do their best to live according to 17th century rules, but after the Vorhees' refusal to participate in the Sunday gatherings, the community basically fell apart, even before the governor and his family left.

Overall, I think this was not meant as an experimental archaeology type of production. Instead, the producers were more interested in bringing conflicts to the screen, which is why they chose people from diverse social and religious backgrounds (the other main reason for being chosen was obviously physical attractiveness). However, thanks to the voice over explaining how and why the participants' behavior differs from that of 17th century settlers, I found Colonial House quite educational and enjoyed it very much.
