Shrek 1 was a movie filled with spoofs and nonnense and what I thought would be the perfect ending. Shrek 2 pretty much says it's not. Oh, well, 4 stars.

  Shrek and Princess Fiona get married ugly ever after, now celebrating their honeymoon with random hilarity. When Fiona gets an invitation to visit her parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away, Shrek forecasts disaster. Both of them still being ogres does nothing for the Hollywood-esque society.

  With Donkey still tagging along, Shrek and Fiona discover trouble in paradise. Shrek, feeling Fiona is unhappy, gets led astray and seems to have run away. Meanwhile, the King Harold has some troubles with the Fairy Godfather, I mean, Godmother, and her pampered son, Prince Charming.

  Like the first one, the story is pumped with obscure references to fairy tales, movies, and beyond. And fortunately, there's still a workable plot. Shrek, still the reluctant hero and former scapegoat victim of scared men everywhere, battles with himself the value of love versus the truth of how dominating beauty is. The good news is, with allies such as the energetic Donkey and the suave holy-crap he's Antonio Banderas Puss in Boots, he learns to fight to find out. He even becomes human, which I find a minor setback but if it helps him learn, it works.

  Shrek 2 is Shrek's movie; he's the one who in the end regains self-confidence in his character because, well, it's a fairy-tale ending. Good guys win and uncrok champagne, bad guys either are doomed to unviolent ends or fade from sight forever. While glad that they got rid of the Dragon to avoid shortcuts, the climax of the movie is still makes some cry, "Cheap move." But with upbeat music and a few dirty jokes, Shrek 2 is an admirable story which breaks the mold that all animated spoof sequels [...].
