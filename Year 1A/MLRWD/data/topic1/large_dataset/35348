Gentleman's Agreement stars Gregory Peck as Phillip Green, a journalist, who poses as a Jew to write a series of articles on Anti-Semitism in America in the 1940's. Dorothy McGuire stars as his fianc&eacute;e whose affections begin to waver as the charade continues. John Garfield stars as Dave Goldman, Green's Jewish best friend, who comes to New York to find a place to live, and runs into obstacles because he is Jewish. Gentleman's Agreement was presented despite the pleas of various studio heads for the movie not to be made. It tackled racial prejudice with a fury, received eight Academy Award nominations, and took home three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress.
The story is spellbinding. The acting is superb. Gregory Peck, as Phillip Green does an inspirational job as Green. You can feel his frustration and see the anguish on his face as he deals with the prejudice of others, the violence against his family, and stumbling blocks thrown his way from his fianc&eacute;e. He is faced with a secretary, who is Jewish born, but had to change her last name to get work at the very company Green works for. He tackles prejudice head on at a hotel, where he has weekend reservations, but discovers that is restricted. The directness of the movie will astound you and make you shake your head in awe that this type of prejudice could have been tolerated in America.
Gentleman's Agreement is a movie that should be shown again and again until people get the message it was meant to send. Anti-Semitism cannot and will not be tolerated in America.
