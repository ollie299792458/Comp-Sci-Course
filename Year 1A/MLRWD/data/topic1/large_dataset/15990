I was so glad that I saw this when it was originally released. This film is absolutely stunning. It is not an all-out horror film like some people might think.  This is a great adventure story with well drawn-out characters. Tom Wilkinson makes Beaumont so despicable that you just want to throw HIM to the lions and let them have at it. Michael Douglas is also very good as Remington. But the film belongs to Val Kilmer as Patterson, the Irishman who comes to build a bridge and finds himself being blamed for the lion attacks, and John Kani as Samuel, the tribal chief and Patterson's friend and foreman. Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score perfectly captures the essence of Africa (African chants are incorporated into the score). Director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond demonstrates with this film that he is a master of the widescreen format, and his shots of the African landscape are breathtaking. Then, of course, there are the lions themselves. The attack scenes are VERY well done, and Zsigmond's shots of the lions' eyes are still stuck in my head. Add to this some terrific sound effects and you have a real winner.
