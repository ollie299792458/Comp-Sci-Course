This has to be one of the 5 best science fiction films ever made!  This edition has two DVD's, one contains the original version we all remember from 1982 (I was sixteen, my brother was ten, and we all laughed at the van scene because I was also going for my driver's license) as well as a second disc which contains Steven Spielberg's edited version.

I happen to like both equally well.  I thought Steven eliminating the guns was a nice touch.  In real life, I sure hope the Feds wouldn't pull guns on kids like that!  If they did, it says a lot about how we're becoming a police-state and need to rethink a few things, even in the current climate of fear in view of terrorism.

This was a classic, magical movie, that anyone would enjoy watching over and over.

It was also the very first DVD I bought when I broke down and purchased a combination DVD player/VHS recorder.  The image on DVD vs. tape was fantastic!

Five stars for the movie and the Disc set.
