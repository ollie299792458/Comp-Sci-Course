Each year at Christmas time I use a Readers' Theater play with my sixth grade reading students called "The Night the War Stopped." The story is based on the true event of WWII that is also depicted in the movie, "Silent Night." When I learned from a student that this movie existed, I had to get it!

While the story lines of the play and the movie are a bit different, the main events are not: On Christmas Eve in 1944, three American soldiers and three German soldiers spend the night in a little cottage in the woods in Germany-- their hostess being a feisty German mother who will not allow guns in her house on the holiest night of the year. It is wonderful and remarkable how everyone complies with her demands. As the movie unfolds, we come to see each soldier as a human being with a story of his own, and the enemy soldiers come to understand that truth as well.

This movie has horror, suspense, tenderness, love, joy, and peace all wrapped up into one beautiful package. The acting was most convincing, and the movie is one my husband and I will watch every Christmas from now on. This is the best Christmas movie ever!
