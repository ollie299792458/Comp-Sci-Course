A disappointment. I was pleasantly surprised by Rodriguez's first film in the trilogy, El Mariachi: an independent effort in the good sense of the word, with signs of originality, some authentic atmosphere, and -- most unusual in the thriller genre -- even a little bit of heart. I should have stopped there, I guess, or maybe checked out the second in the series, Desperado (which I haven't seen).

In the interim, Rodriguez had clearly become a "bankable" writer/director/you name it. (According to the credits he seems to have had a hand in almost every creative aspect of the film; you get the feeling the only reason he didn't design the costumes was lack of time.)

Certainly various parties must have shoved huge wads of bills in each of his pockets and told him, go forth and multiply our money.

Once Upon a Time in Mexico has all the hallmarks of a big-budget action picture, which today primarily means lots of computer-generated effects plus high-profile stars. None of the latter offer much to appreciate, and Johnny Depp is nearly unwatchable with an absurdly fey, oh-so-ironic performance as a bent CIA agent. The only decent performance is by Ruben Blades, who brings some inwardness and dignity to his role as a retread FBI agent.

Rodriguez hasn't entirely lost his aptitude: there are cinematic coups here and there, and once in a while when the movie slows down to catch its breath between bloodbaths it becomes almost human. But way too much of the action is just a calculated, routine splatterfest in a sub-Peckinpah mode.
