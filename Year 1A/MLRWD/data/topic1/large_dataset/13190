I think it's safe to assume that by now most people, whether they've seen "The Pursuit of Happyness" or not, are aware of the "rags to riches" theme that is the basis of the story.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers have taken a great true-life story and turned it into a long, drawn out study in futility. The script was in dire need of tightening; three-fourths of the film did not have to be dedicated to Gardner's never ending battle with hardships and disappointments - and that machine! Viewers get the point at least halfway (if not sooner) through the movie.

The script should have concentrated more on how his time as an intern at the brokerage firm helped lay the foundation for his future success - with the last act being more concerned with his growing financial success after he ventured out on his own; that's a great story that is never told - at least in the film. Instead, Gardner elaborates on that subject in the "Special Features" segment.

As for Will Smith's performance, I can see why he was up for an Oscar. The fact that he didn't win in no way took anything away from a truly outstanding (and Oscar calibre) performance, matched only by his son's wonderful performance as well.

Perhaps just as important as the message in the film is the discovery of Will Smith as a fine, leading actor in a dramatic role. That said, I hope "The Pursuit of Happyness" will be the vehicle that allows him to continue on in that direction. I have no doubt that in time he will get that Oscar he deserves.
