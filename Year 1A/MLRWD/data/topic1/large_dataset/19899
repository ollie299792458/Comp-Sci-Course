This is going to be short. I was moved by this film, the performances are dead on accurate. This is the first time I have payed attention to Chris Cooper and I feel I have payed a price for my oversight.  Have you ever experienced something that changed your preferences, expanded your horizons, made you step out of your comfort zone? this film is a revalation to me. It addresses racial issues in a way that is totally non-biased, the point of view is human and not white, hispanic, or black but completly true. That is what makes this movie so important to me, the absolute truth that is involved within  this film inspires true joy within all the pain that is displayed on the screen. The message to me is that bad things happen and that life has the proverbial ace up its sleeve for every one but these people are real enough to deal with that and this director is wise enough to let that come across in a way that is so unforced that every one that views this film wishes that they could open their door onto Rio County even with all of its imperfections and misunderstandings just to be able to veiw a society that is honest or  willing to at least bend the truth if it will lead to some sort of harmony in a intricately woven tapestry of border living in the south west.
