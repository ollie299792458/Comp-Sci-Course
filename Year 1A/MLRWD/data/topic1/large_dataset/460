This was not as engrossing as 2001.  Of course I wasn't interested in seeing another 140 minutes of what I saw in 2001.  We have more accurate views of Jupiter and the moon, IO, thanks to the Voyager missions since the  movie "2001".  There were a couple of engineering tricks I  thought was fun to watch.  There is an aerobraking scene and the crew came  up with a way to safely leave the Jupiter system two weeks ahead of  schedule, the implementation of which was fun to watch.  The reason given  for HAL's murders was a bit of a letdown.  I think that perhaps that  mystery should have been left unanswered.  
I would suggest that anyone  with this movie pause the film the moment the nurse puts down the TIME  magazine.  That looks like Clarke as the President of the United States!  Opposite Clarke is what appears to be Kubrik as the Soviet leader.  But  Kubrik didn't direct this movie.  The magazine cover says "WAR".  Maybe there is some inside joke.  Clarke also supposedly makes a cameo on a  park bench.
