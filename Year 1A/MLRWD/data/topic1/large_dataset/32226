This movie has two true modes of representation: how television perpetuates through society and how people treat celebrities.  First of all, Truman is no more a victim than a result of circumstances.  His fate was ultimately chosen by a dictatorial creator (played brilliantly by Ed Harris, who deserved an Oscar nomination rightly so).  But as Truman discovers the truth about his pre-ordained life, the "audience" becomes captivated.  The people in the bar console each other and try to rationalize Truman's decisions.  The real truth about television is revealed at the very end when the two security men say "What else is on?" after Truman escapes.  We, as Americans, have so readily counted on television as a main source of not only entertainment, but solace.  We live our lives through the medium of the character.  So, in a way, this movie is a "movie within a movie."  
Additionally, the movie symbolizes in some small way how we idolize celebrities.  Truman is a celebrity.  The people in Seahaven are all aware, but do not tell him he is on T.V.  Rather, they all "act."  This is somewhat interesting because in a way, the actors may want to keep Truman on the island, not only for their jobs' sake, but also because he is an idol.
The truth is, however, that television has a commanding grasp on the American public, and that is the point of the movie.  We lift the minority of celebrities (Harris as the director, the media, etc.) on our shoulders.  It's almost as if we are brainwashed by T.V.  
Harris's character is most intriguing.  You don't know if he is helping Truman or hurting him.  Harris plays a somewhat symbolic father.  He believes that since he gave Truman "a life to live," that he knows what is right for Truman.  That knowledge also gives Harris the ability to destroy him, as exemplified by the storm scene at the end.
Overall, this movie is unique and ground-breaking, and I recommend it to all.
