"Koyaanisqatsi" reminds me a bit of a 1980s National Geographic magazine a bit, just without the written words to back the pictures up. It's an 82 minute film of nothing but images of nature and cities, some sped up, others slowed down, with a soundtrack of "theatre music" by Phillip Glass. It's an interesting spectacle, but not quite as much as I thought it would be.

Director Godfrey Reggio has an eye for detail, and it makes for some fascinating shots, like the dance of cars across the traffic lights, the flow of the freeway like blood in a vein, the billowing of clouds and the detailed delicate crest of a breaking wave. It's interesting to see the people of New York during this period too, how they worked, how they walked, what they did for fun, etc. Trouble is, all these shots and music one after the other can get a little tiring after a while if you're not up for it. It's a film that does feel a little longer than it actually is sometimes. I mean, if you saw some of these shots in plot driven films with a proper context, you'd be impressed I'm pretty sure, but in this film sometimes their meaning and purpose is a little vague. I'm not the biggest fan of vague meanings.

The meaning I get out of them though, out of the whole film, is to do with rhythm. The clouds have it, the shadows have it, all of nature that can be seen has it. Man has rhythm too in his everyday life, in his habits, in the architecture of his systems, and definitely in his music (though it's more about a certain kind of repetition with Phillip Glass more than rhythm, I'd say). Trouble is, man's rhythm is a bit faster than what the world's set up for, and it may be putting life "out of balance" as the title suggests.

It's a good time capsule of the era (1983), an interesting bunch of shots, though you really have to be in the mood for it to watch it. Worth a look if you're interested, though.
