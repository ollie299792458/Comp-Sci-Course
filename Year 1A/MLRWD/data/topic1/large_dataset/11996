I liked Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" way back in 1969, and I like it today.  The HD DVD version is pristine, looks like it did on the big screen in 1969.  This was probably the most expensive western ever made; a lot of elaborate sets and and loads of extras.  There was an outstanding cast, William Holden, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine,Edmond O'Brien, Jamie Sanchez, Warren Oates, and Ben Johnson, and supporting roles with Dub Taylor, Strother Martin, Bo Hopkins, Emilio Hernandez, and L.Q. Jones.The movie is long, very long, 3 hours and 11 minutes long. The story is about a group of aging bank and train robbers,  trying to make their last, big score. The year is 1913, and the railroads have gotten very smart and aggressive in going after outlaws, so much so that it's hard to tell who the bad guys are. After a failed robbery, and several members of their gang are killed, the Wild Bunch retreat to Mexico during the height of the Mexican Revolution. The Mexican Federal Army is in danger of losing the war to the revolutionary thug Pancho Villa. The Wild Bunch learn of a train shipment of US Army arms, rifles and a Gatling Gun and plan to pull off the robbery for the Mexican Army. Of course, there is the usual double crosses, treachery in all parties on all levels, and heroics on a grand scale. There is a lot of violence and a very high body count. The movie is well acted and directed, but the audio dynamics that we take for granted today simply aren't there.  You'll just have to manage with synthesized two channel stereo and forget about the surround unless you have one of those fancy audio processors. The video is outstanding, restored in 1992, and remastered in 1080p, and there isn't as much of a film scratch or dust spot, and the color is consistent throughout. I am proud to have this movie in my collection.  Dan Casey
