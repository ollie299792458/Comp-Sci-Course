While opinions seem to vary widely on this movie (and the entire QT catalog for that matter), Reservoir Dogs is certainly a movie that comes up when you start talking about films that changed the rules and challenged the audience.  The movie is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for those short on patience.  It requires your full attention, pushes and pulls you in directions you don't expect and forces you WAY out of your comfort zone.  
And I'm not just talking about the violence.  The non-sequential structure of the film can be difficult to track, the emotional reactions of the characters are far from ordinary, and there is little "Hollywood-style" storytelling to it at all.  In short, it's the anti-chick-flick...
But it is still an essential film for those who consider themselves film junkies.  The modern-day "independent film" boom (which many would say has been commercialized in its own way) owes a great deal to movies like this, as well as sex, lies & videotape and many others.
