'Good Morning Vietnam' withstands the test of time and has emerged as a classic of the era.

While Robin Williams doesn't really 'do' Adrian Cronauer- who was FAR more conservative in his politics- he channels a nice compromise that suited Hollywood's progressive distaste for the conflict. That dichotomy gives the film it's only weakness. But it is piddling criticism now, given the times.

What is does have is sweep, and scope. Director Barry Levinson ('Rain Man') was at the top of his game, and it has the FEEL of Vietnam. Those who were there will tell you that.

Not to mention a SUPERB cast with JT Walsh, Bruno Kirby, Noble Willingham and Forrest Whitaker. They get ALL of the Army life right. His scene- where he encounters the truckloads of GI's fresh from Boot camp and on their way to combat- is not only hilarious but will bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened combat veteran.

A real treat. The Blu Ray looks and sounds great. Totally worth owning...
