I saw this last night. Some movies are meant to challenge. If some people can't handle adult material then they're welcome to insulate themselves, though it's more than likely they've already seen more objectionable material on the net.

This movie is not porno, it's not perverted; it's about as sick as real life itself is sometimes sick. The alienation of the two main characters is something they are facing within themselves so they can start living again... truly living. It's a gritty and realistic love story and it has a happy ended within the context of their lives. The sex is not sick, but the grisly murders are. Worse murders have happened in reality but this was bad enough and it's reflection of what can happen in real world situations. Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo's performances are outstanding. So is the direction and the cinematography. It's a film for adults who understand eroticism, emotional and physical hunger, alienation and loss... and Jane Campion does her usual outstanding direction in handling such adult material. It's a Five star film for those who can set their usual prejudices aside to watch how the two main characters learn to love, heal and understand each other under conspicuously tragic circumstances. Jennifer Jason Lee is outstanding as Ryan's sister, but let's not mistake the sometimes unsympathetic and unappealing nature of their roles as bad performances or a bad movie. The movie is meant to challenge and awaken, and everyone put their lives on the line to tell this story--an outstanding effort!
