Amusing idea, we all like to see two people forced together to 'make it work' and see a happy ending; but...
Sarah Jessica Parker looked almost 50 (she's been at it a long time: YOU know, THAT TV series.)
Firstly, early in the film they really should have given her a better make-up job, poor old girl.
Hugh Grant? Well he IS old, has to be 55 by now. Still trying to play the slightly dopey appealing English boy; it really is about time he chucked it in and tried out some serious bad or nasty roles, 'cause he really has HAD it with the funny/cutesy stuff. He's just awfully painful to watch. And he kept ducking his head, almost as though he was saying, 'look, I'm trying to be cute!'
SO?
So there's this couple WELL into middle age trying to make up; and here are we the viewers, trying to give a darn whether they do or not. They are far to 'far gone' for us to really care: Let's face it, we expect our parents who've reached their 50's to either make up or split up, it barely matters.
I very much regret to say it wasn't funny. It was meant to be of course and I guess they tried, but it simply wasn't. It was mostly just painful.
Both Sarah and Hugh need to try something new before they are completely forgotten.
