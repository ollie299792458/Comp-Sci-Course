Al Pacino's glorious little film about a couple of would be bank robbers who simply have a really bad day. Brought to you by the same team that would also bring us Serpico, Pacino is simply electrifying in this film about a bank robbery in New York City that simply turned into a media circus on live television. Filmed soon after Pacino's stunning entry into the hollywood lights as Michael Corleone in Coppola's Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon cemented Pacino as a legitimate star in his own right. With a rivetting performance Pacino simply oozes panic and sheer hysteria. 
The film begins when Pacino and two friends enter a bank and begin the heist. The film makes little effort to set things up, prefering to get right into the action. Once it starts it never stops. Just moments after the bank robbery begins one of the would be thieves simply loses his nerve and walks out. Things get worse from there. From a little homemade fire to snipey cops ready to blow his brains out on the tarmac this movie simply screams tension. It was one of the very first Bank robbery movies which were rather popular for a long time. Pacino is simply terrific in this film as an on the edge psychopath who simply wants to pull the job off. But he's clearly in over his head and sinking fast.
This movie isn't for everyone. It's not one of the best movies ever, and it's simply not for all tastes. But if you are a Pacino fan or love high tension drama's you may enjoy this. There's never a dull moment and it's beautifully scripted. The weirdest part of the whole thing is that it's largely based on a true story, if for no other reason than that, this movie should be seen. If you are an Al Pacino fan, this is a brilliant must have.
