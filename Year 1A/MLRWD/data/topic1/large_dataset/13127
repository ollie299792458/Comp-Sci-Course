OK, this isn't a faithful recreation of the superb book, but like the book made a few small changes over the amazing real-life story of Homer Hickham and his friends to make it more legible, so too does the movie make a few changes to make it easier to see. The main thrust of the story is unchanged. Homer Hickham sees the Soviets make some early points in the space race and decides to do his bit to catch up, at the same time learning a lot of lessons about school, his family, his community and his nation.
Make no mistake - this is a feel-good story and you will be left with a lump in your throat as you win through all the trials and troubles along the way. You will be proud of Homer, his family and friends. And you will be proud of the USA, because Homer, and hundreds of thousands like him, worked to make the early space programs bigger and better, until an American stood on the moon, and later, much later, a piece of one of Homer's original rockets made it into orbit on the space shuttle.
I recommend reading the book if you want to sort out the details the movie was forced to leave out, and understand the changes made. For instance, Homer is actually Homer Hickham Jr - his father was called Homer as well, not John as in the movie. A small and unimportant change made to reduce confusion, but if you want the facts, read the book.
I particularly liked the fact that right at the end of the movie we get to see actual photographs of the real people in the story.
Homer has written more inspiring books and in these dark days I cannot help but recommend them as well.
