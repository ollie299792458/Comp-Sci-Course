This DVD exceeded my expectations and I can't say enough good things about it!!

First of all, the knitting lessons with Jennifer of Jennifer Knits, were fantastic! It made me understand the differences between American and Continental and I discovered I've been a Continental knitter all along.

What's great about this DVD is, you can repeat watching the lessons and it's like having a private tutor. It's much better than actually having one and asking them over and over again to repeat the stitches. I can imagine trying the patience of anyone doing that, but with the DVD you don't need to worry about this.

The stitches and techniques shown on The Art Of Knitting DVD are invaluable. I still consider myself a beginner and I just finished a simple sweater with the skills I learned on this DVD. It's so exciting!

Now that's just one part of this DVD. There's over 3-and-a-half hours of content. Among my faves are the stitch library, glossary of terms, spinning and dyeing demos and of course, the A-Z index lots of other reviewers here have mentioned. It's the coolest feature and something I have never seen on any other DVD.

There's a nice quote from Olivia Newton-John on the case of the DVD. In my own words, if I can parody one of her songs, "Let's Get Knit-ical" with The Art of Knitting DVD.
