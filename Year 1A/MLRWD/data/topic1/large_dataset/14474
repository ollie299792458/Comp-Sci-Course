Visceral...that is this film in a nutshell.  The main question is how in the world Hoffman and George's characters EVER got married.  They have no chemistry and absolutely nothing in common.  But get beyond this relationship and this film builds with wonderful intensity.  It is a test for both Hoffman's character as well as George's to have the marriage be rocked by the old male "freinds" and to see Susan George's character slowly slip away from David because he is not "man enough" to put an end to the Brits' unacceptable behavior.  She has lost her civility now that she is back on her home turf (a real irony since they came from the USA, where we are so much more barbaric than our UK bretheren).  Only when the constable is killed and you really feel that all hope is truly lost does Dustin hop into action.  And he really takes over and "proves" that he is a real man.  Okay, so it is sort of a macho trip, but it is one of the most intense films of the 70s, certainly Peckinpah's best in my opinion.  This DVD version is a rehash of the laserdisc, the print is identical to the Japanese letterbox import laserdisc.  I bought Hoffman's character all the way.  The locals are wonderfully menacing in a covert way.  Very well done...and a lot of credit goes to the editing for this pacing.
