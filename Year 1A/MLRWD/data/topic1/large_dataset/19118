This is probably Cosby's finest moment in stand-up (or sit-down, as it may be) comedy. He has really honed in on his famous persona as an intellectual who insightfully discusses family and life issues. As much as I like more edgy and biting comedians like Carlin, Pryor and Hicks, Cosby proves here that you can be laugh-out-loud hilarious without cursing. And, though his perspective appeals to a wide audience, he always remains very sincere. The DVD version of this performance adds to the experience you'd get with an audio CD, too; although Cosby doesn't run around the stage, his subtle use of facial  expression and gesture is well worth seeing.

Sadly, in recent times live comedy audiences have changed- they have very little attention span and expect a punchline every two sentences. If he was starting now, Cosby- with his leisurely pace- might not get the attention that he deserves. But he remains the all-time master of comedic anecdotes. And if you get worn out by constantly watching modern joke tellers, employing formulaic and fast-paced humor, it's a breath of fresh air to watch a man sit down, discuss life, take his time, and just plain be a funny guy.
