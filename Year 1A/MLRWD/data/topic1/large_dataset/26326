The plot is typical romantic comedy fare and pretty much delivers exactly what you expect.  Catherine Zeta Jones and John Cusak play an estranged Hollywood couple whose careers have suffered since their split.  They have a new movie coming out, and Julia Roberts, Jones sister/personal assistant/abused slave, and Billy Crystal, their amoral publicist, scheme to present them as a happy couple during a press junket for the movie.  Julia's character recently lost a lot of weigh and became gorgeous.  She also has long had a secret thing for her sister's husband.  Gosh, I wonder what could possibly happen.
OK, the genre is what it is, and it has a place in everyone's viewing library.  This one, unfortunately, is a near miss.  First, Cusak is wasted.  We know he can play a great romantic lead, but he's got to have more edge than this role gives him.  This is like watching wet white bread.  Roberts is also surprisingly subdued.  The biggest surprise is Catherine Zeta Jones, a celebrity that I always assumed was 80% public relations creation and 20% talent.  Here, she's clearly having a great time and she brings some much needed zing to her role as a self-obsessed starlet.  She obviously has a comedic gift, and I hope she can find other roles that use it. Crystal, of course, is brilliant.
This is one movie where I would definately recommend getting the DVD instead of the video.  Unlike a lot of DVDs where the producers simply tack on some odds and ends from the cutting room floor and call it "special features," here  the special features are both amusing and offer insight into the movie-making process.  The director introduces several scenes from the movie and thoughtfully explains why each was cut.  The deleted scene of Hank Aziz in the bathtub was the funniest part of the movie.
