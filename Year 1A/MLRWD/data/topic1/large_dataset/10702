This could have been an interesting little movie had it not focused on a pretentious, unlikeable poser. I knew in the first 5 minutes (after Oscar has criticized a young woman's *hands* for lacking wit and experience (!)) that I was not going to like this guy....and moreover, I couldn't understand what made him such a chick magnet. I'm a 35 year old woman and didn't understand the appeal of such a transparently self-obsessed, self-important boy. 
I also found his interactions with his father unreal - and I'm the daughter of an academic, so I know how academics are. But if I lived in NYC (or anywhere else, really) and my 15-year-old son disappeared into the night, never came home, and didn't call as to his whereabouts, you can bet I wouldn't be all nonchalant about it in the morning. Oscar's obvious disrespect towards his dad really bugged me - he fancied himself as the great sophisticate, but he was just a whiny spoiled brat underneath the French trappings. Just once I would've liked to see a character put him in his place, like during the excruciating dinner at the French restaurant, and no one raised an eyebrow at Diane's announcement that "Oscar and I are lovers." (Father's reaction: "Well, Oscar is an adult now...." Aren't we all incredibly enlightened and civilized!) Hello? Parent much? 
Other (very small) gripe: Sigourney Weaver was 53 when this movie was made, not 40. I love her and think she looks great, but I couldn't help but be distracted by "Isn't Sigourney Weaver closer to 50?!" 
The best thing in this movie was Bebe Neuwith...but she couldn't save Tadpole for me.
