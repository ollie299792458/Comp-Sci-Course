A dull, pretentious movie. When it originally screened in my city, the restless and irritated audience booed it.
Originally advertised as a horror-film, the movie now enjoys an undeserved art-house reputation after being majorly championed by one or two well-known film critics.  Yet the conceits (e.g., forest as metaphor for dangerous world; awakening sexuality an uncontrollable beast within us) are tired, and the film is repetitious and way too long.  The structure is marred by too many stories-within-stories and endless flashbacks, so by late in the film when someone once again says "Let me tell you a story about..." it is absolutely agonizing.
The film also suffers from having been made around the time of the highly successful "American Werewolf in London" and its then-groundbreaking special effects.  So the movie's tone is jettisoned at times for extended goopy man-into-werewolf transformation scenes.  Nevertheless, these jarring and dated special effects add interest to an otherwise dull movie.
PS: "The Company of Wolves" is not for kids -- don't let the presence of Angela Lansbury mislead you.
