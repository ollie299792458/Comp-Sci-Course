When I first saw the trailer for Waltz with Bashir, I was taken aback by its trippy, surreal vibe--it reminded me of a Hebrew A Scanner Darkly. Although I was immediately excited to see it, I wasn't sure about its overall quality, considering how ambitious it seemed. The blurbs, strategically inserted throughout the ad, boasted the film as "groundbreaking," "stunning," etc., but I couldn't tell why.

As soon as it was available in my area, I went to see it, and was floored. It was every bit as outstanding as the multitudes of rave reviews heralded. The film melds the hallucinatory aesthetic of a Flash animation film with a documentary, one man's empirical study of his own memory loss and traumatizing past. To beat the thoroughly bludgeoned horse, I've never seen anything like it.

The opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film. A throbbing techno beat resounds on the soundtrack as the camera pans over an animated city landscape, decimated, grimy, and bleak. Out of an alley jumps a black dog, foaming at the mouth, eyes lucid. More dogs are seen joining the first, and they run through the streets, unchecked, knocking aside passerbys and trash cans, never breaking pace. It is an unsettlingly surreal scene, with the run-down city backdrop giving a nightmarish quality to something that would normally seem just strange. The film then proceeds to tell the story of the narrator, Ari Folman, and his attempts to regain his memories of the Lebanon War.

How do the dogs tie in to his search? In brilliantly realized memory scenes, the viewer is left to form their own theories as to their significance. The film never gives anything away--it leaves you to ponder, a film to be digested rather than viewed in passing. And if you take the time to fully understand the implications and the emotional resonance (especially noticable after the heart-stopping final revelation), it is an immensely rewarding film experience.
