Too bad this film didn't last very long at the theatre...probably poor timing by the people who elected to release this around the same time as Sixth Sense. 
Overall, this was a very good film. Very suspenseful and  excellent acting by Kevin Bacon. Loaded with imagery and leaves you  wondering about a lot of things...sort of reminiscent of the Twilight Zone.  These are the types of "horror" films that don't require blood,  gore, and Freddy Krueger types to scare you.  The more realistic a film is,  the more it frightens me...and this film disturbed me enough to keep me  awake for many hours afterward.
I would have rated it 5  stars....except...the film is adapted from a book written by Richard  Matheson (who was a writer and director for the Twilight Zone, and directed  some of Serling's most memorable episodes) There are many parts of the film  which were changed from the book, possibly to make the film a bit more  "90's". (the book was written in the 50's) Some of it wouldn't  bother you unless you've read it, but the film doesn't explore the  characters in an much depth as the book. They also change the circumstances  of the victim's death, (and who the victim is, for that matter)and other  small details (the hypnotist in the book is the wife's brother, not sister)  There are also some characters in the book which would have been great in  the movie and would have complimented Bacon's character, but they are not  addressed at all. 
Overall, I would recommend this film. Just don't watch  it right before bed. =)
