"Stage Door Canteen," like its companion, "Hollywood Canteen," are two examples of a very big part of World War Two culture. Canteens gave service people a comfortable place to just be and make some good memories before going off to do what was extremely unpleasant but necessary. There are so many cameos that I won't list them all, but it's fun to see people like Ray Bolger and Lynn Fontanne kibitzing with the servicepeople. The plot is incidental, but quite honestly, I think they only meant it to be window dressing anyway.

The film reminded me that there are vast differences between the War on Terror and World War Two. For one thing, it's pretty easy today to go through an entire day without thinking that there are men and women fighting to protect this nation. Civilians aren't asked to contribute all that much--no rationing, no war jobs, no posters everywhere reminding us to zip our lips and buy War Bonds. That's why movies such as "Stage Door Canteen" are so interesting and valuable, because they were not only morale-builders for audiences of their day, but they can help viewers today to be grateful for what the Armed Forces do for us, and maybe get us thinking of ways we can show our appreciation.
