As a long-time fan of Inspector Morse, I was pleased to see the Inspector Lewis series produced with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse, not to mention some of the same actors returning in different roles. Perhaps you will find yourself doing what I do when I watch a Lewis episode and see a familiar face--try to remember what role that same actor played previously in one or another of the Morse episodes.

While I've been glad to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis, it's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me the most of their predecessor, the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse. With his background as a former theology student at Cambridge, it's Hathaway who is most likely to recall some obscure detail, of interest only to scholars, to help solve a case he and Lewis are investigating.

If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon. It's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the responses contemporary people have to a religious controversy dating back to the Nicene Council.
