On it's own, the movie itself is easily a 5 out of 5 in the reviews. It's creepy and disturbing and most of us have feared some of the stuff that happens to the kids in this movie happening to us when we were kids.

Having grown up on records, we often ran them backwards to try to hear secret backmasking messages in them - though we never actually did. Our basement was damp, dark and creepy - purely the turf of the washer, dryer and the furnace. My babysitter when I was young was often my older sister, and we made it a point to spook each other with games like "Bloody Mary" and attributing every little creak, crack and groan the house made in the night to something coming to get us.

Back then, my young mind would turn the shapes of my coat rack, lamps and even my robe on the back of my door into menacing shadows that I was certain were monsters. Then there were the storage cabinets that took the place of the space normally under a bed. I was certain that more than once I heard a soft *snick* sound of one of them opening in the darkness. On more than one sleepover, my friends and I made attempts at contacting "the other side" with a cardboard ouija board with a plastic pointer sporting mole foam feet.

The Gate plays on those fears nicely and I love the movie.

So, why give it only 4 stars? Well, I had to subtract something for the presentation. The print is pretty rough and it's present only in a 4:3 "Full Screen" format, instead of its proper wide screen aspect ration of 1.85:1. The movie dates itself a bit here and there, too, but overall my only complaint is with the presentation.
