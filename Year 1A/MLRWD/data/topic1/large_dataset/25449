It's simply a great movie, wonderfully humorous and worthy of repeated viewings. Lots has been said about its fictional portrayals of computers and computer connections, and they are correct; it's highly fanciful and nothing like reality. But equally fictional is the portrayal of police operations and tactics throughout. Police do not smash down doors in riot gear with M-16's aimed just to serve an arrest warrant on some teenage hacker. In terms of sticking to reality, the police portrayals are far more ridiculous than the computer nonsense. But relax, it's not really about computers or police. It's a story of teenagers finding friendships and personal identity through trial, and their struggle to make sense of the world they will one day inherit but don't yet feel a part of. The overly dramatized computer and police stuff give the events the feeling the movie needs. It's not a documentary, but a movie that tells what it feels like to experience events like being arrested. And it does that quite well. (Did I mention a young Angelina Jolie?)
