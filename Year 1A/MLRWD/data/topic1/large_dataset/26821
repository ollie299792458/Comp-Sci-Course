Since there is no synopsis, I'd thought I'd write one since I watched this movie a million times or so growing up.

While Dave is on business in Europe, and Mrs. Miller is in charge, Alvin, Simon, Theodore and the Chippettes are, thanks to the competition between Alvin and Brittany, schemed into a "race" around the world. The terms are that they race in provided hot-air balloons, and the must deliver and receive a Chipmunk or Chippette doll at various, specific destinations.

The race is sponsored by a very wealthy, Bavarian-like, brother-sister duo, who only say they are "very bored." When actually they are part of a diamond smuggling ring that needs a deceptive way to deliver their product.

The plot is the danger that the race puts our main characters into - both because of the bad guys, and the fact that they are racing hot-air balloons around the world. (Maybe this is where Richard Branson got the idea.) Anyway, how the Chipmunks and Chippettes get out of the trouble they put themselves in, not to mention how they deceive Dave and Mrs. Miller about it is the movie.

The thing about the movie versus other Chipmunk escapades is that the songs are original to the movie, not covers. They are rather catchy, and the animation is that nice 1980s, colorfully detailed, kind. The one that's still actually animated and not CGI.

The interesting part is to guess where they are in the world during the various music montages. Oh, and there's a baby penguin.
