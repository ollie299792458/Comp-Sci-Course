There is something vernerable and bygone of B&amp;W TV, the earliest years of Doctor Who are certainly no exception. Perhaps they are the best example. The War Games, the final story featuring Patrick Troughton as The Doctor was also the 10-ep. epic which re-painted the visual pallet of the series from monochrome to color. But there is more to this story than visual history, there is a cunning and evolving story in The War Games. 
The story subtely, yet when viewed in a whole, strikingly moves from the alledged trenches of WW1 France, flits across multiple earthly wars and times, sneaks into the cold alien chamber Central Control, freezes as 2 old enemies square off in ideology and finally forces itself back to the one place the Doctor could never return-Home.
For me personally, this story is most fondly remembered for debuting the Time Lord known as The Master, the arch-enemy of the Doctor. Their emnity, hatred, and yet enduring mutual admiration first surfaced here and still thrives to this day, 33 years later. Trully, The War Games, for its importance to the mystery of the Doctor, the introduction of the Master, the departure of companions Jamie and Zoe and the return to Gallifrey is a great cornerstone to the mythology of Doctor Who. And one great story to boot!
