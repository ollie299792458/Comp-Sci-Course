Because:

1. It will make you laugh. Sometimes it can be kind of weird humor, but at least you will smile from time to time trough the movie.
2. If you are a guy, definetly you will enjoy both visuals: Sarah and Rachel, if you are a woman, well, it is not so appealing, but surely you were not looking for handsome actors in the first place.
3. It can be the same old history, but the important thing is how is being told, specially from the point of view of one guy that is heart-broken. It surely must have some true about how a guy goes around after ending a 5-years relationship. That he spends most of the movie crying about his lost girlfiend it is true, but "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" already tells you that.
4. It is not a Oscar nominated movie, we are all clear of that, then, if you are loooking for some romance, some comedy  and spending a nice couple of hours with some friends, or even by yourself it is worth it, it is most honest that many films around about the same subject. And surely it can start some interesting discussions about love / honesty, etc.
5. Last, if you are looking the "serious" side of the movie, I think the Jason Segel introduces some metaphors to explain his feelings. For example the male nudity part, some people asked if it was really necessary, I am not the person to answer that, Jason is, but my guess is that he was trying to show how vulnerable he was at those moments, same case for the cereal breakfast, jumping out to the water along with Rachel, surffing before going home, all those scenes were showing something more about Peter and his feelings, I liked those little parts of the movie.
