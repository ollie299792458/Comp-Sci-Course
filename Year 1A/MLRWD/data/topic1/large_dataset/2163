Cons:

After reading reviews I thought it would be more challenging than it was. I'm in my 3rd trimester and I used to be in shape but since I got pregnant I haven't been doing almost ANY exercises. I was surprised that it was quite mild even for me. There are 3 stages - beginner, intermediate and advanced, but just for several exercises. I'd prefer if it was a bit more difficult sometimes.

Pros:

1. I love the voice and music and the way this program is done. Everything is very clear, the instructor counts for you so you know how many reps you have left, which is nice. She helps with breathing too.

2. Her intonations aren't "over energetic", which I really like. She speaks with a slight French accent which I find very cute and it doesn't bother me at all. It's perfectly understandable.

3. If you are looking for a classical aerobics workout you probably won't like this one. I love that it's quite slow but not boring, it just helps you to concentrate on your movements.

  If you are looking for a easy\almost easy general workout for the whole body - this DVD is perfect. If you are looking for more exercises on your lower body - there isn't much there for it. I like Pilates Pregnancy Workout better from this point of view. I'm rotating these two and it seems to keep me more or less in shape and it's not too difficult so I don't drag it.

Some people wrote that they are following it even after pregnancy. I'm definitely going to use something more challenging after my baby is born.
