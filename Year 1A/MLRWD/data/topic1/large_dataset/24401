Even for those days this is not necessarily great video, considering Woodstock. However it is good to see so many positive and good reviews of this disk. The real value of this disk is the complete band and at a point where there skills are starting to flourish. Perhaps tyhe best concert footage of the group is the Red Rocks Concert. But that is not really an indication to me as to what this band was about and their real skill. To me this concert shows the real Moody Blues, one of a group that really was something greater than the sum of its parts. Having seen the Moody Blues in Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens. They are not the same group without Mike Pinder and his songs and keyboard playing and vocals. Even this concert does not really show them at their full potential and greatness. What is most interesting is the honest comments particularly of Justin Hayward and particularly by Graham Edge about their misguided views about being able to change the world and the real coruption that became part of the music business. However that certainly does not take away from the obvious talent that made the Moody Blues what they were. The music they created as a unit is some the best anywhere, anytime.
