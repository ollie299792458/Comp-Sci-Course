Is SpookyChick the only reviewer on this webpage with a brain?  This is an incredibly stupid movie.  Poor Terry Wolfmeyer.  (Joan Allen in an excellent role).  Her husband has run off with his Swedish secretary and we're supposes to feel sorry for her and understand her anger.  Except she looks great for a fifty year old woman.  And she lives in a gorgeous expensive home in the Detroit suburbs that is always spotless.  And she has four beautiful daughters.  And she has no need to work outside the home.  And she seems to be a great cook based on her fancy kitchen and all the home cooked meals we see.  And on top of all this she has Kevin Costner for a boyfriend.  Please give me these problems!  Terry also seems to have money coming out the wazoo.  She has too much pride to go through a messy divorce.  Apparently she has no need for alimony or child support, even though one of her girls goes to an expensive private school and the mortgage on a house like that is a whopper.  The only hint that money is a fact of life in this fantasy world is when she sells some land behind her home to a subdivision developer.  Terry must have an amazing lawyer though.  There doesn't seem to be any problem with her husband not being around to cosign the deal or even the need for his power of attorney.  Oh well, maybe she inherited the land.  Another glaring omission in the movie is the fact that one of her daughters marries and has a baby.  But despite numerous family gatherings in the film, the baby is never seen.  Maybe the director didn't want to be bothered with an infant on the set.  And I haven't even described the stupid ending yet.  Anyone not fooled by Clark Kent's glasses can figure it out half way through the film.
