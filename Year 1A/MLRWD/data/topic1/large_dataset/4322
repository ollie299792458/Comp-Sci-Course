Most dramatic TV series cannot sustain more than 20 episodes.  Look at all of the complaints about Lost this season and not moving towards completion.  Kidnapped had a feature film feel for every episode.  There was no filler.  Why?  Because early on, they knew that there would be only 13 episodes.  They had to have narrative drive to get the plot and subplots tied up in 13 episodes.  So, I miss Jeremy Sisto and Delroy Lindo and Dana Delany and Timothy Hutton and WillDenton (the kidnappee) and Mikalti Williamson (what would have happened to his character if the series had been picked up for the year and maybe next year?), it's the way that I miss Nicholson and Damon, and Wahlberg, and DiCaprio after The Departed ended.  I know that each of them will be good in something else again.  So, NBC did us a favor by canceling Kidnapped in its prime.  We can remember it as a great show, not as a show in which Knapp tortures somebody for the thousandth time like Jack Bauer has in 24. British shows like Fawlty Towers and The Office (British version) tend to go for 13 - 25 episodes, then call it a day.  And we remember them fondly.  Our shows go on too long and get flabby.  But not Kidnapped.

If you haven't watched it at all or only saw an early episode or two, you are in for a real treat.  I envy you that you get to discover each episode anew.
