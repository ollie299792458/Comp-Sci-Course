Sweet November (2001, Warner Bros. Pictures) is a touching movie to watch. I really enjoyed it. The end brought me to tears. Sweet November teaches the importance of the simpler things in life. The film portrays values toward people and relationships. Sweet November isn't a movie with loads of glamour or special effects, but the story and characters will emotionally touch you.

Nelson Moss is an advertising executive. He isn't able to see anything past his busy career. Nelson has it all - total control of his fast-pace life. Everything changed the day Nelson crossed paths with the spontaneous, attractive and good-natured Miss Sara Deever. Nelson's life began a downward spiral. He lost his job after a blowup during a presentation for a client at work. Upon returning home, Nelson's girlfriend bid him farewell. Being a work-a-holic, Nelson's job was his life. Nelson is having a difficult time accepting his current situation.

Sara pries into Nelson's life. Sara has a special gift, helping men with problems. She brings Nelson into her home and into her life for the month of November. For one month, she will dedicate herself to Nelson so he could learn to live a more meaningful life. Why a month? It's long enough to make an impact without having to become too emotionally attached. Sara's life circumstances prevent her from making a lifetime commitment to anyone. Considering Sara's secret illness, she prevents herself from a lifelong commitment to anyone.

Sweet November helps us see what life is meant to be about, to cherish our time with each other. We can't always predict how much time we have left in life, so it is important to live life each day to the fullest.
