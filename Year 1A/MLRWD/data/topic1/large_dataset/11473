With the arrival of "Gladiator" to DVD, movie fans and critics are cheering to the film's famous chant of "Maximus! Maximus Maximus!"  While indeed an impressive film, the arrival of "Conan the Barbarian" to an excellent collectors edition DVD makes a welcome companion.
"Conan the Barbarian" is a fantastic film in which the marriage of visual style with beautiful rich music creates a rare fantasy adventure unlike any to blaze the big screen.  Ok, all fans of Conan know this.  So what makes the DVD Collector's edition so great?
1. Widescreen: I can actually see all of Arnold's sword now! 2. Audio: While still a mono soundtrack, the DVD creates a CD like audio which is presented in all its glory. 3. Documentary: Awesome!  So many facts, so many interviews, so much insite.  Conan heaven! 4. Full Feature Commentary: Arnold and John (the director) are both funny and informative.  Who knew Conan had so much depth?  Only the obsessed fans like me of course! 5. Cut Scenes &amp; Special Effects:  Awesome again!  Not enough words.
Overall, this is what DVD should be all about!  Great Movie (widescreen), excellent picture, clear sound, and lots and lots of obsessed fan stuff.  Get it!
