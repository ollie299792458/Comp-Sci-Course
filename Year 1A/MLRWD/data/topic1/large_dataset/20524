I did not realize that Reservation Road was really about until I actually watched it.  Basically, it about a divorced lawyer who reurns from a baseball game with his son, answers his cell phone while driving and hits a middle school aged boy, killing him instantly.  He does NOT stop (grounds for disbarment)and he hides his SUV.

The victim's father witnesssed the tragedy and relentlessly tries to ascertain the identity of the driver and bring him to justice.  He goes to a law firm for assistance since the police are unable to do anything and he is referred to a partner who is no other than the driver of the hit and run vehicle.  Such poetic justice!  To add to the web of intrigue, the father's daughter takes piano lessons from the driver's ex-wife!

Eventually, he finds out the identity of the driver by sneaking into one of the bedrooms and finding a picture of the driver, his son and the dark colored SUV with the grille guard.  The rest is all suspensful.  I found it interesting and was pleased that there was closure as well as perceived retribution.
