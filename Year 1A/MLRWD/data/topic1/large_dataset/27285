What a passion for Christ!

As they say in "The making of the Apostle": Sometimes we didn't know if they were acting or it was real. I don't think there can be a more honest approach to the work of Christian evangelizers in American film history. Simply put, it's a great film, very emotional, very spiritual, and very human. Robert Duvall plays a Texas preacher whose wife cheats on him and fills for divorce. Then she even takes away his church from him (I didn't understand how that happened, though). The course of events sets him on a journey to meet his fate, which is no other than to continue giving out the Word in the holy name of Jesus.

Duvall plays an honest and true Christian preacher, but at the same time a very real man, with his own flaws and temptations. Eliminating the darker side of this man from the story, I think, wouldn't have paid a better tribute to truth, not would it have made a better film. The important thing that comes up here is the honesty (the reality) of Christian worship. There is no mockery of Christians. There is no intention to evangelize either. This is not a Christian film; it is a film about Christians, true Christians, spirit filled followers of Christ.

Even if non believers can't find anything here to move them closer to the Lord, at least they will have an insider's view of a Spirit filled church. So many people are put off by religion, but this is not about religion, as you see in liberal churches, this is the real Thing. All the characters are played superbly. The 2 hours and 10 minutes pass real fast.
