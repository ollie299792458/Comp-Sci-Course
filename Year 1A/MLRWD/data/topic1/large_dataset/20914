I bought this DVD and CD set because it is a demonstration of human kindness from people who really cared. Nowhere on this DVD can you see the ego of these music legends. They played for the love of music and also to help out people who were in need.

George Harrison made this concert happen because he genuinely wanted to help the people of Bangladesh. I was born many years after the concert but it struck me how kind people were in the 1970's to want to help a bunch of people who really had nothing.

I am also a Bengali and a high school teacher in the US. I use the concert in my classes to show examples of human kindness and a willingness of Westerners to give back to the poor. The cover of the DVD speaks volumes and really makes an impact on anyone who looks at it. I was sadden and heart broken that when George Harrison died the Bangladeshi government did not send a letter of condolence to George Harrison's family or that there were no steps taken to honor the fantastic work done by George Harrison for the Bangladeshi people. So on behalf of a grateful nation and Bengali's everywhere, thank you George for the fantastic concert, music and your love for a nation of people who needed it.
