Truley one of the funniest movies ever made!  This is Mel Brooks at his very best along with a superb cast.  This movie has made millions of people laugh, (hysterically!), for years.  One of the funniest scenes is when the Creature rapes Elizabeth, but she's so overcome by his "size" she bursts out singing "Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!"  That scene is one of the funniest ever filmed, and highly worth metioning!  Other scenes, and quotes include: "Putin' on the Ritz!", "Put the candle back!", "What Knockers", Elevate Me!" "Frau Blucher", (horses whining hysterically!) "Abby Normal", and on, and on, and on...  Also, I believe the term "blucher" is German for glue.  Hell, if I were a horse I'd whine too!

You simply can't go wrong this classic comedy.  It is sure to put a smile on your face and have you quoting the characters lines for years to come.  Way to go Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Cloris Leachman, & Teri Garr!

As for Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle and Madeline Kahn: You all are true comdey legends.  God bless you all, and may you all rest in peace.

Fredrick: "Igor. Will you give me a hand with the bags?"
Igor: "Certainly.  You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban!"

Deserves more than five stars.  WAY MORE!!!
