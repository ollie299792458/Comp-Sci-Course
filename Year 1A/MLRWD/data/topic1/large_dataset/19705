Kutcher's performance was very realistic and believable. He really was using mannerisms that we see in other people in day to day life in his performance. Perhaps that's why the movie was panned- him being in shows critics percieve as "teenybopper" and then coming off as so casual.Some reviewers mentioned various interpretations of the film. Check out the director's cut, listen to the narration. They spell out their intent and maybe that will fill in some holes.There really weren't a lot of "holes" in the script. Obviously you have to be accepting of the premise, but once you accept the main premise it flows nicely. There were a few goofy things that divert attention for a second, mainly caused by budget and time constraints. Like a scene that's set at night but is clearly filmed at dawn. The directors fess up in their narration and to similar occurences. Prosthetic beard at one point after Kutcher shaved. A few lines that just don't jibe, then you find out they let Kutcher ad lib them.Other than those minor knocks, I'd have to warn some people that if they don't like creepy movies like Jacob's Ladder, this probably isn't their bag.The director's cut is even creepier, that's the one I watched and I understand the ending was different in the theater. The ending I watched was almost sickeningly creepy and sad (but not gory), so the movie can be a downer for some.But for those who do like this type of movie, I give it 5 stars because these good and creepy psychological thrillers are basically once every two year finds.
