Despite two problems, this thirty year old film is enjoyable, especially because of Neil Diamond's singing. All of the actors are very good and Laurence Olivier as Diamond's father, a very observant Jew, a cantor, is brilliant. Olivier is the foil against Diamond's need to abandon his religion, violate many of its principles, marry a non-Jewish girl, and sing popular songs that he wrote to mass audiences. We are able to identify with both Diamond and with Olivier, and with the girl as well.

 The problems are, first that the story is simplistic. The struggle between the parent and child is not new. Yet, as previously stated, the acting overcomes this problem and makes the story interesting and entertaining. Second, there are many errors about Jewish practices. Either the advisors to the film did not know Judaism as well as they claimed or the director and the company decided to ignore their advice. But most viewers would not recognize these subtleties, such as no knowledgeable Jew would wish another "good yomtov," a happy greeting, on the solemn day of Yom Kippur.
