When a rich entrapreneur finances a bold experiment, and succeeds in the cloning of Dinosaurs, he needs the authorization of a few experts and critics to ok his new attraction after a fatal accident occurs.  However, during the tour, a Tropical Storm hits the secluded island of Isla Nublar, and all hell breaks loose....and that pretty much sums up one of the greatest movies ever to grace the silver screen.  It was only a matter of time before the release of the Special Edition DVD.
Usually when you see the words 'Special Edition' you can look forward to Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and behind the scenes documentaries.  Well, unfortunately, there really isn't much anything 'special' about this.  Don't get me wrong, the quality of the movie is outstanding.  I have never seen the movie in such great sound and picture quality before.  There are a few 'making of' documentaries and other related things. There are also a few trailers.  However, there is some footage that is still missing from the movie, footage that was NOT cut in the theatrical release, but was cut in the transition to home video.  Now on DVD you would expect some of these scenes back.  That is not the case. There really isnt much making the DVD 'special' other than its incredibly high quality and behind the scenes documentaries.  There are also some fun facts about the Dinosaurs on the island, but it still feels like there could have been more.  All in all, a very good DVD, a must own for fans of the movie.
