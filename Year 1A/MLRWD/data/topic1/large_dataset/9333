I've been reading comics for over 40 years. I have a complete run of the Fantastic Four, including two copies of issue number 1. It's been my favorite comic book since I started reading them. I've been disappointed in some of the Marvel franchise movies, such as Hulk, Daredevil, and Electra. I've also been very pleased with some of them, Spider-Man and X-Men in particular. I think the FF adaptation was very good. Much better than DD, Hulk and Electra, and maybe one notch below Spider-Man and X-Men.

The movie changed, somewhat, the origin of the FF, but essentially they were true to its spirit. The FF was one of the first comic book's to give its characters 3 dimensional personalities and real-life problems. This was novel in the 1960's when the premiere comic books were the "cartoony" Superman and Batman. The personality development has always been an integral part of the FF franchise. I think the movie captured the personalities very well.

The special effects were very good, perhaps not awesome, but very good - again, better than some, not quite as good as others. There have been some complaints about the costume of the Thing. I thought the costume was great. And the special effects for the Torch were also great.

I'm hoping that the movie generated enough revenue for a sequel. I think both the Spider-man and X-Men sequels were better than the originals. I'm hoping the same will be true of the FF. The producers have to spend a lot of time introducing characters in the first movie because many movie-goers will not be familiar with the comic book. Once the introductions are made, the sequels have more time for other developments. Overall, I rate this movie B+
