3 nitpicks that make this movie a 4 instead of a 5.

1) The reveal of young CGI Jeff Bridges at the beginning just doesn't sell and looks bad (also on the TV shot where he's giving a speech at Encom). You buy the CGI more once you're on the Grid because it blends better with the environments. They should have kept the reveal of him being de-aged for CLU after the disc wars when Sam is brought before him.

2)Tron should have played a bigger part and his face should have been revealed at some point: either when he captures Quorra or when he crashes his light-jet into CLU.

3) The very end was a little too "Blade Runner"-esque, I wish they'd have taken those shots, added in CGI effects and particles of the grid re-appearing around the bike in the real world and then used that as a cool transition into the grid-looking end credits sequence. Could have been a cool bridge instead of a hokey fade to black.

In terms of the product, the blu-ray is beautiful, it retains the IMAX aspect ration for a number of scenes and the film itself is a lot of fun!
