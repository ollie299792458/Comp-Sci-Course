ok let me first say im probably the biggest van damn fan ever and i was so excited when he started doing movies again but his last few have really sucked i bought this movie cuz everyone gave it good reviews  AND I DONT KNOW WHY this movie is definitaly not van damn style the storyline is waaaaaay to long he doesnt even get clean till the end and the villian is a joke most pathetic villian ive ever seen in a movie there is nothing good about this movie and van damn looks horrible throughout the whole movie theres really no kicking in this movie just all guns also this is a very graphic movie which is probably the only thing that made it bareable to watch.  the movie goes straight into him being  messed up and do n drugs but it never mentions why or how he got so messed up he becomes clean cuz hes in a coma for a long time near the end of the movie and is also pathetic cuz he has a limp and can barely speak  the makers of this movie deffinitaly were more interested in making a quick buck than a movie
