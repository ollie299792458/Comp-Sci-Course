First off, let me just say I know nothing at all about the Final Fantasy series (although I did see "Spirits Within") and hate anime. In all fairness, that could be exactly why I thought this movie was such sweet sauce. I'm sure the die-hard fans believe the film did an injustice to the franchise.

Watching this flick is the equivallent of watching some really hot chick dance at the bar. You just can't look away.

The CGI is absolutely the best I have ever seen in a movie or on a video game. The creators must have put countless hours in perfecting every detail down to the characters hair. I mean I'm talking serious perfection here, when the wind blows you can see individual hairs on the characters' head move in the breeze. Flippin' amazing.

One of the complaints I've heard is the lack of a cohesive plot. I never felt lost and I can't think of one animated movie I've ever seen expecting a compelling and complex plotline. What I do hope for is to see a flick that is mindless entertainment. That is where "Advent Children" more then succeeds.

I assure you, coming from someone who knows nothing regarding Final Fantasy and dislikes anime, this flick will rock your socks.
