It's easy to see why this film catapulted Wong Kar Wai's status and is considedered one of the best films of the nineties. Not being a fan the first time through, the blu ray resparked my interest for this film so I decided to give it another chance. Lucky for me I made that choice.
  The first half of the film is rather funny dealing with a heart broken cop who runs into a blond wig wearing woman whom he falls for exactly 57 hours later. This is great stuff. The comedic timing of Kaneshiro and Lin are spot on. The smooth transition from the first story to the next is also marvelous. Wong's direction of this film is fresh and invigorating and gives a new meaning to say chick flicks. I prefer the first part over the second however many will tell you they like the second story which deals with a cop who, you can tell is pretty good at picking up women, but the one that interests him now catches him off gaurd so to say. Either way you look at it both stories are great and you get a little bit of everything which makes this a very special film. The blu ray release is perfect and I'm sure it's pretty much exactly how Wong Kar Wai would want anyone to see this film. Picture quality 5/5 Audio quality 4.5/5
