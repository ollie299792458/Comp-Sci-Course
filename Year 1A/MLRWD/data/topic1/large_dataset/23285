OK, just to get this out of the way up front, this is another review preferring "Wings of Desire" over this glossy remake.
It's not that I utterly detest "City of Angels." The director borrowed well from Wim Wenders' German original, particularly the nifty images of dark-coated angels roaming in this world, not in direct contact with human beings, but still able to influence them. And the leads, Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan and Dennis Franz, are capable actors.
And yet, and yet ... in the end, "City of Angels" is merely about a supernatural being who becomes human just to get into the sack with a pretty woman, overlaid with some homilies tacked on about how much he sacrificed to achieve that state, and everything being worth it no matter what tragedy strikes.
Guess they thought they were brave in giving the movie a sad, yet ultimately uplifting ending, but it falls flat.
In "Wings of Desire," the angel's passion for a certain woman is the precipitating factor for him taking the plunge (quite literally), but it's just the final influence in a long-held desire to experience all the sensations that being human confers. Indeed, we never really see the two "get together," and really, there's no need to. There's also much more of a spiritual dimension in the original as opposed to the pat, feel-good sort of theology tacked on to "City of Angels."
Yes, "Wings of Desire" has a much more deliberate pace than "City of Angels" and it does spin out a lot of philosophy, but don't let that scare you away. You don't need a college degree to enjoy it - just a willingness to take the time and let its subtle spell envelop you.
And I'll bet you'll find the moment in "Wings" when Peter Falk says, "I can't see you," but I know you're there," much more delightful than the same moment Dennis Franz has in "City."
