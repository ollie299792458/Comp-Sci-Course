On his way to recruit a new player for his minor league baseball team, coach Arthur 'Murph' Murphy {Dean Cain} runs off the road and uses the phone at a local farmhouse to call for help. While there, he witnesses their son's `golden arm' and convinces the family to allow Mickey {Luke Schroder} play for his team. His parents remains unsure about the situation, since Mickey has Asperger's syndrome, but the coach is convinced that it will work and benefit not only Mickey but the team as well.

My Thoughts

Our girls are getting to the age where they want to watch movies that are more `real life' based and often I am at a loss to find movies that are clean and provide a redeeming story line. A Mile in His Shoes is one that I am happy to add to our collection and am not worried about the kids watching without me there. This is a movie that will also encourage conversation about how we treat others and encourage others who may not be just like us, and also how they may influence and change our view of things.
