I've just received this from the USA this morning [ I live in England ] and the first thing I had to do was compare the 'cropping' of this new DVD edition with the DVD from 2001 [ which was full screen flat ] , which I bought in Illinois, where I worked at the time.

The short answer is:  you're either gonna love it, or hate it.

Personally, I prefer the 2001 disc; what you're seeing there is the fully-exposed camera image, before the cropping that took place in the cinema, when the movie you were watching was projected, as per Kubrick's [ apparent ] wishes.

The problem with this new re-formatting, is that you lose information from the top and bottom of the frame - and it doesn't look right, it feels squashed and uncomfortable.

The image is less sharp than the 2001 transfer, too - not greatly, but it's definitely there, and those of us with an eye for these things will notice it.

The saving grace though is the commentary by Baxter and Garrett Brown, the Steadicam operator on 'The Shining'.  Tremendous!  Full of insights into the production from Garrett, Baxter's comments being largely redundant.

A second disc has three new featurettes, which are interesting as far as they go, but nothing particularly illuminating or special.  Ironically, the fourth ' Special Feature' on this second disc, is the best by far - Vivian Kubrick's masterful documentary on her father's film, which was previously on the 2001 edition.

The long and short of it is this:  Like the Ultimate Editions of the Bond movies from last year, if you're a true fan, you'll want both versions - but KEEP AHOLD OF YOUR 2001 EDITIONS !
