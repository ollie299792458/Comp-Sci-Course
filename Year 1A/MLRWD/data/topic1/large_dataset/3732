"Blues Brothers 2000" is a disappointing sequel, and yet for some reason I preferred it to the other disappointing sequel from the World of Aykroyd:  "Ghostbusters II".  Maybe it's because the greater amount of time that passed between films makes BB2K feel more nostalgic.  Or maybe it's because, to the extent that BB2K is a retread of the original "Blues Brothers", the repetition feels more natural and logical than in GB2.

When Elwood is released from prison and discovers that Jake has passed on, what exactly do viewers expect him to do other than attempt to reunite the band?  What else would he do to rediscover meaning and purpose in his life?  Therefore it makes perfect sense that the first two-thirds of BB2K echoes plot elements from the previous film.  Where BB2K falls down is in the third act -- the Battle of the Bands at Queen Mousette's -- which is a spectacular musical climax but leaves much to be desired in comedy-action terms.

I was surprised by how moved I was to see the character of Elwood in another movie, in particular when he plays his harmonica for the first time.  But the most remarkable scene in BB2K is probably "Ghost Riders in the Sky", which combines American popular music, a supernatural manifestation, and the Bluesmobile doing something amazing.  It's the perfect cinematic summation of Dan Aykroyd's interests and career.
