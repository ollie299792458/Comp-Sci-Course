i like the movies about space.
and the idea of actually (more or less) experiencing what astronauts do on their way to and back from space, let me buy this movie. just the launch scene gives me goosebumps every time i see it. its such an powerful happening, it leaves me in awe.
i  have just seen it again a few days ago, because of the columbia tragedy, where our first israeli astronaut ilan ramon was among the crew of seven.

the part where i am on the edge of the chair, is the reentry from space. and i can watch that movie a hundred times and will still be at these scenes at the edge of the chair.
it shows the heatup and the shaking on reentry from the cockpit and lets you imagine what the seven columbia astronauts went through until the shuttle unfortunately broke up around them.
yeah here and there it has a few flaws, but they are minor to the viewing experience of this movie.
if you are interested in the shuttle flights and want to have some insight about the nasa (training) procedures and have fun, go for it.
