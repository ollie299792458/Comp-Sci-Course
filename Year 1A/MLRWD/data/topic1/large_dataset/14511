Set years after "Jaws 2", (I don't know where "Jaws 3" fits in) where widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) lives happily in Amity with youngest son Sean who's now a police deputy. Her contented life is shattered when Sean is killed by a great white on Christmas Eve while trying to clear a channel marker. She flees to the Bahamas to eldest son Michael (Lance Guest) where he works as a marine biologist. The shark manages to follow her from Martha's Vineyard to the Bahamas in three days. Pretty amazing, considering that sharks don't like warm water in the first place. That's the first of many flaws in this movie, and Roger Ebert took the time to list each one in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times. Michael Caine is wasted as carefree pilot Hoagie, in whom Ellen takes a romantic interest. Film does have a slick look and great scenery in the Bahamas, but the shark doesn't look real and is about as frightening as a rubber duckie. Michael Caine declined to appear in person to accept his Academy Award for "Hannah and her Sisters" because of this movie. That move alone might have killed the career of a lesser actor. Kind of neat how he emerged from a sinking airplane with his clothes fully dry.
