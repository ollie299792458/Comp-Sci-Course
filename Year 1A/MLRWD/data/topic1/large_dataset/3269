How anyone can rate this at less than 5 star beats me.
OK, so the storyline is cheesy, the history ludicrous, the acting (what there is of it) madly hammy, and Janet Leigh's astonishing cantilever bra not only defies historical reality and belief, but gravity itself, but the whole thing sweeps along with such incredible gusto that you really don't care. It is a total hoot, and seldom if ever have I had the sense that everybody involved in a movie had such a whale of a time making it.
Stunning scenery, outstanding cameratography, a great battle and a thrilling climactic duel. Plus a decently literate script with a line or two to die for ('I think I'll go and watch that slave drown' springs to mind, as does the dialogue revolving around Leigh's bodice being too tight for her to row).
Compare The Vikings with the stupendously dull multi-Oscar winning (how? why? what was the jury *on*?) Ben-Hur of the following year. All anybody who isn't certifiably insane wants to watch the latter for is the fantastic 10 minutes or whatever of the chariot race. As for the turgid remainder (even the sea battle is pretty cruddy), forget it. Now with The Vikings, 90 minutes or so of unremittingly rollicking entertainment.
Disengage brain, slot video/DVD into player, line up beers and *enjoy*!
