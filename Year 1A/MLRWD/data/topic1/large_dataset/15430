The film's fresh, funny dialogue packs enough power to keep things interesting. Ashley Judd plays a working woman (Jane Goodall) who falls for a co-worker Ray (Greg Kinnear). The story has been told before...he has a girlfriend and they're having problems. Jane and Ray date and decide to move in together but he starts to push her away and breaks her heart and gets back with his ex. After the devastating end to their relationship Jane begins to develop a thesis that male behavior is directly related to that of wildlife. She studies the tendency for animals to be noncommittal and compares men to bulls, dogs, and other creatures. To prove her theories, she enlists the help of her roommate Eddie (Hugh Jackman),a womanizer who falls into all of the patterns of her research, whom she moves in with after Ray and her breakup. Though the theories she comes up seem to make sense she finds there are real men out there who don't go for the "new cows" and that as Jackman says "Rays not the only man your ever going to love".
