Every single martial-art movie that came after this one owes a debt to Bruce Lee.  Every.  Single.  One.  That I write it so confidently, definitively, speaks of arrogance: how could I purport to say such a thing, in light of the thousands that followed?
My arrogance is merely supreme confidence in my assessment.  Bruce Lee would approve.
From the opening fight scene (filmed last) to the final refocus on the bear claw, Bruce Lee's fully-realized vision is pure entertainment.  That it happens to be the best martial-arts movie ever filmed is almost frosting.
Enough of the preamble.  Let's get down to why I can call up my cousin Jason and we can watch this movie over the phone every time it's on.  How we know all the dialogue, get shivers when we see the action... because the fights are incredible.
Even today, these are some of the most realistic fight scenes in cinema.  Not the realism in the sense of wrestling with a drunk guy in a parking lot real, or a short road rage exemplar.  No, this is karate and kung-fu and kempo going head-on, no wires, no stunt doubles, just Bruce Lee kicking Sammo Hung's ass in the opening scene (that's right, *THAT* Sammo Hung), Bruce Lee wiping out sixty guards, Bruce Lee absolutely dismantling Bob Wall in a tournament.
Oh yeah, Jim Kelly was pretty good, too. &lt;laughing&gt;
Seriously, Jim Kelly *was* pretty good.  He moved better than John Saxon, that's for sure.  And for all the artifical devices, the silly premises (and there are many), it's a wholly enjoyable movie, and smart, if you can believe that.  Bruce Lee's acting ability will impress you, and there are hidden gems all over this flick.
Don't take my word for it.  Rent it.  Buy it.  Order a pizza and have your buddies over.  And just remember: boards don't hit back.
