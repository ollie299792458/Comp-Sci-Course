Hi,

I watched the movie on amazon instant video... thingy in HD. Quality was good, no streaming issues. Initially, it paused during the producing company's logos but the movie itself played smoothly.

After watching the trailer this presented itself as a Sherlock Holmes-style thriller. Overall, the movie is well-done. If you like Cusack (the reason why this was a must to watch for me) then this fits right into other performances and patterns of his movies. The costumes were appropriate as were the settings/scenery.

Now, the plot felt a bit shallow and I would have walked away and come back to it had I not paid $4.99 for the rental (the famous "Box" does not have the Bluray just yet). I did like the ending/last few minutes and thought that they were creative. Would I watch it again? Most likely not. And, I would not by the DVD/Bluray on sale either.

However, if you like Cusack and are a big fan, you should -- without question -- watch this movie. He does well with the gloomy/depressed intellectual with that forever shimmer of hope inside of him. I think the movie reminded me of  blend of V for Vendetta, Sherlock Holmes, and The Legends of Sleepy Hollow; Holmes being the least similar.
