I actually stumbled upon this movie in the TV guide and decided to watch it, only because it had Sean Connery.  It was however given four stars by the critics.  SO I thought how good could it possibly be?  It was  tremendous.  Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors sonce I  saw him in James Bond, The HUnt For REd October, and and The Rock, but The  Man WHo would be king is very close in my opinion to being his best movie.  Not to take anything away from Michael Caine, because he too was fantastic.  The plot was amazing, but in the same time, I could actually see this  happening at the time this movie took place (early 20th century).  John  Huston is such a great director, and this is one of his finest works, and  that's saying a lot, since he directed THe Maltese Falcon and The African  Queen.  The scene where Daniel Dravot falls and his crown also falls from  his head and they both disappear into the valley.  Amazing.  The many  scenes with the monks are also fantastic.  Overall, this is without one  of the best movies I have ever seen.  It's got great cinematography,,  acting, and direction.  Everything you should want in a movie.  Buy it!
