I have seen this movie many times, I know most of the lines and all the parts get better every time.  I rented a horrible HBO Video version of the movie and the screen was horrible and the audio wasn't too big either, a rough sort of mono mix.  The DVD must do justice and take out the grayness in the colors, add more color and of course improve the sound.  The gunshots and explosions sounded horrible I think in the original tape so I think that is improved on the DVD.  The front cover looks a lot different than the original movie poster and mostly the video boxes but get it? new cover-new movie?  The synth music is great I think, it gives it the whole robot 80s feeling that the 2nd movie couldn't make with the stupid strings and steel clank noises.  The first one seems better because it's so original and it focuses more on story instead of action and guns.  This movie has its gross parts like Arnold punching a guy through the stomach, taking out his eyeball, and sliting his arm to look at machinery but it's all old effects so it's really fake but much more realistic than Friday the 13th. Anyways, this movie is classic and it doesn't make me scared anymore because 1997 has already passed and that's when the war was supposed to happen. All in all a great flick
