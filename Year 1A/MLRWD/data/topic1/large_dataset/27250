My wife and I are fanatical about scifi. We'll watch anything. The three star review for this film convinced us to give it a try. It was bad; worse than bad, actually. I've never written a movie review in my life, but I felt it was my duty as a fellow human being to save even one other person from watching this. To summarize...
plot: what plot
acting: meh
cinemaphotography: I am sea sick from the camera work
effects: none
...all topped off with a WTF ending that makes you want to cut out the part of your brain that stores the memory of this film.

I wish I could have my time back. Wish I could go lower than one star. In fact, as a gift to humanity, I may create dozens of false identities and use them solely to give additional one-star reviews for no other reason than to drag the average rating down as close to zero as i can (which would still be too high a rating for this film).

On the bright side, I would highly recommend this movie to all my enemies.
