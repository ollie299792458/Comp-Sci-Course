The 3D was pretty darn good. Rich detail and the birds eye view of the Canyon were awe inspiring. I try not to base my review on anything but 3D and how it looks but the I had a hard time simply taking in all the beauty because of the heavy conversationalist/ water conservation overtones through out the film. While I support the ideas expressed in the film I would have liked to have taken the beautiful raft river ride down the Colorado River free of interruption.
Very sharp and beautiful detail was apparent throughout the movie, and it gives you a sense of just how much depth the Grand Canyon has. Spectacular birds eye footage that when watching it in 2D lacks some of that luster that I saw in the 3d version. The 2d was still very pretty but which would you rather view, a screen of high definition images, or the birds eye as it sores through the canyon. I envy the birds.

The 3d was good, the movie it self was alright, but I hoped to see more breathtaking images of the Grand Canyon and I did not get that. Robert Redford it seemed only narrated a tiny part of the movie. That was pretty disappointing, it was like they said Morgan Freeman was narrating a film, but than 90% of it was narrated by Andy Dick. I realize that has nothing to do with the 3d, but when I bought the film I was under a different expectation. Ultimately the film was pretty, but political overtones and 3 different narrators hindered my overall experience. Also if you are looking for another awesome Imax 3d movie check out Tahiti big wave. That was a fantastic 3D Imax movie.
