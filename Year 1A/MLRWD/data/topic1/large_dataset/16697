I just got my copy of the BluRay version of BEN-HUR.  This version is absolutely fantastic or any other adjective that you want to use to describe it.

I was 14 years old when this movie was originally released in 1959.  In the ensuing 52 years I have watched this movie in excess of 600 times.  It would be a gross misunderstatement to say that this is my "favorite movie" of all time.  I have had versions in Betamax, VHS, DVD and now in BluRay.  BluRay is by far the best version of the movie released to date.  I don't see how they can do a better job but with technology being the way it is I'm sure that a much better version will be available in the years to come.  The question is will I be around to see it?

I lived in the Boston area about 20 years ago.  The Wang Center was created about that time period.  The Wang Center contained, I believe, it was a 20 screen, state-of-the-art theatre complex.  To introduce the cinema to the people they had a contest and the top 20 films would be shown in the opening weeks.  BEN-HUR was one of them.  They got a remastered version of it and Charlton Heston appeared on the stage to introduce the film.  One hell of a night.  I thought that this version was superior.  Though it's only a fond memory at this time it doesn't compare to the BluRay version that is now available.

I wish that I could recommend the 50th Anniversary set for $44 but I can't.  When the movie soundtrack was released it came in a package that had an information booklet on BEN-HUR.  I was hoping that booklet would be in this presentation set.  It wasn't and I think they made a major mistake in not releasing the booklet.  Get the disc NOT the package.
