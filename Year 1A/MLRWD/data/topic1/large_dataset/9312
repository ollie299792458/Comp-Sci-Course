This movie is a different kind of comedy than most. I've come to the same conclusion as a lot of other reviewers have. This movie is either loved or hated. There is no middle ground. I absolutely love this movie. I could watch it all day, everyday. But then there are people like my girlfriend who can sit through the movie and not even crack a smile. She says its stupid and not at all funny. I can't pin point the reason that people can have such different opinions about a movie. But since I'm writing this and I loved it, it gets five stars. Will Ferrell is hilarious in this and Steve Carell had me rolling on the floor. The one liners in this movie were fantastic. My friends and I quote this movie to death. If you haven't seen it, rent it first before you buy it. Just in case you fall in the "haters" group for this movie. However, if you enjoy the comedic genius of the following, go buy it immediatly. If you love Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Jack Black, and/or Luke Wilson...you will love this movie.
