First, let me say that I am an unabashed BG fan and have been since I was eight.  Most people wonder why while extolling the virtues of "better" sci-fi.  I counter with the fact that I like to look past the surface glitz and glammer at the substance of a show and BG had a wealth of that.  When I heard there was finally going to be a boxed set, I was elated.  And I was not disappointed.
This is one great set.  Universal leads out with the opening episode that has many restored scenes and a great (and at times hilarious) commentary by Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Herb Jefferson.  The following episodes are transferred perfectly to DVD and contain a wealth of deleted scenes, some of which are pretty amazing.  For instance, watching how Viper scenes were shot against timed film on a rear projection backdrop made me realize just how old school some the special effects were.  No blue screen acting here!  It also made me appreciate the high quality they tried to instill in each episode.
Throughout the collection are other nice mini-documentaries and short commentaries from the cast and crew.  There is also a really nice photo gallery with many great shots from the production of the show.  Man those models were big!
About the only drawback to the whole production is that the clarity of DVD shows some of the rough edges of this 25 year old series.  Matte outlines, wire rigging and such sometimes show up clearly on the screen.  George Lucas took the time to wipe that stuff out of the first three Star Wars movies.  Universal should have done the same.
Even with the rough edges, this is a fantastic set and one I highly recommend to anyone who is (or was) a fan of the series.
