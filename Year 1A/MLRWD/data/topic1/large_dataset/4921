Interestingly enough, my dad didn't want to watch this film because he thought it would be too similar to "Kung Pow", which, being the intellectual stalwart that he is, he found quite stupid.  I must admit that from the previews, I thought more or less the same thing(except that I liked "Kung Pow"!).  How wrong I was!

It's very hard to categorize "Kung Fu Hustle".  While in many ways it plays like the classical kung fu "chop sockey" films of the early 70s ("Return of the Dragon", "Chinese Connection", "Drunken Master", etc.), it's far more than that.  Imagine a blend of Jackie Chan's "Drunken Master", mixed with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Kill Bill", with a Road Runner cartoon thrown in for good measure.  It's pure entertainment.  The martial arts sequences are fast-paced and excellent, probably the best I've seen in a film since "Hero".  There are some great characters(i.e., the Landlady; and the musician assassins have one of the most compelling attacks I've seen in a movie in ages! You'll see what I mean...), and although it's quite violent in places, it also has its light moments, and humor.

My only criticism would be that the guy who's supposed to be the protagonist doesn't really get that much screen time, and he doesn't do anything remotely honorable or heroic until the very end.  I think writer Stephen Chow could have done a little more with his transformation from gutter slime to super-powered master of the Buddha's Palm.  But hey, it's a movie... ;) Watch it!
