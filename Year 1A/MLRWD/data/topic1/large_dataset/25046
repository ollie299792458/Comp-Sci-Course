I didn't think I'd like this movie. And at the beginning, I was sure it would be dull until maybe the last five minutes, like a lot of movies are. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.
Talia Shire and her  doctor husband head up to Maine, where the husband investigates pollution  from a papermill. Meanwhile, something is out in the woods, killing people.  After a family of campers is killed (you have to see the exploding sleeping  bag scene--the best! ) Shire, her husband, and an American Indian couple  travel to the place of the murder with a helicopter pilot. Among their  searching, they find two deformed baby creatures and bring it to an Indian  camp inhabited by the American Indian woman's grandfather. Some people from  the papermill show up looking for the Indian man, but so does the creature,  looking for its babies and for a kill. And thus begins some real  action!
This movie is great. Only a tad dull in the beginning, and  catches up and gets to be one of the best! The scenes of action are  relentless and suspenseful, and the ending is very cool! I love how this  creature can hurl people twenty feet away with one swipe. This is a  definite recommendation. I don't know what everyone hates about this so  much.
