Exiled Prince Valiant of Scandia travels to King Arthur's Camelot, finds the friendship of Sir Gawain, the enmity of the turncoat knight Sir Brak, romance, conflict and a singing sword!

This is a wonderful movie I remember from childhood. It contrasts with the dark, profane, anti-hero garbage produced today by Hollywierd. This movie is bright, colorful with wonderful costumes and sets. I am struck by how good these old films truly are. Robert Wagner does a fair job of Valiant, Sterling Hayden is excellent as the veteran knight Gawain and James Mason gives a veteran performance in the role of the traitorous Sir Brak.

This is the story of a young prince of Scandia living in exile who journeys to King Arthur's court in Camelot. Prince Valiant wishes to become a knight of the Round Table so he can help his father retake his throne in Scandia. Along the way, he is befriended and mentored by Sir Gawain, foremost knight of the Round Table. He is caught up in the treason of Sir Brak who masquerades as the "Black Knight" intent on usurping King Arthur and making common cause with the Vikings who deposed Valiant's father.

There's lots of adventure, swordplay, battles, romance and honor to go around and a good time will be had by all who watch this great old film! I recommend this DVD with five stars!
