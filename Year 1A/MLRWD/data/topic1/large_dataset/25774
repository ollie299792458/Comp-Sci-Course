Armageddon:

1. Mark Henry vs Booker T: This was not good at all, mark henry is impossible to work with, these two just didnt have any chemistry at all, not a good way to start the show, this was a typical raw match *3/4

2. RVD(c) vs Randy Orton IC Title Special Ref= Mick Foley: This is very underrated, it was really good, the match goes back and forth, it has a good amount of time, these two connected very well, some nice spots, and the ending was pretty good to ***3/4

3. Chris Jericho/Christian vs Lita/Trish Stratus Battle of the Sexes: This was horrible, stupid and pathetic, I hated every minute of it, the women botched everything which I was expecting, this was so predictable, it was honestly hard to watch, christian and jerichos worst ever match DUD!!! (0 Stars)

4. Shawn Michaels vs Batista: This was ok, I mean I expected better from these two, the problem with this match is that it dragged on, and it had no real story to it, it was like watching raw, I wasnt suprised by the winner **3/4

5. Dudley Boyz(c) vs Mark Jindrak/Garrison Cade vs Val Venis/Lance Storm vs La Resistance vs Hurricane/Rosey vs Scott Steiner/Test Tag Team Turmoil for the World Tag Team Titles: This wasnt very good at all, it was watchable but not good, there were two many bad teams in this one, La Resistance are one of the worst teams ever, there was a funny botch at the start with hurricane(typical), the ending was predictable **

6. Dudley Boyz(c) vs Batista/Ric Flair World Tag Team Titles: I wasnt expecting this, way to short, not even a minute N/A

7. Goldberg vs Triple H vs Kane WH Title: I like this one, goldberg does some of his good power moves, theres a good table spot which fitted in well with the match, kane was a monster in this match, he was impressive, I've seen people give this match a 2 stars, I think that isnt fair at all, these 3 really did mix well with eachother, with the other members of evolution winning the titles, I wasnt suprised with the outcome, you will really enjoy this one ***1/2

Match of the Night: RVD vs Orton
Worst Match of Night: Battle of Sexes Match
Moment of Night: SPOILER= Evolution regain the titles!!!

Overall PPV: 6.25/10
