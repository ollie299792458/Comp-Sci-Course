For me, Final Destination 3 was by far the best of the trilogy. Unlike the first two, this one has a story of its own. Its the graduation carnival and everyone is having a good time, that is, everyone except for Senior and control freak Wendy Christensen, when her friends drag her on a rather "evil" looking rollercoaster ride. She is terrified of being able to see the tracks before her, so she is doomed to sit in the last two seats of the cart with friend Kevin Fischer. The ride has begun and everyone is as tense and excited as ever before. Up, up, up it goes "Its just a ride" she says to herself, "Its just a..." before she can finish, the cart begins to vigorously shake, soon Wendy and Kevin are separated from everyone due to an unfortunate leak in the hydraulics, they know their death is coming soon as they cannot hold on any longer they begin to slip away and before you know it, they are plunging to towards a very painful death when suddenly...everyone is okay. It was just a premonition, but a scary one at that. Wendy is freaked and makes a scene forcing 8 other people off the ride. They are free, but is this the end of the ride for them, or just the beginning?
