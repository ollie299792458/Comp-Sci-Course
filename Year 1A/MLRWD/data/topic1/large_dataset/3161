At first I had doubts about Russell Crowe taking a lead in a romantic comedy but but was I pleasantly surprised. This movie is an absolute sleeping beauty, a winner of a delightful passage in the gorgeous south of France.
Bravura performances by Albert Finny in the flashback scenes of our hero's boyhood. Marvellous story, sharp and witty script, fluid movement, a romp from one end to the other. Most wonderful of all was Crowe who mixed the hard nosed investment fast lane type with a man coming to grips with life's real values so well, I wanted the movie to keep on and on and show us more how he settled into his paradise in the Louberon.
All the supporting players were wonderful, but above all, I loved the cutbacks to Finney and the insights of how the boy became the man. This kind of wonderful character development is rare in most movies today. Kudos to the great
 Ridley Scott and writer Marc Klein for giving me a few hours to forget about the crappy world and remind me that there are places in today's world one can escape to and feel wonderfully human,even if it's
sitting watching a movie. Highly recommended! Vive Lamour!
