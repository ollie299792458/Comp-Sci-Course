This is a great story which captures all the realism of professional athletic competition and training at a time in history when women were expected to confine their creative efforts to home, husband and family.  It shows the rivalry and the unity that develops amongst the women as they put together a league of their own knowing full well that when the men return, their league will be abandoned in favor of the all male professional league of the pre-war years.  Memorable performances by Tom Hanks, Gina Davis, David Straithern and, yes, even Madonna make A League of Their Own a great film.

I was privilaged to have known Jean Cione who distinguished herself as picher for the Rockford Peaches during the time period described in this movie.  Jean was a tall, left-handed picher and was admitted to both the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Italian American Hall of Fame as well.  There is not room enough here to enumerate of describe her athletic ability and accomplishments.  She was instrumental in developing a Women's Athletic Program at Eastern Michigan University.  Jean passed away in Bozeman, MT last November (2010).  The details are there on Google at Jean Cione (Wikipedia)for those interested in knowing more.

Jean and I went to the same church and one of my most prized possessions was a baseball she had signed for me.  She was an example for young women of how to set high goals and to achieve mightily in an area that had been the domain of men only.

This is a great film about a great lady and it is available on Amazon for a great price!
