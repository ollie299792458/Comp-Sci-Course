J Adams may not believe that your comments are worth a response, but I can't resist.  Your correct in your self-description of a lack of mental capacity. I assume that not liking this particular film means that the viewer has no sense of 'humor'?  Wake up!  This film was a box office flop, which according to you logic would mean that most of America has no sense of humor.  Wrong, we're just tired of seeing the same stupid plot with same stupid jokes.  And we are tired of Hollywood assuming that the public consists of 15yr old boys who can only understand bathroom humor.  Stupidity does not always equal funny.  My friends have funnier conversations and it doesn't cost $15.  I don't need to throw away money to watch actors being paid millions just to remake their last comedy (and I use that term loosely). I can turn on cable TV any time of the day and never fail to find another version of this film. And if you haven't noticed, Kutcher plays only 1 character and replays the same unfunny jokes each time.  The comment to see "Honeymoon in Vegas" is on the mark.  At least that film was smart snd funny. In "What Happens.." it's like they wrote the script in 5 minutes after viewing Kutcher's other films. If you think 'elite' is expecting an actual plot and humor, then I guess most Americans are 'elitists'.  I just hate leaving the theater thinking "thats 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back".
  If you want to laugh at the silly or slapstick throw in a copy of "Duck Soup"
