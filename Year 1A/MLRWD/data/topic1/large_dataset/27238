I had seen a show based on the true events of what happened to this family or what the family had told. I rented this to see how they would put it in movie format and while I didnt think it was bad, I dont think they should say "based on a true story". Maybe "inspired by true events" would have been better. The older boy did have cancer and they did move into a house that was a funeral home/haunted but the older boy was actually sent to a psyche hospital after scaring his family too much. He also shared the basement with his younger brother, who also witnessed a lot of the events in the basement. After the older boy was put away the family had an exorcism for the house. There wasnt any evil man that performed rituals, dead bodies or that the house burnt down. There was a man that was a prime spirit but not what they made him to be in the movie. The family just moved out after the exorcism and the boy was eventually released from the hospital. Normally I dont mind when they change the story because they have to add more suspense but I guess what kinda got to me was that they said at the end that the house was rebuilt after the fire and well, the house never burnt down. So that was just wrong flat out. All in all it was decent, not great but decent. I think the show based on what the family had said was better.
