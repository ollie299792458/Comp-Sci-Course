the first xmen movie had to accomplish so much in the introduction of so many characters that most of them as well as the plot itself got short-changed.  that said it was still an enjoyable film.  in this film we know most of the pricipal characters and the essential nightcrawler is introduced in dramatic fashion at the beginning of this movie.  the visual effects are spectacular and several of the actors contribute memorable performances.  not all of them though.  it may not be his fault given the lines he has and minimal screen time, but James Marsden as cyclops seems to prove that it is possible to be at once stiff and limp.  That is a shame because his character is the longest tenured member of the group in the comics as an original member of the 60s xmen and the only original to stick around when the xmen were completely reinvented in the mid 70s.  he deserves a more dynamic role.  maybe in x3 (probably the phoenix story) he will come to life.  hugh jackman is great as wolverine.  and i really like gandalf as magneto.
