A couple years ago (2002 or 2003, I forget which) a nature doc gained notoriety for its outstanding visuals. Winged Migration remains one of the most beautiful, one of the most epic, and one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Though I hold nothing but respect for the cinematography, the lack of any kind of narrative structure and the knowledge that the film was staged under very controlled circumstances made it a near-miss for me, Oscar nomination or not.

With this fresh in mind, I apprehensively put March of the Penguins into my DVD player.

I was impressed. The cinematography was much better than I expected (although Migration definitely still wins in that department), and the filmmakers understood how to make the film interesting to those of us who could care less about the mating rituals of birds. Morgan Freeman's narration was spot-on (of course it was, it's Morgan Freeman!), and the writing gave the film emotional weight where other nature documentaries run dry with facts instead of passion.

What these creatures endure is mot something to take lightly. When I first heard of the film, my principle response (along with a reluctant curiosity) was "They're animals. They can take it." But after watching them take it, I realize just how trivial most other natural exploits seem by comparison. They don't just march in the cold, they march in an unimaginable cold for days or weeks without sleep, spend months without food in the harshest conditions imaginable without shelter, and with nothing to do but dream of their offspring who they will inevitably abandon when and if they survive the winter.

By the way, parents of unlucky offspring are likely to try to steal a chick from another parent.

During a year marked by great documentaries and less than great everything else, March of the Penguins holds its own against some extremely stiff competition. Murderball might take the gold, but Penguins went down fighting.
