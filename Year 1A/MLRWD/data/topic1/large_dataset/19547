I never saw the cgi enhanced version of ET until I bought the Ultimate Gift Boxed Set because I was stubborn and believed that ET should have been left alone in it's original theatrical format-I was wrong. I am one of many who is tired of Hollywood trying to make everything politically correct nowadays and was sick to hear that ET was going to fall victim to it's influence. While it is true that the government officials firearms were cgi replaced with radios, I didn't really notice because the film's magic worked anyway. In the 2002 version we find ET much more agile than we were led to believe in the opening sequence when he is trying to escape the authorities, running and jumping like a forest animal. There is an added scene with ET in the bathroom and cgi enhanced effects are added to the starship's engines when it takes off. All in all, the cgi effects were perfectly executed and looked as real as you can get.
The Ultimate Box set also includes the original version which was the only way to get it, unfortunately. But it also includes a fourth disc (CD) of John Williams soundtrack and a bonus DVD full of extras. There is a hard cover book of ET, from concept to classic, with extras in it as well as a collectible senitype from a scene in the film. Considering all this the price wasn't bad at all, especially since I got it for about [$] less than the suggested retail price! But if you don't want to spend the money or if you feel that you may be missing something if you don't get the original version, put your fears to rest. MY family and I enjoyed the remastered version as much as the original and I wouldn't have missed a thing if I didn't purchase the box set only for the 1982 version. The film is still a beautifully put together work of art no matter which version you watch. 1982 or 2002, go ahead and get either one!
