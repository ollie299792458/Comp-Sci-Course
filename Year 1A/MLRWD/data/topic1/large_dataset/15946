I was first introduced to the story of John Harrison via Dava Sobel's dynamo paperback 'Longitude' which I thoroughly enjoyed. Next to fall into my possession was Sobel's 'The Illustrated Longitude' which was just superb and added so much to the story with all the amazing images. Subsequently when I came across the DVD 'Longitude' a few years back I quickly grabbed it.

This film is wonderful and a delightful complement to Sobel's books. Michael Gambon and Jeremy Irons shine in their respective roles of John Harrison and Rupert Gould. The movie quickly draws you in and you soon find yourself sharing Harrison's challenge in his quest to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea, and feeling his frustration in the claiming of his prize with the big-headed politicking from the Board of Longitude consistently throwing new obstacles in his path.

The story of Gould is interwoven with that of Harrison throughout the film and it works exceedingly well. Jeremy Irons excels in his portrayal of Gould and you share the man's passion for the timepieces as he discovers them in 1920 to gently take them under his wing and painstakingly restore them to their former glory, breathing life back into their little mechanical hearts. If it hadn't been for Gould then these ticking treasures could very well still be stashed away collecting dust and rust, or worse still they could have been destroyed during the war. For the producers to include Gould's story in the movie was a masterstroke.

The supporting cast is excellent as is the detail to historical accuracy and setting. The film has a nice blend of intrigue, science, heartache, triumph, humour, passion and politics. Compelling, informative and entertaining, this is film is a winner and a definite keeper. The acting by all involved is stellar.

A marvellous film that will be enjoyed by all the family. Chances are you won't look at clocks the same way ever again.
