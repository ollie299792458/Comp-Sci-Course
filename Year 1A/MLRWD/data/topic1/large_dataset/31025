THe plot of this movie is a little shaky, not much higher than a B-grade horror film, and the characters are slightly glossed over, still, this storpy about an FBI agent and a psychologist probing the mind of a serial killer to find the location of his soon to be dead last victim is told with an immaculate sense of imagery.  Tarsem creates equally beautiful and haunting images that on could imagine being taken directly from the head of a serial killer. The DVD presentation is nothing less than what one would expect from the New Line Platinum series.  The video and audio are crisp and clean, and the extras are mostly interesting.  Tarsem is not an interesting man to listen to, but he does share some insights into his creative choices for different scenes.  I just wish he had more to say than "I always thought this would look cool."  The deleted scenes, available with or without commentary, are mostly just extended takes of things seen in the movie, and are probably interesting only once or twice.  Still, if this type of psychological thriller is your cup of tea, then the complete package of this DVD should certainly sway you into buying it, however people with lukewarm feelings toward the movie won't be charmed by these few extras.
