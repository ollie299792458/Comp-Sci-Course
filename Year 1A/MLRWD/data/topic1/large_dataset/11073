I am a huge fan of the original, and I'm not a fan of remakes in general.  With that said, I'm not about to insult anybody by trying to put the original and this 2003 remake in the same category.  I do think, however, that this movie is pretty good.  What makes it work is that the two movies are very different.  There are similarities to be sure, but you don't feel like you're watching a blow-by-blow replay of the 1973 classic.  I saw the remake in a theater and expected to spend two hours laughing at a lame attempt to capture the classic's low-key horror.  Instead, I found myself wrapped up in the new story because it strayed enough from the original to catch and, more importantly, keep my attention.  There are a lot of extras on these two discs, including an interesting plot device that never made its way into the movie.  Also, the commentary reveals some interesting facts.  Overall, I think anyone who likes scary movies will like this movie.  I definitely think people who haven't seen the original will enjoy it because they have no reference to compare it to.  However, do yourself a favor and see the original too; you won't be disappointed.
