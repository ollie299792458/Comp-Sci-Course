This is the sequel of Urban Legend, a film that I truly believe is one of the modern day horror classics of this era.  In my honest opinion, it'a almost as good as its predecessor.
This film has so many different bright spots.  the first of which is the cast.  This movie is proof positive that you can make an enjoyable horror film with a young cast WITHOUT featuring eye candy like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar.  The whole cast was great.  Heck, even Joey Lawrence (who I detested on BLOSSOM) was enjoyable in this film.
Speaking of the cast, Loretta Devine is the only cast member from the original film who is in this film... and man alive, is she a hoot!  She provides the film with a lot of great comical moments... all without taking away from the horror theme.
I recommend this film to those of you who liked the original... as well as lovers of the horror genre.  You won't be sorry.  Unlike recent horror sequels (like Screams 2 and 3), this sequel does not disappoint.
