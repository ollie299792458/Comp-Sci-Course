Without going into spoilers or repeating the last few other reviewers, what might remain to be said about "The Thin Blue Line" is that it certainly deserves a place in the death penalty debate. Anyone who has watched Morris' later documentary "Dr. Death" can guess his view of the death penalty, but this documentary is the more effective argument against it. Because of the convoluted regard for capital punishment cases, the guilt or innocence of Randall Adams is decided based on what punishment the state of Texas was pursuing at the time. One might naively think that the added stakes of a capital punishment would make Adams harder to convict, but the documentary shows that instead of a more intense scrutiny of the evidence, the police/DA get tunnel vision and the legal machine falls in lockstep. The detectives, judge and (most grotesquely) the forensic psychiatrist seem to expose themselves and their end of the government. I get the impression the Adams isn't telling the whole truth (or Morris isn't showing it), but the theme is laid out beautifully, building from beginning to end. Like "Fog of War," we may pop in the DVD thinking that we already know the story, but the film does not fail to surprise.
