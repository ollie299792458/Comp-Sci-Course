It is very difficult to put into words the emotions that one goes through in these type of situations.  I lost a very dear friend in March 2012 who at age 15 was able to get his parents signature to join in 1941.  At age 16 he was an instructor assigned to the jump school at Chilton Foliate under command of Captain Herbert Sobel.  He managed to get transferred to 1st Platoon, E Company, 506th PIR and made the jump in Normandy.  His name was Clarence (Clancy) Lyall.  He was one of a brave few who acheived 4 stars on his jump wings, made the jump on his 18th birthday at Operation Market Garden and 2 more in Korea.  He chose not to be recognized in the Ambrose book.  When I met him I was a struggling Vietnam veteran having NO direction and he managed over time to change that.  I became a confidant, "gofer" and just a friend, travelling around to reunions and anniversaries of the jump in France.  We watched this film together and I have my own copy to remind me of those times.

As a history teacher, this rates way up there.
