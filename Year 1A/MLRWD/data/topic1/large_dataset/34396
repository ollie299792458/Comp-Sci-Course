I found it very effective and enlightening to first view Al Pacino's "Looking For Richard" before diving into this wonderful
interpretation of Shakespeare.  The Pacino film does an admirable - and frequently hilarious - job of explicating the soap opera plot and in the doing immerses you in iambic pentameter enough that when you turn to McKellan's marvelous film you barely notice the characters are speaking in verse.  As for "Richard III" itself, well, what can be said?  If Sir Ian were ever to portray a character who did nothing but belch, fart and scream profanities, it would unquestionably be worth watching.  And yes, I am a huge fan of Lord Of The Rings but I'm thinking much more of his work in this film and certainly  "Gods And Monsters" (all you "Mummy" fans ought to check THAT one out!) and even the seriously underrated and over-
criticized "X Men" (yes, I AM looking forward to the sequel!)
As for the supporting cast (a.k.a. "any character not Richard"),
okay, maybe Annette Bening is in a bit over her head here, but the film is called "Richard III", ya know, not "Queen Elizabeth"...  hmmmmm,  Miranda Richardson comes to mind.  Nah,
wrong universe!  Look, it's Ian McKellan's show here - literally
!  How many living actors are there who would dare claim screen-
writing credits alongside Will S.?  Or dead ones, for that matter!  One last point:  if you're a Pink Floyd fan, even if not much for Shakespeare or drama or soap opera or war films, sit this one out - it'll be worth the ride.
