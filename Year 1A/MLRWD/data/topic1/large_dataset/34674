This movie is NOT a film version of The Trojan War as depicted in Homer's 'Iliad', not even as depicted in the history books. It is a movie quite loosely based on those stories. Nonetheless, it is a great one. It contains some of the best battle scene direction I have ever seen, in my opinion better than that of 'Return of the King'. The acting is all very well done, especially non-verbally. Eric Bana shines, and Brad Pitt doesn't try to be more than he is, but is still strong enough of a character to be equal with Bana's Hector. The deeper parts of their characters, while not necessarily historically accurate, are actually very well played out, and the film achieves a rare balance of audience sympathy for the warriors on both sides. There is something to be said about the way the film does not really choose sides at all (it is narrarated at the beginning and end by Odysseus, the most neutral character). What you will find here are amazing characters, all rather well developed, amazing action, filming, and atmosphere. At the very least, worth seeing once.
