The Prowler is classic to horror fans and when it came out in early 1981 we witnessed more of Tom Savani's great effects. First off The Prowler is about a World War vet that is over seas and gets a Dear John letter,his girlfriend Rosemary says she can no longer bare the pain of having to wait for him,so she told him she found someone else and moved on with her life. In 1945 a graduation dance is held and a couple is brutally murdered with a pitchfork. Years later the town has the graduation dance again but a prowler is on the loose. Could it be the jealous girl,the angry boyfriend,the shrieff,the man that lost his daughter in 1945 at the dance? Its a great coverup of the identity until the end. Lastly the death scenes are brutal unlike Paramounts April Fools,My Bloody Valentine,or Friday The 13th these death scenes are credited with Tom Savani's (1977/DAWN OF THE DEAD,1981/THE BURNING)effects and are all uncut/unedited. There is even a special effects making extra,and trailer,tv spots,picture galleries and great creepy score DON'T MISS THIS CLASSIS OR WILL BE MISSING ONE OF THE BEST HORROR/SLASHERS OF THE EARLY 80'S!
