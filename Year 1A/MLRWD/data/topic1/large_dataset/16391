This would be a good movie if only it had a decent plot. The acting is there, the special effects are top-notch for the time, the spy-eye camera sequence is Bond worthy, but the basic story at the heart of the action is severely flawed on different levels.  For beginners, there is no science in this science/fiction flick.  Picture, if you can, a world in which manned flights to Mars are a part of history, but also in which no one has bothered to notice the planet opposing Earth in the same orbit.  This is sooo wrong.  Alright, fans of the worlds of Gerry Anderson, like me, are used to such physical impossibilities and scientific lapses.  However, even if you accept the conventions of this "world", you are still left with a hugely annoying plot complication - - while the astronauts are in a pre-programmed state of suspended animation during most of their "journey", in the course of post-landing interrogation, one of them is accused of having turned the ship around mid-mission.  What!!??  I watch this and feel sorry for Roy Thinnes, who did a good job with material not worthy of his talent.  The ending is also a disappointing bust.  Still, for die-hard fans of Gerry Anderson's creations I do recommend this film.  It is eye-pleasing, stupid fun punctuated with some decent performances from several familiar faces, including Lynn Lorring, Ed Bishop, and George Sewell.  Shame MST3K never got hold of this.
