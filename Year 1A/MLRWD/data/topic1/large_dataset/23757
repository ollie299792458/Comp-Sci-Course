I saw this film ten times in the theatre when it was released in 1990. The entire look of the film just blew me away. And 90% of the characters looked exactly like their comic strip counterparts. Beaty did an amazing job on this film. It's one of my all time favorites.

However, I was really disappointed in this DVD. No trailers, TV spots, no making of documentary, nothing but the film. Now, the Disney channel did air a making of special in 1990 and it could have been inclued on this DVD. I have it on tape, not to mention several trailers and TV shops for the film and KD Lang and Take Sixes 'Ridin' The Rails' music video. I also know of a couple of deleted scenes that showed up in the trailers. All of this stuff Touchtone has in their vaults and should have been included on the DVD. Shame on them.

As for the film itself, well because I love the movie so much I had to pick it up even if it is a bare bones release. The sound and picture are great and it was nice to see it again in widescreen. I would recomend that you rent it if you have to see it. If you have to buy it, wait for a special edition or Director's Cut to come out.
