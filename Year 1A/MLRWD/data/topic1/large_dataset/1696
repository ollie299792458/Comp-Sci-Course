I agree with virtually everything Aion had to say in his excellent and thorough review. I picked up Witchblade nearly a year ago and forgot to watch it. I just watched the entire series over the last two weeks and I was very pleasantly surprised. The cover is a little misleading - this isn't a violent "pervy" series at all and apart from the large bosomed main character, there is virtually no sexual content in this series at all. We are presented with a story of a woman, doomed by fate, and her utter dedication to her daughter.
The story is a little predictable in places, but this isn't so important because the characters are very well fleshed out, engaging and likeable. Witchblade achieved, at least for me, the one thing all successful movies and TV shows aim to do or should aim to do, namely present us with characters we can identify with and care about. I found parts of Witchblade very moving indeed and, of course, there were light hearted fun moments, too. The episode at the beach did have a touch of fan service about it, but it gave the viewers a breather from the darker and more tragic undercurrents of the story.

The English dub is excellent and the English cast was excellent and the translations were fair and idiomatic. The Japanese cast was excellent, of course, too. Please watch the interviews with the Japanese cast! I found this one of the most entertaining aspects of this DVD. It was nice to see Nana Mizuki interviewed - I've long admired her singing and I have some of her albums - she was so alive and animated in the interview - she was adorable. I liked the funny and, indeed, cheeky questions the (Japanese) cast asked each other! I got the impression that the group of people who voiced the characters had an enormous amount of fun together.
Maybe watch the cast interviews before looking at the entire series? It won't spoil the show for you.

I'll watch Witchblade again some time. I enjoyed it, it was a nice journey.
