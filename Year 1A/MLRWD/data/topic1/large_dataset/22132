To be honest, I really thought this film was going to be better than the original, considering the remake's budget and cast. If you've ever seen the original, then you'd know what I'm talking about. Don't get me wrong, though. The original Wizard had a very low budget and it shows, but it had something this movie doesn't but should have: creepiness!

After I saw the original version, I thought to myself, "Did some high school kids puts this mess together?" However, days after the first viewing, my mind began to filter out the trash and left me with elements of horror which made me wonder if the movie was the work of a genius or a rank amateur who was just experimenting. I still can't say for sure, but I will say it left me with a chill.

Unfortunately, this modern remake did not. I was not scared in the slightest and Glover did not persuade, in my opinion. It was nice seeing Combs and Dourif together in the same movie and I thought that was a nice touch.

The only good thing about this movie was the interesting angle they used to explain Montag's magic. A decent plot with a flat script but there's no saving this one.

All in all, I do appreciate the effort that went into this film; I may come off harsh at times, but I do appreciate those directors who bring horror fans new material that they can view, thus keeping the genre alive.
