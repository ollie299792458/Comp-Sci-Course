I'm one of those people that usually thinks the Disney direct-to-video sequels are usually best left to rot.  (Bambi II? what the heck?)  But I'm also one of those people who think that the Emperor's New Groove is one of the most underrated movies that Disney ever made.  So I couldn't help but give Kronk's New Groove a try.  The final verdict?  Well, while most of the jokes are indeed recycled from the first film and the three stories in one movie plot feels a little forced, it's still quite good.  I'll take a good recycled joke over a brand-new dud any day.  The performances from the returning voice cast are all top notch (thank god we don't have to put up with any pale imitations this time).  The "be true to your groove" message is heartfelt and true to the story.  And any Disney movie that has the chutzpah to incorporate an old Earth, Wind & Fire song is just fine by me.  True, it's not as good as the first movie, but all in all, it's a darned fine flick.  (And Tracy Ullman lends a nice Katherine Hepburn-y touch as Ms. Birdwell also.)
