With the self-sacrifice of Ripley in Alien 3, the Alien series could have just ended right there with two classic films and a good but troubled third installment. But what do you know? It seems that 200 years after the events of the previous film, they managed to make a clone of Ripley from blood samples that were taken before she died. But why bother with the cloning process when there is barely anything worthwhile in this film?

First off, did I already mention that Ripley is not in this film? Yes, Sigourney Weaver is part of the cast, but now her character has alien DNA that gives her certain traits shared by the aliens that her previous incarnation has been fighting off. Then we have a crew of scientists and other ship members that are poorly developed, most notably being the miscast Winona Ryder. Even the all bald males on the prison planet in Alien 3 had more depth to their characters! These are nothing more than your typical cardboard cutouts given their stereotypical role.

The script is rather cliche and tired if anything. Joss Whedon takes the screenwriting responsibilities rather than director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is well known for screenwriting the rest of his works. We could tell what was going to happen from a mile away, further eliminating any aspect of suspense. It comes to the point that we don't care that the characters are getting killed. It just comes to show that paper thin personalities blend well with predictable deaths.

While the film isn't terrible, it just comes off as a pointless live-action cartoon that has "Alien" slapped on it. Only recommended for die-hard fans, otherwise, you're not missing out.
