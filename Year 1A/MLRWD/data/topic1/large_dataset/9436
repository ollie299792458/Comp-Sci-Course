Some other "Trilogies" suffered from a severe degradation of quality with every new installment after having produced a hit with the first movie. Fortunately is the "Jason Bourne Trilogy" not part of this group, because the creators were able to create three movies that were each by themselves great movies in their own rights and also made sense when looked at as a whole. This movie is the third and last part (I hope) and the conclusion of the story does make perfectly sense and does not feel like an afterthought by the writers.

As in the first two parts, "The Bourne Identity" and "The Bourne Supremacy", does the anti-hero Jason Bourne play the cat and mouse game with his former employee, which brings him to different places throughout the world. The movie is action packed, but not over-the-top action like in the "Terminator" trilogy.

It's an action movie and not a philosophical piece of intellectual depth, no, it is plain and simple good entertainment. Nothing more and certainly nothing less either.
