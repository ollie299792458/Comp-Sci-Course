This movie, while not very faithful to the source material, is nevertheless an exceptional fun adventure. Both Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella are perfectly cast in the roles of He-Man and Skeletor. Lundgren is physically the best choice for He-Man. However, it would have been more fun if the director had stuck with the original idea of Prince Adam becoming He-Man. Frank Langella delivers without a doubt, the most impressive performance in the film. It is he who really carries the movie. Langella dominates each scene with his powerfully evil portrayal. Every line he utters and every scene he's in are not only memorable, but chilling as well. If this had been a more prestige film, he could've won an Oscar.

  As for the story, Eternia has fallen under the iron fist of Skeletor and his minions. Using a teleportation device called the Cosmic Key, Skeletor has gained control over Castle Greyskull. He-Man and his companions must rally together and defeat their enemies before all is lost.

  Certainly the film's biggest flaw is bringing earth into the story. The idea is interesting, but just doesn't work in terms of believablilty or practicality and ruins any chances of the film getting off the ground. One only wishes we could see more of Eternia.

  Overall, this is simply a fun-filled fantasy. Don't expect this to be a masterpiece, and just sit back and enjoy it.
