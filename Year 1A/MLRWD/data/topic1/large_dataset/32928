Three little girls were snatched from their mothers' arms. Spirited 1,500 miles away and denied their very identity. The girls were forced to adapt to a strange new world. They will attempt the impossible and will endure a daring escape. A run from the authorities. An epic journey across an unforgiving landscape that will test their very will to survive. Their only resources are determination, ingenuity and each other. Their one hope, find the rabbit-proof fence that might just guide them home. It is a true story which makes it that much more touching. The actions in this movie remind me alot like those actions of those practicing Indigenous religions. Indigenous religions can be described as consisting of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of an organized religion. All of the hardship the girls had to go through reminded me alot of how it is practicing under a religion that is not free like it is in America. You have to go by certain rules and certain obsticles just to get to where you want to be. It was very touching to see the similarity. Another example that comes to mind that closely relates to Rabbit-Proof Fence is those who practice a Primal Religion. The two most popular terms in the present context are 'primal' and 'traditional,' They are embedded on their beliefs and they are not going to let anything stop them from what they believe in. Which reminds me of the three girls. They firmly believed in getting back to where they belonged and no matter what was going to try and stop them, they had their eyes on the prize. It is amazing to see the connection between this movie and the Indigenous Religion. Overall it was a really great movie. There was a great storyline and it was very touching, I was able to watch it with my little sister. I would recommend it.
