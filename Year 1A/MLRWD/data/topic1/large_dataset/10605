Like Water For Chocolate is an amazing film that I very, VERY highly recommend.  I've always loved foreign films and this one is by far the best.  For those who prefer hearing it in english, this dvd offers the english language track, which helps you enjoy the film even more.

Basically, this is the story of Tita, the youngest girl of 3, who is bound by tradition to never marry so that she can care for her heartless mother until she dies.  Tita falls in love with Pedro, who then requests her hand in marriage.  But because of the tradition, the mother decides Pedro can not have Tita as his wife, and promptly offers her eldest daughter!  That is terrible enough, but then when Pedro accepts the offer, it is even more troubling.  His idea is to marry the sister so that he may be close to Tita (a difficult task considering the mother watches them like a hawk).

Over the period of many years, Tita uses her cooking to express herself and her love for and with Pedro and it affects her family in many interesting ways that make this an excellent film.  It is not for children, so please do not share it with those under age 12.
