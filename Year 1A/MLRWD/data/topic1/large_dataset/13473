Edward Burtynsky is a photographer out of Toronto that I first discovered three years ago. His subjects are the places where industry has most altered the land. He began with the trailings from mines. His tendency (for better or worse) is to embellish the beauty of these sites. The places that he's documented have grown to include the cross-cutting of the earth for train tracks, ship-wrecking of old oil tankers in India and now the amazing mass-production of commodities and the accompanying changes that embody China.
Although I have always admired Burtynsky's work, his reluctance to take a forward stance on his subjects, and his decision to rely upon expensive, clean, gallery prints of these embellished locations seems to me a mixed blessing. He seeks out and hence brings awareness of the sites, but then so refuses to give any hint at judgement- some could think it is fine just to sit back and buy the book. I find myself frustrated.
This film however, made by Jennifer Baichwal, encompasses all of the amazing strengths of Burtynsky's work, and then goes one fine step further. By simply interviewing the people who live in and around these landscapes, by documenting their work and their lives, the tenor is no longer neutral and clean. One cannot help but form their own opinion when faced with women heating up our discarded mother-boards outside of their homes, or seeing children (who most probably have never been in a car) standing barefoot in the oil that was stuck to the bottom of an outdated oil-tanker, scooping it up with a 5-gallon bucket. The director does not narrate, like the sometimes painful Michael Moore or even Al Gore- instead she quietly, beautifully shows us and lets us see, lets us understand. In the best sense, this film is educational.
(Ironically enough) I would like to buy this movie for everyone I know. It has changed the way I shop, the way I live. It has raised my consciousness and my understanding of the world. Try it, it is good.
