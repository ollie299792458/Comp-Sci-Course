as one of bill's despised 'advertising and marketing' folk, i've written professionally my entire adult career, yet finding the words to describe bill hick's genius feels like coming down from the mountain and trying to describe the radiant face of god.

the first night i saw Revelations on cable, i felt like i'd suddenly been told i had a long lost brother. the emotion of seeing someone not just saying things i'd personally felt and believed for years, but hammering them home so viciously to penetrate the thick skulls of the common public herd was rapturous. i laughed, i cried, my heart broke. and when it was over, i turned to the other people in the room and said "boy, he won't live long - what's he thinking, telling the truth in public like that?" little did i know he was already dead.

to compare bill hicks to others in the stand up comedy world is futile - and an insult to what he did. bill was not a common clown. he was a spiritual emissary from god, sent to wake us from our somnambulistic social lethargy. and given a little more time,

perhaps he'd have disconnected enough pods from the matrix to set off a chain reaction and awaken the planet.

or at least gotten some of us seats on the UFOs...

if you don't get what made bill hicks the standard to which all others should aspire, you're probably one of the poor saps who most NEEDS to grok bill's message. squeegee your third eye and try it again.
