...and by 'Absence Of Awesome', I mean quite the opposite. This movie IS awesome! Paul Newman ignites the screen with kerosene soaked he-man sexiness. Those blue eyes may seem cold, but they burn through you like a small child using a magnified glass to burn a small ant on the pavement at recess! Sally Field is as radiant as a Jamaican sunrise as she splashes her acting abilities throughout the movie like a farmer sowing seed in his freshly plowed field! The plot is as complex as Einstien's theory of relativity, and with the same effect: once completed, both the movie and the theory of relativity result in an atomic expolsion that can bend time and space. There isn't actually an explosion at the end of the movie, per se, but perhaps in the director's cut he'll put one in. I can't sing my praises ENOUGH for this movie, but if I DID, it would be a chorus line of dancing girls kickin' out a medley of showtunes with ME as the lead, wearing a sequined blue suit and a curly moustache singing my own falsetto version of 'Workin' In a Coalmine' (The Devo Version).
