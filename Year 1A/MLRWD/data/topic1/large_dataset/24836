Wow!  This is one of the most polarized set of reviews I've ever seen.  Basically each review goes from 5 stars to 1 star and back.  However, in my opinion most people who reviewed this movie poorly probably shouldn't see this type of movie anyway.

I thought this movie was genius in many ways and truly horrifying. It stuck with me for weeks like "Exorcist" or "The Ring".  Also, I thought this movie was quite original in it's own right. Yes, it did derive certain elements from some other classic sci-fis, but what movies don't nowadays.  "Event" still holds it's own with an intriguing plot, truly horrifying scenes, great cinematography and exceptional sound.  Speaking of sound, this movie may have the best sound effects ever. Just watch this movie on a good home theatre system and turn it up!!!

I'd have to say the one down side was how the movie progressed to a little campy horror near the end, but overall I found the ending satisfying.  No one ever seems to like movie endings no matter how good the movie - this one was more than acceptable.

This movie is not for everyone.  It is extremely disturbing with some very morbid and twisted themes.  There is one scene halfway through involving the original crew of the ship which will truly disturb anyone especially if you watch in slo-mo like I did.  And to think that scenes were cut to achieve an R rating. Therefore, if you are looking for a recommendation here I'd say definitely see this if you are a fan of sci-fi and disturbing/gory horror.  In truth, this is really very much a horror movie.
