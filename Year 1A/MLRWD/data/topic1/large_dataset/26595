Finaly this movie came to the Netherlans. I have waited a longtime. I have read, watched the trailer and I haven't been dissapointed not at all. I don't think you can categorize this as an chick-movie. This is an movie for male, female, young or old. I think you can categorize this in the "Amelie" rate.

I like Keri Russell and this was really a good decision to choose her as the main caracter. I already liked her in the series Felicity. This movie is really an Film Festival movie. It's a pitty it didn't came to the International Film Festival in Rotterdam. It would have been solled out I can tell you that.
The caracter Keri plays wants you to save her from her terrible husband even hit or slap him for her. You want her to be with the doctor and make give her a happy life.

Best two scenes for me is the smile she has the next day and the scene where she cries and wants to be saved by doctor Pomatter. I also liked the soundtrack and hope it will come out soon. Good music with good scenes.

Adrienne made and delivered a beautifull movie so that we can be reminded of her creations.
