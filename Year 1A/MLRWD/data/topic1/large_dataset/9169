I bought this after seeing it on cable and being reminded of what a good film it was.

On the off chance you are looking at this review and haven't seen it, William Hurt is a small town lawyer seduced by a local femme fatale, Kathleen Turner, and he gets in over his head in doing her bidding. His best friend, a assistant district attorney, played by Ted Danson, is in the unenviable position of having to investigate his friend. The drama and plot twists unwind from there...

I have now watched it several times, and I actually think it gets better each time you watch it, because you start noticing small details about the scenes and plot that you might have originally missed...this film has aged beautifully. Amazing ambience and Hurt,Turner, Mickey Rourke (back when he was cool), Danson, and the other supporting actors are great.

I bought this exact DVD off Amazon, so I can speak about the extras. This specific DVD includes some scenes that were cut--including one scene involving a first murder attempt on Richard Crenna that failed. The other extras included some interviews in Europe that took place in 1981 with Turner and Hurt. The next set of extras is discussions with the actors today about the making of the film--interesting to see how they have aged.  Lawrence Kasdan, the director, is also interviewed. There's a LOT of interesting information about how it was filmed (it was cold, not hot when they shot the movie!), some artistic choices that were made, etc. I actually thought, for once, that the extras were valuable, because I had never seen film noir, and the extras really emphasize the point that Kasdan was going for a sexy recreation of old film noir like the Asphalt Jungle. Never seen those, but if they are as good as Body Heat, I will go rent...
