We bought this series at a Cracker Barrel store after we enjoyed a few episodes on TV Land. It's a great series for a boy to watch in particular, because of the pratfalls and physical humor. And, of course, power tools!

The family setting is a bonus. I'd forgotten how nice it is to watch the goings-on of a family that is loving and close-knit, not shrill and crude, as TV families are these days.

Some of the references between Tim and Jill are of the adult variety, but it's not a bad thing to have the opportunity to explain the meanings of double entendres within the context of a loving marriage. We feel the same way about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003643BTY">Mythbusters</a> -- their experiments with alcohol and dangerous activities like driving drunk or driving while distracted give us the opportunity to discuss risky behaviors in a memorable way.

We've seen some shows from later years and haven't liked them as much as the earlier shows. Through the years, the focus seemed to have turned inward onto family issues and relationships. Those episodes don't interest our son as much as these earlier episodes that focus on the Tool Time antics and its slapstick humor.
