"On the evening of April 10th, 1996, 400 lucky people witnessed the public emergence of Alice In Chains at the MTV Unplugged stage in New York" - unfortunately I wasn't one of them because I was born in neither the right time or place! GRRR it really sucks growing up in the music scene that's around to day.  Anyway, on to the review, this performance has to be the most breathtaking performance I have ever seen for the following reasons:

The songs performed were some of Alice In Chains greatest songs, other than 1 mistake in the opening minute of "sludge factory" the songs were performed floorlessly, Layne Staley's deteriorating health (which although very tragic) made the atmosphere so much more emotional, it lasts for an hour which is a perfect amount of time for a live performance (for me at any rate as some long concerts can bore me after a while) and finally because this was completely about music and no diversions unlike some concerts where there are a bunch of lighting effects, stage props, stunts and acts (which are good at times, don't get me wrong about that), but with this performance it was just 5 guys (including Scotty Olsen the back up guitarist) walking up on to a candle lit stage in their jeans and t shirts in front of a fairly small audience and giving it their all.

My personal highlights from Alice In Chains unplugged include: "Nutshell" - an absolutely spectacular concert opener and possibly my all time favourite song period), "Brother", "Sludge Factory" (in particular when Layne removes his shades to reveal his heroin abused eyes which compliments the feel of the song so well), "Angry Chair" - Layne's chance to show his guitar playing ability on a song he wrote all himself and "Would" which they did well to perform unplugged as before watching it I wasn't too sure how they would pull it off.

If you like Alice In Chains and haven't seen this, for god sake buy it now and you really will be amazed.
