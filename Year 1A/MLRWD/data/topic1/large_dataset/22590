I just heard about the upcoming February 7, 2012 Kino release of the 1937 A STAR IS BORN. My wife and I have always loved this version (Of course, the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason is also excellent!).

I'm giving this upcoming release 5 Stars, sight unseen, based on the assumption that it will be even better looking than the earlier 2001 release, which was made from the same, original 35mm nitrate print authorized by the Estate Of David O' Selznick, as this one is an HD transfer! We're not talking about ragged Public Domain Transfers here, folks!

As for the film itself, I think one thing that gets overlooked these days is the solid casting, and I'm not just talking about the two main leads, Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, as great as they are. Some of the biggest supporting players fro the thirties are in this film. I found Andy Devine and Edgar Kennedy to be quite good in their supporting roles. With the then celebrated actress May Robson (Best known for 1933's LADY FOR A DAY), and of course, Adolph Menjou, you simply can't go wrong!
