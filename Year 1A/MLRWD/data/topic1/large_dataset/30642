This somber yet deeply unsettling film managed to give me the willies even in the less-than-ideal Horrorhound Weekend convention setting.

Not soon after a pregnant woman (Katie Parker) declares her missing husband (Morgan Peter Brown) legally dead, she begins to having terrifying visions that hint that maybe she spoke too quickly. Writer/director Flanagan pulls off an incredible feat with this film. He manages to reinvent the ghost story,  then takes it to an unexpected, even creepier place.

Don't be fooled by the show-burn pacing, because the almost-suffocating tension had me squirming in my seat, forgetting to breathe.

It's been almost a year since I've seen ABSENTIA.  What haunts me most is not the disturbing visuals or even the deeply unsettling story line.  It's the mood.  When I simply think about the title, I hear in my head its stark, two-note funeral organ score, and my chest wells up with emotions not usually incurred by watching a horror movie: grief, loss and perhaps the most terrifying of all...the dread of inevitability.

Toss in a pitch perfect cast, including a heart-wrenching cameo from the always delicious Doug Jones, and BOOM!  You've got my favorite horror movie of 2011.
