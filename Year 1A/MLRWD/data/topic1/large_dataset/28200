I'm new to the Millennium trilogy, both the books and Swedish film adaptations. So many people raved about the first book, in particular, that I was very much looking forward to watching the video.

As the header to this review says I believe those expectations let me down.

But let's look at the positives. Rooney Mara is outstanding in her role as Lisbeth. Daniel Craig once again shows that he is far more than just James Bond and does a good job. The cinematography was excellent. It was great seeing the move set in Sweden and it was very well shot.

The beginning titles are superb but also reveal the strong evil undercurrent that pervades the movie. And it's that evil that I struggled with the most. The rape scenes are terrible and I wasn't at all prepared for those. It took me back to days of watching horror movies hiding behind the couch.

The first third of the movie is quite slow and doesn't really get moving nor all that interesting until the two main characters get working together. At that point it moves along at good pace. It's a dialogue-rich movie that requires attention to track the investigation for a serial killer.

It's not something I'd watch again and I'm not sure I will watch the second instalment except that I'm curious to know how it joins up with the first as there appeared to be closure at the end.
