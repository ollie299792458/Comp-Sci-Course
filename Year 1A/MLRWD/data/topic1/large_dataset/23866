I am not sure where the last reviewer got his/her copy from. And I'd not trust a copy bought outside UK or the US, lots of pirated copies are  specially in Asia. Comparing Charlotte Church to Sarah is no justice  either. I had both CD's of the artists. CC has way to go before she can  match Sarah, and the CD of CC was poorly recorded, you did not get full  energy from her songs, it could have been better. I've seen SB up close on  the front row in DC. What drove me to see her was the PBS pledge drive when  Sarah's "First of May" froze me to the spot. This angel could  sing to break your heart, and I have never seen/heard anyone with such  broad range of voice and sang like an angel. I'm still waiting for my DVD,  but I have seen it already on the PBS. Can't wait to see and hear more of  my angel Sarah Brightman.
I remembered she got a standing ovation after  Puccini's "Nessun Dorma", you just want to rush to the stage and  gave her a kiss. That was just one of many standing ovations.
