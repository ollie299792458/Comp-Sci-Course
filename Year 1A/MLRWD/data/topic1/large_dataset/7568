Tony Randall carries the movie of course. This is a vehicle for him to display many sides of his talent: with seven different characters to go about that is quite a load to carry plus some linguistic fluency in various accent. The ingenious direction of George Pal is also to be lauded. The scene where the termegan wife was looking at the newspaper and didn't know who Medusa was and the henpeck husbank tried to explain to her and suddenly he looked at his wife's face with a head full of hair curler which resembled, you guess whom, and the expressions on his face and his wife's; if you happen to have a mouthful of popcorn while watching this, I bet you any amount of money, the corn would explode. It's just about one of the funniest scenes ever.  This is a wonderful film full of fun and many wise sayings.  You won't be disappointed I assure you, whether you like fables or fairy tales or not, satisfaction quarantied.

As if 7 faces is not enough for him, Randall, at the circus finale he plays himself in the audience shaking his head in disapproval of Dr. Lao's busybody maneuver.
