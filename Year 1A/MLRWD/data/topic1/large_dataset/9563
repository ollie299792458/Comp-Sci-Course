The State Within is a roller coaster ride of a conspiracy thriller. Set in the present, it uses drama to inform and entertain us. The cast is outstanding, led by the much under rated British Actor, Jason Isaacs. This 6 part series starts out with a bang (bomb blows up a british airliner over washington dc), and then immerses us in the political world of the british ambassador, politicians, foreign policy between countries, and private companies as investors in our future. I found this absorbing and interesting, and could not wait to see each episode. The script treats the audience as if we are intelligent, concerned public. Not only entertaining, this series will make you think about the daily news that you read and watch on tv. How much of the truth do we actually have reported to us? How truthful are our politicians, locally and nationally? Absorbing and gripping, I highly recommend this thriller to anyone who has wondered about our future as a country, and a planet. Terrorism is as much a concern today as is global warming and international policies.
