This is the ultimate film noir, not only in visual style, with shadows, venetian blinds and ceiling fans, but in a tour de force of evil and shady characters. And there's even more: this one adds southern voodoo with Faustian pact to the recipe, so the film is beyond hommage and beyond noir; it's actually DARK, not just film noir on the trail of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep or the previous effort in that genre, Body Heat, only this one does not bother to offer the usual femme fatale as in the mentioned examples.
It's odd how De Niro's Louis Ciphre, despite the long nails, looks a lot more composed and elegant than Mickey Rourke's Harry Angel, a detective who keeps detecting his own past and who looks increasingly dirty, sweaty, undone and badly dressed as the movie progresses, so that by the end, he looks almost like a homeless man, perhaps so as to enhance the down on his luck feel of his character. His performance is superb, even better than De Niro's and the celebrated egg eating scene.
The copy in blu-ray is also beautiful and impeccable, probably even better than the one I originally saw in cinemas back in 1987, when it was released, doing Michael Seresin's photography justice.
A masterpiece of a man's journey through and to hell, with freshly new, evil characters and not just the obvious femme fatales and greedy low lifes that parade on endless examples of the genre.
