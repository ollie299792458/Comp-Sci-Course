....than you are purchasing any of the so-called teen "comedies" of today.
  This movie is simply wonderful:  hilarious, poignant, sardonic, and romantic, it features what defined 80s adolescent flicks -- John Cusack.  Who could play the everyman better than he?  Who was more skilled at identifying with a teenage audience than Mr. Cusack?  As a 17-year-old, I can say that the film has not lost any of its charm:  this is a cult flick at my school, and it still resonates.
  If you're a girl, you want to be with Lane Meyer (Cusack's character).  If you're a guy, you simply want to BE him.  'Nuff said.
  The film relies not on gross-out humour (thank God), but on subtle touches of wit, elements of fantasy (Lane's crawling meal), and absolutely hilarious comic vignettes ("How To Pick Up Trashy Women")
  In short:  it's worth buying, and has not dated in the least.  Much like Say Anything..., it was another critical triumph for Cusack, but a bomb at the box office.  Why are such good films appreciated AFTER they've played out in theaters!!?  There's no justice...
