I ordered this DVD after reading James Monti's "The King's Good Servant but God's First" (an excellent biography of Thomas More) and becoming an utter fan of the scholar and saint (I've even got a framed copy of Holbein's famous portrait of More).  Not knowing what to expect, I was floored, and still am, by the genius of this film (which very closely follows Robert Bolt's outstanding play, "A Man for All Seasons" -- also available on Amazon).

I've seen the DVD over 200 times and can probably follow it word for word.

Other than Paul Scoffield's absolutely BRILLIANT performance, the other performance which shines through is that of a young, handsome John Hurt playing Richard Rich.  [You might recognize Hurt as the magical wands-shopkeeper in the Harry Potter film series.]

Some of the greatest lines/scenes in this incredibly intelligent, clever film:

Richard Rich: "I'm not depressed.  I'm lamenting.  I've lost my innocence!" (nervously joking)
Cromwell: (snaps) "Some time ago. You only just noticed?"

As an another reviewer pointed out, More's greatest line in the film: "Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to lose his soul for the whole world... but for Wales??"

The movie is even better than the play itself, as the film refines certain elements (i.e., omits Chapuys's character, streamlines the relationship with Rich).  However, the film only made VERY minor changes to the play -- since the play is quite brilliant and in no need of change -- so fans of the play will be surprised and pleased at how little the lines were changed.

I can't recommend this movie enough.  Other than "The Passion of the Christ", it's my favorite film.
