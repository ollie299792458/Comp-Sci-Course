After watching (and loving!) Spirited Away a couple of weeks ago, I was looking forward to enjoying another animated masterpiece in The Triplets of Belleville.  Unfortunately, this film was not nearly as entertaining as Miyazaki's masterpiece.
The positives: The musical scenes were the best by far (unfortunately, there were only three of them).  Also, there were some incredible animation sequences (the ocean journey scene was particularly good).
The negatives: The story itself took quite awhile to develop, and even when it got going, it wasn't particularly engaging.  The two main characters (the grandmother and grandson) had very little personality, so it was difficult to "root" for them.  The social commentary was nothing new--yes, we know, America is a society centered around consumerism and self indulgence.  This film presents yet another caricature of the American "pigs."
Overall, this may be a renter, but for me it did not live up to its critical or popular acclaim.
