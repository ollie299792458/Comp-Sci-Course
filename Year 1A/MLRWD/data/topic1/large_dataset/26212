Roper: He was in it for the money.  Williams: He was in it because he had to be.  Lee: He was there to get them out... ALIVE.  This film is a RIOT!  I was expecting a cliched kung-fu action flick with some of the greatest martial arts moves ever put on film from the Master himself, Bruce Lee.  Well...  I got that, but I wasn't expecting some truly hysterical 70's blaxploitation comedy mixed together with the cliched James Bond plot.  Lee may steal the scenes with his truly uncanny physical moves, but it is Jim Kelly who burns up the film as Williams with his outrageous polyester funk and his super-fly fro!  It is a crying shame that Black Belt Jones is not on DVD...  yet.  It would be a fitting companion piece to this film.  I've not laughed this hard in a LONG time.  Ohhhh, my stomach feels bruised from laughing out of my chair!  To top it off, this DVD has 4 trailers.  Two of them have the most hysterical announcer commentaries I've ever heard.  They sure don't make movie trailers like this anymore (I wish they would)!  This DVD is a sure-buy for the vintage trailers alone.  Some truly classic one-liners too!  Williams: "Man... you come right out of a comic book!"  A great ensemble cast of characters.  John Saxon, Jim Kelly and Bruce "The Legend" Lee are Roper, Williams, and Lee!
