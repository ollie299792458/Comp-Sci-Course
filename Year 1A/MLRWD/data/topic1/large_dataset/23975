It's funny that people take action movies so seriously. Action movies are like popcorn movies and are made for just a fun movie experience. So from the beginning when you go to see an action/popcorn movie you shouldn't expect to see an in-depth storyline, 3-dimensional characters, or great acting (though this film does a bit better in that area than most). What you should expect to see is of course good action, good cinematography, cheesy one-liners, and good special fx - which this film has in spades.
So if you don't like action movies, then you won't like this one (I would've thought that was obvious, but some people have a rough time with it).
This is the most skillfully-made action movie in the past 10 years - or since Hard Boiled, though Desperado definitely gives it a run for its money - and Kill Bill has now topped MI2, but that's my opinion :P.
Good action movies are hard to come by and few people appreciate them, either because they insist that every film should be art (in its defined form) and/or that in order for a movie to be good it must succeed on every area (i.e. acting, cinematography, dialogue, etc.). I agree with these and truely enjoy well-thoughtout and artsy movies (Glengary Glenross, Taxi Driver, The Man Who Fell to Earth, Memento, Adaptation, too many to list). Every once and while though it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't have too many levels working at once. One that's focusing on just one thing and it does that one thing very well -MI2 is that kind of movie.
