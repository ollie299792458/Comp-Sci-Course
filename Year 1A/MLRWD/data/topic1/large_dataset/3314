Wild Things kicked some major behind. I would like to go into the plot but it is so convoluted that it would take all day and the some, okay? The plot twists are reminscient of something you would see in those old Hitchcock films but it isn't nearly as terrifying as a Hitchcock film. This film revolves around a guidance counselor portrayed by Matt Dillon, two girls who accuse him of rape, Neve Campbell from the Scream series and Denise Richards (who is downright entertainingly annoying), and the cop investigating, Kevin Bacon. Set in the swamps of South Florida, this film is a perfect case study of man's obssession with the dollar bill and sexual manipulation. Two scenes that sparked the disgust of moviegoers and critics alike are the love scenes involving the guidance counselor and the girls and their kissing session in the other's lavish swimming pool. Now, I'm no pervert but I do know a good throw in when I see it. The producers added these scenes to keep their audience's attention. The love scenes are not what made this film a good one. Added to the mix is the comic genius of Bill Murray as a scheming lawyer who is the comic relief and he does not disappoint, either. Also, another impressive plot twist is the ending which, unconsciously, sees the underdog triumph. While I won't give away plot details, I will say this: It is interesting to see that in a film like this that the character who is least likely to succeed is the one who actually makes it. I recommend it for fans of great film noir, not for fans who want to see it as a sleazy competitor for 1992's Basic Instinct.
