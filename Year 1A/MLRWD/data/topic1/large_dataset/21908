Naturally, anyone would feel guilty about hating this movie. And I didn't hate it until about 3/4 of the way through. A lot of it was cheesy, but I appreciate good cheese. The thing that got on my nerves was the underlying social commentary, which is, as I take it, some weird liberal agenda to show us that blacks and hispanics are going to rise up? Or it's about the poor? I don't think you average joe can figure out what the hell Romero was trying to say here. Either you say something boldy, or don't say it all. All the shots taking at Mexicans in this movie don't really apply to the overall theme, so one is left wondering why they are included. Anyway... without all the social stuff, I would have liked this movie. It's not the best zombie movie. At best, it's a low-grade sci-fi channel movie. If you think you can get past the misdirected politics of it, and some of the really horrible acting (However, the blonde-haired captain guy's acting was superb), maybe you'll like it. To the averge viewer, it comes across as a bunch of zombie movie people coming together for one last hurrah, bit it doesn't really make any noise for the rest of us.
