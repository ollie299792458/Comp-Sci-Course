What's it about?

Regan is a healthy and happy 12 year old girl who lives with her actress- mother, Chris MacNeil. All seems regular untill Regan abruptly becomes prone to unexpected fits and unusual behavior. Fed up with doctors, Chris confides in Father Karras; a priest with a crisis of faith. Convinced Regan is possessed but unfit for the job, Karras calls in experienced Exorcist Father Merrin. Together they join forces to free Regan from the virulent demon that possessed her.

Is it any good?

It's amazing how after nearly 40 years this movie can still make you feel like a hampster in a lion's cage. How Linda Blair never won the Oscar beats me, she manages to show innocence through constraint so well, while Ellen Burstyn's performance gives you that real feeling of isolation as a desperate mother unable to protect her child. An exceptional script from William Peter Blatty coupled with great direction and top performances ensure 'The Exorcist' will always stand the test of time.

Best bit?

It's always sure to turn HEADS!

The scream of the demon being exorcised was created by recording squealing pigs being driven into slaughter.
