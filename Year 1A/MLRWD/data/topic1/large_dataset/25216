I've ordered, but haven't watched this DVD yet.  I'm sure it will be great, any and all U2 is always great.  I'm very anxious to check out the enhanced DVD features too.
HOWEVER, I have to echo what some others have already said about the set list of this concert/DVD.  How can "One", "Pride", "Angel of Harlem", "Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and other great tunes not be included?  I've scanned the set lists of other U2 shows from their 1st, 2nd and 3rd legs of their world tour, and there are many better sets out there.
Also, I was at the NY &amp; NJ shows in October, and I noticed that there were NO songs from the POP album performed at all, and Achtung Baby got short shrift ("Until the End" and "One" doesn't do justice to U2's best album IMHO).  I wish U2 would recognize that some songs are better live than others and perform them more consistently.  Songs like: "Trying to Throw Your Arms", "The Fly", "Staring at the Sun", "Even Better than the real thing", "Running to Stand Still."  My 2-cents.
