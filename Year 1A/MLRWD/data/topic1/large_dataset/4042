Excellent film.  If you are smart and have a sense of humor and an eye/ear for spotting cultural references this movie will have you rolling around on the floor laughing and immediately replaying it as soon as the end credits roll.

The attention to detail makes Tarantino's clued-in references in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs look like the work of a noob.  For instance - how many people noticed that the videogame played in the limo towards the end of the film was an 80's game called Berzerk and why would they include this game in the film?  If you don't know the answer to this you might well be one of the critics who inexplicably reviewed this film so badly whilst obviously not coming close to understanding it.

The dialog is classic, the humor is faultless.  My favorite line is said by the main character to his girlfriend when he tells her "You've had a nice lie in?  Good.  Listen - I've been fatally poisoned and a psychopath is heading over to your apartment to torture and kill you.  I'll be over in a flash".

Even typing this review makes me want to go and play the film again.  Highly recommended.
