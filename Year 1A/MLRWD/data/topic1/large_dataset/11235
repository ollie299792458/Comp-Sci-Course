For those of you lacking HBO, you missed this gem the first time around. Don't let it happen again. With a screenplay by the author of the Pulitzer prize winning author, Richard Russo, each word and scene resonates with just as marvelous novel.

First, the cast is superb. Paul Newman, havinf starred in anearlier film based on a Russo novel, saw the emotional tale in the novel, approached HBO, and had himself cast as the mischevious Max, father of the protagonist, Max Brody. Max, played to further perfection by Ed Harris, lost his once-fat wife (Helen Hunt) to the spa owner windbag, played by a cast-against-type Dennis Farina. Jaonne Woodward is the antagonist/villian, in a story that plays out against the backdrop of a crumbling industrial city in Maine. A manipulative matriarch makes life miserable for many.

Russo wrote much of the book in a setting, a decaying town in New England, and he admittedly drew from the lives of his own teenage daughters to flesh out the role of Tick, Max's daughter. Here too, Tick and her youthful colleagues play their roles very well. They play out the drama created by the adults, witness a tragedy, and allow the adults to come to terms after one more death.

The DVD version closes perhaps to quickly, and the classroom tragedy late in the film is a bit melodramatic. But there is not a minute that rings false. Watching the DVD on a cross-country flight left me wanting more than three hours.

Read the book. Check this DVD out. Enjoy them both.
