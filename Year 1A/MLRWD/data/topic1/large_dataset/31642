I had to write a review for this movie when I saw some the crap that other people were writing.  First off if you refer to this movie in the number of acts, this movie isn't for you.  If you like Jonah Hill's movie then you'll love this one.  Yes, his movies are a little vulgar and raunchy, but it good fun and Jonah doesn't pretend to be anything he's not.  If you are not a fan of Jonah, this film still has a decent plot (much like Super Bad) and has a better message.

You watch 4 kids (Jonah included) deal with little problems that are made into big deals but none other than themselves.  As the characters grow and spend time with each other they learn from each other.  Enemies become friends and realize that there are much bigger problems out there and that they need to deal with their problems instead of ignoring them and making them worse. It's well written, with good direction and that is why I gave it 4 stars. It is a good comedy with a good story.

By the way, this is the unrated version, it's suppose to be vulgar and raunchy.
