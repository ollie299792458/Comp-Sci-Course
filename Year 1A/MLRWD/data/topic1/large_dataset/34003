A very intelligent yet hilarious look at the insanity of war and those responsible for waging it in the nuclear age.  Full of 4 Star performances by Peter Sellers (in multiple roles), Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott and Slim Pickens, the epitome of the commie-fighting cowboy

The behind-the-scenes companion DVD is just as much of a treat as the film itself: the set designers made educated guesses as to the interior of a B-52 bomber, and turned out to be so accurate that the Air Force got concerned and Stanley Kubrick was worried that the FBI would come after him; Peter Sellers was originally set to play the Slim Pickens role in addition to the President, Group Captain Mandrake, and Dr. Strangelove -- but a dispute with Kubrick, Sellers own near-exhaustion from playing 3 other roles, plus an "accident" all conspired to allow Sellers to bow out as the B-52 commander, and in came Slim Pickens in perhaps the most memorable film role of his career.  Pickens, as Major Kong, upon being told by his radio operator they've just received orders to bomb the Russians in reponse to an attack on the United States, responds: "Well I been to one World's Fair, a picnic and a rodeo, and that's the stoopidest thing I ever heard come over a pair of earphones!"  Do not miss this classic!
