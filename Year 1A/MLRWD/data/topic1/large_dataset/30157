I thought about teaching it as a modern interpretation of Othello, but there's this long, uncomfortable, sex scene that turns into a borderline rape scene in the middle of it.  I'm sure some think it's profound, but frankly, it's pretty heavy handed.  I'm teaching at the college level so *can* show it, but it's uncomfortable enough that I don't.  Well performed, but aside from that, it relies on and perpetuates stereotypes of black sexuality, violence, drug use, etc. much more than the original without anywhere near the character development that makes the original interesting.  From a pedagogical standpoint, I can use it as an excuse for a discussion on constructions of minoritized identity, which is fine and dandy, but then it's not doing its job as a companion piece for Othello to help them deepen their knowledge, except in the most superficial ways.  If I wanted to do that, I could assign the old black-face Orson Wells version.  As well, I'd rather just assign some James Baldwin if I wanted to discuss constructions of minoritized identity.

As a film, it's a good way to waste an evening.  I'd suggest renting it, though I did buy it because I'm also a Mekhi Phifer fan.  His acting in the role is much better than the material he is given.
