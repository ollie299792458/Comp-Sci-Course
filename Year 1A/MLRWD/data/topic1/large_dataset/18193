If you are expecting captions, as you normally do, and as everyone else provides, you will feel ripped off, hurt, and angry. ESPECIALLY if you bought this as a Christmas gift for a deaf person, like I did, and you pop in the DVD on Christmas day only disappoint your deaf friend or relative--not only with a product that doesn't work right (from our point of view) but because he now thinks you are so stupid and insensitive as to buy him a product that is not meant for him. Like buying a book for a blind person. Nice Christmas gift. Thanks.

While this is a great documentary, and Ewan and Charley are great fun, I was deeply disappointed that this DVD has no closed captions for the deaf (or anyone else who likes captions). If you buy this and you are deaf and/or if you plan to watch it with someone who is deaf, your heart will just sink the floor when, at a time when virtually every major release on DVD has closed captions, you pop in the DVD and can't seem to get the captions to work. You scour the DVD box over and over because you just can't be convinced that the litte squared-off Q symbol for captions is not there. Finally, you come to believe your eyes and what they do not see--no Q, and no captions on the screen. It's like buying a book with all the pages in the middle missing. And yet you paid full price!

I wonder if the new version when it comes out will have captions. I wonder also if deaf people and others who want captions, and full expected that they were included in the price of the first one they bought, will get any kind of refund, or will they have to pay twice for what they thoguht they were getting the first time round?
