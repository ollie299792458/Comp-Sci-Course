You will like Scream. In my late teens and twenties, I stopped going to see the slasher movies of that era
because they were plotless, had gratuitous violence and gave me nightmares. So I was reluctant to see Scream. I waited until it came out on video tape (Yeah, its been that long) however I enjoyed it and didn't feel scared because of the tongue in cheek nature of the film and the funny moments that lessen the shock of the violence But , the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and the twists and turns keep you guessing who is the killer and why are they trying to kill Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). The revelation of the killers was surprising, since it seemed that someone older was doing the killings.

Since I enjoyed Scream I made it a point to see Scream 2 in the theater, followed by Scream 3. I recently read the filming of Scream 4 began this Summer. I wonder if Sidney, Gale and Dewey will finally be killed off?

I am going to order the trilogy on DVD since I don't own any of the series in this format.
