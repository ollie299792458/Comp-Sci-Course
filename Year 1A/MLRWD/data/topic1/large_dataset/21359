I was a HUGE fan of Back To The Future and when I found out that the writer of Back To The Future was working on this project I was pretty excited.  Well do to a few issues that I won't get into since it is well covered on the commentary track this movie never made it into the theaters.  That is unfortunate because I believe this is a classic and it is a shame that not more people know about it.

The general premise of the movie is the main character Neil is on a mission driving down a mystical Interstate 60.  An interstate that really doesn't exist in our universe.  What is fun is Neil stops off in various towns along his journey and each person he meets and town he goes to is an exaggeration to kinda poke fun at our society.  Like a town filled with all lawyers who go out of their way to try and sue people who are just passing through there town.  I really don't want to give away too much but it is a really fun show and I think it would have worked great as a tv show.

Anyway check out this rare jem.  You won't be disappointed.
