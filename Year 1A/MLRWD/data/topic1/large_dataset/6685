The original version of "The Parent Trap" is definitely my favorite Disney movie ever and it is also pretty high on my favorite movies of all time list. This is a cute movie about a pair of twins (both played by Hayley Mills) whose parents were divorced shortly after they were born. They were split up and never knew the other existed. Then one year they were both sent to the same summer camp, where they met and discovered what happened, so they decided to switch places in order to bring their parents back together. 
Hayley Mills does a great job playing two different characters. You have to understand that this is a pioneering film. The idea of one actor playing the parts of the two main characters was unheard of at the time this movie was made. With the technology we have today, this is a much easier process than it was 40 years ago. There was a lot of tricky camera work involved here. In fact, if you look closely, you can see a couple of times where an arm or a hand or something gets cut off because Hayley Mills went past the imaginary line in the middle of the screen.
There are lots of special features on this new DVD to make it worth buying. The second disc is full of documentaries with background information on the making of the film. 
This is a great family movie. It can be enjoyed by both children and adults. I would recommend it to anyone I know, no matter what type of movies they like.
