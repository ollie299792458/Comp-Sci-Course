Well i've read few reviews.. filled with disappointment.. because the movie doesn't meet the anticipation of the book.

well
 a movie is a movie & a book is a book!
 the movie is done from the director's point of view..
 it would never match what you were expecting it to turn out like..
 this is the magic of books.. you read something & you start imagining because every single one of us has his own perception, view & imagination...
 meaning that if  10 people read this book & then these ten people directed the movie or re-presented it all over again..
 you will find 10 different ways of presentation & 10 different views to the idea of the book..
 so please stop judging the movie just for the reason that it didn't meet & it didn't match what you had in mind regarding the book.

Plus.. not all books can fit to be a movie..
 so the script writers make it fit.. or the director for that matter.

hope i got my point clear...
