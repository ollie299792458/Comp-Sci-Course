There are lots of reviews here lauding this final work by Jerome Bixby, and describing the plot quite well, so let me just add my two cents and split. This virtually action-less movie reminds me of a lost Twilight Zone episode, you know the kind of thought provoking film before the time of CGI and blow your socks off special effects, a flick light on the budget, but heavy on the thinking process. And that's the enormous strength of this movie, from the unassuming, matter-of-factness of Jon ( David Lee Smith) who drops a figurative nuclear devise on his professor friends, to the reactions of his friends and how willing or unwilling they are to suspend belief, to back their kind friend, or to have their worlds shattered by him and begin to doubt his veracity and sanity, to a tale that slowly unfolds and unwinds as the movie proceeds, like some giant sleeping serpent finally awoken from long years of sleep ( maybe 14,000 years of it?), becoming more menacing to some, more thought provoking and illuminating to others, until in the end you are privy to surprise ending that leaves Dr. Will ( Richard Riehle) dead on Jon's cabin floor, overcome with the final revelation. The only weakness perhaps is you have to wonder why Jon was not killed in other ways, like by a rock, or arrow, or spear, or gun shot, or bomb, etc. in the countless conflicts he must have witnessed, and perhaps was even a part of. Or how did he avoid accidents that could have done him in? It's unclear whether his body has the ability to regenerate tissue that has been damaged by such things. But then, Jon's over riding talent seems to have been his ability to simply survive.

This flick tells us as much about friendship and humanity as it does about survival and the ability to accept truth. It's a rare one, like "My Dinner With Andre," or "Mindwalk," and for that reason, a very solid one in a genre that is very narrow in volume, but very wide on perceptions, concepts, and thought provoking insights.
