1988's much beloved camp classic ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK is hands down the best film of the 1980's!!!!! Actress CASSANDRA PETERSON unique version of the vamp is forever cemented in this wonderfully outrageous film that can still take you on a laughable excursion some twenty plus tears later! ELVIRA'S obvious talents and upfront personality are featured gratuitously throughout her misadventures from L.A. to Massachusetts - and then back to Las Vegas for the show stopper of show stoppers! This film expands on the characters cosmology from her MOVIE MACABRE days, and gives her a wonderful wacky witchy family backstory. This film is loaded with camp humor and is bursting with one liners that will make this film one you'll want to view over and over - maybe even make a Halloween tradition; although you'll want to watch it more than just one time a year it's that funny! I've known plenty of people who when down or a little depressed will throw this in their DVD player and afterwards feel soooo mush better as if they have a whole new lease on life - ELVIRA IS BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN PROZAC EVERYONE!!!!! You've gotta check out this flick! I mean what's not to love? ELVIRA'S our underdog Goth gal-pal whose gorgeous animated face litters our world with her wit and wisdom for nearly ninety minutes that you'll never forget! This film also has a fantastic supporting cast (can you say Chastity Pariah anyone!), and I simply adore her lovable devoted familiar of a dog GAWNK who is a star in and of himself - wait till you see his makeover!!! This film has so much going for it, and if you want to laugh your *** off do buy this flick!!! Also check out ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS as this too is a hell of alot of fun - UNPLEASANT DREAMS EVERYONE !!!!!!!!!!
