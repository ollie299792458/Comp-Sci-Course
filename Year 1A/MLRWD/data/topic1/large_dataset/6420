It is interesting to read all of the reviews posted before and note all those who get XANADU and those who don't.  This is an absolutely wonderful film, an uplifting musical that exhilarates with its verve and joy.  Olivia  Newton-John is exquisite being both winsome and exotic/erotic as the greek  muse.  This was made during Newton-John's  multiple personality phase of  her career where one minute she was Sandra Dee from Muskogee, the next a  Nordic Dominatrix from Hell.  She manages to infuse both facets  intriguingly here with her supernatural greek muse character being both  sweet yet vaguely intimidating.  As an earlier post stated, the script is  very clever in it's allusions to greek mythology.  The male lead is stiff  but what can one do when Olivia is on the screen except stand there and be  quiet.  Gene Kelly is wonderful as well and I believe this was his final  film appearence; an excellent final bow.  The musical numbers and songs are  magnificent-especially the dancing duet between Kelly and Newton-John, the  big band/rock combo and the show stopping conclusion.  What I think some  viewers do not seem to comprehend is that this film is both a tribute and a  reincarnation of the wonderful hollywood musicals of the thirties-sixties  period. The animated sequence is an obvious homage/steal from ANCHORS AWAY  and An AMERICAN IN PARIS. Unfortunatley, Xanadu was made in the eighties  when the culture was already in freefall. So, of course, no one knew or  knows what to make of it. For those who think this is a bad film--HEY!  there's a new Bruce Willis movie on TV! Go watch it.  For the rest, we can  take pleasure in a charming musical fantasy that they just don't make  anymore.  Xanadu was the last.  Thanks Olivia.
