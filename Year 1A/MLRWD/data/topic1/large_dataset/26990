I was raised in a Navy family, attended a school run by the Navy overseas, and still have long time relationships with military friends and family. Many from my high school served in the military and the special forces.

Professionalism, effectiveness and valor are the three terms I would use to describe our service people's performance on a daily basis both in their professional and personal lives.

All of us owe our service people not only a debt of gratitude for protecting us from the tyrants and animals, of which there is a never ending supply, we owe it to them to ensure that the politicians don't short change them on their salary, living conditions, equipment and benefits and divert the funds into various vote buying programs and pork for the connected of both parties. Cell phones for votes while the soldiers are laid off comes to mind.

I thank the makers of this movie for minimizing all of the hot-dog and psycho episodes prevalent in so many military movies and not portraying the officers as disconnected boobs, they are not. The few that are ineffective, incompetent or detached from their reports don't last too long in uniform.

I have never met or known a better class of people than our service members.

While this film focuses on the SEALS, lets not forget the 6,000 plus service members who have died and the 25,000 wounded from all branches of the military in the current conflict with religious fascism, worse than the Nazis if that is possible.

In short; mostly realistic portrayal of the character and effectiveness of our military.
