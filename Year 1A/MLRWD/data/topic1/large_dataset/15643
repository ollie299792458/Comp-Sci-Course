The original theatrical release of Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D was done with polarized lenses, as many know. This produced a much better 3D experience than you're going to get with this version that uses the red and blue glasses. But is it a total waste? Not at all.

There are some drawbacks: because of the glasses, most of them film looks red and blue, and not like the natural colors of the movie. Then, there is some ghosting in some shots where characters appear to be doubled, or have a weird outline to them. But if you can forgive these flaws, you might find yourself really enjoying this. Some of the scenes in this film look pretty good for being a home 3D release. There is depth to a lot of the shots, and some of the scenes here just look really good. I was pleasantly surprised by how well some of it actually looked. Is it on par with the theater experience? No. But think of it this way: you can get this for $13. Come on. For that price, this is more than sufficient.

I think those complaining about the 3D quality are expecting something like the theater experience, and that's just not going to happen unless you import the Japanese version, or spend a lot of money for equipment. This is $13, and the 3D is more than sufficient for that price.
