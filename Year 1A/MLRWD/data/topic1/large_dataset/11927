His portrayal of King David brought glory to God, not Richard Gere.  Worldly critics, and the mass enslaved did not praise the content or intent of this movie...the message of worshipping God and not IDOLS is made very  clear in the BOOK of Samuel 16:7 "The Lord does not look at the things  man looks at.  Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks as  the heart."  I beleive the part Richard played had a huge impact on  his personal quest for truth.  Gere converted from his roots in  Christianity from a Methodist to the Tibetan school of Buddhism in 1982.  The movie was filmed in 1985.  Samuel 16:3  "God said, you are to  annoint for me the one I indicate".  Richard's talent is a gift from  God.  Richard's heart was influenced by Buddhism, but His heart is ruled  and changed by God.  In 1988 Gere used his visibility to promote the  oppressed in China.  His performance in this movie honors God. God chooses  the foolish to confound the wise! King Solomon came from King David's lust  for Bethsheeba...the Lord is faithful to those whose hearts are  pure..Richard has a servants heart.  His role in this movie changed Richard  forever, and it inspired me to read the entire book of Samuel.
