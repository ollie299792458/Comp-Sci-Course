The first time we rented this movie, I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. We ended up renting the movie so many times, we could've bought it. So we did. 
Christopher Guest is hilarious as Corky St. Clair, the mastermind director, producer and writer of "Red, White and Blaine." The production is to celebrate the 150th birthday of Blaine, MO.
"Waiting for Guffman" begins with a brief history about the town before getting right into the auditions for the big production. The "talent" that gets cast for the play include Dr. Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy), Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara) and Dairy Queen worker Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey). 
Corky wants to use his big production as a springboard to Broadway. And when he finds out New York agent Mort Guffman has accepted his invitation to watch the one-night show, he feels he's on the right track.
While the overall movie will keep you in stitches, the heart of the humor will come from the big night onstage. The songs the cast sing, the dances, the dialogue - you'll find yourself quoting the movie after a second watch.
You'll also recognize many faces in this mockumentary. If you've ever seen "Best in Show" and "Spinal Tap," you'll definitely love "Waiting for Guffman." Highly recommended!
