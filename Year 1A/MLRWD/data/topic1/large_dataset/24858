Just like 'Dances With Wolves', this movie has that  epic, expansive feel to it. It takes place in a post worldwide disaster. No one can remember what happened, only that once humans were said to have lived on "dry-land". Now there are small atolls of human colonies scattered across the never ending oceans. There is also a dominant and bloodthirsty clan called the "Smokers". These greasy glutinous gang have taken up residence in an old oil tanker. And have patch-worked together a basic knowledge of the combustion engine and how to exploit it to conquer all the atolls. At the middle of all this is a little girl who bears a tattoo on her back, that is thought to be a map to the mythical dry-land. And Kevin Costner's character, the loner called the Mariner, who is evidence of evolution at work. Through a series of events, these two cross paths, and end up fighting for their lives and caught up in the search for dry-land. This is one of my favorite Costner movies. The cinematography is beautiful. The cast and acting is entertaining. I love it every time I watch it. It's definitely a post apocalypse style movie, and for some people that might be an overplayed theme. You'll either love it or hate it. If you liked his previous movies in this style, its a good bet you'll like this one. It is a cool new twist on the 80's genre apocalypse movies. I only vaguely remember those, so the theme isn't played out for me.
