Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark in my opinion is a version you can't watch just once. My children can attest to that! I have watched it over and over and over... And each time I do it becomes more endearing.  True it is somewhat dated and one must do a slight adjustment in one's mind as the scenes take place on a sound stage and in film. Nevertheless, the dynamic chemistry that takes place between the main characters and the superb acting abilities of all the actors makes this version so much worth the while. I have viewed the DVD entitled Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (1997) and was very disappointed. I found it very difficult to believe that that version's Jane and Rochester would actually find love in one another.

Not so with this BBC version, you can see each characters growth that leads them down the path to their love and you believe it should have ended exactly there. I read the book stimultaneously as I watched the DVD and it pretty much sticks to the eloquent manner in which Charlotte Bronte wrote the classic.

Spend your money on this version or check it out at your local library to see what you think first.
