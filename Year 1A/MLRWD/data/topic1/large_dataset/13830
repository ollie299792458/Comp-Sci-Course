I... can't say enough good things about this movie. This film has to be the funniest film i have ever seen. It's worth seeing just for the soundtrack which is nothing short of perfect. Matt and Trey have a unique way of putting a film together that you could not expect from any other movie-makers. I just hope that when the DVD comes out they will put enough extras in that will make people buy it on impulse so that they can see it.. and die laughing. I'd like to add that i have been a fan of south park for 2 years and own series 1-4 and can't wait for series 5 to come out, so i can relive those hilarious episodes (towlie, anyone!) I have seen every south park episode up to 814 and i am looking forward to series 9 which airs on March 9th. Also, i'm 14 and i can't see why people say that "you must to be 17 to see this movie" why?

Look how much i care, Stan, see, look at my face, this is how much i care.

Sorry, i just had to get a south park quote in there somewhere :)

Anyway, if you are not offended by south park you will love this movie.
