I'm really gravitating to the less mainstream and not super popular movies and books these days.  I had never heard of this as far as it being in theaters.  I loved it.  It haunted me for days after watching it.  The weird thing was that I wondered for an hour or so after watching it if it was maybe a true story, if something like this could have really happened.  Of course it couldn't, except way long ago and in secret.  I got so caught up in the characters and the tiny details, like the people making deliveries to the schools and halfway houses making such an effort not to get to know or care for the kids, to protect themselves from the horror and saddness of the whole thing.  This is a movie that has alot of saddness but I enjoyed watching it so much and it really made me think.  I think there might be people out there who have philosophies that this kind of thing would be okay.  So I think movies like this are terrific to keep us thinking and watching what we do to each other as human beings.  I was so glad to see Carey Mulligan in something more than just a supporting role.  I think she's very talented.
