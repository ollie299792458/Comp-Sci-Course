Never thought I'd see the day when Criterion would decide to dip into Rhonda Shear's "USA: UP ALL NIGHT" territory, but that day, it appears, is upon us. Yes, this might be the Citizen Kane of cheap 80's sex comedies, but what does that say exactly? All the visual grandeur of an episode of Love Boat? Got it. Alot of innuendo but curiously lacking in any real sex, as if edited for tv (the USA network, per say?)? Got that too.

Alot of people will see a one star review and see it as reductive, as in -4 stars. But I really mean this review as +1 star. There were a few jokes that made me snicker. There were a few sexy flashes of nudity. It stars Mary Waronov, who will send you to your computers in search of the films that you've seen her in before. It was ahead of its time in documenting our sex-obsessed culture. One can find some social significance to justify this being a release in the Criterion Collection. But really, if you look hard enough, that would probably apply to most every movie.

Fair warning to all those discerning buyers out there, this film is pure trash. Not even fun trash, but cynical, evil, boring trash(the worst kind!).
