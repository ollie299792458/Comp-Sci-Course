I wont go into the stupidity of cutting scenes out of this first rate film too many people have already mentioned it.  If companies think that veiwers are too stupid to make up their own minds on what they want to watch then they realy shouldnt bother producing films.  Sad to say, when Americans complain about their films being cut they need to take a look at the idiots who clasify films in the UK (Average age 80) Must be great them sitting through hours of 'explicit scenes' only to cut them for us the masses.  I can only assume they think we dont have the ability to watch a film and make up our own minds we need others to do that for us.

Anyway on with the film.  Monica Bellucci is an exellent actress and in this film she plays a woman who pursued by almsot every man in her small town while her husband is away fighting in the war finaly gives up when she believes that her husband has died.  First falling for the well to do in the town then sleeping with what it would seem half the German army based in the town.  The horror of the reprisal against her at the end of the war and the final happy (to some extent) ending.

great film, if you can find the uncut version get it.  Film editors need to put a stop to this we are grown adults let us decide what we want to watch.
