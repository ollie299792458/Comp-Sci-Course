"Ain't nobody out here man I don't even know why I'm trippin, Don't nobody wanna mess wit da Smoke Dog Rooo Rooo, roooo rooo, Roooo Roooo!....who dat?!?"
"It ain't dem niccas that act hard...."
"Oh SHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"
Man this movie is hands down the greatest comedy I have ever seen.  Even when it turns serious and they are about to get smoked it is still funny.  And when Craig was finna get beat up by Deebo, the classic line that makes me laugh everytime comes up "yeah put that gun down Craig and get knocked out like ya father used to!"
There are so many memorable lines and scenes that it would be useless to try and go through them all cause I would end up reciting the whole movie.  My favorite parts however are when REd gets knocked out by Deebo and the father gets out the car.
"YOu want some of this too old man huh!"
"NO!!!!!!!get yo a$$ up boy and get in this car, I told you bout messing around with these people!"
My other favorite part is when Craig is high and he's talking to Debbie on the couch, and he turns and sees little puppie dogs staring at him and he goes "What the FHFG! man i'm trippin"
Another part when it's getting dark and Smokey and craig are trying to come up with a plan and Smokey says:
"Alright here's what we gon do, I'ma give you the gun, then I'ma go to my house and chill, you sit here on the porch and wait for dem niccas and later on you call me and tell me what happened!"
THis movie is funny from beginning (Jehovah's Witnesses and No Milk) to end ("I don't wanna die...Hey craig I love you man") and is very memorable.  The performances were excellent, the cast was excellent.  Even the concept of letting the plot come to them as they sit on the porch all day and do nothing is excellent.  The music and soundtrack was also excellent. The movie is excellent.  A Must have.
