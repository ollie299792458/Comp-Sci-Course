I absolutely enjoyed this movie.  I wasn't able to view the entire series  on television.  So, I got the DVD.  That was one of the movies my family  sat down to watch last Christmas.  The acting was great.  I hadn't known  too much about the individual Temptations - so this movie really told me a  lot.  The music and the performances were so good - I often hear people  (from family members to my hairdresser) talking about the movie and  actually trying to perform some of those dance steps!!
The movie had so  many moments - quite a few full of laughter and even those to make you cry.  I really had no idea that the group had gone through so many break-ups and  all of the different members.  I also enjoyed getting to see a little bit  of young Smokey Robinson (and the real Mr. Robinson at the burial scene),  the Supremes and Berry Gordy.  
Basically, the movie was good enough to  make you wanna go out and buy those old Temptations records.  In the  meantime, I think I'll go dig out my video of the Motown 25 Anniversary  special!
