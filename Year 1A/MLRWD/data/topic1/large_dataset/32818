The latest animation picture of Disney is certainly a great and funny movie. I personally think it's one of the better movies Disney has made. What I really liked about this one was the perfect animation and variety of  characters and also the stunning backgrounds. This all together gave it an  extra dimension what made the movie real good and visual stunning. The  story of this movie was not alike the old Tarzan movies and has very few in  common. I liked this because I didn't hardly liked the old movies of  Tarzan. But if you like the movies of Tarzan you'll find this the opposite.  The voices of the characters were very nice and fixed very good with the  different characters. One point I didn't like about the movie that was that  all the songs are done by Phil Collins. I don't think Phil Collins is a bad  singer, but I think the songs also have to be done by the people who play a  character. Some of the songs are very good, but I just don't like, it that  every song is done by the same person. And I gave this movie 4 stars,  because I think the music is very important for Disney movie. So far  concerning the movie.
The DVD is a very good one it has a fine picture  and 5.1 sound quality. The extra features are also very well done on the  normal Tarzan DVD and it contains lots of them. What very funny for kids is  is the Read-Along story option where a kind can read or be read the story.  Who said DVD is not educational ?. The rest of the extras is also very  good.
