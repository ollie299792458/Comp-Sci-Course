Probably the funniest, if not most profound play by Neil Simon turned film.  As a kid I saw the original staging on Broadway; in an unusual twist, the film version was even better, owing in part to the incredible cast.  The most famous Oscar, of course, is TV's Jack Kugman; he is very good.  But Walter Matthau was born to play Oscar as Zero Mostel was born to play Max Bialystock (the Producers).  Kids going batty over the current TV poker craze will love the card playing scenes.  Hypochondriacs will love Jack Lemmon as Felix.  And for you news junkies -- when Felix tells a Pigeon Sister he writes the news, and she asks, "where do you get your ideas?"...there is nothing dated here.

I've caught the rather mediocre Broadway revival with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.  Stick with the film -- it is funny, at times hysterical, with a subtext of pathos missing in the TV and stage versions.  This is the definitive version.  Like all great work, it stands the test of time because the characters, situations and relationships are timeless.

Buy one.  Buy three... and give two as a gift.  It's that good.
