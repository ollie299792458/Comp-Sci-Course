Ok, I love shark movies. Good ones, bad ones. I had been waiting for a new shark movie for a long time. Obviously the best shark movie was Jaws, then arguably Deep Blue Sea. Open Water and Reef were good in their own respects.

I feel like the movie went with the PG-13 thing hoping that the 3d in theaters would rake in the dollars. The movie should have been R and they should have made it with their balls. People that love shark movies want the violence. And not for violence sake, but because it's interesting and terrifying to see someone get eaten by a shark. Robert Shaw in the mouth of the great white at the end of Jaws has stuck in a lot of people's minds over the years for a reason. You don't see it often, and you don't see it done well. I think there was 1 shark attack that was cool in this movie. Only one. Which is too bad because the actors and actresses in this film were so awful that you just wanted them to die in the most awful ways. (spoiler) The Baltimore ghetto street tough black guy has a line where he says, after his girlfriend is eaten "West Baltimore rules...you take one of mine, I take one of yours" as he's standing on the beach with his right arm eaten off, standing with a spear that he somehow made. This movie was awful on so many levels which is a shame because someone that truly is interested in sharks clearly wrote the script. But all the interesting facts about sharks were taken from Shark Week or Planet Earth or other popular documentaries that covered the subject.

If you like sharks, watch it...it's worth your while because I feel like every shark fanatic will be better off seeing it than not, but don't expect even a B movie out of this. It just was downright crappy.
