I felt "Push" was a good action flick that needed some more ingredients that was missing from it, that
the movie script could have been developed alittle more deeper the way Hideki Kamiya, director to the legendary
"Devil May Cry" the original and now "Bayonetta" did. Push needs it's legendary script writer and director. I
gave this movie three stars because of it's lack of in-depth powers and a undeveloped script. For example,
CyberConnect 2's "Hiroshi Matsuyama," President/CEO of CyberConnect2 came out with "Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm,"
about 2 years ago; anyway the game did good but it could have done better? Well, this year, he saw the flaws his game
was suffering from, like the naruto world, it barely had people walking about in the leaf village. The Leaf village
was completely dead full of boring with no signs of life? Now that Hiroshi Matsuyama sees these problems, he's given
"Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2" along with his developers and script writers the ingredients to make this years game waaaayyyy,
waaaayyyy better. Flaws are finally corrected with a cherry on top. Well "Push" needs that type of director, script writer
with an eye and a more open-mind to bring this movie to life, the way James Cameron did with "Avatar." I felt Push was rushed
in certain areas of the movie with weak areas that needed tobe develope without rush.

But don't get me wrong, I like "Push," I loved Dakota Fanning's acting, But Chris Evan and Camilla Belle was not clicking in this
movie. How many movies did Camilla Belle star in with less lines to say, my god! And Chris Evans was just p***y wipped in this movie,
that it exposed his weakness for a** that he could not stay focus. Dakota Fanning is a much better actor all-around, she needs more
like her to make a dream team for more hit movies like "Twilight New Moon" and "Twilight Eclipse." I give "Push" three stars.
