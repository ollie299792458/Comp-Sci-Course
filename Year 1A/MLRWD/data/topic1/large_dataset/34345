A big reason why Callas is so revered, more than a quarter-century after her death, is her mystique.  Sure, she lived in the public eye, and left a vast legacy on record, but she wasn't visually documented much during her brief prime, and her status of the greatest singing-actress of the 20th century rests largely upon the credibility of those old enough to have seen her onstage.

This movie has some howlingly-awful character types.  You have the boorish, egocentric rock producer; the dowdy British journalist (where the hell did they dig up that ugly hat?); and the twinky gay artist.

Some situations are so hackneyed, it's hard not to roll your eyes.  The boy-toy artist, who brings La Callas up to his studio, presents her with a painting supposedly inspired by her Casta Diva.  The painting itself looks like a sophomore-level art project, yet Callas is so taken with it that she hangs it in her dressing room during the filming of Carmen. What?

Curiously enough, this film, which would best appeal to opera fans, and fans of Callas specifically, insults its audience.  What about that tacky dig at Renata Tebaldi?  Or that tired scene that serves to teach us about how much of a workaholic Callas was in rehersal?

Then there's the occasional bit of dialogue that can give you indigestion, like when Callas claims that being outside is "overrated".

One feels bad for Zeffirelli, who concocted this film as a tribute to a friend and legend. He would have fared better by giving us a film epic about her life, instead of this incredulous bit of fiction about the end of it.
