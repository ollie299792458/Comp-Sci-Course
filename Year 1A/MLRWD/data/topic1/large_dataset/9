I've been doing the P90x workouts (about 4-5 workouts per week, mixed with mountain biking on the off days) for nearly 2 years now. I work out around 350 days a year. I tried this Bob Harper workout (1 hour one) last weekend for the first time while working out with some family. WOW! I was going into the workout expecting it to be fairly easy in comparison to the P90x workouts, but I was quite surprised.

The biggest difference was the sheer lack of breaks during the Harper workout. Tony (P90x) gives you 10s breaks in between many of the exercises while he talks and switches weights. Not this workout. There is one small break about halfway through, but otherwise you are going nonstop. Or, at least, trying to. I was pouring sweat and had to take a few breaks. I think my mistake was using weights that were too heavy for the number of reps. In P90x I usually do 8-10, but in this workout it's not unusual to do 30 reps for some of them. Keep that in mind when you are first trying it out...I was using 5-25lb weights for most of the exercise.

I plan to incorporate this DVD into my normal rotation with P90x and mountain biking. It's awesome!
