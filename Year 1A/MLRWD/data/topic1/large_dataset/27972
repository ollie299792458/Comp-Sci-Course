Dead Calm is a great movie, and what makes it even better in my mind is that the bulk of the film is supported by three actors who never let it get dull. Billy Zane and Sam Neil are really amazing in this movie, while I felt Nicole Kidman played her role out in a painfully average kind of way. I like that the director didn't pull any punches and showed you everything including a fairly graphic child death and a very uncomfortable quasi-rape scene. The movie moves along very nicely which surprises me because I didn't expect it to paced so well with such a small cast and locale. I also have to speak of the soundtrack composed by Graeme Revell, because it is just so incredibly well done and fits perfectly with the movie. Graeme comes from an industrial music background, which I am pretty well versed in, and some of that background leaks into his score, making it a very haunting and just extra special for me. Really my only complaint is Nicole Kidman, I feel she was miscast, but I must tell you, I am not a big fan of hers to begin with, so if you are a fan, you'll probably love her in this. And she also gets naked in this movie, if that's your thing. Overall, Dead Calm is a stellar thriller.
