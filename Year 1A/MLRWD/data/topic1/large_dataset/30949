Kaiju Eiga fans are in for a treat with this, the 2nd to last entry in the Godzilla series. The movie itself is a direct link to two of Toho's previous creations (Godzilla x Mechagodzilla, and Mothra). So there's quite a bit of story interwined from all three of these movies...

The best part of the film would have to be the monster battles, Mothra never looked better, and Kiryu (Mechagodzilla) is also a nice addition to the mix. Although, I for one, am getting tired of the Kiryu's appearances, and I'm glad that the robot doesn't appear in "Godzilla : Final Wars" (the big guys final film).

The down side would have to be, well, a few things in all honesty. One, Kiryu is never called by it's true name once through out the film... When it is repeated over and over again. Instead, the subtitles read either "Mecha G" or "Mechagodzilla".

I'd also have to say that I like the original title of "Godzilla x Mothra x Mechagodzilla : Tokyo SOS" 100% better then the title that the DVD is going by.

But all in all "Godzilla : Tokyo SOS" is a great entry, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.

BTW - "Godzilla : Final Wars" is already out in the Monster King's homeland and all in all it's doing okay... Though, there are many mixed reactions to Goji's final film here in the States.

Only time will tell.
