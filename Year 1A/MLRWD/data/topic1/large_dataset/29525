My husband and I missed this film when it was in the theatre, so I bought the blu-ray version last week, thinking this would be a film we'd watch again and again [as we do DiCaprio's other big celebrity film, The Aviator]. It turned out to be one of the worst films we've seen--ever. We're puzzled how it could be so bad. Perhaps designed to create a visually dark mood to match Hoover's reputation, the scenes are so dark you sometimes can't see what's going on. But that's very far from the main problem. The story--a back 'n' forth between old age and the main events of his life--is so choppy that it's often hard to follow. These main events are told as vignettes, such as the Lindberg kidnapping and various hits on Commies, interspersed with guesses about his private life as a closet homosexual with a long-time partner [that may never have been consummated]. But the script was so bad, and even the acting was so bad [except for Judy Dench as his mother], that even the most emotionally painful scenes were just painfully embarrassing. DiCaprio seemed to be so focussed on getting the weird dialect right that nothing else, or even the dialect, rang true. We kept saying to each other, 'When is this going to be over?' Compared to The Aviator, a very similar film in structure, this film is a zero.
