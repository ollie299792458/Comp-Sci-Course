Put it this way.... to be honest and right to the point.....

Eros would have been a PERFECT BEAUTIFUL very erotic movie had the WHOLE movie been about the story and romance built between the two main characters: Chang Chen and Gong Li. But because they added the last two to the movie well.... geez! I just don't get it to save my life, why in the world they felt like they had to add the last two stories to this movie! UNREAL!!!! Down right stupid if you ask me. It totally ruined it! I mean.... They could've just made a 2 hour movie out of the first one with these two beautiful people/actors! I guarantee the movie then would've got the highest ratings and even gone up for an award!

The only reason why I love this movie and even bought the movie is because of the first short story about the Tailor Chang Chen and Courtesan Gong Li. It's so very erotic and beautiful. Once it's over, I turn the movie off and pretend as though that IS the movie itself. Forget about the other two!! Not even worth ones precious time - not even for a blink!

I would've given this movie 1 star because of the other two stupid stories but gave it 4 because the first story my favorite is in this movie. It's the only one that truly deserves 5 stars!!!!!!!!!! and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's such a shame the first one could'nt have been a movie itself. So upsetting and very disappointing. But at least we got to see the first one even for it's blink of an eye second showing in this movie!!!

I think another Director/Producer should remake this short piece between Chen and Li into a regular full length movie one day. Trust me.... they would get millions back and more for it!!!

I still very much recommend this beautiful sexy movie but please ONLY get it for the FIRST story and THAT'S IT!!!!! Trust me.... after the first one... if you continue to watch it... you'll be very disappointed!
