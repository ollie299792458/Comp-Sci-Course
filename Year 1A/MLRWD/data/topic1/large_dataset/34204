This film is essentially based on the absurd idea of time, the idea that time is real, a dimension, which could be travelled through. The NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory, a major part of superultramodern science, suggests that time, like space, is not real, but is rather a mere form of illusion to non-spatial mind. Present is an experience whose physical/material bases are non-spatial feelings. Past, like space and time, is a mere feeling; not any concrete reality existing on its own. To be precise, past is a feeling I have that I felt/had it before. I can't even be sure that something happened in the past. Maybe it's just my feeling in the present, where present is also a feeling. Getting into the past therefore means having the right ideas (that would also exist as non-spatial feelings) that conceptually correspond to the past. And the means to do this is to, at least partly, investigate the design of the universe (probably written in the form of some central superhuman thoughts existing as non-spatial feelings) by say meditation. The film is thus flawed based on a flawed scientific idea. But still I rate this film 5 star as it is thought- provoking and may lead one to superultramodern science and deeper philosophical/scientific problems.
