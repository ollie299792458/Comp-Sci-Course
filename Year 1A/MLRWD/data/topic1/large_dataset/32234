I can't remember how long it was between the two movies... but the increase in the quality of the camera work is just exponential!  It really goes to show that if you keep at something you can truly be great at it.  Aside from how technically good this film was, it touches on some important themes such as how the woods are frightening and dangerous at night. It really drives that point home, as it does the idea that maybe witches and ghosts aren't all "Gen-X" fun and games and that people who "play with fire" are going to get "burnt". To Ouijja board and Dungeons &amp; Dragons enthusiasts: take note!  Though this film is loosely based on the themes and plot structure put forth in such classics of the genre as Friday the 13th part 2, Nightmare on Elm St. part 2, Halloween part 2, and Hellraiser part 2,  it comes away with a distinct voice thanks to the unforgettable and touching narration of Scott Bacula (of TVs Quantum Leap).  We can only hope that Scott shows up as an actor in the next Blair Witch installment, rather than just a disembodied (albeit heartwrenching) voice-over narrator.  Who better to wage the final battle against the witch?!
