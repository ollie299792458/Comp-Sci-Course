If you read this to get some idea about the movie itself, stop here, and no matter what, watch it asap.
This is one of the best movies ever made.
Historical facts etc? Well, let me repeat, this is a "movie". As one of the users said, the music is real anyway.

I have the 2 disc DVD set (it's not flip over type). I bought it in 2005.
One of the discs contain the movie (it has both the director's cut and the theatrical versions) and the other one is the special features (interviews etc).

Then I saw the movie in Blu-Ray.
I read the reviews because I was sceptical about the video quality of the blu-ray. Is it worth it? -Yes (read below).
All the reviews are mixed up. I even saw some reviews about laser disc and VHS releases.
Well, I want to tell you about the Blu-Ray.

Yes it's worth to pay for the Blu-Ray version.
I watched both discs (DVD and Blu-Ray) and compared them almost simultaneously in 2 different Blu-Ray players (one being OPPO BD93, the other is Panasonic something). Both players one by one proved that Blu-Ray has a better picture quality than the DVD.

Sound didn't seem to differ a lot though. I have a 7.1 sound system with Pioneer Elite receiver, and some nice, really decent speakers. I really could not tell the difference between the two discs (DVD and Blu-ray).

If you can find the one-disc Blu-ray version (nowadays available in your grocery store for $11.99). Go for it!

And you might have already read it but let me repeat, so far the blu-ray discs contain only the director's cut version (as of December 2011).
