Lots of interesting critiques here of this masterful and wrenching film and I don't see much point in being redundant.  So, one perhaps important clarification and one opinion just because I feel like it:
1.  The DVD release contains not THREE deleted scenes, but SIX.  The Special Features section has a second page!  Furthermore, if you've missed it you will see not only the scene (whose absence from the film is interestingly lamented in an earlier review here) in which Miss Kenton speculates on what her life might've been with Stevens, but also a rather fascinating scene labeled "The Pier" in which Stevens spills his guts to a complete stranger and dampens his hanky into the bargain.  Without having yet heard the director's commentary in these scenes, I must conclude that they were excised for their overt emotionalism, which could be considered somehow false to the characters.  To me, the more intense the repression, the more inevitable that eventually the truth will be blurted out in an awkward and unexpected manner, so I'm of mixed mind regarding these choices.
2.  I relish rather than regret the integrity this film displays in not permitting us the scenes of huge emotional catharsis that we're all screaming for by the end of the tale, but the penultimate pigeon scene is one subtlety too many...either this film should've made SOME sort of final statement or I've failed to properly comprehend the one that's there.  Instead, it just seems to...stop, in a rather arbitrary and anticlimactic manner.
