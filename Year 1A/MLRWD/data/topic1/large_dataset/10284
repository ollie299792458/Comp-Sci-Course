Alien stands the test of time as one of the greatest sci fi/horror films of all time. It is still being ripped off to this day but never equalled. Mostly overlooked by today's jaded teens and early twenty-somethings, this is no gun blasting action fest. That description best suits the 1986 sequel Aliens. Alien is really a suspense film. It is also a showcase for some of the best artists and designers ever assembled for a film project. The set and costume designs are second to none. H.R. Geiger's biomechanoid creature and set designs are also a frightful wonder to behold but what makes this film so frightening is something so often lacking with modern horror movies...character development. These characters are your blue collar working class neighbors. Everyday people you can identify with. Much of the dialog is so natural and spontaneous, thanks to Ridley Scott's directing style which encourages improvization from the actors. The first thirty minutes of the film are spent introducing the viewer to their world and setting up the terrors ahead. When they are thrust into a living nightmare and must rely on their wits to survive you are right there with them to the horrifying end. I first saw Alien when it was released in 1979 and I've witnessed the endless stream of lame imitators like Deep Star Six and Species. See the first, the original and best of them all.
