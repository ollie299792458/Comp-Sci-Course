About a Boy is one of those films that gets better the more times you watch it.  It's so funny you can't laugh at half the jokes because you are still chuckling from the last one.  Yet About a Boy is more than just a bunch of punch lines strung together, this film touches on some serious issues, but in a manner that never seems pretentious.
Will (Hugh Grant) is in his late 30's and doesn't really care about anyone or anything but himself.  Attempting to meet single mothers (although he hates kids, he thinks single mothers are desparate) he accidentally falls in with a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  Slowly the two begin a friendship that will be the most important relationship either has ever had.
I don't want to say much more than that.  This story is endlessly charming.  American Pie directors Paul and Chris Weitz have fashioned a magnificent film out of Nick Hornby's material.  And how well does Hugh Grant fill out this role?  Charming, witty, and hopelessly self-absorbed, he is fantastic as Will, the guy you know you shouldn't like, but do anyway.
All the supporting players are great too.  Toni Collette is amazing as Marcus's misfit mother and few child actors come off better than Nicholas Hoult does here.  I really enjoyed this one.
