I first saw this movie ages ago, and through the years completely forgot about its existence. Then I watched the Monty Python documentary "Almost the Truth" and they talked about this movie and showed clips from it. That brought back the memories and I realized I must have this film for my collection.

I'm not gonna go into great detail about the film itself. If you haven't seen it by now, I can't help you. Buy the damn Blu-Ray (or DVD if you prefer), and see it. It is absolutely amazing and is some of the finest work the Monty Python crew has ever done. I love absolutely every single second of this film, and if you don't, you are probably a bad person. I strongly believe that the people who don't like this movie are the reason we can't have nice things.

On to the Blu-Ray then. I bought this particular edition because of the stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. The picture and sound quality is great. The only complaint (if you want to call it that) that I have is the menu. The writing on the menu can be a little difficult to make out at first glance, but it's not really that big of a deal.

I haven't checked out the commentary or any of the other special features because honestly I don't really care much about all that stuff. I bought the Blu-Ray for the movie, not for all the extra crap. Well worth the cash for the movie alone, all the special features notwithstanding. In the time it took you to read this review, you could've bought this movie. How can you live with yourself?
