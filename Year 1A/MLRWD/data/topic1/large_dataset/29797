This is about the 20th Barbie Featured Movie I have gotten for my daughter who worships the floors of the Barbie dream house she walks on.

This particular movie is a direct sequel to Barbie: A Fashion Fairy Tale (You may want to watch that first before seeing this movie), that follows the adventures of once again Barbie as herself (Most of the time Barbie is portraying another character in the movies) that discovers that 2 of her closet friends are Banished Faries from the Fairy Kingdom of Los Angeles (Yes, I Kid you not, Los Angeles) the fairy princess of Fairy L.A. kidnaps Ken because of the affects of a love potion that makes her believe she is in love with Ken. So now Barbie joins forces with her two banished fairy friends (Still trying to figure out how anybody can be banned from L.A. ?) and long time rival Raquel to rescue Ken before he is forced to marry the love druged fairy princess and be forced to stay in Fairy L.A. forever. Now I know this will by far never win any sort of Academy Awards, recieve a Critcs Choice of the year, or put Pixar out of Business anytime soon However, for the age and gender group it is aimed at they do make a very imaginative and entertaining movie. They also teach the values of love, friendship, and never giving up no matter how hard the object of the movie is.

I will have admit this is probably one of the weaker Barbie Movies in the Franchise but my daughter loved it and as always taught a good lesson of not judging a person by there outside appearance. For anybody's young to teenage daughter I would heavly recommend it for, plus the price on these movies are generally pretty reasonable.
