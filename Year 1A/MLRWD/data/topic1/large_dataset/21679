This underrated sci-fi is a joy to watch. Karen Allen stars as Jenny Hayden, a young widow who wakes one night to find someone in her house who looks exactly like her dead husband Scott. Jeff Bridges plays an alien who is sent on an investigative mission after his people intercepted the Voyager probe, which was carrying details of earth and its inhabitants. In a naive attempt not to frighten Jenny, the alien takes on the form of Scott.
The alien has crash landed and has only 3 days to cross the USA to a rendezvous point where he will be rescued. A terrified Jenny is forced to drive the being and she initially is, naturally enough, very hostile. As their journey across the States progresses however, Jenny begins to learn more about this strange and gentle being and a burgeoning relationship develops. Meanwhile government agencies are in hot pursuit, their aim is to capture, interrogate and kill the alien.
This is a film that is gentle and moving but also manages to build up tension as the chase is on, and fine acting from all the leads adds to the quality. This film is great for anyone wanting something a little more thoughtful than the usual action packed, special effects filled type of movie in this genre.
