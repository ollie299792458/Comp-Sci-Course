This is the untold story of a fierce, patriotic citizen. She believes in the tenets of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. She believes in We the People. She decided to get involved in her local government and change the status quo. She is fearless, independent and a woman of strong convictions. This is the woman that was never introduced during the 2008 campaign. These are not anonymous sources in salacious magazines. We hear straight from the lips of people who worked in her administration and worked in the corrupt administration prior to her overwhelming election to Governor. We get to learn Sarah Palin was the most popular Governor in America, she crafted the largest piece of energy legislation in North America, she utilized her line item power to cut out $300 million dollars of wasteful spending and she made transformative ethics reform!! It's an inspiring story of being knocked down but not knocked out. A great idea we teach our children to never give up hope when you are on the side of what's right.
