Man, what a stinker this movie is.  Seriously it's so lame that only children would enjoy it.

First of all, how dumb is it that there would be a girl bank robber anyway.  I believe the boy part of it, because history has shown that boys rob banks.  But girls?  Come on.  That's not very believable and anyway why would they need to because they get all their money from men already.  See, the logic in the movie doesn't work.

This movie, which is horrible, is also a total rip-off of Natural Born Killers.  If Woody Harrelson (or anyone from the terrific ensemble sitcom "Cheers") were in Bonnie or Clyde it would be a much more excellent movie.  I would prefer to see Frasier and Robin Colcorde robbing banks and I think that would be a real hoot of a movie.

I haven't seen many Warren Beatty movies, but I can tell you after this one, I probably won't be rushing out to rent them.  And Faye Dunaway who plays the part that is not Clyde is also dumb and I hate her so much!!!!

If you have a choice between seeing this movie and Anaconda, I recommend Anaconda, again, unless you're a child and have no movie taste and then you should probably watch this movie.
