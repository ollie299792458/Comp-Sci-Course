Did i really watch the same film as the previous reviewer??..my this Seagal vehicle is bad,what happened to the stylish fighter we once knew?
The fight scenes...showing Big Steve's gurning face and then cutting to the back of a 'double' who then does the actual fisticuffs,more Steve face pulling...more 'double' fightwork, Seagal is only ever shown in these scenes from the shoulders up.
I think these days the fight double should get top billing as with each passing film Seagal does even less,by this rate he'll need a stuntman just to get out of a chair, 'lose a bit of weight Steve,you don't convince at all anymore'.
The way the 'action' scenes are cut are annoying,the same punch shown numerous times,the same person hitting the floor as many...too much of the same,and it skips frames looking like they're using a teleporter..most odd and amateurish.
Don't get me wrong,i like the man,but he is plainly way too out of shape,he fights men half his age (and weight) and has never had a fist laid on him,taking the odd punch or messing up his shredded wheat hair would seem better.
You can tell he wrote it,his various ladyfriends in recent films have got so young its frankly embarassing.
He plays chauvenistic arrogant fool (along with his partner) which makes their characters unlikable..
Watch it and wonder where it all went wrong for Big Steve..
