I first heard of this series from a review on the website, www.teevee.org; if you search for Da Vinci on the site, you can see their review of the full series. I purchased the first season  based on that review and I'm very pleased. This show is excellent! If you are a fan of television programs such as Prime Suspect, Homicide or NYPD Blue, you will enjoy Da Vinci's Inquest. 
The main character, Dominic Da Vinci, is an investigator for the Coroner's office; his job is to investigate the circumstances surrounding the victim's death. He works closely with both the medical examiner and the detectives on the homicide squad. The interaction of all the characters makes for a rich mix of personalities. The first story arc spans three episodes and it does a fine job of establishing the cast and the feel for the series. Subsequent episodes introduce and usually resolve the mystery in one show, but the consequences continue to affect the storyline throughout the season. Minor plot threads run through the whole season to flesh out and provide motivation for the characters. 
Viewing the first season is like reading a great novel - you don't want to stop it because it's so engrossing.
I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys thought provoking television mysteries.
