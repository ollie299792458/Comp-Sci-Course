I had read the reviews about this film and seen the trailer - but was willing to give it a go - sometimes some little gems are hidden amongst the poor reviews - oh boy , was i wrong ! This film just made my blood boil - don't these Hollywood Diva's both male and female already live in their own worlds of make believe and plastic surgeons , without now pushing their paparazzi predjuces on the rest of us - when they want to be seen , they can't wait for the paparazzi to show up . This film was just a Mel Gibson fantasy - he even had to pop up in a cameo role - maybe he thinks he's like Alfred Hitchcock ? The non speaking 20 second shot of him was even badly acted - poor Mel . My only hope is that he does'nt go back to making and acting in rubbish like Braveheart !

Back to the film - to add insult to injury - the film was only 81 minutes long / a rip off before you even start to watch it / non of the characters were likeable - you did'nt care what they did to Bo Laramie (what an original and believable name)! / We are all supposed to feel sorry for a guy that and support a guy that sets people up to die , bashes peoples heads in , drives recklessly and pushes a motorcycle off a cliff / frames another for murder - all because someone took some pictures of him and his family - then he stops in the middle of the road waiting for a speeding car to hit him without his child strapped in - i must admit Bo did look very healthy after the accident !!

I was no fan of Princess Diana (she loved the media) - but the scene where the paparazzi are all over the wrecked car taking photo's was a bit sick and over the top!

My verdict - if you are wanting some light entertainment that lasts 80 minutes with no plots , twists or realistic events included and a very predictable end - this is the one for you !
