Aside from the cheesy cover art, this is another New Line Platinum release that is sure to please fans with its extras.  Of particular interest on the bonus CD is the section entitled "The John C. Reilly Files" and the hilarious montage of the boys telling off Nick (Michael Penn) after their simply horrible recording sessions.  As for the movie itself, well, it's big in scope and covers a lot of ground in a very entertaining fashion, but I have to grudgingly hold out on that fifth star as the message has been heard many times before (in fact, I find the underlying plot remarkably similar to Goodfellas - boy wants to be a gangster/star; boy becomes a gangster/star; boy lives the high life; boy does too much coke and screws everything up; boy has to come begging to former employer for help).  There is a lot to like about this movie, though; the performances are excellent (Wahlberg is so sweet you can't help but like him and Burt Reynolds hasn't been this good since - well, ever!), and the story provides plenty of laughs and drama, and even the minor characters feel pretty real, too (i.e., the perverted "Colonel" and that weird guy dancing around to Sister Christian amidst the popping fireworks).  Boogie Nights makes a good addition to a DVD library - stands up well to multiple viewings and very attractive bonus features.  Recommended.
