We first saw "A Little Princess" on HBO and knew right away that it's a "must add" DVD to our collection, even better...a DVD with two of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classics. Any adult can relate to the two movies here and the stories are beautifully told on film adapted from the books. There are other versions which we haven't see and am pretty sure they're all as good. My girlfriend became very emotional [about Sarah Crewe] and loved it (she's a kid at heart) I'm glad she did, because essentially, I wanted this movie for her because she is my little princess.

The double-featured disc is a great value, but a widescreen format would be a good option, there isn't one despite the description from the case stated that there is both full-screen & widescreen versions: this is pretty misleading because I believe the two formats were meant for the 'Theatrical Trailers' and NOT for the movie if you read carefully along the print. Also, printed inside on the center hub of the disc, it states that both versions are 'Full Screen', by then this is too late to sort out the confusion if you are very particular about having the widescreen format...so I'll minus one star for this making a total 4 out of 5.
