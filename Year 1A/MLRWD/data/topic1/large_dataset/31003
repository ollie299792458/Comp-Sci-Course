Ok, it is no Leone film, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a great movie. You have one of Eastwood's stronger roles and a great supporting cast (everyone from Bruce Dern to Dennis Hopper is in this one). You also have a graphic and horrifying opening sequence. The story is Eastwood is mistaken for a rustler, mistakenly lynched. He survives, becomes a marshall and hunts down the men who did it, falling in love along the way. And underneath it all, there is the director's commentary on capital punishment. The film leaves a few loose ends, not enough for a sequal (if that is what he was thinking at the time), or really enough to make the viewer think. Instead, just enough questions to annoy the watcher. Still, it is one of Eastwood's best movies. 
As a dvd it falls way short. The picture and sound quality aren't much better than what you would find on video cassette. There are no extras, just the trailer for the film (and a badly done trailer it is). But I would pick it up just for the quality of film it is.
