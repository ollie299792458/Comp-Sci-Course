Although this is absolutely a fabulous tour de force and treat to see 4 competent actors, unlike the drudge and hacks we have to put up with in today's Hollywood, I just wanted to let anybody know that has taken a gander at the Product Details and advise them that this movie is not in anamorphic widescreen as it is alledged to be described. It is in fact nothing more than a re-issue of the 1997 snap case. Only differences, snape case 1997, keep case 2006. Original theatrical movie poster used for cover art 1997, cast photo used for cover art 2006. Different pics on the back of both dvd cases from different scenes in the movie. As for the most important piece of noteworthy evidence, the statement on the back of both dvd cases, quite literally reads exactly the same, "STANDARD VERSION: Formatted from its original version to fit your screen. WIDESCREEN VERSION: Presented in a "letterbox" widescreen format preserving the "scope" aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. Enhanced for widescreen TVs." I would intend that to be that the aspect ration in question is 1.85:1 non-anamorphic and that it is not 2.35:1, which is anamorphic.

Hope this helps any cinephiles out there with their decision to invest in this newer release.
