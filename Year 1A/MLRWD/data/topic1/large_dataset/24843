A must see! I must say that L&amp;B is one of the best love stories I have ever seen, and for that matter one of the best movies I have ever seen. The insight and parallel between being successful on the court and successful with your heart is clearly driven home by the director Gina Prince-Blythwood. The director's attention to detail I found very captivating. Thanks to the director for  potraying the 60% Afrian Americans who are middle class or upper middle class for a change.  Omar Epps gives his usual A-Game performance. Clearly sometimes one of the often overlooked talents in Hollywood. And quiet frankly (no offense to the caucasian audience) but if Sanaa Lathan had been white she would be up for an Oscar Nomination, the depth of her ability to potray a female basketball player never having picked up a basketball before the sundance film festival reading is simply astounding. Sanaa's acting ability that delivers the emotional heart tugging throughout the film can not be overstated. Sanaa and Omar's chemistry was a true bonus for the movie. Thanks to Spike Lee and 40Acres for recognizing a true gem of a script. I hope their are more drama's in the works for the African American audiences. If you haven't seen this movie yet don't even bother renting it, purchase the DVD or VHS it is well worth it for $20 or less.
