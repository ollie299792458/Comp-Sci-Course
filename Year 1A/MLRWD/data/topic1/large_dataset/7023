I saw ATLANTIS last night, accompanied by my 65 year-old mother, and we both had a great time.  No, it's no LION KING or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but it's not meant to be either; it's meant to be something different for Disney, and it is.  The action scenes are amazing, sometimes evoking for me images from the STAR WARS movies.  The dialogue is often sharp, fast and hilarious (maybe a little too fast to follow for younger kids), and lots of our fellow adult audience members were laughing out loud.  The voice talent is, as always with Disney, fantastic; Michael J. Fox does a terrific job as Milo, Leonard Nimoy is perfect as the aged Atlantean king, Cree Summer is proud, intelligent and earnest as Princess Kida, and Milo's fellow adventurers are all equally well done.  I didn't find the storyline at all difficult to follow, and while the concept of the giant crystal that keeps Atlantis alive is a bit "new-age", I don't think kids will have a problem with it.  It's sci-fi, it's fantasy, it's adventure - it's awesome!  It's also a whole lot more than what you've seen in the previews and commercials, so go see the movie TODAY!  You'll have a great time, and it might just spark your interest in the search for the real (hey, there is intriguing evidence) Atlantis.  Adventure lives!
