I don`t mind horror or scifi movies with a message, even if I disagree with that message, if it is part of an entertaining story.  I loathe what most people consider horror movies but love genuinely chilling or even scary movies.  This one has potential to be so good, but it is all set-up and no pay-off.  The filmmakers use the laziest cheat in storytelling: If a character agrees with the filmmaker`s worldview, he is not only smart, he`s kind, heroic, better-looking than the bad guy, and a great lay, while the guy who disagrees with the director`s worldview can`t just disagree on one point, he has to be scheming, dishonest, and has to destroy evidence of wrongdoing.  If you think Al Gore has all the answers, you may enjoy this, but if you think there can be more than a black/white point of view, you`ll be in for a dull time.  Some good acting and excellent tension-building leads nowhere. Repeated shots of a well-cap in the snow promise something scary ahead, but all we get [SPOILER] is a see-through reindeer.
