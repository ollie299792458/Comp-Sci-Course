Ok Mr. Woo we get the slow-motion bird flying thing. What's with that? Is that your staple? It's in all his movies. Here it had nothing to do with the movie except that John Woo wanted to make sure everyone knew they were watching a John Woo movie. Once upon a time Woo's style of direction, especially action sequences, was unique, but now it's tired. Woo is more concerned with slow-motion birds and 1980s action sequences than bringing out the best in his actors. The quote-unquote acting was laughably bad. Particularly Ben Affleck, who is picking all the wrong roles. Ben, you're not an action star. You were good in Good Will Hunting and Chasing Amy, those are the type of movies you belong in, where you play regular guys. The larger-than-life action star thing isn't working for you, although your bank account says otherwise. Uma Thurman's character, if you can use the word character, was barely human. Just a piece of cardboard with skin on it. And Aaron Eckhart I've been disappointed in for years. Here's a guy who was absolutely brilliant in 'In The Company of Men' (1997 I think), and he's never remotely matched that shocking performance. Since then he's been reduced to chubby side characters. Aaron, fire your agent.

 When, O when, will people tire of these mindless, brain cell-less, useless, action movies. When? I guess never, and soon I'm moving to Mars and starting my own production company.
