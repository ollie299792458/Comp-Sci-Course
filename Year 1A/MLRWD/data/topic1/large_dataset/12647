The year 2008 was a year where he OSCARS where a FIASCO. Movies like this one that should've gotten OSCARS(Angelina was nominated as Best female actress and didnt get an Oscar - what a shame!)were treated by the wayside.

The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button suffered the same fate. That was the best movie of that year and like Forrest Gump it shouldve cleaned house. Brad Pitt on this movie was also nominated for Best Actor but was given to Sean Pean for a movie called MILK that you can find now at Walmart for $5. I guess they wanted to get in good with the Gay community at the Oscars because MILK cant touch Benjamin Button.

To the surprise of many, this was a great movie directed by Clint Eastwood.

PLOT - This movie takes place in the 20s. Angelina is a phone operator supervisor and leaves her son at home as she goes to work. When she returns she cant find him anywhere so she files a police report and tries for the police to help her but at that time, the police didnt want to look bad so they put her in a psychiatric ward because she made public that the police failed to help her finding her son.

It narrows down that a man in the 30s killed 19 kids and one of the kids that escaped came forward to tell the tale. The kid mentioned he saw Angelina's son as this man massacred kids sometimes 5 at a time.

With the help of an attorney, Angelina files a lawsuit against the police dept and not only the killer was sentenced to die by hanging but unfortunately Angelina was never able to recover from the loss of her son.

Is a great movie with a lot of substance that again it was treated by the wayside!!!
