Annie wannabe's, here is the standard to which you strive for. Unfortunately for all of us, she's been locked away in the MGM vaults for the last 50 years. But, if I know Annie, she's coming back, better than ever ! Musical lovers under 50, are you in for a treat. Forget all that you've heard about Judy Garland, and her sad exit from Metro while working on this picture. About Louis B. Mayer begging Hal Wallis at Paramount to loan MGM his hugely popular star, Betty Hutton. About the cold shoulder Betty recieved from cast and crew on the "Annie" set. None of it affects the stunningly exciting final product. THIS IS A GREAT MUSICAL !  The score is as good (or better) than any you've ever heard. Songs you'll remember, and be singing, for the rest of your life. Hopefully we'll be seeing a totally restored version, which means the glorious Technicolor will dazzle you. The young Howard Keel makes his MGM debut here, and will knock you out. Louis Calhern is perfect as Wm. F.(Buffalo Bill) Cody, certainly larger-than-life !  But , this is Betty Hutton's movie, from start to finish. I've always considered it her crowning achievement. It's big, brash, beautiful, funny, and above all, it's FUN !
