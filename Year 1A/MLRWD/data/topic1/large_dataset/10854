A movie starring Al Jolson, and featuring Kay Francis, Delores Del Rio, Ricardo Cortez and Dick Powell is suppose to be excellent entertainment, correct?  I found 1934's WONDER BAR to be a bit of an uncomfortable movie, even though I am a fan of pre-Code pictures.  There is a rather lavish, tasteless blackfaced musical routine by Jolson called "Goin' to Heaven on a Mule," that most people today will find offensive.  One character who visits Al's nightclub is very depressed, gives away all his worldy goods,and wants to commit suicide--and he is actually helped to do this by Jolson's character, to cover up a murder in the nightclub!  Gays are also ridiculed--there is a brief scene where a couple is dancing and a young man walks up and taps the man on the shoulder and asks if he can cut in.  The man indicates it's okay...and the two men dance off together.  Jolson grins widely and says, "Boys will be boys!"  There is also a rather violent dance between Ricardo Cortez and Delores Del Rio where he whips her!  
I don't know...the whole thing just didn't seem very entertaining to me.  I guess I expected more, given the cast.  I know Jolson was a tremendously big star on the stage, but I'm not sure that his "larger than life" persona translated quite as well onto the silver screen.
