I usually like Jackie Chan movies.  I grew up on them as a kid in Asia.  I would read the subtitles on his Cantonese films.  Ever since he started making American films, however, his action has been less exciting/audacious/suicidal (perhaps also because of age) and the plots have never been more ludicrous.  In this film, he's a cab driver that gets recruited to drive for a super-spy.  When the super-spy gets injured, he puts on the suit and inadvertently fills in for him.  The bad guys wants to take over the world by providing the only clean source of drinking water and contaminating the rest.  Ugh!
Jackie Chan is perhaps better known for his unique, slapstick style of martial arts.  However, in this film, Jackie plays Johnny Tong a cab driver who knows no martial arts and would rather hide under cars rather than confront a bully.  It's the Tuxedo that "gives" him his special abilities including a Fight Mode which turns him back into regular ...-kicking Jackie (but much tamer).  There were also bunch of Matrix-like scenes which I'm beginning to get tired of.  
I have no major complaints on the acting, the casting or even the directing.  I do have major problems with the writers of this movie.  It's not good enough.  This is not a good Jackie Chan film.  It's something I'd like to see Dana Carvey get stuck with.  Now there's your unwitting hero.  But why sully Chan's reputation with such .... ?  Had the writers actually watched Chan's earlier films maybe they would appreciate his true abilities and write accordingly.
Don't focus on the plot.  Just enjoy how much fun Chan and Hewitt have on-screen and leave it at that.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):
============================
L (Language) - 4 (Jackie Chan does the best he can with a deficient script and lacking plot)
E (Erotica) - 0.5 (n/a - but I never know Hewitt had cleavage, and I swear to god one of the bad guys copped a feel when they fell into a pool)
A (Action) - 3 (usual Jackie Chan slapstick martial arts made less interesting by the tuxedo special f/x enhancements)
P (Plot) - 4 (cab driver turns subsitute super-spy out to save the world from a bottled water magnate bent on poisoning the earth's water supply)
