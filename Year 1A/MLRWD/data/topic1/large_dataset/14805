I bought this, and another DVD (Underworld 3) on a whim, based on reviews and descriptions. Comparing these two, Outlander definitely wins out. It was good action and nice CGI, not too mushy, and good, solid characters within the narrow range that is usually allotted to your friendly neighbourhood action characters.

The main topic, a spaceman crash landing in the viking era, is in itself very promising. I also found I liked the way they explained it in the bonus disk, about how this could actually be the event on which Beowulf. There are zillions of ways of looking at old myths and epics, and why should this explanation be less plausible than some others?

The plotline was somewhat predictable, if you are familiar with the rote action movies - "tortured" hero who has a killed wife and child in his past, a local woman, or better even, a local WARRIOR (read: Mary Sue) woman, an old and wise man, a hothead heroic sidekick-character, and a demonic menace. I guess you can already guess what happens to each of them? You probably guess correctly. No real surprises there.

A BIG mistake was IMHO naming a character Boromir. Egads. If they felt the need to use a Tolkienish name, why not take one from Rohan, where they really had Germanic names which would have suited perfectly? Why an Elvish-based name which stood really out like a pink polka-dotted elephant?

And as regards the bonus disk: oddly, while I liked to see all that additional material, making of and deleted scenes, I found the fact that they even bothered filling a whole disk with bonuses way too pretentious. This is no big hit movie to require such self-aggrandisement.

Okay, so I've written a lot about how this was not a good movie - but it wasn't all that bad, really. Mostly, I liked it. It was nice entertainment, and someday I'll probably put it into my DVD player again. :) If you're not looking for anything serious, this might just suit your taste.
