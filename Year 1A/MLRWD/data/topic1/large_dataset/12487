my review is based on the limited edition edition of WANTED.

if you want a review on the movie. go ahead and read someone else's review. theres plenty of them written.

the reason i bought it was because of a sentimental experience i had when i saw it in theaters. and ok, i admit that i am an angelina jolie fan.

i decided to buy the limited edition version because the image pictured for the product seemed nice. i dont really care for the film cell or the assassin's booklet that came with it. i do like the graphic on the dvds, and the card that was holding them inside.

what sold me for the limited edition is that the box looked nice and appeared to have a plastic cover that fitted over the "book." the book box itself is built to feel like the old fashioned encyclopedia texture and feel. however, the plastic cover was nowhere to be found. the product came in plastic saran wrap, and the plastic case that was in the product image whether it be hard clear plastic or  just a plastic sleeve was nowhere inside.
