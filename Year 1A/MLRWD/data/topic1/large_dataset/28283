...by not giving it the full season it needed, pre-empting it frequently and for up to a month at a time, and then ending it on a cliffhanger, knowing it wouldn't be renewed.

This was honestly the first TV show in years that I looked forward to each week. The story was interesting, the characters grew on you, and unlike shows like Lost, new and interesting revelations were frequent, and the show was not bashful in showing the creatures.

It was funny, suspenseful, and had more than a few great shocks (the fishing boat scene at the end of episode 2, Rich and Laura watching the old film and finding out something very odd about one of the villains later in the series, just to mention a few).

This was the first TV show I've ever bought for DVD, because I enjoyed watching it that much. The show is given short shrift even here -- the only bonus stuff is a marginally-interesting short featurette, and deleted scenes that were deleted for a reason, as they didn't really add much.

I would love to see a continuation, whether it was a new season, a miniseries, a movie, or even a book, but I won't hold my breath. Still, this was a great series, and it deserves to be watched.
