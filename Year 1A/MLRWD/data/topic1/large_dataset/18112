Going to keep this simple. What I love about this DVD:

1. Jackie has created several mini combos for the entire body, where she combines two moves that work different muscle groups together. You switch back and forth, first one move, then the second, and repeat. This allows you a brief rest between reps without having to stop. I love when trainers do this. Keeps the pace up, but doesn't kill your arms and legs, allowing me to actually finish the routine.

2. Jackie shows you the entire move before beginning each set. I love being able to watch the move first. That way, I don't feel like I have to play catch up as I scramble to learn a new move.

3. Simple, effective strengthening routine. No fancy, elaborate moves. What I love about Jackie is that she knows that form, continuous movement, and a large number of reps is what gets results, not difficult moves that people who are already in shape could pull off.

Love Jackie. Will always buy her DVDs.
