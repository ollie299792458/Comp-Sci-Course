A thoroughly enjoyable contemporary re-imagining of "Pride and Prejudice" (via Helen Fielding's novel), which is actually more faithful to the satirical spirit of Austen than many previous adaptations have been.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger plays the introspective, thirtysomething Bridget Jones: physically, professionally and romantically dissatisfied, and saddled with a humiliating family.  The tale of her romantic and professional misadventures - and ultimate victory - will have you cringing and crying with laughter at the same time.  In any other year, Zellweger might actually have secured the Oscar for this role.  Not only did she display incredible physical commitment in mastering a British accent and packing on real pounds to play the part, she perfectly captures the endearing insecurity of the contemporary woman along with its necessary antidote - a bedrock of self-respect which has her rejecting the kind of man who thinks he can always have her (Hugh Grant), and hanging on for the one she really wants (Colin Firth).  Helen Fielding's novel has been brilliantly adapted - improved, even - thanks mainly to the peerless comic flair of co-writer Richard Curtis.  Where the book eventually slipped into a dull repetitiveness (which I suppose one could argue is deliberately emblematic of the lifestyle it portrays), the film is more focused, more funny, and knows precisely when to call it a day.  First-time director Sharon Maguire directs with remarkable confidence, revealing a great eye and ear for gags.  This is, quite simply, a perfect comedy.  They don't come any better than this - either side of the Atlantic.
