The first thing i noticed when watching this was the sound, from the first scene on the train you can see what kind of amazing sound quality and thrills awaited as saya stepped off the train.

  Many people complain this film was too short, i agree, but not in the 'this film sucks because it is too short' way. There have been many films that have been short in length yet deep in every other aspect, and this is one of those films.

there is little back story to the characters and information is dripped through slowly. But that is one of the parts that make this such a brilliant film. The storyline is not handed to you on a silver platter, you must peive together bits of information and decide for yourself what you think is the true meaning of his film.

  Now onto the animation quality, and its in an entire league of its own. There have been many animation productions which combined computer graphics with polished anime but none have surpassed the seamless blending and amazing graphics of Blood: the last vampire. One such victim was Metropolis (hopefully spelt correctly), the graphics were amzing and the animation qulity good but the two never combined well and they just looked odd. Blood on the othr hand used intense and detailed shading and lighting effects to create an almost imaculate mix of computer graphics and anime.

  Overall i was morew than happy with hthis film. Those looking for an indepth epic will be dissapointed, yet revived when they realise the masterpeice this film is. This is one of those films where you must have a sequel, it was like the matrix when neo became the one and so many new directions for the story to steer towards awoke. All i can do is hope the geniuses who created this have enough courage to take up the muse and pen and create another amazing sequel.

In short, read the review title.
