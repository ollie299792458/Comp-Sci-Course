Friends & grown kids kept telling me-watch this show. In August I rented Season 1.  After the 1st three episodes, I was completely HOOKED! OMG!! LOL!! I have finished all 3 seasons and am now getting Showtime to watch Season 4 - LOL!  Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought I would like this show...  I rank it up there with Classic Star Trek, Dark Shadows and Firefly :) In fact I was a big fan of CSI: Las Vegas, but sorry CSI, Dexter is way, WAY BETTER!!!  The writing, plot, twists and turns are absolutely ingenious! And Dexter, God bless him, you can't help but like him....despite his Dark Passenger :)  I used to work in a courthouse years ago and this show has brought back great memories of my time there.  We didn't have people cursing as much as on the show, but the characters certainly remind me of some of the people I used to work with - it was a great job. :) Seasons 1 and 2 are my favorites, but Season 3 was really good too.  Can't wait to see Season 4!!! I highly recommend this show.  I rarely watch tv shows or serials (movies are my thing), but this show really is exceptional - Dexter, I'm your #1 fan, Buddy :) LOL
