This is one of those rare types of film...a perfect film for a wide variety of audience. A beautiful, historic love story, with a heroic Tristan (Franco)and a beautiful, timeless Isolde (Myles) a lushly filmed epic, complete with some fantastic sets and characters...and thundering, rousing entertainment.

  So why was it so passed over?

  I don't know...much like I don't know where we go when we die. What I do know is this is one helleva film, all the way around. Filmed in Ireland and the Czech Republic (Like New Zealand, the new film hot spot)...with a perfect cast, David O'Hara as the brooding Irish King is worth the price of admission alone...Rufus Sewell, a very under rated and powerful actor is splendid as the strong yet sympathetic King Marke, who is a good man and thus makes the story even more bittersweet...and a very nice Anne Dudley (Pushing Tin) soundtrack. Extra's are superb, with two running commentaires from the Screenwriter, Dean Georgaris and the Executive Producer, Jim Lemley and the Co-Producer, Anne Lai. I could see a tie to the 1965 film, The War Lord...both in the stories and the need to create a stunning film on a less than stunning budget...it's really very nicely done!

  See it...and read the legend. This is a timeless story and all involved should be heartily congratulated. Considering this was presented by the Scott Brothers I would've expected far better treatment. Please do not miss this film...in fact Champion it if you can...it's that good!
