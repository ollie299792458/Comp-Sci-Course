This is a wonderful, simple, short tale about a boy from Seoul who goes to live with his mute grandmother. He greatly disrespects her and treats her like garbage, but she continually cooks for him and makes sure he has blankets to sleep with at night, displaying her unconditional love for him, despite his temper and obnoxious ways. The movie is also a tale of first love, as the young boy, Sang-Woo, develops a crush on a neighborhood girl. Though Sang-Woo feels out of place and upset due to his sudden move from urban Seoul to the unnamed country town where his grandmother lives, he gradually adjusts to life there and develops a love for his grandmother. The actors in the film, especially the grandmother and her elderly friends, do not seem like actors at all. In fact, it's quite possible that they are not, as the grandmother herself had never even seen a movie in her entire life! She was 78 years old at the time this movie was filmed. I was an Asian Studies major in my undergraduate years, and know how to read, write and speak basic Korean. The really adorable part about the grandmother's letters to the boy towards the end of the film is that she only learns how to write "I'm sick" and "I miss you", and that she makes a spelling error that is very common amongst young Korean children learning their native language, and a mistake that foreigners learning Korean often make. This movie is warm, gentle, touching, and I cried a lot. It is one of the best films made in the last two or three decades. I highly recommend seeing this movie. Although Amazon.com is asking for 70 dollars for a new copy of the film on dvd, this is not actually that ridiculous of a price. However, I will try to wait for the film to come down in price a bit, as you should too. I watched this movie with a friend in Seoul, South Korea last night, and my friend said that the movie is 100% accurate in terms of the countryside settings. I hope you check out this film as soon as possible!
