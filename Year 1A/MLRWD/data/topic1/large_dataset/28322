This is a 2 CD set that I found it at Target cheap.  CD1 is the movie itself and CD2 is chock full of a buncha extras like the story of the "actors" playing the players.  I didn't think of this before, but it's not like you can hire actors to pretend they can skate and play hockey.  The director wanted the movie to be as realistic as possible, so he had to hire a bunch of hockey players with the acting gene.

I'm not going to bother reviewing the movie because if you're even reading the reviews on this site, then you already know just how astonishgly good it is.  But I will say this much about it.  I can't believe that Disney put out such a high quality product.  That said, there are a lot of other extras on the CD that you'd probably enjoy assuming you're into the 1980 Olympics Hockey Team.  I just wish I could find a decent version of the game itself, but the only copies I've found are like $100 bucks on VHS.

Where it concerns history, the 1980 hockey game itself should already be on DVD.  It shouldn't be available only from sellers on eBay pushing a crappy, poor quality, beat up VHS tape.  But I don't expect the DVD will ever become a reality because the publisher of the DVD would have to seek the permission of the USOC and otherwise jump through ABC's copyright hoops in order to make it happen.

This inavailablity is a prime example of copyright clusterf*ck to the detriment of the culture.  I know I'm not the only guy in the world who wants this game on DVD.  But thanks to the morons in Congre$$ and their moneyed corporate taskmasters who paid them off to pass draconian copyright laws, this game will most likely deteriorate on the celluloid in its tin in a vault somewhere.  Just like all the other vintage events shot on celluloid that are languishing because copyright laws have locked down permanently what has permission to be transferred to DVD versus not. And that's your copyright 101 fundamentals o'the day.
