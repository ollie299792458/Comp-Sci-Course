Superbad is a fun movie with some gross out humor but some really classic moments as well.  If you are into the original American Pie style of movies or the National Lampoon style of movies then you should definitely check out Superbad.

On the video side, Superbad is presented on Blu-ray in a 1080p AVC MPEG-4 encode on a dual layer BD disc (50GB).  The picture is extremely clean and sharp and the colors really are bright and pop through nicely.  A small number of parts seemed a little soft for my liking which is the reason for a four star rating.  The sound contains a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack and a PCM soundtrack.  Both had very similar quality to my ears and both are lossless so if you have a method of listening to these tracks then use it.
