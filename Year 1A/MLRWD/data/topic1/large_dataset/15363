Do not let the price fool you, this is a high-quality concert! Rarely have I seen a live concert DVD (or video) with this quality. The picture, the sound, and OH! Cyndi Lauper's performance!

The songs she sings on this DVD are as follows:

At Last--Which she performs with amazing talent and strength.

Stay--A nice song with a great story before she begins to sing.

I Drove All Night--She performs this one brilliantly.

If You Go Away--Good song.

All Through The Night--She sings it great live-which is hard to imagine.

Walk On By--Very well done.

Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood--Outstanding performance!

She Bop--A slower version of the song, and done with a new kind of attitude.

Sisters Of Avalon--A good song from one of my favorite albums!

Change Of Heart--She really gets into this one with the foot stomping!

True Colors--Great, great, great!

Shine--Vocals are always strong, and on this one-brilliant!

It's Hard To Be Me--Nice story at the beginning, and she gets into this one a lot too.

Money Changes Everything--OUTSTANDING!

Unchained Melody--This has to be a hard song to sing live, but she pulled it off. It shows her vocal talent, and she is superb.

Time After Time--One of her biggest hits, and the song is done great!

Girls Just Want To Have Fun--She seems to be enjoying herself!

DON'T GET ME WRONG--every single song on this album is great-brilliant! I gave a list of the songs she sings, and what I thought of each song. She is truly a remarkable entertainer, and she proves it on this DVD. Anyone who is interested in her music should buy this DVD!
