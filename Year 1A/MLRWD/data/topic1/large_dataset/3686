I just watched this via Amazon Prime and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're a Steve Coogan fan, which I am primarily due to 24 Hour Party People and the other smaller roles I've seen him in in American movies (I've yet to see that Alan Partridge character that everybody in England seems to know him from), then I think you'll enjoy it also. If you're not a Steve Coogan fan, I think this movie will make you one. I didn't know Steve's sidekick in this movie - Rob Brydon - at all, but all he had to do was throw one of his impressions in and he had me. Coogan's good, Brydon's good, together they're good. I can imagine the two of them trading barbs on the synergy of their greater selves, just as they tackled so many topics during their trip from childhood traumas to Wine.

Besides Coogan's (and Brydon's) banter, there's great scenes of Northern England and a great soundtrack (mostly) by Michael Nyman. There are no new Nyman tunes, but the ones they use are wonderful. I've heard from a friend and the other postings for this movie that the commentary and other scenes are just as good so I think I'll be getting the DVD to watch those. Unless Amazon Prime has bonus scenes available. I've never investigated that before, but this movie was so good I'm investigating that.

I almost feel like watching it again, but I'll save that for another time.

You'll have a very enjoyable trip with The Trip.
