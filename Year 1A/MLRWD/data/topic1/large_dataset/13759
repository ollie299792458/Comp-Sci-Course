Errol Morris shows himself to be a master filmmaker - a great director, of storytelling, talent, photography, and editing. His film, "Mr. Death" is, to me, a "perfect" film. It's a singular work by one man (Mr. Morris), so consistent in his directorial, visual and editorial presentation, that no other filmmaker of the past or present (except perhaps Sydney Pollack, or Martin Scorcese) can touch him for being able to deliver a mood. With "Mr. Death", Mr. Morris shows himself to be so much more talented than egomaniacal directors with big budgets like James Cameron, for example. The film "Mr. Death" is great because, like the individual whose story is told, the film is perfectly off-center, running exactly parallel to everyday life. There's no doubt that Mr. Morris is a genius. With "Mr. Death", Mr. Morris does exactly what filmmaking needs someone to do - tell the strangest possible story with feature film-mood-quality in an editorially documentary style. Anyone who backs this guy's next project is doing filmmaking, and the art of social commentary a favor.
