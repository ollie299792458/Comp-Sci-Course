We liked this movie for a light Saturday date night w/popcorn in front of the TV. The best laughs, in my opinion, come from the moments that catch you off guard---the little subtle gestures like when the cousin shows up with his hair in a towel after sneaking into the coveted bath at a swanky birthday party. The least funny were the really juvenile jokes showing body fluids. It was almost as if two people wrote the movie---one going for subtle and one going for over-the-top-in-your-face.

At the same time, there are some quite serious moments. The music slows and swells (the soundtrack is really schizophrenic), and the main character (fat boy) seems to be going through some real heartbreak. Parts of the movie are quite touching, but then it goes back to over-the-top silliness again. They also could have made the story more plausible---why did he have only 3 weeks to train? Why not make it 8 weeks or something that would have made a bit more sense?

My advice would be to rent it and just go with the dumb jokes and take what you can from the rest.  Hugh Grant and his crew would have done a better job (think how smoothly 4 Weddings flows), but this is still worth the cost of admission.
