I don't have a TV as I live in a small apartment, so I watch on Hulu, but last night I got tired of seeing the same Charter commercials over and over and over, so I thought I'd surf on over to Crackle and see what they had to offer. They don't have nearly as much stuff as Hulu, but the commercials are a lot shorter and they're different.

On the site, I typed in comedy in their search engine and "Zombie Strippers" came up among the que of thumbnails and I clicked on it and two minutes into it, I was hooked.

At first I thought, "B movie." Then I thought "Great Movie." Okay, so it was a bit hokey and the girls were maybe more naked longer then they had to be, but the blood, the gore, the special effects, Wowie, zowie, was that all great.

And okay, maybe the acting wasn't top notch, but it was plenty good enough by everybody in the movie. If this isn't a cult classic, it should be. I know I'm going to watch it again tonight with my boyfriend. And I'll probably watch it again this weekend with my girlfriends, because this deliciously sadistic movie is already a cult classic at my house.
