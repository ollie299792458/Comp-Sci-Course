Back to the future is a combination of every time travel movie ever made.  This movie contains "kick butt" extras and amazing facts straight from Universal.  They take you behind the scenes so well that it makes you want to watch it over and over and over again.  I also learned some facts I did not even notice like at the beginning there is a clock that has an old man hanging from the hands.  This signifies the ending.  Einstein's clock reads 1:21 am and the car needs 1.21 "jigawatts" of electricity.  Marty runs over 1 of the twin pine tree when he meets old man Pebody and this changes the name, Twin Pines Mall to Lone Pines Mall!  Also Old Man Pebody's son is named Sherman.  If you have seen Rocky and Bullwinkle than you know Mr. Pebody (a dog) and Sherman (a boy) were time travelers.  Pretty cool huh?  I also found out that in an early script the Time Machine was going to be a refrigerator but the director thought that kids might get stuck in the fridge so it did not work out.  This DVD colletion is truely amazing and is a "have to have" set.  And Im sorry for my lack of spelling.
