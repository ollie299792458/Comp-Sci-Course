Half Light is a terrific "sleeper" of a movie and ranks among the best of its' kind with others such as "The Changling" and "Ghost Story".  Beautifully done on what seems to be a well-endowed budget, excellent performances by its' actors, a sound track which was originally composed for the movie by a true music composer, and an intriguing storyline, the movie is played out against the background of a Scottish fishing village with a spooky lighthouse as its' focus point.  The protagonist, Rachel Carson{played by Demi Moore} is an acclaimed and successful mystery writer who takes up residence in the seaside fishing village to attempt to undo the writer's block which was caused by the untimely and needless death of her only son.  Haunting appearances and messages left by her son, a clairvoyant woman who claims to be able to see her dead son walking behind her, and a brief love affair with the young lighthouse keeper whom the townspeople claim had died tragically seven years ago lead Rachel to the conclusion that either she is the subject of some large conspiracy or is losing her mind.  The conclusion holds a mixture of conspiracy and actual ghostly intervention.  During the course of the story there are plenty of well done and un-telegraphed shocks which remind the viewer of exactly which genre of movie this is, namely a terrific ghost story!
