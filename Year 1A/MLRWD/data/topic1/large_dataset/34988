I just love this box set of volume 2 of MST3K. You can move pictures around and change them to other pictures. The episodes are genuine. The quality is fine, although a couple of words are not heared in the opening theme song in the episode Pod People.

So, here's a short summary of the episodes:

1) Pod People: I can feel Joel and the Bots's pain. Although, they did a hilarious job of riffing Pod People to pieces! The story follows an alien and it's murderous twin and a kid called Tommy who raises the alien and calling it Trumpy (!), and once he watched Trumpy's murderous twin killing someone, Tommy thinks Trumpy did it. Then all hell breaks loose. As Joel explains the whole movie for you, "Trumpy! You can do stupid things!" 10/10

2) Cave Dwellers: An Italian sleeper that has to do with a barbarian and his mute sidekick killing bandits to save their villiage. Lots of funny bits with Joel and the bots. Especially the opening credits skit. 9/10

3) Angel's Revenge (AKA Angel's Brigade): A 1979 yawner with a plot that rips off Charlie's Angels. I don't have anything else to say. There's an ultra hlarious skit with the bots playing cards and Mike intruding wearing a leather jacket saying, "eeeeeeeeee" and the bots have no choice but to destry him. 9/10

What do you have to do: BUY IT!!!
