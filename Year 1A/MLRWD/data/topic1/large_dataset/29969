When I saw the previews for Hart's War I thought, "Hey, this looks pretty good! WW2 from the POW's perspective, and it's not Hogan's Heroes!"  Then the movie started....
I can't say it was a terrible movie, but it lacks any real emotion. You don't feel for the characters, and frankly you don't care whether they live or die.  Bruce Willis doesn't cut it playing a commanding officer, he doesn't have the presence nor the charisma.  The rest of the cast follows suit - decent actor, wrong role.
When the movie delves into race relations (the arrival of the Tuskegee airman to the camp) circa 1940, it becomes very cliche'. The black righteous man vs. the despicable racist white man.  Not denying that this was a wrong that happened in that era, but it is getting very old and predictable the way Hollywood takes every confrontation of the sort to outrageous and dishonest levels.  
The overall plot becomes transparent about halfway thru the film and the rest of it is just playing out the string.  Not really bad, not really good. Just another film.
