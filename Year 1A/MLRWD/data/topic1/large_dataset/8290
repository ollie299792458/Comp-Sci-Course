I was going to write something "witty" in quotation marks combining this title and "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" but only to connote the fack this to me is, while not a companion piece, whatever that means, unavoidably linked, at least to Americans, as a film as well as story. Briefly as well as personally, I enjoyed this one more. OK, "Eternal Sunshine" is the better movie as a whole. But I liked this one more. For one thing, "Et. Sun" didn't have that one laff-out-loud moment (for me!) that "Science" did, which was the time-machine bit where he grabbed/kissed her twice because "one was in the future and one was in the present"....  --Getting down to it, this one shares the same flaws as its predecessor: it feels like a longer film-length than it is. It's toward the end it starts to bore, like a wonderful drug experience that you just want to see some exhilarating conclusion to and somehow wake up next morning and never quite recover . . . which is I suppose entirely appropriate; pththththththbthbthbthbth.... This is a beautiful film that should never have aimed toward some romantically clean resolution, -- which it didn't. However, the very "quirkiness", for lack of a better adjective, which deliciously sets this film apart throughout the first two-thirds of the film, are highlighted to the great disadvantage of story, emotion, and engagement, in the final. I for one am left with a sense that the main character has betrayed himself in pursuing a course that identifies dream with escape instead of enhancement.  --Not to mention he ends up a whining little *&%$#@!
