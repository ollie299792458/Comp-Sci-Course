I remember going to see The Black Hole at the drive-in when I was five years old, but I had to wait until I was 28 before I could see it again.  By that time I was an FX gunkie, actually due mostly to seeing this film, and the movie floored me all over again with some of the most incredible film techniques to hit the big screen ever.

Keep in mind, this movie is a case of some of the most horrid script-writing you will ever see in sci-fi . . . the only cut I can think of that beats it is the Star Wars Holiday Special (yes, the writing is THAT bad).  But if you are a space fan, or like me watch high-tech movies not to be wowed but to see if you can figure out how it is done, this is a MUST OWN for your collection.  Many of the special effects that have become commonplace in filmmaking were done in this film for the very first time, including the development of a new camera that ended up being used in several shots of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, as well as several films after (as a matter of fact, considering The Black Hole and Star Wars were in production at the same time, you will be shocked at how much better the effects are in The Black Hole; I can't help but think what Star Wars would have been if this crew had worked for Lucas instead).  And the U.S.S. Cygnus is quite simply, in my very humble opinion, the single most gorgeous ship ever.

Do NOT pass this one by.  Yes, you will be groaning, but you will also be amazed at what Disney could do before the advent of computer animation.
