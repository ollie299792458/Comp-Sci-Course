I have had the priviledge of watching the worst film ever. It was Plan 9 from Outer Space, by Ed Wood. It was brilliant. Ed Wood took no money, no talent, no acting ability, no coherance and no plot and turned it into the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, meanwhile, took millions of dollars, reasonable (I'll go no further) talent and acting ability, and no coherence or plot, and churned out the worst pile of crap I have ever had the misfortune to be in the same room as.
From the moment the film opens, you know your braincells are doomed. The idiocy-rays beaming from the screen penetrate through your eyes and you suffer the anguished screams of your braincells dying as all logic is stripped away.
And despite what anyone else says, I was resolutely unattracted to the Angels; I find it impossible to like someone whose idea of a snappy line is 'Just once I'd like to leave a bar by the door.' Throughout the movie you can hear the original Angels spinning in their graves. And if they're not dead, this movie will kill them off.
