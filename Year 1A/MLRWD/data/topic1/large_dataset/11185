I saw this movie years ago, either on VHS, cable, or while I was at college, and it was a while after it was originally released at the movie theater. I seem to remember that the version I saw was rated R, so I'm assuming that that version was close to (or the same as) the official theatrical release. The version I saw was a masterpiece by any standards.

Now I may be totally wrong about this, but this DVD version from Shout Factory seems to be edited, censored, or whatever you want to call it. If it's been chopped up, then it's also a big disappointment, considering that this was an exceptionally fine motion picture in its original form. So what's the deal, Shout Factory - has this movie been edited in any way? If so, then are you guys going to release the original cut of the film, or is this what we have to live with?

P.S. I rented this movie first from a local video rental outfit. If anyone has a copy of (or vividly remembers seeing) an uncut version, I'd be interested in reading your opinions about this re-release. Personally I'm going to wait and see before I put out good money for this DVD. Totally unacceptable.
