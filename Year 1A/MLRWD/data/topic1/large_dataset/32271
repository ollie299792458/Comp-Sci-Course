In the 80's I grew up hooked on the ninja fad.  I watched every cheesy ninja movie that I could find in the video store and Sho Kosugi was my idol.  That being said I still enjoy watching martial arts/ninja films now just as much as when I was a kid.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade fits right in with your typical ninja film.  Basic premise, two main ninja clans in 17th Century Japan must each pick their 5 best warriors to compete against each other in a race to appease the Emperor.  In order to appreciate this film you need to understand that the Japanese code of honor is very strict.  If that means killing your lover to appease the Emperor, so be it.  Of course at the heart of the story (no pun intended) is a typical Romeo and Juliet relationship but honestly that's not really why people watch ninja movies!  You want to see cool martial arts moves and lots of killing.  Shinobi Heart Under Blade delivers most of what you want, just not enough of it.  My thoughts;

Pros

+ Plenty of unique ninjas all with their own special skills/powers to differentiate them.

+ Story adheres to traditional Japanese beliefs in the code of honor and that the Emperor is near divine.

+ Beautiful cinematography.

+ Great fight scenes (albiet way too short).

Cons

- Nearly all of the 5 chosen ninjas from each clan die way to quickly, many having very cheap and unsatisfying deaths.  A huge loss in the story honestly.

- Absolutely no back story on any of the ninjas skills, training or upbringing.  Just slight mentions.

- Action sequences are extremely slim.  They spend way too much time focusing on the love story than they do the fight sequences, which in my opinion is what the majority of people watching this movie want to see.

- Master's of both clans must fight to the death yet there's absolutely no scene in the film of it.  Very disappointing!

While I did really enjoy the movie it could have been so much better had more content been included.  It felt more like a drama than an action movie.  Whether or not that's what the director wanted I'm not sure, but the movie loses a star because of it.  If they had simply put more action and backstory on the main characters I would have easily given the film 5 stars.  If you're into martial arts/ninja films it's definitely worth a watch.
