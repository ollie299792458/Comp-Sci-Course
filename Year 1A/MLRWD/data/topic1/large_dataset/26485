You know how, in a good movie, the camera will move to a group of people who are laughing at what was just said, but that we didn't hear?  In this movie, they make the mistake of showing us those conversations, followed by uproarious laughter...but they aren't funny.  It's symbolic of this movie.  Each character/situation is presented in a way that it's obvious what reaction you are supposed to have, but it just doesn't work.

Meryl Streep:  Just wants her dream kitchen.  Odd, the first time we see her existing kitchen, it's a long shot moving into a huge, beautifully lit, perfectly appointed kitchen in her home.  The discussions of the dream kitchen are simply shoved in there to give the Steve Martin character a reason to exist, but it's jarringly amateurish.

Alex Baldwin:  Over the top, hammish acting...but I liked him anyway.  His character had no depth, no nuance, simply one dimensional, but he was in fact funny.

John Krasinski:  Tiny part.  Best acting, most believable character, most reliable source of humor.

Steve Martin:  Wasted.  And, what's up with his face?

Not a good movie.  Not without any laughs, hence the two stars instead of one.
