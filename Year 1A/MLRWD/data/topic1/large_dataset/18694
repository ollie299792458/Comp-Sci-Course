This film was a complete surprise for me. I found out, after watching it, that it is based on a novel written by Lisa See. I myself have never read this book so I was quite in the dark. From the very start I was enchanted with this movie and it stayed with me until the very end. If you are going to watch this film make sure you have a box of tissues handy for this film has very intense moments. The film is divided into three different time periods, yet is not in anyway confusing. As you travel through 19th century China you meet Lilly and Snow Flower, brought up together by an arranged Chinese friendship, due to an old Chinese ritual. Back in the 90's, Nina and Sophia, descendants of Lilly and Snow Flower who are childhood friends also grow up together in their more modern way. There is also the present, as when later as adults, Nina and Sophia lose touch with one another until a tragedy teaches one that the bond and love of friendship is more important than anything else in life. The beautiful scenery filmed in Shanghai is amazing and the music is beautiful. Even after watching the special features and listening to how it was filmed, it still left me breathless. I loved how the old Chinese tale was woven with the more contemporary parts of the film. The film goes back and forth amongst the two different generations, however I found the 19th Century parts of the film more emotional and interesting. This is a film for one to share with ones daughters, sisters and anyone with whom one may share that special bond with. It also makes a great gift. This film will be forever in my heart.
