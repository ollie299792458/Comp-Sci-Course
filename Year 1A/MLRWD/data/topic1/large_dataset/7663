"Independence Day" has to be one of my favourite movies of all time. The story is about aliens invading our sordid planet but the director has a deeper meaning in store for us in this classic film. For example, when the President of the United States was giving encouragement to the people of the world, he said that he demands independence not just for America but for the whole world from the aliens. His speech of world unity in the face of catastrophic crisis is an inspiration for world peace. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons in this film is a reminder to the viewers that weapons of mass destruction can be useful if used correctly. The film "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7OI8">Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)</a>" also gives the audience a similar view.

Lastly, the comic element of this film brings about a sense of comedy in this 'serious' message the film is trying to convey to the viewers. Will Smith's acting is superb as usual and I would definitely recommend this film to UFO fans and fans of Will Smith. A MUST watch.
