The original Clash of the Titans (1981) is perhaps best known as Ray Harryhausen's last movie.  The film is often maligned, but it is truly representative of Harryhausen's skills as an animator and a must-have for lovers of cheesy fantasy films.  Starring a young Harry Hamlin as toga-wearing demigod Perseus, a weathered Lawrence Olivier as Zeus, and a bevy of famous actresses as the goddesses, the film wasn't much of a stickler for historical detail.  Nowhere in Greek legend, for instance, does one encounter a giant, city-destroying sea monster called the Kraken (for that, you have to look to Scandinavian folklore).  Nor, for that matter, does a scene-stealing mechanical owl named Bubo appear in any of the ancient scrolls of Homer or Hesiod.  Even back in the 1980s, the movie was considered by many to be a B-grade hunk of feta.  Still, Ray Harryhausen's masterful stop-motion effects made it popular among young moviegoers and turned it into a cult classic almost overnight.

In short, the original Clash of the Titans is not a great movie, but it's certainly a good movie, especially if you have a sweet tooth for trippy giant scorpions, tantrum-throwing Greek gods, ripsnorting sea monsters, and acting that's as broad as the river Styx.  Harry Hamlin's Perseus is a bit of a pouty pretty boy, but his performance is still far more enjoyable than Sam Worthington's in the recent 3D remake.
