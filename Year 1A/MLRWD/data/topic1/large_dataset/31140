A bit about me I am 30 and I love old Hollywood glamor. And what could be more glamorous than Norma Shearer??
Well the rest of the cast looks great too. This very unique film is an all female cast (even the animals are female only. Yet this story of adultery and actually enjoyable catty women (there cattiness is cleaver and witty) is not based on only women. The men in their lives are very prominently. And though not shown on screen you will imagine these guys interacting with these women with vivid detail. I just can not describe this very cleaver film enough to do it justice. I had no idea about the all female cast when I first saw it, and I am glad I might have thought it was a cheap gimmick. Trust me it works. Only truly wonderful writing could make this seem as if there are male parts in it. You forget that there aren't, and might not even notice it was a female only cast if I hadn't told you. 
This film is marvelous and glamorous and you would want to be as beautiful as Mary Haines (actress Norma Shearer) herself.
Gorgeous clothes and wonderful lives... the way Classic old Hollywood Studios can make us wish desperately that they were our  lives. 
This is a film to be seen over and over. It is very funny, cleaver, and a sheer delight. I am not a girly girl type of gal I prefer Sci Fi and Action films, but my one weakness is well made classic films. And this is definitely one! Buy your copy, I did. :o)
