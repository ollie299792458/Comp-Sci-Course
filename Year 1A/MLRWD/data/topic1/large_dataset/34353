I got the blu-ray/dvd combo pack so I could watch the movie on all my players including my phone.  In order to play it on my phone I have to convert it on my computer, but my HP Vista computer will not even read the DVD side or recognize that anything has been put into the drive.  My old Sony Vaio reads it fine but I don't have a DVD converter program on that and don't want to spend another $40 to get a license for one.  Not even sure the old Windows XP would work with the program.  The blu-ray is great, you can see every freckle, wrinkle, etc.  The movie itself is awesome as well, much better than New Moon (I am in the Edward camp and there was not much of Edward in New Moon).  But I am wishing I had just bought the single disc DVD and to heck with the blu-ray.  I paid more money for a product I can't use for the purpose for which it was purchased.  **UPDATE 12/21...After rebooting my pc a couple of times the DVD drive finally recognized the DVD side and I was able to convert it to my phone.  I can't help but think this is due to the 2 sided disc which means you always end up with fingerprints on a playing surface.  I don't think I will buy any single disc Blu Ray/DVD combos any more.
