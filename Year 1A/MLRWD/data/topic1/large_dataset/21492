This movie is embarrassingly bad and deserves every poor review it got when it first came out. I find it embarrassing to turn it on again having watched it for the first time a couple weeks ago and will throw out the DVD. The movie had really bad production values and seemed like a TV movie. All the acting is below par except for Kevin Costner, the script is LUDICROUS and makes light of the sister character's death, which defies belief. Whitney Houston's costumes are bizarre and not of that time or any time, something the director cooked up for no discernible reason except to objectivize her. There's nothing realistic about the actress' side of life, they tried to make the bodyguard activities realistic. You'd think they would have put more into the details of her life, but they made it super cheesey, gave her unbelievable, super naive employees, and convenient but unconvincing relatives. She doesn't seem that committed to her career, has no problems or issues to deal with other than safety, and it's hard to believe she'd be up for any award whatsoever, let alone a best acting award. The relationship between Houston and Costner is unpleasant, boring, and they have no chemistry.

The director and writer deserve the blame for this movie and watching them on the DVD extra features they don't come off very well. Based on this movie they should stop making them.

Whitney Houston could have performed far better had she directed by the right director. She's OK in a couple of scenes where she gets to show her desire to be with Kevin Costner. He doesn't seem to like her even when he does. Dopey.
