"The Message", or as it's called in Arabic "Ar-Risalah," is one of the all-time classic movies about religion and faith, and it's my all-time favorite. As a Muslim growing up in America, I had very little knowledge about my own faith until this movie came along. This movie taught me to be proud of my heritage and reinvigorated my life, thank God. Partly as a result of this movie, I became a religious Muslim on November 1, 1995. The beautiful part of the movie is that it taught peace and spirituality as well as self-defense, not the violent terroristic murder practiced by the extremists nowadays. This movie shows Islam the way it's supposed to be, and the Arabic version, even though English is my first language, is better than the English version because the Arabic-speaking actors played their parts with passion and seemed to care more about their roles, probably because Islam is their faith, and they have a point to make about their faith with this movie. The desert scenes were well-done, despite the weather challenges, and everything was done according to the approval of Al-Azhar University in Cairo and the Shi'a gathering body in Lebanon, which makes the film stay within the boundaries of the faith, which is good for relieving any worries of the more conservative Muslims. All-in-all, a great movie, especially for non-Muslims who want to learn about Islam.
