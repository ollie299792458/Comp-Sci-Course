For me, Latter Days is a very important piece of gay cinema (for me at least), because it tackles one of the most controversial subjects: Mormonism.  Not only that, but it's a great romance flick.  This one may be too much for every audience to enjoy, especially straight MORMON audiences that still follow the teachings of their gospel, or the religiously conservative.  For them, this film will feel like a stab through the heart, and a total insult.  For some, it should be a wake up call.  Mormon missionaries in gay denial do exist.  The fact that they find out on their mission: It exists too.  The fact that they finally give into it on their mission: Happens more than you think.

Latter Days is a very realistic portrayal of a mormon boy who finally realizes he is gay through the help of a very special person while on his mission to convert people into the mormon religion, and it hits hard to home for me because I was raised mormon, and was in denial for the first 15 years of my life, because my religion said it was wrong and I would go to hell for it.  Thankfully, the grasps of religion no longer have their hold on me, and what you see in the film, like the torture sequences his parents end up doing on him after they find out about their son, actually really happens.  The bigotry of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is also very accurately portrayed as well.

I'd recommend this film to anyone, just maybe not active mormons, you know, because you don't want one of their bishops or high priests showing up at your door asking why you trying to convert one of their members out of the church...or maybe you do?
