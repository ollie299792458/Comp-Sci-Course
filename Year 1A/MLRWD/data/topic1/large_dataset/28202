Creepshow 2 is just as good as Creepshow 1 was. Although Creepshow 1 had a slightly more comic book feel to it, Creepshow 2 still delivers the goods. There's gore, don't worry. The first story "Old Cheif Woodenhead" is a good story about two men and their leader(who is a son of a father that is in an indian tribe). Their leader is named Sam. ... They rob an old couples store(which has a statue at the front called Cheif Woodenhead). Sam's father gave the old couple stones that are worth thousands of dollars, because the old couple were running out of money. ... I liked this story alot.
  "The Raft" is about 4 teens terrorized by a man-eating muddy thing in a lake, and "The Hitchhiker is about a woman being terrorized by a man she hit with her car accidentally and drove off without reporting it.
  My favorite was "The Raft" because it was scary,funny, the acting was very good, and it had an awsome TWIST ENDING! I liked this moive very much. "The Hitchhiker" was creepy too, but the scariest one is "The Raft"! You have got to see this movie! The DVD is excellent!
