Joseph Campbell could never have envisioned this when he published his treatise, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces."  But here's a television series where week after week after week, we watched THAT EXACT SAME outline unfold against a different backdrop, and we loved every second of it: the journey, the call to action, the successful first try, the dark Cambellian cave (where the guys usually created a military arsenal out of pitchforks and stuff) from which the heroes rise up with the newfound power (or half-thrown together quasi-military equipment and a classic Pensor movement)to vanquish the antagonist and live to fight another day.
I do like how the late George Peppard's character pays frequent tribute to the man for whom he was namesake: Hannibal (*NOT* the cannibal, no this was the guy who took on the Romans with Elephants).  Overall, it was a fun series if you could get past the fact that you were watching the EXACT SAME story again and again.  (At least till the final season, where they all became CIA spies working for Robert Vaughn.)
