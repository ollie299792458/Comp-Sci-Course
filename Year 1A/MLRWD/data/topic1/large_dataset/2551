I have a Grandaughter who now is in college ,a music major...she and I have had so much fun watching musicals all through her growing up years, and this musical is our ''favorite'',...to this day,we can't have a lodging place without a copy. We first started out watching it on  VHS...The music,choreography,story,actors,are fantastic...we know every song by heart .. :) If you are Musical loving people like we are,you'll enjoy it as much as we do still.For us ,..it's a classic.Just like one of the songs sings,..''When you're in love,really in love,...there is no way on earth to hide it." So ,hop in your lounging clothes,get the popcorn popping,and share the love with a sweet somebody. Watching great musicals has had a part in our grandaughters love of singing, and theater,and then going on to be majoring in music in college. But those fun, wrapped up in a warm throw,popcorn powered movie nights with a loved one ..are the best :),also, ordering  movies from Amazon is easy,efficient,fast,and I love the way they notify you when there's a great deal on ones you are interested in. :
