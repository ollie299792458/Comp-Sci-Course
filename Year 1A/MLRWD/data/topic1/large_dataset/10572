I lived in Chicago for several years and I would often visit friends in Cabrini Green. My familiarity with those housing projects is what made "Candyman" more than just a movie to me. This movie not only had a unique story line, but by movie's end you are not one hundred percent sure if Candyman committed the murders of if Virginia Madsen's character did. This ambiguity, this vagueness is what lends realism to a movie that I consider to be the best of the genre. Tony Todd, a long-time underestimated actor, gives a sterling performance as the baritone voiced "creature." Testimony to the movies greatness can be evidenced by the lack of long, drawn out dialogue on Candyman's part: "Be my victim," "come to me" and other short, blood curdling statements sufficed. An important note: this movie's premise is that Candyman, as a young artist, fell in love with a white girl, the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. The plantation owner would have none of that, and sent henchmen to murder the young man. As part of the torture, they not only cut off the hand that he sketched his pictures with, but they also brought in bees that stung him until he hwas dead. The legend kicked in: if you look in the mirror and say "Candyman" three times, he will appear. BUt did he? One need only understand how sick this society is, and the existence of the anti-miscegenation laws that prevented interracial interaction, to know that such a premise not only could exist, but twas played out in this country's history. Virginia Madsen's performance is incredible, as is that of newcomer Kasi Lemons. I recommend this movie without reservation.
