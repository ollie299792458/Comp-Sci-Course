I've tried to find a copy of Howard Breslin's short story to round out the sense of dissatisfaction I found with this film.  Thus far, BAD DAY AT HONDO appears to out of print, but the next best thing is the shooting script which is available online.  A side-by-side comparison of script and film reveals a great many omissions and revisions that make for a kind of open-source experience, and many of the peculiarities in the film are justified in the script.  I believe the longer film would have been significantly better, but the one we have is Plenty-stimulating.
Dore Schary also produced GO FOR BROKE, a 1951 film that tells the very poignant tale of 442nd RCT Japanese-American volunteer GIs in Italy and France, and works as a fine prequel to BLACK ROCK by grounding Macreedy's rationale for coming to a hostile, flyspeck cowtown (where you'll never see a horse) and probing buried animosities until they gush with fresh blood.
The very literate script for BLACK ROCK also brings a satisfying roundness to the dimestore loafers (Marvin and Borgnine), while making Francis necessary and every other speaking role more plausible and real, most especially Macreedy.
It WAS explosively subversive, and it still is, despite the fact that this film that bristles with subtext was meant to contain much more than was shot (or much more that was left on the cutting room floor).
I also think the score is tremendously manipulative, instructing us when and what it insists that we feel.  All in all, it's a truly fascinating Grade B Cinemascope launchpoint with a shower of rising and radiant stars
 (how many oxymorons can I pack into this sentence?)
for thought about film, politics, culture and pretty much everything!
