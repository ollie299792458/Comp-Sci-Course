Should we just consume everything Star Wars related without thought or question, nor any basis for quality or standards?

It's quite clear a this point, that the people behind these new releases, are doing their best to make them as unappealing as possible.

The attitude behind this marketing ploy is of complete disrespect...

1) They are not putting any effort into the quality of the product.

2) They are not even going to offer the basics of home video standard that the world has come to expect in 2006 with 16x9 enhanced (read: anamorphic) transfers.

3) Instead they intend to source the video from outdated laserdisc transfers from the mid-90's, which is completely unacceptable. Why not just port over the full-screen VHS image while you're saving time, money, etc?

4) Nevermind the fact that they couldn't even see fit to put the individual DVD's in a simple slip box and package the 'trilogy' as it should respectfully be offered, and as any other movie franchise collection would be in 2006... But they've even refused to offer covers that look like a minimal ammount of time was spent to design and promote these inferior discs. Despite the terrible cheap looking photoshopped covers, the aesthetics aren't that significant overall - but it's yet another strike against any thought, care or quality control being devoted to this 'throw-away' release.

So we are simply expected to purchase these DVD's because they are apparently "Limited Editions" (perhaps they want these pulled from the market as quickly as possible before anyone has time to realize and publicize on how crappy and insignificant a waste they are?) and because George Lucas and company recognize how much money they can squeeze out of consumers with anything SW related.

Not so.

Buying these discs would be the equivalent of watching non-remastered, non-anamorphic, poor quality laserdiscs that were issued 13 years ago!

So should we all simply run out and support this product by putting money in the pockets of George Lucas and the producers who so outwardly don't care about this at all?

NO!!!

I will continue to support quality products, releases, efforts, etc.

Anything else is not worth my time or hard-earned money - Regardless of who or what is behind the sale!
