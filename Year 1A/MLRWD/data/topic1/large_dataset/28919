I knew a little about the story of Elizabeth and Darcy before I saw this movie but it really got me interested in Jane Austen. I am currently reading the novel and have just finished watching the Colin Firth/A&E version and they are amazing - both the book and the movie.

The movie was funny, clever and cute. It was not a great character anaylsis nor was it meant to be. In the movie, I missed some of the seconday characters that appeared in the novel like Mr. and Mrs. Bennett and Charlotte.

I thought the casting was wonderful although I would have liked to have seen more of Mr. Bingley. I really loved the actress who played Lydia. She was so cute and funny. I also really loved the man who played Fitzwilliam Darcy. He was so good and just the perfect Darcy although no one can top Mr. Firth of course. The guy who played Mr. Collins - OMG he was hilarious ("The Lord has commanded us to multiply and replenish the earth" - LOL!) The actress who played Elizabeth I was familiar with from SUNSET BEACH and she was good too but I thought the character of Elizabeth was written too surly and snotty. Otherwise this is a good comedic version of P&P and if you like romantic comedies you'll like this.
