What could have easily been, well, a mess, instead became as intriguing as the original.  Sometimes, Hollywood needs to relax on the laurel of the success of the first movie and leave it alone.  However, I am glad that they threw that advice out of the window with BLADE II.  My worry would be that the sequel would not be as action-oriented or smartly written as the first; the common thread found in many "part two" flicks.  What I got was more action than required and a storyline that involved a group of monsters called the Reapers, a vampiric bunch that destroyed humans and vampires alike.  The best part of the movie, outside of the fight scenes, was when Blade and the vampire task force had to join forces to destroy the Reapers.  How can a team work together when distrust almost becomes stronger than the common enemy?  That interesting aspect, along with the betrayal of a cast member and the mystery of the lost and found Whisperer, made this one of the hottest movies around!
