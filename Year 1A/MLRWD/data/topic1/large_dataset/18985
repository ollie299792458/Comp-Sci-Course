Saw this movie at a store on sale for $4.00... So I was thinking "why not?", great price and its suppose to be as good as the matrix? Hell Yea!!  Well the first half hour of the movie I was very interested by the plot. Afterwards, it just started going downhill for me, the visuals were nice, but more like a cartoon. Which makes sense since they were trying to get that anime feel, but the delivery was missing something. Since the whole movie is in front of a blue screen, it was a little let down for me. The whole feel of the movie wasn't meshing well, I can't pinpoint what it was exactly. I wasn't connected or really concerned for any of the characters either. So at the end when they were showing the neo's backstories, which should've been a tearjerking moment- I was more just waitng for the movie to end. The final end reminded me of "The Fountain", the souls were traveling through the universe, only to become lighting back on earth. Well, I added a star because the overall message of the movie was genuine. One last thought, I felt this movie was long enough, too drawn out on certain parts, and not enough coverage on others...  but now I see there is another version that is even longer--- wow I wouldnt be able to make it on that one.. I get the point fully with this version.
