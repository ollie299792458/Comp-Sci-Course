Those people who bought MacGyver dvds season by season instead of
purchasing the box set missed out on two movies which were only
released in the box. Many of us are frustrated that we paid more and
supported this release only to miss out on the chance to have the
movies. I rang Paramount today, and they tell me they have a release
list as far as June, and the two movies are not on it.

However, Paramount have a dedicated line for people who want to call
and ask for dvd releases and they are keeping note of how many people
call to ask for these to be released. They are happy for you to call
them and request that the movies be released - that's what the phone
line is for.

They will ask for your name, but no other details - although you may
like to tell them if you are phoning from abroad - and they are very
friendly :-) Paramount have meetings where they discuss future
releases and the number of requests they receive is one way
they judge what the demand is. So please call!

If you would like to see the two MacGyver movies released on dvd:

1. Call Paramount on 323 956 5000 (if you are calling from outside
the US, use 001 323 956 5000).
2. Ask for "Home Entertainment" .
3. Ask politely for Paramount to release the two MacGyver movies for
people who don't have the boxset. That you want "MacGyver-Lost Treasure of Atlantis" and "MacGyver-Trail to Doomsday"
