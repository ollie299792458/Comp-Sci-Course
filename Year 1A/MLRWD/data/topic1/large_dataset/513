Well, I just watched Gamer and Whiteout the day before and was dissappointed in both movies. I read the previous reviews and do not agree at all. Of course, I'm a science fiction fan, I love Star Trek (all series and movies, with the exception of Deep Space Nine) and if you add some suspense to science fiction, I'm there. I loved the whole concept and idea behind the movie. I also love the technology diplayed as well, (movies like the new Star Trek, Deja Vu, and Alien) Who did not love the room "Mother" was in on the Nostromo. I admit, I do love when thay combine technology and use it in a new concept. The movie is worth watching just for the idea behind it. If you loved "Data" on Star Trek - TNG, you'll love this movie. I don't really critizize how actors perform in a movie, my only question in the end is "Was I entertained?" I also rate a movie on it's after effect. If I remember a movie three days after I watched it, and liked it so much I want to order it, it's a five star for me. I had to go look up the names Whiteout and Gamer becuase I could not remember the names of the movies. Not that those movies were bad. They were just OK for me. The only thing I did not like (not Ving Rhames fault, by the way) was the character he played. You would think that in the age of surrogates and modern technology I would not be seeing the minorities dressed up like Jamicans living in the 1960's or 70's. I understand what the movie was trying to convey, they are against surrogates so they must also be against technogoly. Wrong Hollywood. We all live in the 20th century and I do believe it's possible to be against surrogates but understand some technogoly works in a positive way. After all, at the end of the movie, doesn't he use technology to elminate the surrogates? You see the irony, right?
