A funny thing happened on the way to exploiting Angelina Jolie in this sort of clunky but sorta fun movie.  The camera took a look at Gerard Butler and couldn't stop. His first scene establishes him as the film's real leading character and Ms. Jolie takes a back seat despite her daring stunts.  The fact is that this is the first movie I've seen where the camera seems more interested in the leading man's face than the gorgeous, full lipped heroine's.

You know how when a steamy love scene is shot the camera usually lingers on the woman's face and the audience sees the back of the guy's head?  Some directors say that's the only way to shoot a sexy scene, because the audience wants to see how the female is taking the lovin'.  But here the camera is on Butler's face,  registering his reactions--most unusual, and when that's over and he's out of the story for a while, it's hard to get back with Lara and take an interest in what she's risking her life for.  She's really not a woman one can easily connect with.  Her Ladyship Croft maintains a lofty smile as she does her tricks without breaking a sweat.  To help her out, the bad guys are particularly klutzy.

The finale seems somehow off; maybe the director was wise to use it, though.  The alternate ending seen on the DVD extras, again puts Lara in the wrong place, and that silly camera goes right i and dares to reveal its fascination with Butler again!  An audience might have a tear for it, which is never called for in this sort of cartoonish action flick. Still, as I said, it's a bit of fun.
