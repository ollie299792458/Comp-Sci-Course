This is definitly my favorite movie! It is action packed and has a little humor in it as well. If you are into cars, then this movie is like heaven for you. 
This movie is basically based on trust and illegal street-racing. The technology in these cars are unbelieveable, and the stunts that are performed are mind-boggling. 
I have never seen so much "interesting" action in one scene in my life. I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and I bought the DVD the first day. 
Some of these cars would be anyone's dream car, but each car gets better than the previous. Whether it's the Green Eclipse or the Honda Civics.
This movie is about an undercover cop who joins a racing team in order to find out who has been robbing tractor-trailers for their electronics...
Overall, the plot is a 3 but the action/special effects are a 5+. The cars in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen in my life. I think that this movie is more for the younger crowd, it appeals to us more than adults.
