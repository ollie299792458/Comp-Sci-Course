ok, i'll put SPOILER ALERT but really, watching the end scene to this was one of the most unnerving experiences of my entire life. it's like the film ended but then a special seagall-cam actually took us inside the fat one's head and showed us his inner fantasies. he appears at the door of this house and there is this lovely young woman with two children and an older woman. who are they? good question. at no point have they appeared in the film up until now or even been mentioned. the children are dressed similarly to the children in fatso's recurring memory flashback but they're not white like the flashback children, one's chinese and one's indian!!! why? how? eh? then the children are given a present and disappear with, the housekeeper? their aunty? stevo's mother-in-law??? next thing, horrifyingly, the lovely blonde who i'd assumed must be his niece turns out to be, errrmmm, somebody he's about to have sex with anyway. god, by this stage it's as bad as walking in on your mum and dad having sex when you were young if your mum had somehow not aged at the same rate as your dad. all the time seagull has his constipated smile on his face:he is indulgent towards this performance. one small mercy, the door is closed before the full on passion starts. I'M TRULY SORRY TO HAVE TO GO ON LIKE THIS BUT I AM BUT ONE PERSON AND NO ONE PERSON SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALONE.
