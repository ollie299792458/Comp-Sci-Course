(November 1999) A Brief Personal Overview - The Wild Bunch 
I remember seeing 'The Wild Bunch' in a cinema in Dublin. I loved westerns so I went to see it. But this movie was different. I left the cinema feeling that I  had just seen a great cinema Movie... a great western.
Years have past  and recently I bought the video to revisit those times. It is evident how  well Peckinpah loved the visual image. He gave the cinema a way to alter  time and space by artfully editing multiple camera angles and intercutting  slow and normal motion. Sam Peckinpah knew how to maximise a dramatic scene  like nobody. I don't think I have ever seen, since then, movie images used  to such a dramatic extent as he used them. I feel that the bad reviews he  received then (for the violence) were unjustified and maybe stunted the  director's later works. (Perhaps Peckinpah was a little before his  time...)
Also, the acting talents of William Holden, Ernest Borgnine,  Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Warren Oates, Jaime S&aacute;nchez, Ben Johnson,  and, Emilio Fern&aacute;ndez (a wonderful performance), the cinematography of  Lucien Ballard, the music of Jerry Fielding, not to mention the rest of the  team, along with the masterful directing and editing talent of Peckinpah  produced a movie that forms a part of cinematic history, and rightfully  so.
It is a hard, violent, shocking, tragic, stylish, nostalgic,... and  as somebody said 'balladic' tale about a group of misfits cornered by time  and circumstance... but, then again, aren't we all in the same boat?
