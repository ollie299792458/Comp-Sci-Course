OK. I debated buying this for a looonng time. First of all, I have never liked dance. My mother forced me to take tap and ballet as a child and I was fat and a klutz to boot. It was traumatic. LOL..As an adult I have always avoided dance floors because I am so uncoordinated and have zero rhythm. I am nearly 47 years old, quite overweight (though I have lost 66 lbs so far in 6 months and I am going to keep on going). The reason I finally broke down and bought this is because I have been in a Tae Bo rut for quite some time. Don't get me wrong, I adore Billy Blanks, but I needed a change. I used to do Tae Kwon Do and Kickboxing and I find his workouts enjoyable due to this training. I got the PCD workout to challenge myself with something, get out of my comfort zone, and have a change of pace. I can honestly say, I LOVED THIS WORKOUT!!!! It was really easy to follow--even for an uncoordinated lady like me--and a lot of fun....I loved getting to do "naughty" moves I would never ordinarily do. The girls are sickeningly gorgeous and have perfect bodies (If one could die from envy, I would literally be dead right now over the envy I feel over their looks..LOL). Although God did not bless me with lack of weight issues, He dDID bless me with a fantastic imagination and I was able to picture myself on that stage as a PCD myself and looking like them while doing this workout....Then I had to come back to reality (bummer). On a completely serious note, I think this is a SUPER workout when you want something lighter if you usually are a hard core exerciser like myself (2 hour workouts most days...but I am in a hurry to get to a normal weight....feels like I am literally running..or punching or kicking...for my life)....I found Ms. Antin to be absolutely charming as well as the girls themselves. I felt confident vicariously through their confidence that shines through. Great workout and I am about to purchase another for my sister!!!Fun, fun, fun!!!
