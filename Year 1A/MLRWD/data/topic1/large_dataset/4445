"The Mission" was an excellent film that tells the story of the injustice that the Guarani faced in South America because of the cruelty of the Portugese and Spanish settlers.  It is a story of the Guarani people and their human rights versus the rights of the church and of the powers in Spain and Purtugal. Well casted, Jeremy Irons plays a jesuit priest who colonizes with the Guarani in order to christianize them and make their lives "better."  His mission is to salvage their humanity and protect them from the cruelties of the Spanish and Portugese crowns who wish to take over their land.  But is he really their savior?  Robert DeNiro plays the perfect role of the harsh slave trader gone good.  His determination of penance makes the audience almost feel sorry for him.  If not for the actors, watch the movie for its cinematography.  The scenery is absolutly beautiful!  The camera finds a healthy balance between nature and man's bad intention. It will teach you a lesson in history that you will not soon forget!
