Amidst the insane hype of vampire movies, books and television shows, Vampire Diaries is a stand-out in my opinion. The plotline is gripping, with more twists and turns than a roller coaster; the cast is adequate, if not stellar (although I am a bit critical of most young actors and actresses); and the overall feel of the show never fails to inspire the kind of "What could possibly happen next?" questions I love to ask myself and others.
The mythology isn't completely original, but there are some fresh spins on popular vampire lore, such as the magic rings that allow vampires to walk in sunlight. (And the fact that these vampires don't sparkle is all the better for my tastes.) While based on L.J. Smith's book series from the '90s, the show is far from loyal to the novels, which, while irksome for some fans, I'm sure, is, to me, a big improvement. (Yes, I read the books, so I know what I'm talking about.)
All in all, I find The Vampire Diaries to be an interesting, entertaining mixture of horror, action, suspense, and, of course, romance.
