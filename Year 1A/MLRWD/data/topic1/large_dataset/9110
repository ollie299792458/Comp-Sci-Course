One of the very first movies I remember seeing as a very young boy was Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein on Million Dollar Movie on WOR-TV, Channel 9 in New York, in the early '60's.  I was so enthralled with this movie, that as I got older, it easily became my favorite A&C movie...followed by Keep 'Em Flying...
This movie never fit into the continuity of the other Universal "Monster" films, as the Wolfman had actually been cured in 1945 in The House of Frankenstein.  But how wonderful to see Lugosi reprise his role of Dracula..only the second time he would play the role...the first in 1930 in the original film 'Dracula"
One thing to note is that in the laboratory battle scene, Glenn Strange, who played the Frankenstein Monster, had broken his foot, and was not the monster in these scenes.  Some say it was Lugosi and other say it was Chaney who played the Monster in these brief scenes.  Look carefully.  Both men played the Monster in previous films.
A&C Meet Frankenstein has been included in the AFI's top 100 films of all time.  Quite an accomplishment!!!!!
