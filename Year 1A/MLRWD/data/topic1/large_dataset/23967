I saw the Grave of the Fireflies two weeks ago, and I can't describe all the emotions that invaded my heart, my mind and my spirit....this is the story of a brother (Seita, 14 year's old) and his sister (the most beautiful and brave girl that I could have ever seen...Setsuko, 4 years old).....they will have to live the horror of war at it's own, alone, without a mother or a father...the story is so moving...the scenes that twisted my heart and broke it in pieces are the ones where you can see how happy and depressive can someone be...what a mix of feelings...how can children suffer so much and be happy at the same time!!!?....at the end of the movie, I was not able to contain the tears...  Seita will do all possible to keep her sister happy and satisfied, but there are times where the reality slashed his back and he feels hopeless in a circumstance where the lack of compassion and love are the most cruel show in desperate times.  I am sure that you will enjoy this story, and I am almost certain that you will not be able to classify this wonderful masterpiece as an anime, or movie...it will be "THE STORY OF SEITA AND SETSUKO, the story that will be engraved in your hearts for a long time...you will never forget it.  Is a devastating and wonderful story at the same time...see it for yourself...
