Was dragged to this (complaining bitterly) by my child, and have now dragged other adults to it three times.  The appeal of this movie for me (NOT a slapstick fan) was the unexpected, fascinating and touching chemistry between Kevin James (Paul) and Jayma Mays (Amy).  Paul reminds me of Forrest Gump, whose blunders manage to turn out well in the end because his motivations are pure.  Jayma Mays does a great job of playing a woman who is both sexy and angelic without making her seem like a bimbo.  Raini Rodriguez is refreshing as a normal American adolescent, sensitive and glamourless.

  There was a moment at the end of the film, when Paul turns toward the camera, with purpose, to claim Amy, that took my breath.  As I left the theatre after one showing, I saw a guy who physically looked something like Paul Blart, with tears streaming down his face.  The man's wife greeted him outside the theatre doors with a wry and amazed, "That bad, huh?"

  The characters and performances make this a memorable film... given that it's unabashedly slapstick comedy, it's something of a miracle.
