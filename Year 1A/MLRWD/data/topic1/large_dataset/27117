One of the best documentries in its genre;"Paradise Lost" will
keep you rivited till the end.And then it's not over - cause you will start thinking about what you have seen and wonder what in fact REALLY happened.
I know that loads of people firmly believe in the innocence of the WM3, and I wholeheartedly support a retrail. BUT, never have I wished more for something like a "time machine" - so one can go back in history to this incident and see what the TRUTH is; to see what REALLY took place there.
We must guard against the notion that the WM3 are without any blame, and keep in mind that they have troubled backgrounds. I firmly believe that someone like Damien did dabble with various cults and unsavoury influences, and I thought it was a mistake to try and deny that outright. For instance, I don't believe for one moment a rebellious teenager would  change his name to Damien in honour of some priest who lived amongst lepers. That just doesnt ring true. And maybe that was their undoing - to try and paint them as misunderstood (totally) spotless youngsters. But PLEASE, I am not implying they are guilty. Not in the least. You HAVE to watch PARADISE LOST 2, once you have seen this one, as it is a compelling follow-up to this tragic story.
