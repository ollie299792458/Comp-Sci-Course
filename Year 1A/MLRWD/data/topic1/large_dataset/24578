Of all the series first shown on Masterpiece Theatre, in the late-1970's, "Poldark" has to be number 1.  From its historical significance just after the American Revolutionary War, to its character development, endless twists of plot, tight dialogue, fabulous costumes and scenery, good vs. evil, humor and pathos, and on and on, "Poldark" is tops.

Why Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees never did more to appeal to the American audience is a shame.  They are so convincing and so filled with positive chemistry on the TV screen.  We often hear about actors being "type cast" and that may be the problem. In any event, hats off for what you did with "Poldark," because we've never seen a better dramatic series than this.

At this writing, my wife and I have almost finished viewing Series 1, and have found it to be every bit as good as when we first saw it, around 35 years ago.  We might ask why it's take so long to finally come out on DVD, but now that it's finally here, we say, Thank you, BBC.  The series is absolutely great.

We have Series number 2 on order and hope, it, too, will be as good as Series #1 and as good as we remember.
