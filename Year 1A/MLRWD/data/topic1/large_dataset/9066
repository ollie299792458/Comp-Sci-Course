What does our legacy leave when our life is gone? Am incredible movie of faith, hope and love. For so many people who call American a Christian nation, I have to ask myself sometime where is the faith, hope and love. Because of the Whitewash (Yes, I am Caucasian) history textbook we were taught so little of the cruelty, rape, murder committed against the Black man. I was not taught about vagrancy laws where a black man could be arrested if he did not have money.  Then he was fined and sold to a plantation owner.  This happen in the 1900's.  There has been so much more that has given many Americans the feeling that other races are expendable. There needs to be healing in America.

Back to the movie. Yes it is extremely inspirational. It has challenge me to think and help those less fortunate. It is a must see and you have an excellent  opportunity to get the movie at a great price with Amazon. Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Kathy Bates and Quinton Aaron do such a great job acting, there were times I knew my body was in my theater seat, but I felt my heart and emotions were in the actual scenes. The family portrayed in this movie had money, but they knew that these three remain, faith hope and love, and the greatest of these is love.
