I really enjoyed this movie unlike many of the other reviewers and while i agree on some of the reviewers claims about the defunct soldier spec-ops and the way they act at times in the film, you must remember that they were mercs/soldiers for hire...at times even irl that kind of soldier leaves a lot to be desired.  Being a person that used to train with army special forces, the team in the movie don't seem like the real deal...that's because they are mercs, and they are not.

  I especially like the plot about the government finding nephalim (angelic/human hybrids) buried in Iraq (earliest civilizations of mankind)which is not something that is just made up out of the blue by a fictional writer but has its basis in the book of genesis of the holy bible...the flood was even Gods way of destroying all of the nephalim and starting over.  A very unique plot line.  Just how many movies have been made depicting the nephalim...a hand few?  The movie should get two stars just from that fact alone, as well as getting the countries they would have been found in correct...it would have been a little silly to have the plot line Tennessee hillbilly's find Nephalim in the Mountains and squeal like a pig.

  I would have liked the secret organization fleshed out a little more that Perlman's character, "Wesley" worked for and their mandates and what Gooding's character was going to do at the end of the movie.  I suppose they were going to leave that for a sequel...a shame to as it will probably never be made.  Like I said I really enjoyed the movie.
