I liked the first film more, but it`s good. It`s been nearly 10 years since the previous time i saw it, so i was suprised by a twist near the end. I think it has some well choreographed shootouts. One thing i didn`t like, was that i think it had less action than the first film. I think John McClane is a good character.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I think this is on par with the first one. Not much more to tell, i think it looks pretty good.

Audio Quality: 4/5

The first thing i noticed about the dialog compared to the first film, was that i think the dialog sounds clearer and much less tinny. Very nice, because i think the first film had trouble with that. They also used the rear speakers much more compared to the first film. I was happy me that.

I think John`s gun have good bass. Some of the other machine guns also have good bass in my opinion, but sadly not all of them. I think that was a bit strange, but ok. This film have more explosions than the previous one, and i think the explosions sounds nice with surprisingly good bass for a film that is 20 years.

Film: 3.5/5
Overall: 4/5
