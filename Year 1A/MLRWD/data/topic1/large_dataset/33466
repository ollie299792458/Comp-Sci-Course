3.5 Stars. This was a pleasant surprise after reading many negative and mixed reviews. This was not a "great" or "classic" movie but the message it projects could BENEFIT any relationship. This thought provoking movie can be very uncomfortable to watch at times primarily because it can hit "close to home" for many and most couples and had me sometimes recognizing my own shortcomings. Granted, it is not a great comedy/drama or story (can be very dreary and sad after the 30-minute mark for many) and Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn do not have an incredible "on-screen" chemistry. But there are so many lessons that can be learned from their troubled relationship that can be applied to everyone if we except that we are all have our "quirks" and "set in our way" mindsets.

When this movie premiered, the combined total average critic reviews were a "C" rating. This was 14 of the top critics throughout the country (i.e.: Roger Ebert, "C", New York Times, "D+", Rolling Stone, "B-"). That Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are such likable actors compounds the problem. They're not convincing as sadistic meanies, and when the movie makes them act that way, we feel sorrier for them than for their characters.

The outstanding cast "line-up" definitely helps an average screenplay. The "Telly Savalas" piece in it was a classic comedy moment for the two main actors. The "Tone Rangers" were a fun addition to the story line (including their song during the end credits). The movies ending may surprise you (either positively or negatively).

Sometimes we all need a friend like Vaughn had in Jon Favreau (as "Johnny O" who usually gave poor advice) to tell us that we may be a wonderful person but we need to realize that couples/friendships (lovers or buddies) cannot be a one-sided relationship for both to enjoy life together.
