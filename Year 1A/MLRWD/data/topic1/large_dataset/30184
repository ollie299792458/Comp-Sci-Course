Very lively, very visual, everybody does things that no other movie has the ground strength for them to do it in.  The best soundtrack...whether it is being rhythmic, emotional, or grand.  THis is one film that has to be seen to be believed.  Once you get to know it after more than one screening, you get to love it, especially since it's heart (Lelu) is so genuine, along with being gorgeous.  But my favorite little scene in this spectacle is the maxed out gonzo who tries to rob Bruce Willis at his little mod-port apartment....he's a complete wreck....speeding out of his mind, and unable to keep it together...turning the moment into great comic effect. Whoever you are, you're one of the best things in this movie...and talk about not skimping, don't forget the asian guy who floats his junk-styled ship over to Bruces window to sell him noodles and then floats aways into the fantastic skyway...just a little something to add to the great charms and fantastic touches of this one of a kind film!
