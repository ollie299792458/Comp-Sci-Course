Emotions this movie evokes from it's viewers: Horror, Amazement,Wonder,Sadness,Disbelief and Confusion.  This movie left me feeling haunted for about a week.  I was not sure if this strange man I saw ( in his self-made videos ) was a genius or a suicidal madman...or quite likely a bit of both.  His friends seem to love him and felt he was highly intelligent and a sweet gentle soul.  People who never met him might think he is truly a Looney tune. Frankly his own video footage seems to portray him as a man with serious emotional issues - perhaps a mental illness - like bipolar disorder or something similar. With that said, the bear footage was amazing but the movie to me was more about this man more than about the bears.  I am glad they did not include the "audio" of the "attack".  That would have been too gruesome to listen to for me. I'm glad that they didn't show any photo's of the "remains"...which would have been equally as gross.  Sometimes what you don't see and what you don't hear...is more frightening.  This film can be funny at times and then deeply disturbing at other times as you watch it.  It left me feeling confused because I would go from "this guy was a nut case" to "wow, maybe he was on to something there".  The end scene where he is walking up the stream with wild bears following behind him like big puppy dogs does make one wonder?  Definitely worth watching if you are interested in the human psyche or animal/human behavior.  I can see why kids ( at the school's he visited ) loved him. And I myself would have enjoyed meeting Tim as well.  Such a tragedy that they both were killed. But maybe that is what he was driven to do.  The tragedy is that his girlfriend's fate had to be entwined with his.  She should have gotten out when she had the chance. But this happens all the time.  People forget that they are mortal. All in all a special film that is not your ordinary run of the mill movie.
