This video is hard to navagate on the DVD. I had difficulty finding the different routines and couldn't tell what was the introduction, practice and workouts. I also don't like the fact that you have to watch the whole introduction everytime you put in the dvd, you can't skip through it. The introduction and the routines seem to have no connection to each other at all. I also cannot stand the instructors voice. She sounds like a cross between a 2 pack a day smoker and an obsence phone caller. Her voice and heavy breathing freak me out. She is also totally out there. The background is a totaly throw back from 1983 and this video seems like they just took and old betamax or vhs and put it out on DVD. I was hoping this video would be a great way to relax instead I am just weirded out by her voice and thrift shop like ambience. I got this as a gift and will be giving it to salvation army as a donation. There has got to be something better than this video. My family laughs everytime they see me play it. It's like a comedy spoof to them.
