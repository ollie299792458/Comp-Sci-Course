This DVD is a must have for any fan of Amor Real. It is definitely a collector's item. I was very excited when I found out that this telenovela was being released on DVD since it was my favorite Mexican soap opera (as well as the most viewed soap opera in the history of Mexico) and I am totally in love with Fernando Colunga(Lead Actor).  I was also happy that this telenovela was coming to DVD since I wasn't able to watch every episode. I purchased the DVD the day it came out and I was very pleased with it. That is why I am recommending it to any fan of telenovelas, you will not regret it. This telenovela which is set in the 19th century has a beautiful story.  I was captivated by every episode I was able to watch.  The only drawback of the DVD, which is not that major, is that you will not get every single episode in its entirety. The DVD has the most pivotal parts of Amor Real. It didn't bother me as much as it bothered other reviewers. It would have been very expensive if every single episode was released on DVD, it would take up more than 15 DVD discs! I'm pretty satisfied that they released the most important parts of this telenovelas. Another selling point for this DVD is the extras as well as the English subtitles, so you can still enjoy it even if you don't speak fluent Spanish.  Go out and get this DVD now, you will thank me later.
