The songs played throughout the Black Symphony concert come from Within Temptation's Mother Earth, Silent Force, and Heart of Everything albums, with at least half the songs played from their latest album. Sharon's voice sounds beautiful and the band plays along with the orchestra and choir seamlessly. There are a couple less-than-perfect notes in the concert and yet they still make it sound great.

Visuals to the show include pyrotechnics, Sharon's costumes, fantasy dancers, and a video screen which displays music videos, ethereal landscapes, and composite war-related footage along with the music. Special kudos to the acoustic songs (Forgiven, Somewhere), as well as the songs which made the best combination of the band with the orchestra (The Promise, Truth Beneath the Rose).

The singing, instrumentals, and talent of WT make their performances extremely exhilarating. The quality of video footage of the DVD and the audio on the CD make Black Symphony a must-have in symphonic rock/metal lovers' collections. This and WT's Silent Force DVD are exceptional concert DVD's.
