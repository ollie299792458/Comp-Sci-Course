I suppose I can't say much more than the previous excellent reviews by other Lucy fans here but I have to pay tribute to the wonderful Lucille Ball by saying a few words too. I have always loved The LUCY Show. I watched it in reruns on my local channel in the early 1970s and then on Nick at Nite in the 1980s. Then it seemed to have disappeared. I can't understand why The LUCY Show, Miss Ball's second TV series, has been so overlooked all these years. I really love and enjoy The LUCY Show, every season, from 1962 to 1968, more than any of her other series. She was still so very beautiful, very funny and the on screen exchanges between Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley and later with her friend in California, Mary Jane (Mary Jane Croft) are not to be missed. I'm very grateful for the upcoming DVD release of The LUCY Show, the Official Second Season. What a treat it will be to see these episodes in COLOR, uncut and unabused like so many bootleg mini compilations that have circulated for years. This is the one to buy and I am first in line! Thank you!!
