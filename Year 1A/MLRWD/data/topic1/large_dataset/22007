This 40-minute DVD is perfect for any little girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina.  Prima Princessa, an animated fairy ballerina, narrates the video, featuring the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet performaing Swan Lake.  I love that Prima Princessa explains what is going on in the ballet so that young watchers can understand and follow the dance.  Between acts, Prima Princessa guides viewers through ballet steps demonstrated by students from the School of American Ballet.  There are also young budding ballerinas attempting these steps and having a wonderful time.

My girls love the dancing in the video.  I had to smile when my eldest commented that she didn't really know that people could put their legs that high and thought only Barbies could do that.  Everytime they watch the video, out come their tutus and ballet slippers and they begin dancing.  They can really relate to the little ballerinas and are enchanted with the Paris Opera Ballerinas.  I like that they were learing the story of the ballet.

I enjoyed watching the ballet but was especially impressed with the educational component of learning the ballet and learning the dance steps.  In addition to just watching and learning at home, this would be an wonderful teaching tool for children to watch prior to going to an actual ballet.  In fact, I hope to get the Prima Princessa Presents the Nutcracker prior to taking the girls this Christmas.
