In my opinion, this is the funniest movie ever made. This is even more impressive considering that it was made very early in the careers of nearly everyone involved in both writing/directing and acting.
The whole thing is essentially a spoof of a 1957 movie called Zero Hour. Our hero Ted Striker follows his flight attendant girlfriend onto her plane in an attempt to salvage their struggling relationship. During the flight, both pilots are incapacitated by some unfortunately timed food poisoning, and Ted has to land the plane.
Stupid jokes abound, and there is something very wrong with you if you aren't laughing. You can tell that nobody erred on the side of caution here. Anything that was funny found its way into the film in one way or another. There are whole scenes that are built around a single joke that is totally unrelated to the plot of the film, but are still really funny. You forgive the movie for some technically bad storytelling techniques because it's so damned hilarious. This is a comedy in the truest sense. Nobody is taking anything seriously here, and neither should you.
There are jokes flying so fast you have to see it more than once because you will laugh through many of them on the first viewing. The best part is that even 30 years later, very few of the jokes feel dated.

Final Score: 9/10
