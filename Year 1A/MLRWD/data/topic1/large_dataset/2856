I have never heard of Monty Python in the early eighties until I saw the "Holy Grail", I did not expect it to be a funny movie at all and was delighted to see how funny it was. I like it over the "The Life of Brian" which I had to watch two or three times to get all the jokes. I think the reason is I used to read tales of King Arthur as a child but didn't know much about the bible or Jesus. As for the technical specs of the DVD I would give a three only because of the picture quality and sound isn't so good and has no special features which is common with DVD's now. (When are they coming out with a critertion edition?) 
Anyway, it will always be in my top ten list of movies. I consider it Monty Python's "Blazing Saddles". I don't know why it Leonard Maltin considers it for hard core fans only. My Dad used to show his ninth grade Geography class this movie when they studied Europe. The kids understand most of the movie and they like it. (Though the average kid doesn't get all of it). And I became a fan of Monty Python from watching this one movie.
Just wanted to add that I got the Special Edition. It's Awesome!The Lego scene and the Japanese version is funny. What they did was translated from English to Japanese, dubbed it into Japanese and translated back into English. Though all the tranlataions the script changes. (It's two scenes not the whole movie.)
