This is a magnificent film well worth owning your own copy, dealing with perhaps the greatest person of the 20th century and many other centuries as well.

It has just one flaw, small or large depending on your taste in such matters.  One of the most remarkable features of Gandhi's character was his resilient serenity and fidelity to his purposes in the face of tremendous odds and considerable personal suffering and failure.

This account of his life shows us this trait but gives us no idea of its origin in his experience.  Instead, it offers us a glimpse of a young Gandhi being thrown off a train in the middle of the night by a racist conductor.  Ben Kingsley, playing Gandhi, simply picks himself up, dusts himself off and begins the first of many successful strategies of non-violent but extremely active resistance.

His response to the religious turmoil which threated to strangle his infant nation in its cradle was heroic beyond belief.

From what reservoir did he draw this tremendous strength?  The movie hardly provokes that question, and it certainly does not attempt to answer it.  Probably because the answer involves no great spectacle.
