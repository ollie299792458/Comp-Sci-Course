To those viewers/reviewers who comment that the message of "Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner" would have been more effective had the Poitier character been a working class guy because that would have shaken up the Hepburn&amp;Tracy middle-class sensibilities, I have this to say: this movie was about racism, and specifically about racism where it's least expected - in the hearts of those who espouse anti-racist philosophies and teach their kids to be open-minded and tolerant. If Poitier had been a working class character, the test situtation that this comedy/drama creates would have been diluted, because then we'd be examining the family's class prejudices and not their racism. A movie can't do everything. What this movie does so brilliantly is remove all the objections a family like the one in the movie could have to a potential son-in-law and those have to do primarily with social class, intellectual sophistication and profession. The Poitier character is an ideal son-in-law, except... And it's that EXCEPT that the movie looks at.
