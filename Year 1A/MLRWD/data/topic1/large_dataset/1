First off, Dogma isn't supposed to be takin seriously.  None of Kevin Smith's movies are, for that matter.  So, for all of you naysayers who do nothing but harp on this movie, please, do all the fans a favor: GET OVER IT, AND DON'T WATCH IT!!!  Now, that's been said, on to the movie.  This was the first Kevin Smith movie I had ever viewed, and from the get go, I liked it.  The acting, for all characters, is enjoyable.  You can believe the actors are there characters (which is kind of the point, right?).  As a Catholic myself, I was apprehensive of this film, until I realized that it is just a movie.  If you're the type of person who can watch a movie, and not take all of its messages to heart, please, view this one.  Actually, there is one good idea that this movie brings to light.  There is a line in the film that says "So you believe now?"  "No, but I have a pretty good idea."  This line refers to the thought of religion, and if you are one those fanatics, then maybe it isn't your flick.  But maybe, just maybe, you can walk away laughing, and even thinking, which I believe was Kevin Smith's main idea.
