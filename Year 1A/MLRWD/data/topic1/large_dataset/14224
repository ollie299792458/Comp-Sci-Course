Prompted by some positive reviews of this movie, I felt i had to add that that this movie was not funny.

After an ok looking movie trailer, I decided to see this with my wife and have a laugh or two. We are both 22 and we are not some weird old couple.
But this movie was just bad.

After the movie starting off very slow and the plot being pretty dumb, the momentum was not there. After the fourth homophobic remark from the main characters brother, I thought to myself " ok, might be funny to some but this is really over doing it". they finally get on the road and I give the movie a little more slack.

  One liner after one liner jokes fill a gaps between the over-weight, non attractive friend's sexual antics and overly confident personality. Both not funny.
  The look at the Amish rumpspringa was a little funny, but after 15 minutes of drunken Amish kids...this gets a little old.
  People look to Seth Green to save this movie, wow... I not only found Seth green a bit off, he was completely not funny at all. All his jokes and awkward pauses were ill timed and didn't make me smile or laugh.

 Now if it weren't for my wife's stubborn habit of wanting to finish something once it is started (like bad movies) I would have left the theater by now.
 But we were almost done and there could still be laughs to be had...right?

 The obvious plot was moot at this point, the chubby kid, was not funny, the jokes, the brother, the girlfriend, the red necks...not funny.
 The one time I got a cheap laugh was when the main character was holding the people hostage with the doughnut suit and a gun.

 To skip ahead, the movie is ending, I'm relieved, and it all ended as happily and as predictably as it could be, but what really mad no sense...the Friend becomes Amish because of a crush he has on a girl he knew for a week?

All in all, this movie is not as bad as lets say...Strange Wilderness (which I did walk out of).  But definitely not worth my time, I bet it's not worth yours.
