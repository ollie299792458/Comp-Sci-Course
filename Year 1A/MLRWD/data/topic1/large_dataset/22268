It's hard to figure out how I feel about this movie. One one hand, it can be downright maddening, especially when it comes to the question of whether the wives are robots or whether they have microchips implanted in their brains. Who knows? I don't think the writers or the director had that one figured out. There is so much here that doesn't make sense, such as...are we to believe that the husbands are left alone to either kill their wives or to perform brain surgery, enabling Walter and Joanna to perpetrate their little farce at the end? Hmmm...
That said, there are some very funny moments. I love how Glenn Close's character is so over-the-top. I have never seen her in a role like this, and she is definitely the bright spot in this film. Bette Midler also has some funny moments, and I loved just looking at the amazing homes of the characters. Any one of them would qualify as my dream home. I do like to watch it just to see Ms. Close and Ms. Midler, or to look at the beautiful sets, but I admit that I end up forwarding over most of the movie to see the parts that I actually like.
I have the original Stepford Wives movie with Katharine Ross, and this version definitely does not compare. The original has some creepy moments, which are definitely lacking here. Given the choice, go with the original!
