And, for that matter, not really a zombie flick. This work is much more than that. I found it profoundly moving, and felt it hitting buttons of recognition all through. Lives that had sort-of healed over or, perhaps more correctly, re-grouped following the agony of grief, are suddenly being prised open again. One day, unexpectedly, the local cemetery spills into the main street all those who have died in the past ten years. Not everyone wants to risk reunion, but it is a seductive possibility. It soon is clear, however, that things can never be what they once were. Hopes newly awakened seem doomed even from the start. But I found myself tagging along thinking, "Maybe...". The threat in this movie is not physical danger, although there is a slowly brooding and unsettling soundtrack, and a sense that you don't quite know what is happening. The threat is more to emotional security, and it is in the form of recognising these people for who they are and taking the risk of allowing them to be what they once were in your life. I found myself many times saying "Yes, that is what it would be like" and, finally, "Yes, that is the way it must be". This, in a sense, is not a happy ending in terms of one of Campillo's original inspirations: the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. These people do not threaten physically, but emotionally and in terms of our security. We soon find ourselves locking them away, guarding them, being suspicious of them and perhaps even inventing reasons why they should be excluded. This is a movie about recognition and risk, and finality. It is not action-packed, but in its persistent probing of your humanity it will have you thinking a long time after you have seen it.
