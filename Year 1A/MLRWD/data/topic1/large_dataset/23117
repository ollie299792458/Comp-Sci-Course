Vincent (newcomer Julien Baumgartner) is an average high school boy, a good student, and a star swimmer. With his best friend Ste'phane and his beautiful girlfriend Noemie (Julia Maraval), high school life couldn't be better for Vincent... until he meets Benjamin (COME UNDONE's Jeremie Elkaim). Vincent keeps crossing paths with the new student, until the two finally have a private moment. The next day, Vincent's idyllic life begins to crumble when the school is vandalized with graffiti labeling him a fag. As the people in his life respond to the news, Vincent faces the inherent challenge of adapting to life as a gay young man. YOU'LL GET OVER IT takes a direct and compassionate look at Vincent's struggle.
This is a delightful film. You've seen many similar films, same old story but set in France in a High School swimming team. French with English subtitles. Julien Baumgartner does a great job portraying his character and is also quite nice on the eyes making this film even better. Tastefully done with some nice brief nudity here and there. Most of the acting is very good, and most of the parts were very well cast. Sound and picture quality is very good and I really found no negatives to the film at all. There are a few extras on the DVD, but nothing real special. A photo gallery, scene selections and some coming attractions. It may be a familiar theme, but unique on it's own merit and I definitely recommend it for your viewing pleasure.
