This is one of Hitchcock's more dazzling if often overlooked films.  Its setting, like those in "Dial M for Murder" and "Rear Window," is domestic and thus deceptively pedestrian.  Hitchcock draws us into the scenario by introducing us to a "typical" 1940's family in a picturesque California town.  Here we meet the sensible, level-headed 20-year-old centerpiece daughter, the heartwarming if credulous middle-aged mother, the wisecracking brainy-brat prepubescent sibling, the father-and-neighbor True Detective fanatics.  Enter visiting Uncle Charlie, a charming sociopath with a passion for marrying and murdering rich grande dames--and voila!--you have a masterpiece.  Tiny inconsistencies in Uncle Charlie's behavior cause a gradually-dawning suspicion to enter the 20-year-old's unwilling head.  Gradually this girl morphs into an amateur detective before the action escalates--and all of a sudden, she's fighting for her life.  Wonderful film, now part of my collection thanks to Amazon.  P.S. Re-watch the film and see how many "doubles" you can spot and list throughout (hint: start with the fact that the villain and heroine are both named "Charlie").  Then read Donald Spoto's "The Dark Side of Genius; the Life of Alfred Hitchcock," look up this film in the book and see how many Spoto uncovered.  Also: take note of Spoto's insights into the film's autobiographical aspects.
