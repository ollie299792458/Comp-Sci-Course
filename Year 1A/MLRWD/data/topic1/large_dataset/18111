Just who is this "stranger", portrayed by Clint Eastwood, who has entered Lago, and what is his purpose?  From the time he arrives, until he leaves, we are left wondering about this shadowy individual.  
Lago is a small Texas town where not to long ago a brutal murder of a sheriff occurred, while the whole town watched, too cowardly to come to his aid.  "Help me," he utters again and again, while his attackers whip him to death.
Now enter the man with no name.  Is he the spirit of the dead sheriff, his brother perhaps, or maybe some kind of ghoulish devil?  Who ever he is, he quickly takes over the town, then takes charge of it, preparing for the return of the three men who killed the sheriff.  It seems his real attempt, other than to avenge the death of the sheriff, is to run the town into the ground; retribution for their earlier cowardice.  The most fitting reprisal being, perhaps, having the townspeople paint the town red, and then rename it "Hell".  
Eastwood's character has no compassion for the people, and as much as he abuses them, we cannot somehow feel sorry the way in which they are being treated.  And even after trying to build up their defense, and train them to shoot at their targets properly and effectively, he still comes to their aid at the end - the bad man shouting out "Who are you", and never given a reply.
Most westerns are the shoot 'em up kind, which we enjoy.  The difference between them and "High Plains Drifter" is that this movie hangs on our moral conscience; and we don't soon forget it.
