Film critics rave about "Sullivan's Travels" because it's about film-making.  My only quibble would be the reprise of the scene where Joel McCrea and his fellow convicts are laughing their heads off while watching Disney cartoons -- when writer/director Preston Sturges reprises some of this scene near the end of the film, it strikes me as being untypically simplistic and sentimental for a Sturges film -- it seems more appropriate to a Frank Capra film.
  My favorite line is : "It'll put Shakespeare back with the shipping news!" (entusiastically spoken by that great character actor William Demarest -- he's speaking about the Depression-era film that Sullivan originally intended to make, a film he called "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" -- a title later used by the Coen brothers).  Is Sturges comparing himself to  Shakespeare?  If so, why not? -- you can delete lines form "Hamlet" without seriously damaging the play, but there are almost no lines I'd want to delete from any Sturges film.
