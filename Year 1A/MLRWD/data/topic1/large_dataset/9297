The kiss between Monty and Taylor in this film is a legendary sequence of editing. It won the academy award for best editing the year it was made, and part of this is due to that specific sequence. But, beyond that, this scene really does typify the brillance of George Stevens. You will see nothing like this in any film not only of that period but even later. The only thing rivalling the emotion and truthful storytelling of this scene is to be found in Hitchcock's "Vertigo" towards the end with the revolving kiss between Novak and Stewart. In both, it defines a depth of relationship that transcends the tawdry or lustful. Compare any film made today! In the extra features, Pakula gives a very good analysis of this key scene.

Enough cannot be said about the direction and acting of this film, and the compassion by which George Stevens directs his actors. I watched, a very good film too, Woody Allen's "Matchpoint" in juxtaposition. Same story, young man on the make. But notice the difference in the moral compass of each character. Clift brings real sorrow and helplessness to the plight he has created, while J. Rhys Myers is cold and emotionless in his fatal choice of wealth and position over love and commitment.Indeed, Stevens never bends to the audience identification with the character's fateful circumstance, and let's him off easy as we all might hope. Directors like Stevens are as rare as they come in the film industry, and his moral vision (like his cohort Capra's) is inviolable. Bravo, to one of the best films ever made.
