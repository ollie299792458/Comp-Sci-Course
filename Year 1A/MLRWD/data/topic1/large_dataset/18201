The Terminator is thrilling, edge-of-your seat entertainment, but it not so subtly begs the examination of man's quest to create the perfect machine only to have his creation turn against him. This is expanded upon in T2 but the original appeals to me more because the viewer has to do the thinking. The icons and imagery are all there, but it doesn't detract from the action and suspensful aspects of the film. Don't misunderstand me; the sequel was great. Cameron had less to work with here and success was not assured. As for the presentation of the DVD, I can say that it's impressive. I remember the film being dark and grainy. The colours are rich and warm, considering much of the movie is at night. The deleted scenes are a bonus. I can see why they were left out, though upon viewing them they add much depth to the story. This is the only sci-fi movie I'd recommend to those who normally would not venture into the genre. "The Terminator" is a violent and chilling action film with spirit and humanity.
