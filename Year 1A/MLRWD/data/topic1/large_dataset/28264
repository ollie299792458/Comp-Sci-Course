I've noticed that most people who have knocked this film recently in their reviews have done so because it has "too many curse words," or some other completely non-relevant reason. I've also noticed that most people who really like it don't seem to know very much about the Coens. This is very sub-par work for them. The performance of Tom Hanks and a few inspired slapstick moments are the only reasons I even gave this film 2 stars.  Other than that, it's a plot I can't seem to care about, and a string of lame over-used jokes based on racial stereotypes and poop that weren't funny the first 1000 times I heard them on FOX and UPN. The Coens are much funnier than this!  I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this film, but it failed miserably.  Up until this point, I have loved everything they've ever done, and yes, I've seen everything they've ever done.  Even Intolerable Cruelty, which was not a great film, consistently made me laugh out loud all the way through and the humor was original and intelligent. I cannot say the same of the Ladykillers.
