American Heritage magazine called it one of the most overrated Westerns of all time and I couldn't agree more.  When I read a plot summary of this movie, I could not wait to get it home and watch.  I could not believe how  disappointed I was.  The plot had so many details and layers that could  have been explored, but no.  It fails on almost every level.  The only  saving grace is that Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly look good in it. Also, I  appreciated the unself conscious approach to references to an interracial  romance that ended before the beginning of the movie, something quite  remarkable for a movie from the early fifties.  Everything else is just off  the mark.  I still can't believe that Tiomkin's song became so popular.  There are so many holes in this most boring of scripts.  What really  shocked me was the subpar cinematography and production values, especially  for a film that they obviously had spent a lot of money on.  The story  takes the course of a single day, but there were so many continuity  problems in terms of lighting(i.e. 5pm looked like noon and noon looked  like dusk).  Grace Kelly spends the entire film wandering around and  pouting.  Cooper and Lloyd Bridges were absolutely disappointing.  I gave  it two stars only because it was a very influential film and became its own  archetypes for many films to come.  This movie represents all the ills that  come from a film industry that was oppressed by production codes and  McCarthyism.  Don't waste your time.  Go with an Eastwood, Ford, or a Leone  picture.
