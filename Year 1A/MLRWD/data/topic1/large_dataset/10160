This is my all-time favorite John Wayne flick.  Most lists I see list "The Searchers" as the best, but I disagree.  This is essentially a reworking of "Rio Bravo", but you get better co-stars here with  Robert Mitchum and James Caan.  Plus you don't have the unrealistic  sing-a-long that occurs in the middle of "Bravo"
  In this  movie Cole Thornton (Wayne) is a hired gunman in town to help out in a  range war.  Before he goes out to meet his new boss, Bart Jason (Ed Asner),  he meets his old buddy J. P. Harrah (Mitchum).  Harrah convinces Thornton  that he'd be fighting for the wrong side.
  Later, Thornton is in  another town, where he meets up with Nils McCloud (Christopher George), who  is off to El Dorado to take the job Thornton turned down.  McCloud tells  Thornton that Harrah is now a hopeless drunk, so of course, this being a  Wayne flick, Thornton has to ride to the rescue.  
  Along the way he is  accompanied by Alan Bedillian Traherne ("Yeah, that's why most people  call me 'Mississippi'.") and Bull (Arthur Hunnicut).  The end is a  shootout worthy of the name.
