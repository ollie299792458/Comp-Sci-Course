While it's never going to be a classic, The school of rock is one of those movies that are just plain fun to watch and that won't lose any of its charm even if you watch it many times.
Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, a thirty-something rockstar wannabe who crashes at his friend Ned's (Mike White) place. His band just gave him the pink slip and Ned's girlfriend (Silverman) is pressing for him to move out (he hasn't paid rent in a loooong time). One day the phone rings. It's a high-up school looking for Ned to take a position as a substitute teacher, but it's Dewey who answers and assumes Ned's identity in order to make some much needed money.
While at school, Dewey finds out that the kids in his class can play some music, albeit it classical, and decides to enroll them in a rock band to enter a 'Battle of the bands' competition (unbeknownst to them). He turns the classroom into a rehearsal studio and teaches the kids how to become rock musicians. All of this behind the back of the school's principal, played by Cusack.
Black succeeds enormously in balancing his crazy rockstar persona with the subtleties of handling the children, and while he learns a lesson in responsibility by the end of the movie, he never betrays the true spirit of his character. The kids who play the students are simply amazing. I had never seen any of them before, so I'm guessing their acting experience is limited, but they give great performances across the board.
For me, the only weak spot of the film comes in the scenes between Black and Cusack. Usually a scene stealer, she comes out pretty subdued and boring in this film - maybe because her character demanded it - and it adds very little to the movie.
There are some great classic tunes in this movie and great musical references from Black (Led Zep, Hendrix, ACDC and a whole bunch of groups).
