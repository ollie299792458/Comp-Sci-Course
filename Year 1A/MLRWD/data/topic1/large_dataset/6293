SCROOGE was a reasonable success in 1970 when it was released, but the intervening years have really been kind to it because it's easy to now see with a little perspective that this as one of the very best versions of the classic Dickens tale, and it's certainly the most colorful, with a splendid production design by Terence Marsh, art direction by Bob Cartwright, and Margaret Furse's detailed costumes. Leslie Bricusse was always a fine tunesmith (DOCTOR DOLITTLE; GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS), but he surpassed himself with the clever lyrics to such songs as "I Hate People," "Father Christmas," I Like Life" and the Oscar-nominated "Thank You Very Much." The makeup to transform the then 34-year-old Albert Finney into the grizzled Ebenezer Scrooge is some of the finest of its period and rivals more recent efforts such as Leonardo DiCaprio in J EDGAR. Beautifully cast and played, this is a holiday treat for everyone, with a memorable score and performances. I defy any but the hard-hearted not to well up at Scrooge's transformation and newfound joy for life. It is regrettable that this superb remastering inexplicably doesn't include the original overture, which was available on the previous DVD version, though it does retain the exit music. I can't recall the film looking as good as this blu-ray version when it was in the theaters during its original release. We noticed background details that had never been obvious in previous laserdisc and DVD releases.
Not to be missed.
