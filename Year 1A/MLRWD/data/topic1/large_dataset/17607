Unlike most suspense thrillers,'Usual Suspects' remains interesting even after multiple viewings. Its charm is not dependent on suspense alone.Its true force comes from the acting by the main leads and the narrative technique followed by Bryan Singer. Just when one story thread appears to be in the danger of going limp, there emerges another much tauter. The screenplay is such a deviously contrived maze that almost every character appears to be lost at one point or another.
Some people complain about the contrived ending. But why ending alone? The whole plot is a contrivance. More mportant than the plausibility element, I think it's the entertainment angle that's really taken care of. And it's pretty cerebral at that.
One of the pleasures of this move is that it makes you care about some of the main characters. You wonder what kind of a life Verbal leads in private. Or what would Keaton be doing if he hadn't got hooked? Was there a real Keyser Soze?
You don't see many movies these days that make you feel that way.
