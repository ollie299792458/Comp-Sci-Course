Ah yes, dashing Richard Gere, gorgeous Jennifer Lopez - what a pair as they move seamlessly together in the ballroom moves!

You'll laugh, perhaps cry. You'll feel the emotion of wanting to fill a void in your life, as Gere's character settles on dance classes to make him supposedly 'happy'. But what he discovers is a totally new and fulfilling talent.

Don't we all sometimes feel we live a mundane life? Wife cooking, cleaning, running the kids here and there, meetings, shopping, etc. Husband shuffling back and forth between office and home, taking in a golf game, watching TV, entertaining the neighbors next door, working out in the gym. Don't we all wish we could just find a new way of adding something to our lives without taking anything away?

Susan Sarandon has reason to wonder. Her husband's acting strangely and going out without explanation. But it all comes together in the end with a wonderful expression of happiness for all.

Excellent. This movie is a keeper. Plus, I love to dance so it's even more special. A ballroom dance teacher I know said she had seen the movie in the theatre four times and took some of her students. You'll feel the passion Gere's character felt when he was on the dance floor, doing something he unexpectedly discovered he LOVED.

Buy this movie and watch it often. Take dance lessons yourself or find your hidden talent. Be HAPPY.
