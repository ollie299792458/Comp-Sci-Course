Michael Tolkin, the writer and director of this film has acheived something truly remarkable: he has made an astonishing modern tragedy from the pat phrases - usually so mind-numbingly banal, even infantile - of  Born-Again Christianity. He does this by treating it all with a surprising  unflinching respect, allowing us to grasp the world from within that closed  system of beliefs, never stooping to condescension. Tolkin asks the simple  question: what if the day of judgement were to come soon - and exactly in  the way that Fundamentalists believe it will - what would we do? Or more  importantly, what should we think about the nature of God's bargain with  the world? (If Abraham had had to sacrifice Isaac, would he still have been  able to love God? Or would he have cursed him?)
Out of this Tolkin  manages to wring a truly profound tragic meditation on the nature of faith  and sacrifice, all set against the most bland, low-mimetic, presentation of  the world imaginable. Mimi Rodgers is extraordinary and deserved an award.  But the greatest star must be the script. There is no word for it but  'genius'.
