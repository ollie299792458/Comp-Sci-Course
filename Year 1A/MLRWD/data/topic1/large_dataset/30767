One of Cameron Crowe's better films, I think. This is not just a boy meets girl, there's some bumps along the way, and then they get together story. There's a LOT going on in this film. It's about a town's love for its favorite son, who has passed on. It's about family. It's about a man who became estranged from his father, and learned more about his father after his father had died. It's about what it means to be successful and happy. (There are some dark moments. It isn't all sweetness and light, though a lot of the film is). And lastly.. this movie.. is about America.

The film meanders quite a bit. I didn't know what to expect, but certainly enjoyed the journey.

Orlando Bloom did well, Kirsten Dunst.. always likeable, and of course she was great. I've never seen her give a bad performance. I think she's an underrated actress.  Susan Sarandon didn't have a large part, but toward the end of the film, she gave one of the better performances of her career.

The supporting cast was excellent, the soundtrack wonderful. And there was even a rather unusual live performance of the classic rock song "Freebird."

We get a glimpse of life in Kentucky in this film (I wonder.. are Southerners really that friendly? I've heard of something called "Southern Hospitality) ..now I want to go to Kentucky.

In summation, if you have the patience, and are open-minded, and open-hearted enough to experience something much more than just an average romantic comedy, watch this movie.
