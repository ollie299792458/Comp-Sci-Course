Finally!!! An animation about kung fu!! It was about time!
With an influx of animation films to choose from this one was definitely a great find.  I think animation should be fun.  Animations should also have characters do 'stuff' that live characters cannot.  Kung Fu Panda has covered them all with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments with some beautifully exaggerated fight scenes. :)  Jack Black brought his distinct comedic style and gave this Panda character and adorable-ness as well as the agility deserving of a kung fu master.  I grew up in Hong Kong watching kung fu movies as a part of my regular TV routine and this movie did fantastically in covering the basics of the authentic kung fu film: The underdog who no one believes in, comes through and surprises everyone.  There's the serious, yet wise kung fu master.  And then there's the wiser kung fu master above him.  And of course the funny supporting cast.  Perfect.  One can never watch enough movies about believing in oneself, can one?  So, go out and have some fun!  Watch this!
