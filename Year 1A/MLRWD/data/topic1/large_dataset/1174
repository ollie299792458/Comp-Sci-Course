I have to say, the first time I saw this movie, I laughed so hard, I was ready to give it movie of the year consideration in whatever genre you would put this type of movie in (I've seen a lot appropriate references to the American Pie series). It was hilarious and my fiance and I were really pleasantly surprised.

Then something terrible happened. We talked it up to some friends of ours who agreed to see it, so we went to see it again. BIG mistake. Maybe it was the fact that we could see they weren't enjoying it as much as we had, but at the same time, it just didn't seem like the jokes were as funny the second time around.

Now I've seen movies back-to-back a number of times so I know that if there is something that is really funny, I'll laugh everytime I see it, that happened very rarely with this movie, which I am the first to admit was disappointing, because I did really enjoy it the first time.

In short, if you haven't seen it yet, go see it, and laugh til you're hurting, but don't expect it to be as fun the second time around.
