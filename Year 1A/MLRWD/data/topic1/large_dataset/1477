Okay, my husband and I are avid Asian culture followers.  The thing that has destroyed me is that this movie only has great eye appeal.  It is clearly overdone and reminds me more of a Chinese Halloween.  We usually watch movies like this for the huge climax.  Where this film built you up for such a climax, one never came.  Initially, I wanted to back the movie up and watch it again to see if I missed something.  But after sitting a while, I realized that I have been let down very hard by this movie and should have turned my t.v. off when I realized that the "plot" or lack thereof was being drug out too far.  I have read other's reviews who have given very high ratings based simply on the splendor of the costumes, etc, but you really need to do yourself a favor and only rent this movie.  If you base great movies on costumes only or superficiality, then this movie is perfect for you.  If you enjoy great movies with great fight scenes like Crouching Tiger, Hero, or House of the Flying Daggers, then this movie is way sub-par.  I would give it one star, but I did enjoy the mystery of it.  Overall, I was very disappointed and wished that I would not have spent so much time on something that did not flesh out into something more meaningful in the end.
