I happened to have the opportunity to see this film recently....I hadn't heard anything of it but seeing as how I really love to watch both Tim Robbins or Samantha Morton on screen, I decided to give it a try....

The movie is really beautiful....set in the future but one not so far off that it isn't relative or current to our times....the language as mentioned in an above review is wonderful where a potpourri of languages makes a new universal one....the mood of the movie and cinematography is well-placed making the movie itself seem like artwork.....it was lovely just to watch....

I have to politely disagree with a reviewer from above when they mentioned that Morton's voiceovers seems out of placed and we could have figured it out ourselves....the voiceover was basically her thoughts to him - almost one of those situations where one imagines what one would say if we saw someone....i loved the voiceovers myself as we learn a little bit more about how Morton's character "Maria" thinks - what things she tends to remember and find meaningful and relevant - trivial things that one may do every day and take for granted that a lover may play over in their heads a million times as something beautiful....

The movie deals with subliminal questions of fate and with mythology while tackling lighty questions about cloning and IVF.  This isn't a political mivie and to call it a sci-fi movie isn't that accurate either....It's a love story without all the hearts and ribbons....It has one thinking if we ultimately choose who we love or is it a predisposition unexplainable to us....I'd feel like this movie shares some DNA with Gattaca and Chinatown.....

Although is carries an "R" rating, there isn't heavy language - the dialog is simple and beautiful and flows nicely....There are brief moments of implied sexuality which is actually beautifully erotic without being graphic except for one small brief scene of female nudity which isn't centered on the top half of the body and in no way seemed gratuitous....I and my friends who saw it loved it....
