When I first saw this movie I thaught it was delightful. There are just some scenes that make this movie as musical as it ti, such as... well I can't think of any now, but there are plenty of them. Another part of this  movie that makes it marvolus is the all-star cast, such notable people as  The Late Anthoney Newly and Sammy Davis Jr., THe Funny Red Buttons, Shelly  WInters, And Donald O'Conner, and The Show Stoping Jayne Meadows As THe Ill  Temperd "Queen Of Harts". Of Corse The fantastic mucical score  also contributes to this Colerfull movie, with such stupendous songs like  "Just Lauph", "Off With There Heads", and "I  Didn't, You Did". All in all this is one of the best Made For  Telivision movies ever yet, and version of this  classic tale. to re-quote  THe Tresire cat "This is just the begining of your adventures",  because this is only the first part, so read the user-comments on the  sequel "Alice Through THe Looking Glass".
