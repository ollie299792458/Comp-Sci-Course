Love Actually is sure to be a light hearted classic.  In the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail, Love Actually is full of many heart warming stories that overlap eachother.  The film is pretty much a complete collection of every kind of love story there is.  What i liked about the film was that the writers didn't try to make them all have a happy ending although most of them did.  This is a film to pop in your vcr or dvd player when having a bad day.  If for nothing else than to watch the adorable little kid in his quest for love.  The movie is essentially exactly what you would predict but that doesn't take away from the cuteness of the film.  Probably the only problem that I had with it was the inconsistency of the relationships of the characters.  It was almost as if some of them were friends in the beginning of the film and then the writers forgot that at the end.  Also I think that this is not really a movie for little kids.  While it wouldn't hurt them to watch it I am pretty sure they will not understand the majority of the film.  But other than that this film was very good and will surely put a smile on any viewers face.
