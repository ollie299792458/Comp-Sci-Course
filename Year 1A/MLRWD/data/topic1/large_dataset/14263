Not for the weak of heart or stomach, this film is a very powerful and very disturbing biopic of real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by an unrecognizable Charlize Theron - who must have eaten about 1000 bags of Cheetos in preparation for this role. Theron plays Wuornos straight and well, she makes her accessible and understandable as a real human being, while at the same time confronting the viewer with her unbelievable darkness and inhumanity. This movie is important as a cinematic achievement - the seedy underbelly of lower class Florida is absolutely depressing as one of the important elements of this story that the director nails, as well as for its unflinching look at the utter darkness residing inside Aileen Wuornos. The director does not force the viewer to conclude whether this darkness is intrinsic to her particular personality and is in some way "loosed" by the agony of her particular story, or whether, having never been treated as a real human being, that she is just "one of us" with a different context. - blogophobe-
