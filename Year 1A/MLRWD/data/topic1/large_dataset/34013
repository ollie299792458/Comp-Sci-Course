My review is for the Blu-Ray version of "A Bug's Life". I will not over the plot since there are multiple reviews about it.
VIDEO:
The graphics are awesome, especially the landscapes and the overall environment. However, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics of the ants and some of the insects that looked poorly rendered CGI material, which sorely stands out in Blu-Ray version. Yes, I still have in mind that the movie was made in 1999 and was Pixar's second movie.
AUDIO
The audio was awesome. Lossless audio makes a difference here, especially when the grasshoppers leave the cantina at the dessert. It is just fantastic

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I am true fan of Pixar's movie (I have all the releases in BD). Maybe this movie is not at the same level of other great titles like Ratatouille. I know we should not compare this movies with another Pixar's movies; however, that is almost unavoidable after you spent almost $35 on it.

I still recommend this movie for the whole family. I read earlier one review that this was not for kids, but my three year old daughter enjoys the movie.  There are some scenes that could be a little bit obscure, but are carefully balanced with funny moments and that you as a parent can take advantage in order to teach your kids not to be scared of, and face obstacles and not feel intimidated.
