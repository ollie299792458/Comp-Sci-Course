I give this turkey two stars for two reasons-I like 1920s art, clothing, and decor, theatrical ploys like foreshadowing and symbolism (which are always fun),  and the performers act their hearts out on this paper-thin script.
And that is ALL , folks.
The story was more predictable than a kids' movie.
The main character is foolish, rude, ignorant, vain, selfish, and a drunk.
The female love-interest puts up with all his abuse for the whole story, as she (and we) "know" he will change five  minutes before the end of the film.  Wow.  Yeah. That.
Now for the bad news- it uses a "what-if" suspention of belief plot device about 10 minutes in-for no reason!
Then, about 45 minutes farther along, they add another impossible pretext -also unnecessariliy- which contradicts the first one.  Was this the first big hit written by an 8 year old compusive liar??
 Hollywood likes to pat itself on the back for taking risks, trying something new, and remembering the pioneering efforts of the great directers from 90 years ago.
Or feeling as if they had.
  The politics around who votes on academy awards is less rigorous then the process of picking a small town's dog-catcher. (No offence meant to the latter. Thank you guys.)
Oh well-- see you at the movies!
