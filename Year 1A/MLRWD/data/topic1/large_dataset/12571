The essence of this movie is that humans live on the moon in the future, but they're constantly traveling back in time to mess with the timeline. The movie is done in a semi-documentary style.

It features a group of male friends that believe they have stumbled upon evidence of a government cover-up. But then they discover that it's really the Church of Lunology that's behind the cover-up.

Question: What is the church covering up? Answer: Aliens (aka humans) living on the moon. Question: Why is the church covering up aliens living on the moon? Answer: They're in cahoots with the future humans.

As members of the church chase the men to get back the time machine device they stole, the men are trying to find out more about the church and the role it plays in humanity's past, present and future.

From my perspective, this was a very boring movie, not the least bit scary. I had a hard time staying awake. But then the screenplay was weak and the special effects (where they existed) were done on a shoestring budget.

The only positive point about the movie was the acting, which for the most part was good. However, acting can't save a poor screenplay/plot.
