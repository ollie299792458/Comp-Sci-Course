This documentary was so gripping and deep, I watched it twice in the same day. McNamara begins with his experiences as a young statistician working under LeMay during World War II. He explains the cold approaches (e.g. firebombing) devised to destroy Japan's ability to wage war. Interleaved are reflections on his personal life, which give the viewer an often unseen side of the man often labeled "An IBM Machine with Legs". We are given an inside look into the decision making processes that led to the onset and resolution of the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as a detailed account of the Vietnam War. He spent a significant part of his later life as an ex-SECDEF retrospectively reflecting on the major events in which he played a major part. Decades later he visits leaders of Cuba and Vietnam to learn more about the thinking and rationale of the actions of the other side.

While one might dismiss McNamara given the vast number of American and Vietnamese that died while he was SECDEF, it was moving for him to show humility. His broad and deep recognition of his biggest mistakes is an important milestone for the history of leaders of the Defense Department. Hopefully other leaders follow and admit their mistakes and demand current leaders not go down the wrong path again.

Another reviewer is correct in noting the framing of his lessons are a bit arbitrary. Some lessons overlap ("Rationality will not save us" and "You can't change human nature."), some are too general ("Get the Data"), some are too specific, and taken together, they are certainly not complete ("Avoid killing" seems like a good lesson). However, if you relate each one to the war in Iraq, you get the sense that the current administration could have done much better in their analysis and subsequent handling of the war.
