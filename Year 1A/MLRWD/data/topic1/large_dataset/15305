This is a fine DVD, to be sure, but considering that there are two widely-seen versions of this film (Todd-AO and CinemaScope), I don't see why they couldn't have given us both versions instead of  "retiring" one of them for all time.  I realize I'm in the  minority, but I actually prefer the CinemaScope version, perhaps because  that was the one I grew up watching on TV over the years.  Once I got past  the novelty of seeing the Todd-AO version for the first time I missed  hearing the lines delivered the "old" way!  I remember the  CinemaScope version actually began with a title card that said "Color  by Technicolor" while a full-bodied orchestra played the music to  "There's a bright golden haze on the meadow"--an exhilarating  fanfare never to be heard on home video, as they have always substituted  the Todd-AO version's overture.  Since the Todd-AO version was a "road  show" only attraction, it seems to me that more people would have seen  the CinemaScope version over the years and thus it deserves to be preserved  for historical purposes if not for any other.  Ironically, the back of the  DVD box erroneously indicates that it's the CinemaScope version!
