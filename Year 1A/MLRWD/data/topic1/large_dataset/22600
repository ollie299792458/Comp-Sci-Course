What a feeling, bein's believin'
I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life
Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

Just like that, you're drawn back to the days of leather, rock, legwarmers, and the movie that made everyone believe in themselves a little more.
In 1983, Jennifer Beals touched us all with a character so full of strength and determination that she faces a firing squad of judges who will decide whether she gets into a prestigious dance school, or be left in the dead end jobs of welding and exotic dance.

For those of us who have already been touched by the incredible strength of this movie, the decision to buy came right at the beginning of this review in the lyrics to the title song by Irene Cara. But for those of you who have not shared this experience, and must rely on the long, drawn out, and sometimes pedantic reviews to find some nugget that will leave them intrigued enough to actually watch the film, there is only one thing that can be said.

If you haven't seen it, you're probably the only one you know who hasn't, which means you will be made fun of endlessly until you do.
So, spare yourself the shame and humiliation, and give it a go.
What can you lose?
