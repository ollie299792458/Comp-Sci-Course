I had the chance to see Dial M for Murder in one of its rare 3D engagements in 1954, and again in Paris in the 1980s. It's wonderful to see it fully restored in its original wide-screen format, without any of the problems associated with dual-strip film projection.

Dial M in 3D is a textbook example of how 3D films should be made. Hitchcock established himself as a cinematic master with the 1930 "Juno and the Paycock," his second sound movie, where most of the action takes place within one room. Using a similar technique refined by two decades of experience, the Dial M camera voyeuristically lurks behind lamps, chairs and whiskey glasses, witnessing what should be the near-perfect crime. All of this works well in 2D, but becomes a new cinematic experience with the addition of depth. Hitchcock uses the limitations of the one-room setting to dramatic advantage, heightening the tension by pulling the viewer into the action. The film has been perfectly restored, with stunningly beautiful color and accurate stereo imaging. Kudos to Warner Brothers for taking on this ambitious project!
