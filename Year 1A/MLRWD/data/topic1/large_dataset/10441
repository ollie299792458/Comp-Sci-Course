This is one cracking good film, and a superb transfer to HD DVD. The picture quality of the Technicolor transfer is jaw dropping. But what makes this disc even more special are the amazing extras. The special features include two documentaries, short films and cartoons, a dozen trailers for Flynn films such as Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, and a Warner Night at the Movies feature.

Leonard Maltin's Warner Night at the Movies 1938 is a real time capsule, which recreates a full evening's movie programme of the time. In includes a vintage newsreel, musical short with Freddie Rich and His Orchestra performing several big band numbers, Katnip College cartoon, and a trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces (for any James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart or Ann Sheridan fans).

The real gems are the two documentaries, around 1 hour each, both of which are worth the price of this disc alone...

'Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of The Adventures of Robin Hood'  presented by film historian Rudy Behlmer, Leonard Maltin and others  features extensive interviews and archival footage of the production, cast and crew.

'Glorious Technicolor' plots the development of the Technicolor film process from beginning to end. It not only provides a great insight to the science, but features clips of the production process for some of the all time great movies such as Gone With the Wind, Red Shoes, Wizard of Oz, etc. It also includes color screen tests for a who's who of Hollywood stars of the 1930's and 40's - Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, Betty Grable, Maureen O'Hara and more. For any fan of the golden age of Hollywood this disc is a must have.
