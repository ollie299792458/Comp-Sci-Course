If I could give less than one star, I would. Director Paul Greengrass has created a film that will literally make you sick.

I've been a camera operator and director for over 20 years. One technique used sparingly is the so-called, shaky cam. I say sparingly. Its purpose is usually to disorient the viewer... to knock them into a bit of a funk, but only for a short time. You have to let the viewer regain their bearings, otherwise the technique backfires. Maybe Greengrass had no story to tell. It's one way to make some people in the audience believe they've been on a rollercoaster ride. It's not exactly the best way to generate audience excitement... getting them to run to the restroom to vomit.

This film probably has the worst use of the shaky, cinema verite that I've ever seen. It's in use constantly. The effect is to give you motion sickness within a few minutes. I basically had to shut my eyes after the first 5 minutes of the movie. In spot checking the rest of the movie, apparently the technique is used constantly, except for aerial shots which probably used a gyro stabilized camera mount. Why bother with the expense of a gyro mount when the rest of the movie basically jitters the heck out of your eyes. In checking the credits, the aerials had a different director of photography.

Greengrass directed the second Bourne film, but apparently used different steadycam operators. That's right, steadycam operators in their $100,000 rigs were probably shaking and snap zooming all the nauseating camera moves. But, that's what Greengrass wanted. And any future film he directs, I won't bother with... unless I want to practice my projectile vomiting techniques.

I should have checked the reviews before buying this poor excuse for a movie. This one will make you sick to your stomach. Take some motion sickness pills before you watch it, if you dare.
