i was somewhat thrown off by the fact liz was brutally killed off right at the beginning. but this is to be expected considering how much of a mind screw this franchise is, because anybody can die (except for maybe Reggie). but of course they come across 2 new additions to their party. "rocky" the militaristic black female martial artists whom kicks a$$ (her friend should have survived for the ultimate team up) and the sharp shooting 10 year old kid "tim" (who is also hilarious btw likewise with rocky, oh and jody makes a return). I'm surprised that tim didn't have a pet dog!, no seriously it seems like this kid would have a pet dog tagging along lol but i digress.

no..no..in all seriousness this series has a great consistency unlike most other horror movie franchises. this flick is more so along the lines of action/horror, with subtle hints of comedy thrown in. its not a strait up horror flick. but make no mistakes its very far from light hearted. the murderous dwarves, and killer spheres make a strong comeback. theres even a special high tech gold one that uses laser beams instead of drill,saws,and spikes. and of course angus is back as the iconic tall man.

the movie picks up right after part to with Reggie and mike recovering from the attack at the end of the second movie. and eventually venturing to a creepy small town called Holtsville (because jody told them too). where they encounter the 2 aforementioned new additions, and some looters who eventually becomes the tall man's minions (if i recall correctly). and of course epic battles ensues. overall a solid addition to the unappreciated, and often forgotten franchise. glad to see its finally on DVD.

on a side note, i always wondered what it would be like if rocky had a spin off franchise with her friend that would be cool. i can picture it now two bad azz black girls going town to town kicking monsters...this screams to be made into a separate franchise.
