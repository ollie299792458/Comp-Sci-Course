Although this production goes somewhat flat after the sequence showing Wyatt as a buffalo hunter, the fault lies with the Director for trying too hard to show Earp as suddenly devoid of emotional response and empathy. In this, the movie tries a little too hard to "explain" him. The production is, however, pretty historically accurate and the revisionists don't take over the film completely.
However,the person responsible for deciding to "slick down" Costner's hair, (even when no portraits of Earp show him wearing his hair like that, and Costner's hair is too thin to look right greased down anyway)should be shot - it bugged me for the rest of the movie. The action is realistic, with out being gratuitous, and Dennis Quaid is SUPERB as Doc Holliday, the acting is generally fine, with excellent film work.
Earp was a freind of my Grandfather, who never represented him as anything but a common man, reacting to uncommon circumstances, with the honor, honesty and determination required by the times; this production remains true to the man.
Well worth the time!
