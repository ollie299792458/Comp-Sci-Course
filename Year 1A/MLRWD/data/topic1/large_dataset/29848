I give the movie itself 3 stars. A group of men kidnap a (psych.) doctor's child, and holds her until the doc (Douglas) can reach another young lady named Elizabeth who is currently under care in a secure ward in a hospital. This young lady, when she was a little girl, witnessed her father die. The men are looking for a number that has the location of a high priced gem. This young lady appears to be the only person that knows this number. Elisabeth (played by Brittnay Murphy) will not disclose this number to ANYONE!!
Along comes the father (Douglas) of the missing and kidnapped kid, he tries to reach out to Elizabeth to get the number for the mere purpose of getting his kid back. Low and behold Elisabeth manages to find a connection with the doctor but still is reluctant to tell a soul.
A movie of good guys, bad guys-run of the mill story.
I gave the movie a an overall rating of 4. 3 stars for the movie itself but 5 out of 5 stars to Brittany Murphy for her excellent performance of an insane, lost in her own world, role!! Her acting, in the movie, is what made me stay tuned into it.
And I say over all, it's not a bad movie to rent. Just not one of the best either!!
