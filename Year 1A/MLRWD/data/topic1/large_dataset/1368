The people endlessly trashing this film are obviously biased against Mr. Stone, or the idea of their guru Jim Morrison being portrayed by someone else on celluloid.  I haven't read an objective review yet, which is pretty  sad, considering that this is a brilliant movie made by an extraordinary  filmmaker.  To quote James Woods reffering to Stone:  "Oliver Stone is  now making films that show a subjective experience, that have no omniscient  point of view.  This guy is doing work that if it were by Orson Welles  would be hailed as genius."  I totally agree.  Stone angers a lot of  people with his risky style, and that's why his films take more heat than  most others.
The endless quivelling over this movie's accuracy is  downright insane!  First of all, why say "If you want a true account  of the Doors, read Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek"?  How can you trust  Mr. Manzarek as the definitive source for a Doors biography?  I'm sure  drugs have poisoned the memories of the entire group, and Manzarek is no  exception.  Do you people realize how involved the real-life individuals  were in the making of this biopic?  It's practically based on John  Densmore's book!  If they thought some major travesties were being  committed against the band, they wouldn't have let Stone go through with  them.  Pam Courson's family didn't let Stone portray their daughter as the  junkie she truly was.  Think about it.
If Morrison has no poetic side in  this film, I'd like to know why everything he said was an epiphany.  Face  it, this is a great film, and, although inaccurate, it's just a MOVIE, not  a documentary, and artistic liberties are taken with all biopics, no matter  who is at the helm.  You must admit that there are some truly brilliant  moments in this movie.  I didn't hate Morrison.  Kilmer did great, and  there should've been Oscar nods for him, as well as the *genius*  cinematography, etc.  To trash this film because it's  "inaccurate" is mere card stacking.
