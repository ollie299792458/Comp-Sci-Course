My review is in no way taking into consideration the Iliad; it is strictly my conclusion based on the Director's Cut versus the Theatrical release.

Hollywood does what it wants, viewers want to be entertained. Hollywood doesn't think in a purist manner, but in a profit manner. The question is whether we as consumers feel satisfied with the results of Hollywood's modifications.

I have seen the theatrical release several times and liked it; I would give that between 4 and 5 stars rating. The Director's Cut I found to be much more uninvolving. From the beginning of the film with a dog running around scavenging and sniffing various corpses to added childish spats between key characters the added material mostly added viewing time, not significant enhancements to the story. There were also edits to the musical score, which I especially disliked during the battle of hector vs achilles. I specifically switched to the theatrical release DVD to compare the sound on that battle because I emotionally felt bored on the Director's Cut which has never happened before. The intensity to that battle came back viewing the theatrical release.

There were some scenes in which added discussions maybe gave a little more insight into conclusions that were made in the story, such as: the debate how Troy would handle the pending war (in which Paris said he would fight Menalaos), how the man carving a horse inspired the idea of the Trojan horse, the debate about bringing the Trojan horse to Troy, etc. These were however mainly insignificant; the theatrical release provided enough for viewers to be able to fill in the blanks.

For the overall story, musical score and scripting, the theatrical release is much preferred.
