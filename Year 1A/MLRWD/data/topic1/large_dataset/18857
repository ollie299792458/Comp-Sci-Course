What Women Want is the story of chauvinistic ad executive Nick Marshall (Gibson).  A sterotypical ladies man, Marshall's only two talents seem to be getting paid and getting laid.  He lacks the relationship skills to be a good husband or father.  During the course of the movie, Marshall gains the talent of hearing the most intimate thoughts of women, and struggles to keep his job and the woman he is falling in love with, played by Helen Hunt.
This movie isn't bad exactly, it just relies too much on the comedic effect of mind reading, and doesn't provide much to support it.  Gibson is fabulous, and play the part very well.  It is quite amusing to see him dressed in pantyhost, holding a wonderbra, with painted nails.  Not to mention the leg waxing scenes.  The problem with the movie is that there is little in the way of supporting plot, which leaves the viewer dissapointed in the end.  The ending itself is especially terrible, without much build-up of suspense to make it enjoyable.
Having said all that, this movie is worth watching, perhaps over a bowl of popcorn with a date, or just by yourself.  You will get a few laughs out of this movie, but don't expect too much.  You will be let down.
