I was a bit late in becoming an X-Men fan since I didn't really get into it until the late 90s. Ever since I've been completely hooked! The movies were pretty good. The first two were excellent, though the third seemed to go too off track. It was still okay, in my opinion. I found X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: First Class quite nice, yet that's also from my point of view. Anyway, I loved the 90s animated X-Men series, X-Men: Evolution and now Wolverine and the X-Men! I haven't looked into the anime just yet; I might watch it before purchasing it. I do know that this particular series was very well written and the artwork is great! I admit that some episodes weren't as interesting as others, but in all it was a wonderful series. I hated how it was aired here in the United States; it took almost an entire year to see 26 half hour episodes! Still, it was worth the wait:) I've owned this complete season for a good while now; however, I just hadn't gotten around to review it until now. Some people didn't like how Emma Frost was written off. I've read things online where they say that they made her too soft. Well, she was softer, but still herself. It showed that she's not truly evil. She still was witty and even snotty and harsh at times, but not over the top. My only big complaint is that there won't be a second season:( It looked so promising too. There were three online petitions that I've signed along with millions of other fans. I was hoping that those would set a spark. For all of the fans out there, let's just keep our fingers crossed!
