As a childbirth educator, doula, and mother, I've watched countless birth videos. Without question, BIRTH DAY is the best video currently on the market. I live in the U.S., where in most cases birth has become more of a medical event than a life event. But BIRTH DAY  gives viewers a chance to see a completely normal, natural home waterbirth, with the mother's family (including here other young children) in attendance. Viewers will be given the gift of spending a "birth day" with Naoli Vinaver Lopez and her family at their beautiful home in Xalapa, Mexico. To witness the love and support Naoli and her family share during her labor and birth, combined with beautiful music and narration, is nothing short of inspiring. I was so inspired that, too, had a home waterbirth!
Every pregnant woman and her family needs to see this video. It was also one of the few birth videos I felt was appropriate to show my then-3-year old son as we prepared for the birth of his brother. Basically, it should be required viewing for anyone planning to ever give birth!
