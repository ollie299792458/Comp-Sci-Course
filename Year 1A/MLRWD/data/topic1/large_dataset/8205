After reading the reviews below, I had to make a comment on this movie.  First off, the reviewer who stated she took "young children" to this movie, I would like to ask why?  It is rated PG-13 meaning the children should be at least 13.  Today, so many times, parents choose to take children to movies not made for children.  Secondly, the review about real women and women of size -- well frankly being overwieght does not make you a REAL person!  I hate that!

The movie does make fun of a FAT women.  If you couldn't guess this from the previews/posters you are in need of serious help.  If you find that offinsive, then why go?  Also I would like to comment that these same people do not have a problem when the movie makes fun of other minorties, such as Asians, Hispanics, Gays and Lesbians.

So that being said, the movie does have a see through plot, simply written but at the same time very funny.  I chuckled out loud so many times during the movie -- something most comedies fail to produce.

It is enjoyable ADULT humor not meant for children.  Do you take your children to R rated movies and complain?  Do your research before you choose to go to a movie with you children.  Get a sitter next time.

I have already purchased my copy of the movie and am looking forward to watching it again and again.
