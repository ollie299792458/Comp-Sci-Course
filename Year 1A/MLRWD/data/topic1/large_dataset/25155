Kings Row won 3 nominations for best picture, best cinematography and best director. No one won. Yet 62 years later, this movie remains vivid, and hailed for its crisp direction, good script, strong acting and  supported by memorable score, art direction and cinematography. I watched the movie yesterday for the second time in 30 years. I discovered that the black and white plus Korngold`s beautiful yet sensitive music greatly enhanced the movie. The music actually joined in the story-telling. And by the time Parris returned from Vienna and was met at the station by Randy, I was in tears. Sam Wood`s direction set the pace such that the picture moved. There was hardly a dull moment. Only I remembered that at the end of the movie, when Drake successfully overcame the fact that the brute doctor had deliberately cut off his legs, Parris took off with such joy that he rang a bell near the Kings Row signboard. But the video version shows him running up the slope to his future wife. Was this ending a change from the original ? Well, this movie is a timeless classic. I can`t wait for Warners to reissue the picture on DVD.
