Too many elements were too bad to save this one.  Unfortunatly, though it had the ingredients of something magnificent, The Magnificent Ambersons did not deliver.  To me, the biggest problem is a few obnoxious performances, despite a pretty promising cast.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I present to you one Jonathon Rhyes Meyers, and one Jennifer Tilly.  They are charged with ruining a potentially good film with thier thoroughly unlikeable characters,  strained delivery of lines,  and horribly overdone accents.  Jennifer Tilly looks like a puppet with a flapping jaw reciting lines in a loud screaching voice.  Jonathon Rhyes Meyers' character is so cocky, so over the top selfish, that I couldn't muster any concern for him at all, nor for all of the other characters who seem to just find him determined and proud.  It is hard to care about a story when you can not care about the characters. This is the position I found myself in as I watched this movie.  I also thought the movie looked a little low-budget and amatuer-ish.  The hair and makeup were also really overdone for the time period.  And although there is one good twist to the storyline at the end, it is quickly ruined by a "happy" ending for a couple of undeserving unlikeable characters.
