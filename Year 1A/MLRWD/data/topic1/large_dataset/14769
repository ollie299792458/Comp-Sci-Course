I came to this hoping to gain some insight and knowledge about the Transpac, about what exactly is required to be competitive, and how people go about mounting a successful campaign. But oh sure: I was also hoping to be entertained.

Right away: alarm-bells went off: "The sea-route between California and Hawaii is the loneliest stretch of ocean in the world." Oh, d'you really think so? The narrator obviously hasn't read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385720009">Godforsaken Sea: The True Story of a Race Through the World's Most Dangerous Waters</a>, which is the story of a single-handed race through the Southern Ocean near Antarctica, where even NORMAL weather is 60' waves, and of which is said: "Below 40 degrees (latitude) there is no law; below 50 degrees, there is no God" (and is an utterly thrilling read as a result).

A few minutes in, the thought came to me: "The director has no interest in the actual subject-matter, and doesn't trust that it's interesting in itself to anyone." Evidence? The pounding sound-track; the trick zoom-shots; the speeding up and slowing down of time for dramatic purposes; the personality fluff; the lack of any hard information at all about sailing.

Do not get me wrong: if you grew up with MTV and "reality" game shows, really like looking at very photogenic young men and women (all of whom are dead serious about this race, unlike the director), and are not looking for any actual information about sailing, you may well love this.

This review will no doubt get slammed, but that's OK: I put it here for people like me.
