In a time when so many "comedies" are front loaded with their best material and then weakly trail off, this film is a good example of how a movie can start off hilariously then proceed to get funnier and funnier as it goes along! The supporting cast does a fine job, but this film is essentially a Bill Murray showcase. Watching his character Phil's various approaches to the bizarre Twilight Zone episode he finds himself in is not only funny but at times very insightful. After periods ranging from taking advantage of the situation to suicidal despair, Phil finally decides to start working on himself. When his diligent efforts at self improvement make him the toast of the town that he initially hated but has since come to love, the once unattainable goal of getting the girl of his dreams becomes virtually effortless. It's a rare film indeed that can be so highly entertaining while driving home such an important point. Bravo to Bill Murray and also to Harold Ramis for his excellent directing of a highly original film.
