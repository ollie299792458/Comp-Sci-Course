For me Fatal Contact started out with a lot of promise. The basic plot revolves around a performer who gets drawn into the seedy world of underground fighting. Not incredibly original, but like I said... it had promise. Throughout the film the main character hangs out with his girlfriend and this irritating homeless guy who works for the gangsters who run the fights. Of course, surprise, surprise, the irritating guy turns out to be a kung fu master himself. Wow! I didn't see that coming. (That's sarcasm, in case you were wondering). As the movie progresses there are, quite naturally, a lot of fight scenes (it is a movie about fighting after all). On the plus side, most of the action is very well done and the fights are well choreographed. So, what's my problem you ask? I'll tell you. This movie has one of the worst endings of all time. If you're anything like me, no matter how much you enjoy the first 3/4 of this film, the end will ruin it for you. I don't want to give anything away but very near the end the plot takes an totally unexpected turn, and the movie gets really dark for no apparent reason. It seems like the creators didn't know how to end this one, so basically something bad (i.e. stupid) happens that makes the main character, who was a pretty decent guy up till now, go nuts and kill a bunch of people. The end of this movie is so out of left field, and makes so little sense, that it just blows the whole thing and ruins what could have been a pretty good addition to the kung fu, action genre. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.
