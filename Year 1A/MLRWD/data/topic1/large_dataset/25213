It's simple, if you are gay and you liked movies like American Pie then you should love this one.

I actually find it amusing how many people said it was "hysterical, but... goes to far". Aside from the actual nudity this movie doesn't go much further than American Pie, which after all has scenes involving drinking bodily fluids and some pretty misogynistic views about women throughout, or Something about Mary's scenes which visually make fun of various body parts. Another Gay Movie is also unrated, which should give some warning. AND its about gay sex, so certain elements of sex are moved center stage, which, I suspect, is the real reason some people think it goes" too far".

And kudos to Richard Hatch for his ability to laugh at himself, kinda funny how no one complains about the rest of the snippets of full frontal nudity in this movie, but zeroes in on him. It's called humor, and over the top is the point.

My only criticism is that the writing is a little rough and the production values and editing could use some improvement.
