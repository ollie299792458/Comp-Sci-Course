It's difficult to capsule review something like, say "The Beatles" or let's say "Leonardo da Vinci".

How would you do it?  Would you say ..  "affected quite a lot of people," "kicked off the Renaissance," ... it's tricky!

Let's focus on JUST - JUST - Miyasaki's (and of course his team's) understanding of the human form - no, let's go further and say "understanding of the nature of time, space and movement."  Of course, this film is the leading, central work of art dealing with these issues.

Or, let's focus on JUST - JUST - painting and the nature of beauty ("art direction" if you will).  Of course, Mr. Oga Kazuo -San, Miyasaki's collaborator, is one of the four or five greatest painters who has ever lived - every background scene from the movie is something to be studied in itself.

And those are merely INCIDENTAL ISSUES, much like discussing that the Beatles were "really good at getting their guitars tuned" or da Vinci was "good at mixing colours".

The movie is an overwhelming work of art, on the nature of what it means to be a human and become yourself.

It's easy to forget it is over 20 years old now (writing in 2010), it looks like it was made today, or, moreover, 500 years in the future.

You could easily argue that in the incredibly horrible, dry, un-sexy, un-human, un-tasty, rubbishy few decades of the world from about 1980, there were very, very few oasis of beauty and human-ity: no doubt, Kiki is one of those few oasis of beauty and human-ity.

Quite simply, a fairy tale originating in our time; set in stone by quite simply the greatest craftsmen alive today or for a few hundred years in either direction. Life is good - you know that because somehow, by a miracle, this work exists.
