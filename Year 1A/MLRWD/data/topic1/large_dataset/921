Bedazzled is a funny movie about a man who has no friends and likes this girl so the "devil" aka Elizabeth Hurley gives him three wishes to do whatever he wants with. He likes this girl Allison so he wishes that he could be with her. All three wishes something goes wrong. Like for instance in one wish He wishes he could be very rich and powerful and be married to Allison...well allison is cheating with her english instructor and he is very rich and powerful, but he is a druglord and finds himself in a very compromising position so he pages the devil, the other wish he ask to be in Allisons life also, he is a basketball player and allison is the reporter and it turns out she laughs at him because his "member" is little and the last one he wishes to be sensitive but he is two sensitive and cries to much (he cries at the sunset) and allison leaves him. All in all he ends up not with allison. This movie is funny. Watch it you wont be dissapointed.
