In my opinion, the movie was excellent.  Even though I felt a few artistic liberties might have been taken, from what I can see, the movie was pretty much 'on point'.  Liam Neeson, did an outstanding job in portraying the Irish leader, Michael Collins, intelligent, highly motivated and passionate about what he was trying to attain, almost to a fault. (Note:  of course I expected no less from the actor - excellent in whatever he portrays).  The movie sheds light on a bit of Irish history regarding the IRB and IRA; the fight to break British total rule over Ireland, and Michael Collins efforts to accomplish this.  The movie should be watched closely , noting, that there was a split among the Irish people and in the end, it was the Irish against Irish (which seems to be ongoing, to some extent,even today).  I had seen/rented the movie before, but it's the kind of movie I can watch again and again.  I enjoyed it that much.  So, I decided to purchase the DVD from Amazon for my own library. When I received the DVD, I immediately watch it over again,twice.  If you are interested in anything regarding a bit of Ireland's history, or the history of the IRB/IRA,I recommend you buy this movie. Each time I watch it, (contrary to what others might feel), I am left with a deep sense of respect for the young Irish leader and what he accomplished during his brief political career.
