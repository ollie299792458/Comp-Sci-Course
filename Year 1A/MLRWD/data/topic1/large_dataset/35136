AFTER THE SUCCESS OF THE ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN, THERE ARE ONLY THREE SEQUELS THAT MANAGED TO RECIEVE GOOD CRITICS REVIEWS (HALLOWEEN 2,4 AND H20) BUT IN MY OPINION HALLOWEEN 4 IS DEFINETLY ONE OF THE BEST SEQUELS OF THE LOT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. 
First of all, the director Dwight H. Little knew, unlike most of the other directors that the original structure of the first film could not be bettered and for this reason he decided to loosely stick to the story whilst introducing some fresh new concepts and direction. Whats more interesting is that as the story is aimed at a more modern audience, Little  blends in the mythology and sinister take of the halloween season like in the original two whilst introducing a much more fast paced storyline that is much more action packed as well as bloodier, gorier and to a certain extent scarier with a few memorable shocks which  the other sequels (apart from part 2) failed to do. Ultimately, this is what makes halloween 4 a cut above the rest.
All in all it is a worthy sequel to the original which accepts that it is just a sequel and using this manages to breathe some fresh new life into the halloween franchise. A MUST SEE!!
