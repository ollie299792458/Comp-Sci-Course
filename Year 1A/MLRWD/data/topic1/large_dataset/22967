Despite being somewhat of a drama film Rain Man is one of the most entertaining films of all time.  Tom Cruise plays the roll of a hot-headed salesman perfectly and Dustin Hoffman is outstanding as the autistic brother he never knew he had.  When Tom Cruise's character learns his dead father left 3 million to his brother who happens to be in a mental intsitutuion, he does the only logical thing by basically kidnapping him in hopes of being able to reach a deal with the hospital.  His brother turns out to be tougher to handle than he thought which pushes him over the edge.  However his brother does possess some unique abilities that he must take advantage of before he learns how much he has come to care for his brother.  Rain Man successfully combines hunmor and drama and is a meaningful experience.  The effects of Cruise's character's poor relationship with his father is portrayed well, and this type of relationship betweeen fathers and sons is all to common in real life.  The ending of the film is also well done as it does not turn out to be as predictable as you might think.
