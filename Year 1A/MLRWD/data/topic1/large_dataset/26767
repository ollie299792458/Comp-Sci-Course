I truly believe that The Shield is one of the greatest works of art ever put onto film.  I'd place it right alongside The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Many people have compared the Shield to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard the Third.  It has also been said, that unlike most television Dramas, the Shield, in its entirety, has a three act structure, with key events happening in the lives of the characters that completely change the dynamic of the show.  I'd have to choose the final season as my favorite, and I also consider the series finale to be the best season finale I've ever seen.  You must watch this show all the way to the final episode.  If you were to stop short of the end, you really would not understand it completely.  Everything that happens in these characters' lives culminates in the final few episodes.  Two days ago, I watched the final episode again.  I've watched the entire series, front to back, twice already, so nothing that happens in the story comes as a surprise anymore.  Despite this fact, when the episode finished, I just sat there, overwhelmed, and almost in shock.  I think my reaction was due to the fact that I was taken aback by the sheer quality of this show, and by the degree in which it affected my life.  The fact that a show this great exists is almost a miracle.
