Like others I have watched the Godfather movies religiously and watched the third installment somewhat with a low expectations because of the negative reviews. Of course coming back to a loved story after so many years is not an easy thing. The movie isn't bad by any means. Just the religious and cult like following the first two Godfather has, it's hard to live up to.

Three things that I thought took away from the quality of the film:

1. Sofia Coppola: she was not good in this movie at all. At times she looked bored, most of the time she looked confused. I believe Francis Ford Coppola, being her father didn't push her enough to the performance the movie deserved from such an important character. Winona Ryder was said to been a contender for this role.

2. Robert Duvall: One of the Best actors from the original cast was left out from this film because of money. He is quoted recently as saying, "I said I would work easily if they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that's fine. But not three or four times, which is what they did," recalls Ducal. His absence and the addition of Sofia was a smack in the face of diehard fans.

3. Andy Garcia: Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he acted like all he did was research on mob guys, I didn't get the impression that he was ever a tough guy in real life. Someone like Johnny Depp would have killed in this role.

There are alot of really good reviews on the movies so I won't write anything long but these three things took away from the quality of the movie for me. I couldn't believe these characters as much as the originals. An excellent gangster movie on it's own, but within the Godfather trilogy definitely the weakest.
