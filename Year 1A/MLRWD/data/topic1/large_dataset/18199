You must leave any sense of skepticism behind in order to enjoy this movie, but less so than "Volcano". Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton are great actors, and they show it in this movie. However, don't expect anything more than a popcorn flick. That being said, Dante's Peak does give some great thrills now and then. It's a good movie to watch with your sound system turned up -- it will certainly give it a workout. Surround details are not distracting, as many movies of this genre can become. I would suspect that the DTS version of this disc has a more enveloping surround field, because the surround field fell a bit flat from time to time in this Dolby Digital version. The video is very good, with few artifacts visible from the compression. Considering the huge amounts of smoke and fog in this movie, that's an acheivement.
Overall, a good disc for some home theater thrill rides.
