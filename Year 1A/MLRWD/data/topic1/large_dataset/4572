Bubbles floating out of teacups. Nuns jumping into swimming pools. All part of everyday life at St. Francis Catholic School... since Mary Clancy and Rachel Deverey joined the school. In this clever and witty movie, Hayley Mills (Mary) and her pal June Harding (Rachel) come to the "perfectly medieval" St. Francis Catholic School. Running the school is a no-nonsense Mother Superior (played to perfection by Rosalind Russell) who is intent on running the school with a firm but patient hand. However, her patience is severely tested when Mary and Rachel use some of Mary's "scathingly brilliant ideas" as practical jokes on the unsuspecting Sisters. The convent is soon turned upside down by the two infamous youngsters, and the driven-to-distraction Mother Superior contemplates expelling the pair. But there may still be a shed of hope for the girls... The script makes for many golden scenes, and Ida Lupino's straight-to-the-point direction keeps the film interesting even when it moves slowly. The supporting players are also memorable: Mary Wickes is great as the gung-ho Sister Clarissa, Marge Redmond is warm and charming as Sister Liguori, and a post-"Sound of Music" Portia Nelson plays another nun, the uptight Sister Elizabeth. And Gypsy Rose Lee makes a most memorable (but sadly brief) cameo appearance as an eccentric dance instructor. This is a rare film that will have the viewer rolling on the floor and finding a heartwarming story among the glorious chaos. A great film, one to watch with the whole family.
