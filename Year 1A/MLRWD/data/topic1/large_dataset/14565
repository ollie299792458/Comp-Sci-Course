Walden Media has done it again. I used to say, "never sell the movie rights," but I have amended that to "Never sell the movie rights to anyone but Walden Media!" For their film version of "Holes" they asked the author to write the screenplay. For this adaptation of "Bridge to Terabithia" they asked the author's son to write the screenplay. He did a fine job. I have not ever seen a film that treated so well the interplay between light and darkness, wonder and drudgery, that we experience in daily life.

This is also a story about the need for fantasy. Early in the film the girl character tells the boy character that they need a place with none of the sort of bullies and tormentors they have to deal with at Junior High. Strangely enough, when they go into their imaginary fantasy world they find they have not managed to leave their real life enemies behind, only changed them into CG creatures. Through play-acting and imagination, the two young teenagers learn courage and compassion that they can then apply to their real life problems. It is a comforting, classic coming-of-age tale, until you get to the end.

Those of you who have read the book know it has a devastating downer of an ending. Take hope. This is a Disney film after all. It does manage to put the end on a more positive note by toning down the angst and emphasizing how the tragedy brings new understanding and prompts Jess to begin building a relationship with his younger sister.

Over all a beautiful film! Buy it!  We want Walden Media to keep making more!
