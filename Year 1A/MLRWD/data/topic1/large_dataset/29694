..."and the American Dream is indicted." Huh? Many of the reviewers here seem to have projected their own feelings into this movie. It seems very popular to state that because the characters are wealthy, and it is a tragedy, then, why of course, the American Dream must be indicted. The theme of this movie is not, "the American Dream indicted," but "You can't go home again."  This is certainly one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen and definitely in my Top 20. The film maker slowly reveals the Ned Merrill's denial of reality as he tries to convince everyone and himself that he still has his job, family, and home. The scene with the empty pool is the most revealing of all the pools. The empty pool is a metaphor for his mental condition. He tells the boy, Kevin Gilmartin, that if you believe in something hard enough it's true for you -- in this case that there is water in the pool. As he leaves he hears the kid on the diving board and thinks the kid is going to dive into the empty pool. So he's worried that he's convinced the kid that by believing in the water that it'll really be there. This reveals that he isn't entirely off his rocker but desperately trying to create his own reality.
