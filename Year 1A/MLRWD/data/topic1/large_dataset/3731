Finding Forester is a Gus Van Zant filmed released in 2000, and starring Rob Brown, Sean Connery, and F. Murrey Abraham.
In the film, Brown plays Jamal Wallace, a talented high school basketball player and gifted writer from the Bronx. In a starnge twist of fate, a dare brings him into contact with William Forrester (Connery) a shut in writer with only one literary masterpiece. Forrest becomes Jamal's writing teacher, and helps him negotiate with the politics of Jamal's new private school and his conflict with teacher(Abraham).
This movie was pleasant enough, stressing important themes such as the price of fame and expectations, the burdens of talent, and the ultimate importance of education.
Watching this movie I was reminded too much of Van Zant's other old man/young man friendship film, Good Will Hunting. These movies are different in many ways, but overall there was just too much of a connection for me. I kept wondering when Robin Williams was going to walk on to the film and say, "It's not your fault."
The cast is quite effective, and newcomer Rob Brown is very believable as the budding genius. F. Murrey Abraham is good as the nasty teacher, but Sean Connery, who also produced this film, steals every scene he is in. Connery's energy and knack for turning the grinch into a father-figure make his work outstanding. This is a nice, watchable film but if you like it, definatly check out some of Van Zant's earlier work, such as Good Will Hunting, or Drugstore Cowboy.
