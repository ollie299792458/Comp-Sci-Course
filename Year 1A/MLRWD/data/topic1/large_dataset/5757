Wow, this was really good! Al Jazeera is said to be too pro-American by the Arab world and has too much propaganda according to Mr. Bush and Donald Rumsfield.

But in reality, Al Jazeera is about as unbiased as you can get. They report everything, I mean literally everything as it happens, uncensored and people blame for trying to show things their way. An example is, our U.S. government thought that Al Jazeera was taking a supposedly "pro-Saddam" view by showing the dead civilians in Iraq.  Then on the same note, our government got mad that Al Jazeera showed the POWs and dead American soldiers when all Al Jazeera is trying to do is show that there is a human cost to war by showing the very unfortunate deaths on both sides.

In Control Room, American soldiers, the U.S. government, Iraqis, and people who work at Al Jazeera talk uncensored about their opinions and feelings.

The part that I thought was the most powerful is when a Al Jazeera worker is upset about the way U.S. government is handling it's foreign policies but admires the U.S. public and our constitution - he says that he believes in our constitution and Americans have enough sense and power to do what is right and they will.

This is a great documentary if want to see news which actually follows the saying - we report you decide.
