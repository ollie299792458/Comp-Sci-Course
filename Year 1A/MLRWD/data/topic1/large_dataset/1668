A little bit of background: I saw this show in London...WOW and I, like another reviewer, bought a code-free DVD player just for this DVD from Australia.  Both the trip abroad and the purchase of another DVD player were totally worth it!
This DVD demonstrates everything wonderful about Kylie and fills in the gap for US fans between 'The Loco-Motion' in 1988 and 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' in 2002.  The set list gives a fair representation of her career overall - especially the "hit" Medley featured mid-concert (a definite highlight).  The updating of some otherwise dated material works great.
Beyond that, it demonstrates what an incredible live performer Kylie is.  She moves beyond the pack of her contemporaries by actually singing and dancing live...and pulling it off.  She may not be considered a powerhouse singer, but what you hear on the album is what you hear live - sometimes even better.
Other artists are so dead serious on the stage (Janet, Madonna) especially in their efforts to be "cool" that the fun quotient suffers in the process.  This show is fun and Kylie seems to be having as much fun as the audience.  It's old fashioned entertainment made modern.  Consequently, Kylie has never been cooler.
Highlights include a show-stopping big-band version of her 1990 hit, 'Better the Devil You Know, a sultry cover version of Olivia Newton-John's 'Physical', the space-age but retro "robot" version of her own 'Light Years' and the pure bliss of her number one hit, 'Spinning Around'.  
She also debuted the world-wide super hit 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' in these shows and once you seen it you won't be able to get the entire show out of your head.
