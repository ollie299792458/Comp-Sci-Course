Tru Calling has potential. The writing in this first seaosn has been some of the worst ever and im sorry to say that the show is just getting silly now. It's a shame because I looovvveee Eliza Dushku and think she's a great actress and unfortunately she gets stuck with this. The Ratings are currently poor and fox decided to give it one more chance - however I dont see things getting better... but wait!

Season 1 in its awfulness has set up a show with tru potential (like the pun there). What we need now from the writers is... well good writing! This will be hugely helped by the amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing x billions Jane Espenson who is joining the show. She is one of the greatest writers of our generation and well Tru should be so lucky to have her.

I would warn you to steer clear of buying Season 1 because if the show flops then there would really be no point in having it especially since season 1 sucks.

Wait a while.. watch it FOX and if things get better (which hopefully they will) then buy.

Improvement in writing and better side-kicks are needed to bring this show to its full potential. I however will not be watching it cos i just cant be bothered (lol im such a hypocrite). And hopefully all this stuff will happen. Stay tuned.
