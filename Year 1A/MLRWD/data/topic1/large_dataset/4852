Others above having encompassed all other aspects of the movie, I'd like to keep mine narrow: Charleton Heston Dystopias comprise a genre-within-a-genre worth exploring if only to analyze their effect on a narrow band of impressionable baby-boomer tail-enders, like myself. Along with POTA, he starred in Omega Man and Soylent Green. These movies all depict a scarred and disappointing future, and it's always mankind's fault. Nuclear war, environmental destruction, germ warfare, it all sucks and its all your [read: white Christian male phallo-centric technology-wielding and utterly blind] fault. If I am any example, these movies provided the seed of a radical environmentalism and disgust, if not outright hatred, of my own species, race, and religion, an outlook it took me decades after to escape from, and one that many on the reactionary Left are still mired in. In fact, the escape was so difficult there was an elastic, or pendular effect, in which one tends to perhaps go too far in the opposite direction before coming to equilibrium. Other movies that contributed to this directly were Silent Running, Bless the Beasts and the Children, Soldier Blue. They had an effect, and put the lie to those who insist that movies and music have no effect on impressionable young minds. These Heston Dystopias are entertaining historical curiosities now, but in many ways they live with us still, and I still love to watch them.
