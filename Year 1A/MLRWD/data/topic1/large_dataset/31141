To start with, the story more than chronicles the various rites
of passage a boy goes through en route to adulthood.  The image
of the camera as an omnicient eye is heavily symbolic - it is
the father who died too early for the child to remember, but it
is also the child's guardian angel, the one who eventually moulds
his character, his decisions, and his future.  There are many
different ways of making a film, and many different kinds of
cameras, and the boy learns all about the film industry, not
realizing that his own life is comparable to a film.  He develops
and refines his own way of looking at the world and interpreting
the things in it, at the same time playing a participant's role
in that same world.  We actually learn more about him by looking
through the other end of the lens, so to speak.  At one point in
the film, he does that himself by reviewing old material and
revisiting old shooting locations.  He experiences it as an odd
yet familiar journey into the known, yet unknown, world he left
behind.
I would recommend this film not just for film-devotees in
general, but also for those who are not embarrassed when faced
with the opportunity to reminisce about the past, who do not
mind surrendering to a graceful mood of nostalgia, and who do
not flinch from reviewing their past with the objectivity of an
all-seeing, all-revealing camera
