"Down To You" is a new teen film by our "good teenage friends" over at Miramax starring Freddie Prinze Jr. (is his carrer  just going to be teen movies after the other?) and Julia Stiles. 
Freddie  plays Al, a college student. He wants to be a chef like his dad (Henry  Winker), but ends up working on his famous television show. His roommates,  are a diffrent story. One is a porn star (Zak Orth) and the other one is  not a chick magnet but wants all the chicks he can get (Shawn Hatosy). All  Al wants is love, but his two other roommates don't agree with him. Julia  plays Imogen (yeah, I don't know how to pronounce it either). She is a  freshman in college and dosen't want to have a romance, but ends up falling  for Al. The rest of the film is just the trouble and tribulations that Al  and Imogen go through during their relationship.
The plot is predictible,  I found out what was gonna happen since the opening scene with Al at the  coffee shop. The film also has some pretty bad acting (Selma Blair as a  pornstar, I don't think so). The film only attracts to teenage girls, so if  you're not female, ages 8 - 17, you're gonna hate this film.
The DVD  contains a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer, good surrounding Dolby  Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, and some not-so-worthy extras (the  behind-the-scenes at the music video lasts 30 seconds while the  behind-the-scenes at the film lasts 1 minute). The extras are mostly what  you find on VHS, but the transfer make up for what lacks on this DVD.
I  cannot recommend this film, but give it a rent if you really want to see  it. Be warned.
