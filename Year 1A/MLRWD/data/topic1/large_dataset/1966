People say that interesting characters and a strong plot are the only things that truly matter in a movie.  This is not true, especially in science fiction.  How many people love the film ALIEN?  I do; it's one of my all-time favorites.  Now how many of us can say that the characters in that film were actually interesting?  Of course they weren't...they were mundane.  Yes, the acting was superb, but The Black Hole's acting isn't too bad, either.  Schell and Forster are great, and Borgnine is fun to watch.  The characters may be cardboard and the plot may be thin, but atmosphere holds the entire film together.  The sets and matte paintings aren't just good- they're fantastic.  Space has never looked so beautiful or mysterious.  The Cygnus is hands-down the coolest ship ever on film (the Nostromo comes in second).  It's bright on the outside, and dark and gloomy on the inside; you really have to see it for yourself.  Both the Sentry robots and the humanoids go well with the ship; the cloaked humanoids were especially creepy, and the scenes that revolved around them were handled expertly.  I especially loved the scene where the captain explored the crew's chambers- John Barry's score fit in perfectly. And that Max is one heck of an awesome creation.  The final twenty minutes are both entertaining and full of suspense.  Perkins' death, the rolling meteor, and the moody journey through heaven and hell are very memorable.  So- is the dialogue dumb?  Yes. Are the cute robots out of place?  Yes.  Is the plot thin and predictable?  Yes.  But this movie is  so full of atmosphere, great music, weird visions, and incredible visuals that all that is forgotten.  Go see it- it's really quite something else.
