SENSE & SENSIBILITY: Excellent! It's a gentler version than the semi-faster paced Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson version. Granted they had more time to devote to it, but still I like this version more. It even shows Colonel Brandon confronting Willoughby, which I didn't know was in the book ( but says so in the interviews ). Dan Stevens is PERFECT as Edward Ferrars, topping Hugh Grant in every way! It even shows Edward coming to visit the Dashwood Cottage and almost decides tells Elinor his secret.

PERSUASION: On the whole, very well done. However, toward the end, Anne Elliot runs all over tarnation "looking" for the Captain and is out of breath when she ends up back home. **Then the next moment when Anne Elliot & Captain Wentworth kiss for the first time ~ it got a little cheesey, goofy & stupid looking. They "air kiss" as they move closer and Anne Elliot moves her lips like a FISH ...and... finally after 5 minutes of Fish Lips, they actually kiss.  OTHER THAN THAT ~ it's very well done.
