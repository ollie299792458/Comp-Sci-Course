I've been a JL fan since the 1970s and loved the Bruce Timm produced JL and JL Unlimited series in the early to mid 2000s as well as Bruce Timm's DCAU movies. JL Doom is OK, I don't think it's nearly as good as Justice League Crisis on Two Earths. The story here is has potential but I think the execution could have been better. Two key characterization flaws here. I don't like how Wonder Woman is de-powered so much here. In Crisis on Two Earths she fought toe-to-toe and eventually got the better of the evil superwoman who was knocking Superman around. Here Diana can barely hold her own strength-wise against Cheetah and it appears they took her ability to fly away. I'd say they made her barely as strong as Spiderman compartively speaking here. The other big characterization flaw is how the Flash is portrayed. In this movie he is Barry Allen, police scientist (well CSI officer here). But the Flash is portrayed as wisecracking, and somewhat immature ...a hallmark of Wally West's personality which was well established and consistent in the JL/JLU TV series. That is not Barry Allen's personality. I agree with others in that I'm glad they used a main villan other than Luthor/Joker. Vandal Savage was a good choice. The fight sequences here aren't as good as Crisis on Two Earths. The way Hal Jordan was defeated was interesting. Despite its flaws if you are a JL fan you should watch this and despite my lukewarm reception to this movie I hope they keep making these movies because these films are a great escape.
