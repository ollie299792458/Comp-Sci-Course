I was expecting a boring sappy story about ballet, what I found was one of the most entertaining films ever.  It is a wondrous look at the world of ballet.  Who knew that a Midwest teen would find ballet cool.  The cast is super especially Boris.  We watch two young people achieve their dreams in the competitive world.  They start out ignorant and ignored in a great scene where both Julian and Vicky are pushed aside. There is a wonderful shot from the stage that is dizzying to show Vicky's perspective.  Highlighted by a beautiful ballet piece in the middle.  The sequence is a great moment on film.  Beautifully photographed with wondrous lights and special effects.  It takes the sequence to another level.  Hypnotic and mystifying.  A wonderful scene is the dance with the newspaper.  The curious changing of perspective shows us a glimpse into the future with Boris and Julian appearing in the dance briefly.  This of course leads to a fascinating parallel of the Red Shoes in the lives of Vicky, Julian, and Boris.  In the film's most powerful scene the Red Shoes goes on without anyone in Vicky's role.
