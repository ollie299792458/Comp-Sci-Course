Critical praise or damnation aside, Forrest Gump, simply, should be seen by all people who really love "Hollywood" films.  What do I mean?  Well, Hollywood has a knack for making empty films that say nothing and mean nothing.  However, every so often, they get it right AND the films wins Best Picture.  
I can think of only two other Best Picture examples that compare to Forrest Gump in their appeal, their scope, their grandeur, their humor, their characters, and their place in Hollywood...Gone With The Wind and All About Eve.  Why?  
Because each focused on a central character whose existence both set and altered the course of all those they encountered.  I am no true fan of the very one-note Tom Hanks, but, his face is one of the sweetest images ever captured on film as Forrest Gump.  It is remarkable, truly.  
The supporting cast is no less than perfect, however, the best supporting act in this film has been largely overlooked.  Alan Silvestri's score.  Listen to his suite as it appears on the double cd soundtrack.  Magnificent.  I defy anyone to listen to that on loud, and not be moved or inspired.  In fact, the Academy, finally understanding the importance of music and that comedy films and dramatic films cannot possibly compete against each other, divided the Original Score category the following year.  However, it was one year too late, as Forrest Gump's score lost to the bland and generic Lion King score.
If you have seen Forrest Gump and loved it, you already know what I mean.  If you haven't seen Forrest Gump, you must only see it on DVD or Letterboxed VHS.  YOU CANNOT SEE A CROPPED VERSION!  I hope, for your sake, you enjoy it.
