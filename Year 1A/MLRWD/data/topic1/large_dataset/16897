This dvd is an awesome buy. If you like Daft Punk and Anime, get it. If you like either one, get it. If you don't like either, this may change your mind.

When Daft Punk was morking on their album 'Discovery' the contacted one of their idols in animation, Leiji Mastumoto.  Matsumoto is famous manga like 'Galxay Express 999' or anime 'Space Battleship Yamamoto". They wanted an animated story told through thier music. There is no spoken dialog during the whole film, just Daft Punks unique style of elctronic music and their lyrics. This pairing seems to work exceedingly well.

I actualy make fan music videos for some of my favorite anime an must say that this is very brilliant seeing somthing similar so professionaly done.

I call this best of both worlds because not only does it pair good elctronic music and great classic anime. It also joins some culture across the globe, Paris and Tokyo and gaining ground in the USA

Check it out, its welll worth it.
