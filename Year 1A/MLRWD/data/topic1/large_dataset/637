I saw this movie way back in March or April 2005 at a preview screening to get our thoughts and to pick out any mistakes.  My 8 year daughter and I attended in a packed theater.  Even though it wasn't in it's completed format, you couldn't tell.  The movie is a delightful movie and we really liked it.  Cale (Dakota Fanning) wants to join her father (Kurt Russell) at his job as a race horse trainer and he reluctantly brings her along.  One day at a race, a horse takes a bad fall and breaks his leg.  The owner, Kurt's boss, wants the horse shot, but because Cale is there, Kurt won't do it and saves the horse, but loses his job in the process.  The story continues with how they hope to breed the horse to make money, but that falls apart so they then hope to heal the horse to race again.  There are alot of ups and downs to the tale which keeps you guessing somewhat, but a rather predictable ending.  But I didn't care, I loved the scenery of the horse country in Kentucky.  Absolutely beautiful.  Kris Kristofferen did a good job as Kurt's father and they do look like they could be father and son in real life.  This is a very good family movie.  I look forward to seeing it again in it's final version.  I learned alot about the horse racing industry from this film and anybody who loves horses will enjoy this movie, guaranteed.  My now 9 year old daughter wants to see it again she liked it that much.  So go ahead and take the whole family!
