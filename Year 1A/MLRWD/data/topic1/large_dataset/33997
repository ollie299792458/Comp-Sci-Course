Firstly, I loved the characters in this film.  The acting was supurb, although that is expected from Bill Murry and the other cast members.  It was the little things that made this film enjoyable: how Don always knew it was Winston when he answered the phone, Lola's pink earrings, the cat on the cusion, the pink typwriter, Don's favorite track suits, and the scenes of the side-view mirror.

A few things bugged me, however.  I didn't like how we never knew where Don was when he visited each woman.  The landscape always looked the same, and I would have at least like to see some geographical differences: desert for one woman, palm trees for another, perhaps Iowa cornfeilds and wind turbines in another.  Also, the ending seemed to leave us halfway though the plot. It is one thing to be left with new questions at the end of a movie, but now we are only left with the same questions that were posed at the beginning.

The music in the film was wonderful, and I loved how it was incorporated through Winston's mixed CD.  I will probably be buying the soundtrack, but not the DVD.  Go to Blockbuster for this one.
