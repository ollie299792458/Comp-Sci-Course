This is a wonderful film, having seen it on stage it has more debth. Yes, some
scs enes drag yet if ever a remake I would hope the "book" would be expanded."
The music, sets, costumes are simply remarkable, as is the late "RICHARD HARRIS,"
who I saw perform this on stage. That production had more depth for I think
they added speaches for him. And I don't compare "apples from oranges,"
or "My Fair Lady," which came with a book and "Camelot," which didn't. But it
came from many written books.

ONE COMPLAINT: the first review is in the year 2000. Nothing from the newly
released, repackaged version. Been told the only change is packaging. This
has not been restored. And I've seen no one review the packaged one so I felt
you should know that the "art" looks wonderful but you get the same picture
from years before.

But it is being put together on "BLU RAY." And perhaps there will be some
remastering and more extras. Many are included in the dvd versions.
And as for Blu Ray I'm disappointed that they are doing what is bein done
with dvds. Less price for a Blu Ray that only includes the picture. No extras.
So why buy? But I love the combo packs for what I dislike about "Blu Ray" is that
is should be programmed to play in any dvd player.

Camelot will always be special.
