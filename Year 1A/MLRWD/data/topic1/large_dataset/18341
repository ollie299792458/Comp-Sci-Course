After a long time between viewing for me I found Hook better than ever. Spielberg did it again. Like many of his others he has created a truly magical and inspiring film which will be utterly amazing to a children and hysterical and heartfelt to adults. 
Containing some of the best performances I have seen and almost faultless casting ( lost boys were a bit off, and pans son drives you up the wall ),  it includes Robin Williams - as the pan "who did grow up" into a middle aged overweight lawyer, Bob Hoskins - as the utterly lovable pirate smee, Julia Roberts - as tinkerbell and Maggie Smith - as a touching older Wendy. The movie however is stolen by Dustin Hoffmans rendition of - Captain Hook. Talk about an actor made for a role, Hoffman doesn't falter once, he is fantastic. Deviant but charming throughout he times some clever one-liners perfectly and makes you feel privileged to seen such phenomenal acting.
With the help of spectacular scenery ( Hooks ship and the North symbol in the ocean are particular favorites ), fantastic costumes ( excluding Tinkerbells party dress - looked like it came out of an opshop )  and some of the funniest dialogue you will hear ( Hooks me, me, me, my, my, my, now, now, now speech for one ) you'll be screaming "Good form" in no time.
So forget what the critics said on its release ( they are always wrong anyway ) and trust the viewers for I have never met one who doesn't love this movie. You will love it.
