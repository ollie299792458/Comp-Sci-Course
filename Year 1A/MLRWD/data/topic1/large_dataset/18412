Final Fantasy Unlimited has great qualities one may look for in an animated series.  First of all, the story is pretty decent and captivating.  It starts off a little slow, but once things pick up, it really is hard to be pulled from.
The story is basically about two children looking for their parents who have mysteriously disappeared in the world of Wonderland.  The two find their way into Wonderland, beginning their adventure of mystery and exotic lands.
There is a combination of animations.  One animation type looks hand drawn and simplistic.  The artwork is not very detailed, but still done nice.  The second type of animation is 3D computer generated.  It sounds like the two and two wouldn't work together, but they blend well nicely.
It's a great series to watch for a Final Fantasy fan because it has qualities from the games.
1.) There are summons such as Phoenix.
2.) Fanfare Victory music is played: just like the games.  (maybe cheesy, but it's there)
3.) There are chocobos.  (chocobo music is even played)
4.) In all Final Fantasy games, there's a man named Cid.  In FF: Unlimited, there is also a man named Cid.
For a start, FF: Unlimited (Phase 1) is well done.  The first episode may be a little slow, but it's great when it picks up.  The lead characters have great personalities.  However, I find the little girl a little obnoxious at times.  The chocobo is cute, as it likes to yank on the little girl's hair and yell out, "KWEH!" from time to time.  The enemies in this series are a little corny, but all in all not bad.
I give Phase 1 a 4 stars because of the slow start.  I also didn't like feeling like FF: Unlimited was a rip from Alice in Wonderland.  I wish they would've named the world something a little more creative, but that's just me being picky.
