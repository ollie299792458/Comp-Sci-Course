A trio of the best the US air-force have to offer are selected for a special mission - to fly with an experimental AI stealth jet. A lightning-strike later and the AI goes whacky, breaking loose all hell.

Okay, so this is more Top Gun than 2001 - hammy acting, a cliched script and plot-holes aplenty - but this movie should not be underestimated.

Any seasoned fan of the action genre should have little trouble predicting the plot frame-for-frame for the first hour, and will be quite content - as I was - to ooh and aah at the pretty pictures and flashy effects (not to mention Jessica Biel in a bikini).

But then, all of a sudden, something unexpected happens. There's a plot twist! And rather an interesting one (albeit within the regular themes of what it means to be 'alive', how far are those in power willing to go to further their own ends and finding friends in the most unusual places). The results aren't exactly innovative or thought-provoking, but it's nice that they tried and it certainly justifies the latter hour.

On the technical side of things, the special effects are superb and the action sequences are well choreographed and exciting, with some imaginative exploitation of the completely unrestricted 'camera'. The actors' performances are nothing of merit, but good enough in the context of the movie and there are some pretty stonking tunes on the soundtrack.

All in all, Stealth is very entertaining and well worth a Saturday night in.
