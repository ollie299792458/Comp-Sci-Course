Don't let the 3 stars throw you off, I'm referring to this particular DVD.  Finally we get an anamorphic widescreen version of it, which is great.  Except, the retards who produced it still are using a single layer DVD.  That means they're trying to produce the entire movie in just 4.7GB of space, including the menus and trailers.  (As many know, most commercial releases of movies use dual layer discs, with up to ~9GB capacity, often they use 7-8GB, this actually uses 4.5GB of the 4.7 available.)  So, if you didn't buy the other release, which has the movie presented as widescreen but not anamorphic (ie, designed to play on a 4:3 TV and has a lot of padding), this is the better version, especially since it contains that version on the other side of the movie disc.  The case is metal, which is neat, but it is devoid of any words, except "The Boondock Saints" and "Unrated Special Edition".  Unfortunately the movie disc is a double sided disc, so we don't get any disc art except on the special features disc...better than the old version, but if you have the old one, this isn't worth your money.
