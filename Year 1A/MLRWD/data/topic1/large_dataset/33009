"The Motorcycle Diaries" starts out as a buddy "road-trip" movie. It's two protagonists, Ernesto Guevarra ("Fuser," his nickname throughout the movie, as he is not yet the radical revolutionary "Che," the name the world would eventually know him by) and his cousin Alberto Granados ("Mial") go on what is supposed to be a wild motorcycle joy ride around South America. The plan is to be ambulant party animals, and the early part of the film is precisely that. The cousins get into alcohol induced hijinx as they try to drink, fornicate with the local women, and party through the continent, riding from one town into another.

But little do they know that fate would twist their romp into what would be a soul-searching expedition. Their Norton 500 motorcycle breaks down halfway up the Chilean coast. The pair would have to live like tramps, living off the kindness of strangers hitch-hiking the rest of the way.

They face adversity as they tramp their way through Chile; witness the horrendous working conditions of migrant mine workers  at Chuquicamata; live among disposessed and oppressed indigenous Incas in Peru; reach an emotional checkpoint when they climb the "Stairway to Heaven" and reach Machu Pichu; and embark on a tramp steamer to a lepper colony on the Amazon, where Guevarra witnesses the difference beween the living conditions between those who can afford First Class, who have their own cabins, and everyone else, who are packed like livestock while being towed in a barge that is exposed to the elements.

At the lepper colony Guevara and Granados volunteer as medics. It is here that Guevarra's transformation is complete. He is no longer "Fuser", the drunken party animal, but "Che", the radical revolutionary.

This film is an awesome view into the 6 month journey of a lifetime!!!
