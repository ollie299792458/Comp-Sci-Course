This movie is simply put, a splendid action featuring Arnold Schwarzeneggar. This movie knows exactly what it is and exactly what audience is wathcing this movie and caters to them perfectly: the action audience. It has every possible cliche imaginable because it really does stick so perfectly to the genre and pleases its audience greatly. Somehow, even though the movie is so cliche, it pulls every scene off in grand fashion. It truly is surprising to see a movie like this and actually love it. I am a college educated man, yet even I knew I had to buy it. It is just that much fun.

It is an action; it stars Arnold; he is a commando...what more is there to action movies!? EXPLOSIONS! FIGHTING! CLICHE BAD GUY MONOLOGUES! HAMMY ACTING! LOOK OUT! Loads of fun are coming your way. If you were to ask me why this movie is so amazingly popular, then all I can say is that sometimes people just need to watch guys get the crap shot and beat out of them by a giant Austrian.

Wonderful movie! 5 stars! And I am not being sarcastic. You just have to see it to know why it is so great. It just is.
