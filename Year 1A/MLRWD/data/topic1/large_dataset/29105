Rachel Marron, portrayed by Whitney Houston, is a worldwide superstar singer and actress who has millions of adoring fans but one has taken there admirations too far.  In a world of glamour and celebrity Marron fights to maintain her career and Frank Farmer, her bodyguard, fights to keep her alive.

Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluted view that she is invincible.

Houston plays a charachter that paralells her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan.  Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career.  Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shinging moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible.  Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role.

Bodyguard, although panned by many critics, was extremly successful at the box office both domestically and worldwide.  The 8th highest grossing film of all time, Bodyguard was financially a success for Houston but her acting performance was ignored by critics.  The film has many twists and turns and keeps you guessing.  It is not an Oscar worthy performance by Houston, but highly entertaining!
