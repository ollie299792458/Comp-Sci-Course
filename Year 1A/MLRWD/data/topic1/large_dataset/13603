Wow... I saw this last night not knowing a thing about it, and what can I say, I really liked it.

I've read the other reviews and can see that people feel strongly in either hating this picture, or loving it.  I guess drawing out strong emotional responses like this is a good thing.

The film worked for me.  It was visually stunning, and accompanied with an equally beautiful score that complimented the cinematography perfectly.

I found the story compelling.  Love and desire, and how they weigh on the psyche, and the torment and anguish they can cause.

The actors provided the framework and the story was told in a more visual and musical sense.  When put all together they seemed to click with me.

What drove the story home was the last letter and the twist behind it.  That said a lot about the power of love, and appreciating what we have.

Sorry to all those who hated this, but I enjoyed this film and the story it tried to convey.
