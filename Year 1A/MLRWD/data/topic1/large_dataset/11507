I am another late bloomer to this show (having been more interested in Stargate SG! and Stargate Atlantis) but have come to love the show and the characters.

My favorite character is Gibbs, with Tony DiNozzo a close second. I like how Mark Harmon plays him and how his character has evolved over the seasons. I would love to have a boss like him that I could trust to have my "six".

The only thing that I wish is that they would do more commentaries on the episodes. The other shows that I have DVD sets (Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, they actually have commentaries on almost all of their episodes after season 3 from actors, directors and producers) have more commentaries. I find it fun to hear what the actor/director was thinking when they did a particular scene, or relate a funny moment.

Michael Weatherly and Pauley Perrette's commentaries were a lot of fun. It made me want to be there with them.

Anyway, I'm now an ardent fan (I even read as much NCIS fanfiction as I can get my hands on - LOL) and will be here for years to come.
