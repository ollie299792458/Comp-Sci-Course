From the very first scene, it's obvious that the script has been expertly crafted. To condense a wonderful novel into a wonderful film can't be easy, and Emma Thompson did the best job of adapting an Austen novel into a film script that I've ever seen. Each scene is carefully written to tell the viewer exactly what she needs to know. For example, the opening scenes of Fanny and John make their relationship to each other and their eventual (mis)treatment of the Dashwood sisters painfully evident. And it doesn't hurt things that the cast is wonderful. Emma Thompson (though technically too old to be Elinor) is, as always, wonderfully expressive, and Alan Rickman does a great job of evoking sympathy and respect for Col. Brandon. The only weak spot I found was Hugh Grant. He seems extremely uncomfortable in 18th century clothes, and I found his mannerisms distracting. But other than that, this movie has mined much of the emotion as well as much of the humor from Austen's novel, and I highly recommend it.
