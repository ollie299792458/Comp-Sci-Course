This film is a `90s version of the classic Robin Hood story, with Kevin Costner starring as the good-guy thief. Costner is joined in his efforts against the murdering Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Richman) who once again proves why he makes an excellent villain. Richman  won best supporting actor in the British Academy Awards for his excellent roll.
Along with Morgan Freeman who plays a philosophizing side kick Azeem, and by Nick Brimble, who plays Little John (anything but little). After Robin barely survives a watery skirmish with Little John, the two become allies and Robin joins forces with Little John's band of robber thieves to overcome the evils of the Nottingham sheriff. 
You don't really have to be a die-hard Robin Hood fan to enjoy this movie. The film has a few flaws and stretches the historical aspect somewhat but it plays out well with plenty of action, adventure, humor, and fun.
Robin Hood Price of Thieves was directed by Kevin Reynolds and produced by Warner Studios.
