"To Kill a Mockingbird" is, in my opinion, absolutely the finest film ever made.  Filmed in timeless black and white and perfectly cast, this motion picture is a work of art.  As for the "politically correct" reviewer who panned the film because of perceived "black stereotyping", and suggested it not be shown to anyone under 21 years of age, all I can say is sad.....very sad.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" should be required viewing for every child in public school in America, it might actually help to counter the influences of Darwinism and Secular Humanism that are destroying American culture and civility.

The performance of Robert Duvall as "Boo" Radley is, alone, worth the price of admission, but John Megna, as young "Dill" Harris, steals the film as far as I'm concerned.  Megna, the brother of actress Connie Stevens, passed away in 1995 but will always be remembered for his role as "Dill".

Everyone should, in my opinion, own a copy of "To Kill a Mockingbird".  And if you watch it.....and aren't moved by it.....well, maybe you should have a close family member call the undertaker.
