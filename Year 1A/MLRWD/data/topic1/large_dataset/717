As a huge fan of Asian horror(just look at my other reviews) this movie really ticks me off the most. When this movie first came about it wasn't that interesting to begin with and the ghost weren't scary they were boorrriiinngg. Then for whatever reason someone who watched Asian horror for the first time in their life (probably the only horror movie they've ever seen in their life at that) saw this movie and said oh my goodness this is amazing! The the Domino effect takes place and all of a sudden everyone that has never seen an asian horror film now thinks of Ju On as the pinnacle. Well folks... I'm here to tell you that it's not. Ju-on just happens to be the one that got all the attention somehow because someone with some pull watched it and the rest is history.

There's plenty of other Asian horror movies that were more amazing but this one just stood out for whatever reason...and while I'm at it screw The Ring too! So now that the The Grudge and The Ring were such great success every other Asian movie now has decided to copy an element from it. No longer are we getting those great original asian horror flicks no we just get recycled grudge and ring ideas over and over and over again and you know what I'm Sick of it! I hated this movie to begin with and now Asian horror has never been the same since it. I see why this is known as the grudge... because I certainly have had one with it since it came into light.
