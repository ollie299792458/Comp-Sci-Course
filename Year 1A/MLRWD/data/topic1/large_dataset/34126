Hard to tell what kind of movie this was, as the quality of the DVD was junk.  I fully feel ripped off regarding this DVD, as it is basically unwatchable.  What I would have wanted to know before purchasing, is that the DVD, was made from an average copy of a VHS tape.  The quality of the video was mediocre at best.  The only way to watch the film in it's entirety is to watch the first chapter, then click on the second chapter. Watch the second chapter then click on the third chapter, to watch that part, and on and on.  The graphics on the cover, looked like screen shots, that any fool with an eighth grade education and a computer could duplicate in about fifteen minutes.

As far as the retailer, who offered this 'DVD' .... several attempts to contact them, by email, resulted in no responses.  Meaning specifically that I will never buy from this retailer again, and have and will continue to recommend no one else use this retailer again, unless they drastically change their responses in regards to issues with product, and stop selling illegal VHS to DVD copies, as if they were actually DVD movies.
