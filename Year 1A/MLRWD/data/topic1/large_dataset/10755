its decent.  its lacking the spark of the earlier films.  it had humor. its not as predictable as it appears to be. courtney cox is awesome. you really feel for sid in this one because everyones blaming her for ghostfaces reappearance like its her fault that shes being stalked.  there a new girl in the movie that really reminds me of the old gayle weathers and gayle cant stand her.  its too funny.
Blood, lots of blood. Buckets. theres a room after a girl gets gutted and you would never believe that much blood would even be realistic. for real, like the whole room is red. everything is red. never been so much blood since sweeney todd.  It seems me to me by the gag reel that they actually used computer effects to do the blood because people are getting stabbed in the neck and fountains of blood comes spewing out.

*SPOILER ALERT*

If your watching this movie because of anna paquin theres really no need to bother. she plays a character in one of the stab movies and she gets killed in like one minuet or less. she was actually one of my main reasons for seeing this.

Rory Culkin is in the whole movie though.
