The actors are all superb in this extraordinary film about the issue of bigotry with regard to Mexican-Americans, women and the poor.  There is not even a hint of melodrama in the portrayals of either the villains or the heroes, making it a film that I never tire of watching.  The issue of bigotry is just as relevant today as it was in 1956 when the movie was made and in 1952 when the book was published.  James Dean reveals his true range of acting ability in his portrayal of Jett Rink from a poor and rebellious young kid to a middle-aged oil tycoon.  Rock Hudson's portrayal of a rich Texas patriarch is quite realistic, despite the overly romantic roles he usually played.  Elizabeth Taylor, too, is convincing as a young woman from a family of privilege in Maryland adjusting to life in the modern west without sacrificing any of the values she had acquired while growing up.  Everyone in this film does not appear to be "acting." They all seem true-to-life, making this film a joy to see many times without tiring of the lessons about bigotry.
