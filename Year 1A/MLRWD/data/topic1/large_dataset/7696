I saw this movie on DVD and it actually turned out to be a lot of stuff: it's funny, it's boring, it's predictable and it's stupid in some scenes..

This certainly was a remake of another movie called "Yours Mine And Ours", and I haven't seen the original, and I do think they made this movie to copy "Cheaper By The Dozen", but for me this was better. CBTD was just boring, plus it was very predictable, and the main story was very dumb.

This movie is definitely not an Oscar winner, but there are some other elements that make it good. First of all, Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo made a great acting, and it was very funny. Then, the story was weird, but I think the reason why I did like this is because the pranks and jokes are very funny, and I think that if that same thing happened to me (to have to live with other kids as a family) I would act the same way.

The only thing I didn't like much is the ending, it was soooo predictable, but the rest is okay.

I think I wouldn't pay to own this DVD, but I don't regret I saw it only once.
