Ok Everybody know Return Of The Living Dead is Perfect in every way!!! And that ROTLD Part 2 is far from it and it's nowhere near as great as the first one!!! But that being said I thought it was still pretty enjoyable. Ok the main lead Michael or Ken Pennyworth is pretty young in this movie so maybe his acting wasn't world class but it was ok, they should've had Will Smith in here telling him to stop cussing because he was bad at it, like in I'Robot. I did love the return of James Karen and Thom Matthews, that was good they weren't  Frank and Freddy but Ed and Joey were pretty entertaining. The zombies were cool but. But I hated the zombies kid he was just really F**^ing annoying and was he supposed to be scary or something LOL!!!  It did have Susane Snyder in it which I liked! The sister character was likeable I thought , the cable guy was cool too!! My favorite character in this movie is Dr. Mandel he was very funny and likeable and had some funny lines ie "your fly is down" or "must've been a fuse" and my "favorite Tell me son, have you ever seen a grown man drunk?" . Thanks for reading!
