Saw this flick on cable & loved it. the cinematography is not that bad, no worse than TV, not some big budget blockbuster & never claimed to be, but about on par with the old Dukes of Hazzard. the worst (to me) part is the fact that it is based on an actual event, whether that's an "old plot" is irrelevant (maybe that's where the compost pile got the idea from? - complain to him that he wasn't that "original"). Danielle DeLucia is very hot & can act, though it is true that there are several places where she has the advantage & instead of putting a bullet or blade threw his eye socket she just runs away, but after reading these reviews, I reconsidered her actions as that of someone who's not emotionally equipped at that point to take someone else's life - even if it was the logical thing to do - shes not Spock after all & some people just can't, & viewed threw that light it's far more believable & at the end she learned to. as for the boys being killed - that just points out the extent of the ruthless subhuman nature of her pursuer! All together a fantastic film with suspense, action and a very beautiful very nude girl. I watched it several times in the same month it was on & never got tired of it.
