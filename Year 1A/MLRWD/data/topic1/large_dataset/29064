Where do I start?  Well, this film is nothing short of a classic.  The fact that it has made an everlasting impact on our culture since the films release in 1967 and stood the test of time is on it's own amazing.  The fact that people are still talking about this movie thirty some years later speaks for itself.  And it's odd that this film that was perhaps looked at by some as a B-movie due to it's dubbing of italian into english and is now looked at as high art.  Everything from the acting to the directing to the truly amazing musical themes throughout is truly stunning.  The set pieces still look pretty good for how old it is too.  I like that I can watch this film and feel the sense of adventure... that's my favorite thing about it.  It has that same sense of excitement as perhaps an Indiana Jones film.  It's an epic that takes place in many different locations as the characters cross throughout the Southwest(actually Italy...spaghetti westerns)And it is an adventure in watching them do so.  This movie has inspired the likes of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and most certainly Quentin Tarantino especially seen in Kill Bill vol.2(I think he even used some of Ennio Morricone's music from this film in his.)  As for the dvd, it's loaded to the brim with extras.  My favorite was the one where they showed the difficulty in restoring the film...that one is pretty cool!  The added fifteen minutes of footage don't really add a whole lot to the picture but it is nice to see the directors true vision finally come to life with this release.  Sergio Leone was a true genius!
