How anyone could enjoy this tripe is beyond me. This movie falls into the category of "dumbing down" to appeal to the market (or some executive). If you are seeking a better modern film I'd suggest seeing Centurion instead. The first glaring insult was the American accents and slang thrown in as if this were an episode of Hercules or Xena. The characters seem to be putting on airs and there is no connection felt to any of them. I will not even broach the subject of historical innacuracies (A mild example beyond sayings, customs,etc would be taking what should be tribal Celts and giving them the appearance of "bush men"??). It's a short story that is then drawn out into a two hour time frame. At one point the movie does what can only be described as a take from Monty Python as the characters run across the landscape of Britain (drum roll please as a character approaches a hill each time). Within the first 10-15 minutes the decision was to leave the movie theater. Being a glutton for punishment I stayed and felt that I punished our 16 year old son for not cleaning his room by having him sit through the rest.
