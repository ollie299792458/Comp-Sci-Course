Well, my gosh, what a waste of time, U2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes (u2.com members, ticket prices.)

I won't go on and on about U2 being sold out, where it all went wrong, all I know is that U2 are getting by and panicked when Popmart was'nt well recieved, mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it.

So the DVD... boring whats wrong with it

1. Crap editing, as others have mentioned

2. The band look bored

3. Bono looks like fat Elvis

4. Bono can't sing anymore

5. Was it really neccesary to have a camera in Bonos sunglasses?

6. Extras??? Two thirty second clips of Zoo TV and Popmart both of which they have'nt released on DVD and both of which are impossible to buy as VHS is extinct now. (Despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums.)

7. The credits are listed as a extra feature.

8. Plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album "All that you can't leave behind".

....has its moments, but at the end of the day its the performance that counts, not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable!! camera editing.

If you want to have a collection of U2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add "Rattle and Hum" "Actung Baby" "Zoo TV live from Sydney" and "Popmart" VHS's to your collection, thats if you can dig them up from anywhere.

U2 have yet to release a decent DVD, dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth.
