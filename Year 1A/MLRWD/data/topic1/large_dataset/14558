I'd like to start this review by stating that, in my opinion, Al Pacino should have received another acting nomination in 1995 for his performance in this movie.  Additionally, this movie should have been at least  nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.  However, having said that, I  can rest safe in the knowledge that the Academy made their mistake.  This  is a truly great film, and I never tire of seeing it.  The performances are  all dead-on (especially Pacino's), the action is first-rate, and the  cinematic style is truly unique.  Cinematographer Dante Spinotti captures a  vision of Los Angeles, both by day and by night, that is nothing short of  mesmerizing.  
One curious thing about the movie is its willingness to  explore the relationships of its characters.  If it's constant action  you're looking for, go somewhere else.  This movie is about crime, the  people who fight it, and the relationships destroyed by it.  It is told in  a flashy style that probably kept Academy voters away, but what do they  know?  
Here's a tip:  set aside 3 hours, sit back, and absorb this film.  It's one of the best movies of the 1990s.
