Fair Game is based on the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, who shares some of the qualities exhibited by Gary Oldham's character in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both are stunningly skilled operatives.  Most of the story you know:  The Bush administration had decided to go to war in Iraq.  Seeking reasons to justify an attack, it seized on a report that the nation of Niger (not Nigeria) had sold uranium to Iraq.  Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador to Niger, was sent to seek such evidence.  He found none.  In fact, he learned that such sales would have been physically impossible.  His report was ignored.  War was begun using the nonexistent uranium sales as cause.  He wrote an article in the New York Times reporting the truth.  In order to discredit him, someone in the administration leaked the information to Chicago Sun-Times columnist Robert Novak that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA agent.  Eventually, Cheney aide, Scooter Libby, was tried and convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury, sentenced to prison, and had his sentence commuted by Bush.  The part of the story you probably do not know was the "collateral" damage.  Plame's sensitive work in the Middle East was disrupted and as many as 70 of her informants were killed.  The Plame-Wilson family (including young twins) came close to breakup.
Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are excellent as Plame and Wilson, even looking remarkably like them.  The film does not change the names of any principals, uses actual footage of administrative figures, and even closes with footage of Plame herself testifying before congress.  Here are a couple of ifs:  If Wilson had kept quiet, Plame's CIA work wouldn't have been destroyed.  On the other hand, if the Bush administration hadn't suppressed Wilson's information and smeared Wilson and Plame, there might have been no Iraq War.  A story worth contemplating.
