I purchased this during Thanksgiving and just received this trilogy set along with multiple other blurays in the mail. When I open the set I go straight to adding the digital copy to my collections, to my surprise the CODE provided inside the box IS EXPIRED on 11/30/11! That was just yesterday! I emailed Universal and am waiting for their response.

---UPDATE---
After emailing universal I decided to try again a couple hours later, I start with Part II code and allows me to redeem! So I try Part III code and again it works, finally the first Part works too! I don't know if it has to do with the email or it was just the iTunes redemption system. I tripled checked the codes when submitting them.

For those who buys the trilogy, the sheet with the codes included specifically says "may be invalid after 11/30/11" so you may want to buy at your own risk if wanting the digital copy.  I found there are some sites having this box set and posts that the digital copy to the ones they sell expire 12/31/12.

Actual bluray quality review at a later time.
