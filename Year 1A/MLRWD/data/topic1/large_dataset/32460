FYI: I'm not real into writing reviews so I don't want to sit her quoting the movie and going on at length about it.

My brother-in-law recommended this movie to my wife & I--neither of us had heard of it--but after watching it, Sex Drive bolted to the top spot of COMEDIES as far as we're concerned.  Super Bad? American Pie? Anchorman? NOPE.  SEX DRIVE!!!

10/10

An awkward teenage virgin meets a girl on the internet and decides to drive 9 hours to meet her in his brothers stolen 69 GTO Judge! Along the way they have the adventure of a lifetime and you meet a TON of classic characters every one of which is memorable.  There is so many quotables here you and your friends will be saying them for years to come....I know we all do.  Seth Green is HILARIOUS playing an Amish guy, and you will have new found respect for James Marsden who played Cyclops in the X-Men movies after seeing this movie.

The Cream Filled edition is for FANS only it is not meant to be watched by someone who hasn't seen the movie once through.

For fans of: Superbad, Harold & Kumar, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks 2
