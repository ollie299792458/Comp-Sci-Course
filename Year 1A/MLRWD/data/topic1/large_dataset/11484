I think both the 1957 and 1997 versions are great movies and I will alternate watching both over the years.  Given the passage of 40 years, they are bound to be different  The older of the two will compare less favorably, because acting styles and attitudes toward race have changed.  So have people.  In the 1957 version Lee J. Cobb portrayed a man so oblivious to the facts, that every time he opened his mouth, he made the case for the other side, often humorously.  George C. Scott never quite achieves that.  However in the final scene Scott surpasses Cobb in revealing his bias, and breaking down.  Lemmon's remark to Scott, "He's not your son, he's someone else" is not contained in the first movie and is an appropriate added touch. I like both Fonda's and Lemmon's performances as juror Number 8.  The pivotal person is actually Mykelti Williams who plays the Ed Begley role (juror number 10, who has a cold).  As the nation of Islam fanatic, he divides the African-American jurors among themselves.  This adds some credibility and complexity, so the fight is not just black vs. white.  Inevitably, the complexities of modern American society are more accurately reflected in the 1997 version.  Before the 1960s, we just didn't address race head-on.  The older version is accurate testament to that.  Still, the 1957 version is amazing.  E. G. Marshall's portrayal of the stock broker is commanding and genuinely fun to watch.  His conversion from guilty to not guilty is the single most dramatic moment in either movie.  The cinematography on his face showing his transformation from confident to doubtful is wonderful work. The claustrophobia in the 1957 version surpasses the 1997 version.  I choose to treat these movies as complimenting one another.  My only question is when will they put the 1997 version on DVD?  Get both versions and appreciate the differences.  They are both superior films.  Both accurately reflect the times in which they were made.
