This series is very entertaining and is very enjoyable.  It was cast very well and if everyone would have behaved in a professional manner and honored the terms of their contracts (and not tried to get out of them!) I feel it would have went for at least 5 seasons and been a lot more full-bodied and well-fleshed-out.  I recall reading a TV Guide interview with the actress who is now on that medical drama that she admitted she had not really grasped what whe was getting herself into with signing a contract and didn't want to continue being on a science-fiction show.  Maybe the direction the show started-off in at the beginning and thru the first season would have continued (had that not occurred) but it seems like they did take a turn towards really rushing the information that was more sci-fi oriented for the second and third seasons.  Had they had 5 it could have maintained the steady momentum of the relationship development with a stream of science fiction constantly running thru it and not a deluge.  Regardless,  this is a really good series with attractive cast and emotionally involving storylines.  Good for teens and those who remember being teens.
