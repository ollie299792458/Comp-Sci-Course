George C. Scott is Gen. George S. Patton Jr.  To many Americans, he has become the famous general.  Never has an actor been cast better than this.  I am a big fan of Gen. Patton and I have read many books about his life.  This movie is a great portrayal of his life.  However, it is important to know that the consultant for this movie was Gen Omar Bradley who had no love for Patton.
The opening speech of the film is, in my opinion, the greatest few minutes in movie history.  It's funny to note that as colorful as the language is in the opening speech, the director had to tone it down from Patton's original speech.  From this opening scene until the wonderful closing scene at the windmills this movie is perfect in every way.  The battle scenes are very good even if you consider that they were done in the 1970's, years prior to the computer generated special effects of today.
This movie won 7 Acadamy Awards including best picture and best actor for George C. Scott.  The soundtrack for this movie is also fantastic and will run through your head for some time after watching the movie.  Have I said that this movie is the greatest ever?  I can't say it enough and I hope everyone takes the 3 hours needed and savors this movie.
