Central America is a region of small countries that specialize in growing bananas, mangos, papayas and other fruit for export to the US market. To protect the interests of companies like United Fruit, the US has often intervened in the affairs of those countries to ensure that Americans can buy cheap fruit.
El Salvador is one of the smallest countries in Central America. Neighboring Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica are giants in comparison. This means that there is little land available for farming by campesinos. In 1980 a war broke out in El Salvador between the army and the landless peasants in a dispute over land. The war continued until 1992, when a peace treaty was signed.
The best introduction to the war in El Salvador is Oliver Stone's film Salvador with James Woods and Jim Belushi. Stone tells it like the nightmare it was, including the brutal murder of innocent peasants by the depraved military and right wing death squads, thanks to the generosity of our Congress and President Ronald Reagan, who funded them with billions of our tax dollars. Tiny El Salvador was one of largest recipients of US foreign aid in the eighties.
I also recommend two recent films on El Salvador: Innocent Voices and Maria's Story, which tell the story of the war on landless peasants living in shacks from their point of view.
Finally, I recommend an excellent book on one "battle" in the US funded war in El Salvador: The Massacre at El Mozote by Mark Danner.
