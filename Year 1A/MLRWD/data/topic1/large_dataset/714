Where to begin...

When I sat down in the theater I thought this would be GOOD, though it Began with a scene from about halfway through the movie and backtracked.

It begins very well, with the space shuttle coming down the hard way and bringing some uninvited guests with it. I Also liked the idea of the gender reversal of the roles from the original.

Then...

I am going to give away a plot point here, so if you are desperate to see this film (Uhm IF that is the case, then maybe You ought to get out more) stop reading now.

Spoiler Alert:

The reason they call this one "The Invasion"?

No "Body Snatching" ever really takes place!

Yesiree! What we have here friends is the Wimpifying of the SF/Horror culture (Much like Spiderman 2...) "Invasion" it is, without a pod person in sight, they "infect" you by vomiting into your drinks (among other things) and worse, due to the current "I like Everybody, don't you all like me" vibe going through most movies, the "invasion" is treated like a (n easily cured) virus - making it possible to reach the end and have (almost) everyone "Invaded" be all honky-dorey.

Suffice it to say, I felt cheated... If they Had to do it this way they could easily have gone back to the first movie or the book for a more upbeat ending.

Get any one of the first three.

This one, - pay Me and Maybe I'll take it off your hands for you.
