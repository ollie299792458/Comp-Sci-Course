The English countryside is beautiful in HD.  Such a feast for the eyes, a shame it couldn't have comprised more of the film.  I knew it wouldn't from the book but was hoping the movie could extend the prewar period.  When I heard this movie was being made I thought, uh, oh, a lot of people will not like the ending.  I admire the choice of Vanessa Redgrave as old Birony, nice touch.  The look and feel of the film is reminicent of Merchant/Ivory, so if you like them, you will enjoy this one.  Even though I knew that four letter word would be included (it had to be) it still came as a shock, just as it did in the book.  I minused one star in my review simply because Keira Knightley overdid the accent.  I realize the British spoke back then in fast, clipped speech but I wish she would have spoken clearer.  Several of her lines were difficult to understand.  However, she did an otherwise fabulous job and never have I seen a woman in a bathing cap look so gorgeous and the green dress suited her beyond words. I give my compliments to the director for making Dunkirk look so amazingly real.  The beach scene needs to be seen to be believed, memorable.  A touching film which reminds that sometimes one vindictive action can haunt the perpetrator forever.
