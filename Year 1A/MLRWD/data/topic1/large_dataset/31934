but this time around, Bekmambetov and the gang take themselves rather less seriously.

This is the second installment in the film trilogy based on the series of fantasy novels by Russian writer Sergei Lukyanenko. There's much less physical pain and spurting blood than in the first movie, Night Watch (which really should be seen first for one to fully understand Day Watch), but the special effects are still over the top, and everybody seems to be having a lot more fun.

Konstantin Khabensky returns as Anton Gorodetsky, the brave but bumbling Night Watch agent who can't seem to stay out of trouble. His life hasn't improved much since he found out that he has a twelve-year old son, Yegor, who is potentially the most powerful Other of all time. The boy is now under the tutelage and watchful eye of Zavulon, the malevolent leader of the Dark Others, and Anton believes that it's his own fault that Yegor has chosen the Darkness. He's also in love with his beautiful, much more talented Night Watch trainee Svetlana but too insecure to declare himself.

Svetlana unknowingly puts Anton on the trail of the Chalk of Fate and the chance to correct his biggest mistake and save the World from the ultimate mega-battle between Good and Evil.  Khabensky makes Anton even goofier and more charming than he did in Night Watch, rushing head long into the mystery of the Chalk (by midnight flight to Uzbekistan), barely avoiding being arrested - and worse - by the Day Watch for a murder he didn't commit, finding himself in someone else's body, trying to reconcile with Yegor, and fessing up to Svetlana.  We viewers find ourselves as out of breath as he is as he runs every where in his desperation.

All these misadventures and more provide the moviemakers with plenty of opportunities to show off their talents for amazing special effects. The dvd extras reveal just what's real - more than you might think - and what's not.
