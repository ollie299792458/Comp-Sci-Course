Hi There
Okay The Last Starfighter came out in the 80's and let's face it the 80's did have a few films especially sci-fi films that did have dodgy special effects and the Last Starfighter is no exception. All the special effects in the film are done using a computer and at times it looks a bit like a cartoon but on the plus side it's a really fun film. Discounting the effects the story and the acting is really good. Okay it's the kind of story you've seen or read before. Young kid gets taking into space to battle ultimate evil, but it's done in a slightly different way as the kid in question doesn't want to become a starfighter. Also while he's off in space a Beta unit (android) is taking his place on Earth with some really funny results. All in all if you haven't ever seen this film see it and enjoy it for all it's cheesy fun. And if you have seen the film in the 80's and liked it, then why haven't you got it in your collection. I would give this film 5 stars just because it's such a nice story but the computer effects do let it down a bit so hence the 4 star rating.
