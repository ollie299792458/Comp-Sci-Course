Jim Carrey is, nowadays, the man of the hour. Blockbuster movies: check. Drama film success: check. Teenage fan base: check. Whether he's thwarting transvestite enenmies as a pet detective or slipping into a mask and into Cameron Diaz's pants, Carrey's got the style, wit, and physical humor one needs to get rich. Which is why Jim surprised us all with this very dark venture into psycology and television, "The Cable Guy". Sure the film is at times, plain Jim Carrey (overacted melodramatics for laughs), but nside is a wonderful descent into the cable guy's infested mind: his mother's abandonment; his knowledge that "Sleepless in Seattle" always gets the chicks; his memory of all the words to Jefferson Airplane hits; and why he ultamatly befriends and stalks Matthew Broderick. It's also cool to know that Mr. Ben Stiller directed it, who goes on to play a part in a recent dark/humor film, "The Royal Tennenbaums". And sure, most of the film is an excuse for Carrey to show himself off, and that he does. Credit also goes to Jack Black and Owen Wilson for turning in good performances.
"The Cable Guy" is a social commentary flick; it's own self parodying makes evidence of that(Carrey, at the end: "Think about it: this sure is a great place for an ending"). It has more ups than downs, and holds it's own. Credit to Carrey also for pulling off a believable lisp throughout.
