I've read both books and there were fabulous. Yes, the movie departs some from the book, but not in a demeaning or bad way a la "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." I found Renee's portrayal of Bridget to be charming. As far as bumbling or stumbling, the character in the book came across to me as such and I think Renee carried off its essence very nicely. The whole point of the book is the awkwardness of being a 30something singleton searching for love, place in the world, comfort zone, etc. 
...on the weight issue, Renee is already underweight, she had to gain 30 pounds to look realistically 20 pounds over. And even at the weight she was in the movie, she was far from fat.  I rather liked seeing a normal-sized person for once on the silver screen. It was also refreshing to see an actress willing to do so for the sake of a good film, which this was. 
I laughed from the time I sat down in the theater. The only obvious departure from the book was the lack of  her involvement with friends, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In the book, Bridget's friends played a larger role. The reduced role in the movie worked better overall because it would have been near as funny with all those tiny and insignficant details.
