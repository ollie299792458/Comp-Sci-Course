The Frighteners.  I bought this on Widescreen VHS my freshman year in college solely based on the cover (and Zemeckis's reputation at the time), and it was the saving grace for keeping my sanity.  After going through a massive (on my end) breakup, struggling with Women in Literature (I eventually pulled an A-), and learning far too late about the effects of alcohol on my friends, I would sit down and watch this movie every single day.  Not all the way through.  Parts of it.  Usually the first hour.  The location shots, especially, reminded me there was more on this globe of ours I was shutting out.

The atmosphere of this film is incredibly spooky.  I'm not quite sure how they did it because I think this was before the Digital Intermediate was popular.  The entire film is desaturated of a lot of red and yellows, while the green and blues are favored.  Not so much as the Matrix films, of course... Frighteners is essentially Corpus Aeotearoa, if possible, as if created from the light of New Zealand.  I love the light of the forest when Fox's character was slightly younger.  Almost orange in hue.

"You are violating my territorial bubble."

This film has amazing effects in it.  The ghosts look realistic, the tunnels of death are beautiful to watch, and all the sets are brilliant.  I wish I knew how they did the church hospital scene, where Frank Bannister turns from the burnt down present into the shiny, slick past, in one shot.  Probably motion control and plates, but I like to think they used ye olde fashioned ways...

And Michael J. Fox ... in the climactic scene ... supernal ...
