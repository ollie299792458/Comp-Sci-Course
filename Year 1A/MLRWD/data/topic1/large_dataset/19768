While the plot is predictable, the sweetness of both the film and the film characters of the fictional town of Big Eden more than make up for it. It was so refreshing to see a movie that delves into gay intimacy and relationships, as well as the main character having a regular body and over the age of 29 (which is too often seen as the kiss of gay cinematic death, as most gay films seem to star cute & buff 'twinks' under 25). A subject that the film does cover that I can't ever remember seeing in a film before is the love that (the somewhat sexually confused) Dean conveys towards gay Henry. True deep platonic love between two men, especially when one of the characters is gay, is I think somewhat of a taboo subject for most Americans.

I would have liked for the characters to have been fleshed out more, for instance not one word was said as to why Henry's grandparents had to raise him; how did his parents die? Also, some flashback sequences from when Henry/Dean/Pike were growing up in school would have been nice to see as well & give the audience a greater understanding of Pike & Dean's separate loves for Henry & also maybe why Henry was so scared to come out in so accepting a town.

Lastly, the fairly tale aspect of the townsfolk who are ALL totally accepting of their gay neighbors is a model example of what our country currently SHOULD and maybe, hopefully someday will actually resemble. Overall I think that this movie is the ANTI-'Brokeback Mountain' due to it's positive citizens & message of acceptance. If the place were real it would make you want to take a vacation there. This is a great film that you can see on a date (straight or gay), with friends or family!
