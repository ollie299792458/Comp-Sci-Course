You ever notice how Asian women tend to have nicely manicured and perfectly symmetrical hands and feet? It seems like an odd trait to actually be passed down genetically. It makes you wonder if it has anything to do with their diet or the Asian region from which these women hail. Whatever the case, it's an interesting evolutionary study. Anywho, on a separate note,  SURVIVING CHRISTMAS was so titanically ballsquelching I suffered from a rare case of what can only be deemed as "peri-rectal stigmata." The only upside being that I now can cross "self-performed fistulectomy" off of my life's "to do" list. Thank you Ben Affleck. Let me know next time you plan on making a movie, so I can pretreat my soon to be decaying flesh with peroxide and epsom salt and contact a Jehovah's witness to record my living will. Blame your agent. Blame the script. Bottom line: You suck Monkey. In fact, next movie, do just that. Suck Monkey for 90 minutes and take comfort it would still only be the second worst film you ever did.
