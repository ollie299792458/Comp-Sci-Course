I tend to love bad horror, but Ghost Machine isn't a "So bad it's good" movie. Rather, it's a "so bad it's BAD" movie.

The plot of the movie revolves around the ghost of a terrorist (Cyber-terrorist to be exact) getting into a combat training simulator and killing people within the game, and thus killing them in real life. This once original idea has been so overused over the past thirty years, that one has to wonder if there is any blood to squeeze from that stone anymore. Most of these films are pretty bad, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOWW">Stay Alive - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007US7E4">Hellraiser - Hellworld</a> or the American remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0RNYI">Pulse (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>. However there are some very well done films with this theme as well, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OE4O">Pulse</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPCK2O">From Beyond (Unrated Director's Cut)</a> or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001662FLE">The Signal [Blu-ray</a>]. Sadly Ghost Machine is definitely one of the worst films in the "Spectre Meets Technology" theme that I've ever seen.

First of all is the acting. This is definitely a poorly acted film, which the "stars" of the movie being C level actors at best. I mean, when one of your big stars is the female lead in the American remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019X3YX2">Shutter (Widescreen) (Unrated Edition)</a>, you know you have a stinker on your hands.

Next up is the plot. Although in theory the idea of an undead ghost terrorist haunting a British equivalent of Guantanamo Bay is a good one, this was handled pretty poorly, such as the ghost somehow transforming from being a female tech nerd into a super powerful killing machine wielding a chain with a hook at the end of it like DC Comic's Lobo was a bit hard to swallow. The movie also suffered from some weird issues such as this army team of like four people being a joint venture between Americans, the British and the Australians. Action Force this was not. The two twists of "Is the bad guy dead yet" were really obvious and ones I was able to call before the movie was halfway done. This was a totally paint by numbers film without any real creativity or character development, relying on only the most cliche of horror movie storytelling aspects.

Although this isn't the worst film I've seen Anchor Bay put out (That would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IT5GDC">Stan Helsing</a>), it was definitely a film I couldn't recommend to anyone for any reason. If you're really curious about seeing this waste of 92 minutes, I suggest Netflixing it. Otherwise, stay away from this clunker.
