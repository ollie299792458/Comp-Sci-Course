In "First Blood" Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo a wandering ex-Green Beret looking for a former Vietnam buddy in a small hostile town.  Rambo is unjustly harassed and arrested by over zealous Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy).  When Rambo is pushed to the limit he strikes back and single handedly beats up several officers in route to an escape into the surrounding hills.
Now that Rambo is back in his element things get interesting as a member of Teasle's posse unwittingly draws "First Blood" (hence the title) unleashing the wrath that is Rambo!  The subsequent hoopla and bombast that accompanied the remaining two installments to the series really overshadow the quality of "First Blood."  Stallone is at his monosyllabic best with a screenplay that keeps the dialogue down and revs the action up. Veteran action director Ted Kotcheff expertly handles the key set piece of the film that shows Rambo deftly ambushing several unsuspecting victims with such precision that none of them is fatally wounded.  Finally Rambo comes face to face with his accuser Sheriff Teasle to issue an ultimatum that actually does more to up the stakes rather then cool the situation down.  Rambo's former commanding officer Trautmen (Richard Crenna) is brought in for advice but instead issues his own declaration when he tells Sheriff Teasle that if he continues to pursue Rambo he better have a lot of body bags.  
"First Blood" is really a study in wills and the stubbornness not to know when to back down.  Sheriff Teasle is not able to admit that he is over matched and Rambo uses the injustice he has suffered both in the small town and in Vietnam as a reason to let his fury rage on an unsuspecting populace.  Recent films like the disappointing "The Hunted" would have done well to mimic the terse sensibilities that served "First Blood" so well.
