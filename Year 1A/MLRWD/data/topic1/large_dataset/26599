"Self-preservation-society" Ahhh,, the delightful tune stays in your head as you remember the times when a Mini Cooper was a Mini Cooper (British and all) and England's footballers were on top of the World. I remember this movie as a child, and as I got older, my love affair with it blossomed as did my love affair with the Mini. Michael Caine at his ultimate "Cockney" best and a cast assembled to perfection. Benny Hill as the technical genious behind the gold plot, with his love for "BIG" women, was a classic role for this much missed comic master. A fantastic plot, stunning scenery, the best car chase sequence EVER in a movie, and an ending that defies logic, make this movie a classic amongst classics. The new remake may have the big star cast, the multi-million dollar production team and the new (dare I say it?) German Mini Coopers, but the original will never be matched for it's wonderful piece of 60's nostalgia. The Mini Cooper, sharp suits, mini skirts, Vespa's, England World Football Champions ...sigh... where did it all go? Bring it all back with this MUST HAVE crime caper Classic. Finally on DVD in America ...Thank You!! Thank You!! Thank You!!
