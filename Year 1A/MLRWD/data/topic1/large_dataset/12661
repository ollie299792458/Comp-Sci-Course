I sat down to enjoy an 81 minute film and that is exactly what I did.  I was captured for that time and often held at the edge of my seat.  This film is a thriller of our post 9/11 days that were formed out of not knowing our enemy.  The transition of the main charater from top of his game to victim was stunning.  I enjoyed the P-I-P insets and found them effective and good for the intensity.  As the intensity of the film increased so did the crisp low bass tones to help rumble that nervous feeling deep in the pit of the stomach.

It may not have been Forest's best job, but he always carries a real screen charisma.  Colin pulled off an excellent job.  My only complaint is with his dissappearing NYC/Latino accent (at least that was my take on what he was trying to pull off in the opening scene).  Although the two women (non-hookers) in the film had very small parts, I did like the fact that Colin's wife looked like more real than most films allow, and the girlfriend was not overdone as well.  The sniper's voice (I didn't recognize it at Kiefer's) was deep, rich, and calm (perfect for creepiness). By not using a telephone compressor for the voice and giving it a non-directional speaker presence the Director showed a stroke of genius.

This isn't a great big overdone film with fancy sets and big explosions, but is is a great big thriller with fine acting and excellent directing.  The movie isn't about ballistics or police strategies - it may just be about unknown enemies, and maybe that enemy lies within us.  Cheers!
