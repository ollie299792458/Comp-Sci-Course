Where to start?

Ok, with out giving anything away.. there is a scene in the movie where ... someone.. warns Michael Keaton's character that he should not be getting involved with EVP, that meddling with EVP was very dangerous, and that he should leave it to the experts.  Ok fine, but if this EVP thing is THAT dangerous, then why do they include a remedial tutorial on 'do it yourself EVP' as one of the special features?

The signature of a good horror movie is to build up the suspense and still be able to scare the viewer, even if they know something is about to happen. This movie atteMpts to scare the viewer bY startling them.  It's like hiding behind a door and yelling boo when someone enters the room.  The only scare is the fact that you weren't expecting anything.  Once the jolt wears off, it really wasn't that scary.. Same can be said about this movie..

While the whole movie pretty much sucked, the worst part was the ending battle between good and evil... The viewer had absolutley no clue as to what was happening.  A better version of the battle appeared in the special footage... They should have edited the movie to have included that part instead. This movie was soooo bad that I didn't even bother to hit pause when I had to get up and get another Yuengling.  After all, what was there to miss?

Save your time and money, don't bother with this one...
