This is one of the all-time classics featuring Bogie &amp; Bacall. Technically not film noir, rather a witty, stylized and romanticized treatment of a rather hard-boiled detective story from Raymond Chandler. It's everything others here have so eloquently stated: the plot is a bit convoluted (but it's not the point), Bogie was never cooler, the dialog is simply a joy and just about every scene is a gem unto itself. And there is a beautiful dame lurking around every corner!
I got this DVD as part of the Humphrey Bogart collection (which also included Casablanca, Key Largo, The Maltese Falcon). Imagine my surprise to find this DVD contained BOTH the pre-release and post-WWII versions on one disc! Also a good documentary comparing the two. I would highly recommend purchasing this movie on DVD if you appreciate great classic movies--or just great movies period. If like me you are a Bogart fan, get the collection. I'm hoping if more people buy these DVDs the studios will start to release some of the other great Bogart classics on DVD, like To Have And Have Not (Bogie/Bacall debut), Treasure of the Sierra Madre ("Badges?"), High Sierra, etc.
