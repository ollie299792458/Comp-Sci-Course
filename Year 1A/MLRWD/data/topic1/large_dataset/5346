This film is the best one ever done on the life of Christ, it gives you a glimpse of his divinity as light.  You always see him enveloped in light as he is sending healing light to someone, it also gives the viewer a deeper understanding of some of the events of His life, that get washed over in other films mostly due to a lack of understanding. Each shot is like a painting, HB Warner did a superb job as Christ.  The score is very mellow and fits the film very well.  This film gives a more acurate depiction of the events in his life such as after the resurrection, the first person he went to was His mother, not Mary Magdalen, which is true, as His mother with her atunement with her son, also experienced the tremendous suffering He endured and she was distraught and in deep suffering.  The beginning and ending are in color, the cells were hand colored and it gives an interesting dimension.  The film has the feeling of a Heinrich Hofmann painting so it is superb.  Hofmann did paintings of Christ from personal visions, and the film has a sense of deep reverence and sacredness and you get a hint of the love and kindness Christ had for others and also His joy, especially when you see Him loving children and His friendship with others.
