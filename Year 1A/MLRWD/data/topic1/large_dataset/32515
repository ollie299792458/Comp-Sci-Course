enjoy this one in the spirit of such losers as "Plan 9 from Outer Space".  Sad coda to Joan Crawford's career; she reads her lines to Trog as if she were dealing with the maid "Give me the child, Trog....Thank you Trog".  Come to think of it, she pretty much gives the rest of the cast the same treatment.  Not that they don't deserve it- most of them swallow scenery without stopping to chew.  Trog(lodyte- get it?) himself looks like an overweight body builder with bad hygiene, Fred Flinstone's underpants and a monkey head, and takes way too long before running amok in the town.  Looniest moment?  Take your pick: Trog gob-smacking some British compact car that promptly explodes?  Joan rummaging around some Scottish moor shrieking "Trog! Trog!" like a fishwife?  Or maybe Trog's fascination with Joan's Doll collection (!?!?!).  Come to think of it, I might just go rent this one now....
It was rumored that Joan drank continuously during the production of her last movies- rent this one and you'll have a good idea why.
