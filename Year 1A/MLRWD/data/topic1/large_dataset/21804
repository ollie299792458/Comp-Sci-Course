To begin, I rated this movie five stars not because its one of the best movies I've ever seen, but because, in my opinion, its better than so many of the movies released in 2010.

Compared to the other oldie action movie of 2010, The Expendables, RED is a clear winner.
As others have said; we know, and probably mostly love, the cast. Being British, the delightful performances of Helen Mirren and Brian Cox were going to make this a winner for me, and Karl Urban always impresses me.

Philip French in The Guardian (a British newspaper) reviewed RED and said 'This is painting by numbers for people who have trouble with mental arithmetic.'  No doubt if, like Mr French, you only enjoy watching obscure Kenyan arthouse movies then RED isn't for you.

There's a measured amount of comedy, a great fight scene between Willis and Urban, and will probably be remembered for Helen Mirren in a white ballgown firing the belt fed machine gun.

The DVD release is decent, but I wish they'd put a little effort into making some limited editions for us collectors.

I wish Amazon would keep reviews of the blu-ray release seperate from DVD reviews, although those of us buying DVDs can laugh this time around as the blu-ray buying fools pay almost double for a movie only release with mere DVD quality sound (those 1 star reviews).
