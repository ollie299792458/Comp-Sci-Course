I read about this Soviet atrocity a few years ago in "Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Seeds of Polish Resurrection" by Allen Paul, but watching the film really made it hit home. I wish it would be released in the U.S. The movie has English subtitles, however the extra features unfortunately do not (this review covers the single-DVD release, not the 2-DVD one, so I don't know about the extra features on the second disk in that set or if there are any subtitles available).

The film deals with not just the atrocity itself, but the refusal among some Poles to accept the Soviet lies about it (the Reds claimed the Nazis were responsible). To me, the film does what I believe it's intended to do; illustrate the tragedy of Katyn, as well as the beginning of Soviet domination of Poland. As mentioned in an earlier review, the executions are graphic - the filmmakers don't pull any punches here, and they shouldn't.

Note: This movie is in PAL (not NTSC) format, so you'll need a PAL-NTSC converter along with a Region-free DVD player to watch it.
