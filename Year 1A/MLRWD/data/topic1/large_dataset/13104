Whether you belive that the greenhouse effect will harm the earth in the way the movie portrays, or not, this movie gives you such a realistic "what if", it will leave most viewers pondering about every act they perform that potentially harms the environment.
I am hugely critical of overdone special effects, but the weather disasters in this film were breathtakingly genuine-looking.  This is perhaps the finest use of special effects that I have ever seen.  I would recommend the movie on this alone.
(Don't read further if you don't want the plot spoiled)
The one flaw, was straining plot credibility past the breaking point.
The movie did overreach itself in expecting the viewer to buy into the father travelling from Washington DC to NY City primarily on foot, during a climatic natural disaster, and that half the United States could be evacuated anywhere in a short time and during these conditions.
These were poorly excuted and simply unbelievable.
Having said that, the rest of the movie is so well done, that I did not care, and highly recommend it.
