They failed (in more ways than one).
One of the big things about this movie were the characters, since 'They' are only after four of them. But the makers of this film did not develop any of the characters very well, so I didn't care if any of them died or not. Especially the guy that committed suicide.
They also did not explain anything! Like, what was that bone/splinter doing in her head? How did it get there? Why was it there? And why were 'They' coming after those 4? It felt like the makers were too lazy to answer any of these questions, resulting in a short, shallow movie with plot holes and confusion.
This movie made me mad instead of scared, although I tried my best to enjoy it, which was enjoyable at a few points. They were just few and far between. This really could have been a great movie. They had a very good idea with the monsters and everything, but they never fell through with it. 
They could have utilized the baby-crying, and the lights turning off better, but they didn't. They could have developed the characters better, but they didn't. Laura Regan could have eaten something, but she didn't. They could have done a lot of things, but they didn't. I wouldn't recommend watching this film, but maybe you should watch it just to see what this movie could have been!
