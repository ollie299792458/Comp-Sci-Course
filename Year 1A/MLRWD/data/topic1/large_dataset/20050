There is no hero quite like Daredevil. I will not say that he is the best super-hero that is out there today but I will say he is one of the most real.
Daredevil has always been different than the other heroes in comic books because his disability is what GIVES him his power. He is proof that anything is possible and that anyone can overcome anything if they really have to.
Daredevil is worth your time if you like super-heroes that are more human and full of flaws. Ben Affleck does a excellent job as Daredevil and he prooves that he has what it takes to portray a hero in the Marvel Universe. Mark Steven Johnson does an awesome job as the director and the writers are great at re-creating some of the best issues of Daredevil. Daredevil is slightly different from the comics but you feel like you are re-reading the best of Frank Miller's run on the comic once you view the film.
Daredevil is not perfect (I can see why some of the comic fans would hate the adaptation) and it has some parts that are really lame but it is a good film if you really like the red hero that we all love. I would be bold enough to say that it is the best solo super-hero movie since "Batman."
The Daredevil film may not please all of the Daredevil comic fans but the DVD is set up in such a way that the Daredevil comic fans will find the extras well worth the price. The DVD has really awesome interview's with all of Daredevil's best writers and artists. You really learn more about Daredevil as you hear what the creators have to say about the comic and the film.
This DVD is great for fans and non-fans. It is a really cool film that is well worth the price.
