Yes, as has been pointed out, there are a number of inaccuracies in this film.  However, it is still one of the most breathtaking pictures I have ever seen.  It captures the true spirit of both an individual's, as well as  a Nation's quest for freedom and independence.  Moreover, the  cinematography is absolutely stunning.
As a historian, I always hope for  authenticity.  However, sometimes one must settle for a blend a fact and  fiction to make a film profitable.
Here are a few of the facts left  out.
No, he did not have an affair with Isabella.
Yes, he would have  spoken many languages including French &amp; Latin.  He was well educated  at the moestary at Kennebeckskenneth(sp, Been a few years since I  researched this topic)
The old man, his uncle, was the abbot at said  monestary.
Yes, it has been speculated that Edward II was gay.  However,  there is no real proof.  Different cultures respond differently to this  topic.
Isabella and her real lover, Mortimer, assasinated Edward II.  Edward III had Mortimer executed when he assended the throne, and his  mother locked in a tower!  So there was no love lost between ED II &amp;  Isabella.
The greatest omission is during the battle of Stirling.  (The  one with the spears)  Wallace used a covert attack to take out the bridge  so the infantry and archers could not support the calvary.  BRILLIANT!
This film shows what an educated man can do when fighting for  his freedom.  Few pictures can capture this as well as Braveheart.
