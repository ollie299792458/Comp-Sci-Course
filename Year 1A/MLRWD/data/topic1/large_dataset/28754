Maltin doesn't get it -- mythos is supposed to be heavyhanded, and pretty; the exquisite sets are inseparable from the oddball tale of good and evil, and I happen to think this is a kind of tour-de-force in the vein of Gilliam and Steve Martin (see LA Story, for example, of the modern fairytale universe behaving to match its surroundings).  
It isn't up to those great standards, though.  All films in this genre have excellent quirky characters, so one expects the "revelation" of Joan Cusack's machinery near the end; similarly, one expects the showdown of absurdist proportions at the penultimate moment, here an army of toys fighting back against a bio-modified modernist "thing" which turns out, in the end, to be little more than a flawed toy itself.  In the great works of Gilliam and Martin, however, maturity is the price the heroic innocent sacrifices for saving their universe; here, the preservation of innocence is all, which falls flat as a moral for such a fairytale (or if it is a moral, it is a dark and brooding one ill befitting the majestic bubble-land of the film).  And the theme at heart IS more of struggle between innocence and cynicism, which sounds like a great film "concept" but ultimately, when you think about it, is an odd pairing -- doesn't Levinson think good exists in a mature form?  Cynical choice for a pet project, then...
