I remember this episode from a kid. It stuck with me because of Donna Douglas' absolute beauty and her character which was so diametrically opposed to her Elly Mae character. Of course the Elly Mae role made her a star, and it also typed her for life, but she did other roles before BH that showed her range and abilities. I had these two episodes on VHS, but wanted to update and get it on DVD before they disappear too. 'The Clampetts Are Overdrawn 11-13-63' and 'The Clampetts Go Hollywood 11-20-63' is a continued next week set. Jethro plays a Marlon Brando bike riding hooligan, he even goes to the movies to study the original. Jed is dressed as an icon of the day in gold lame with a guitar, Elvis Presley. Granny plays her own icon as a Hoot Gibson dance hall 'girl'. But, it is Elly Mae that left a life long impression on me as Venus Adore, a sure knock off of Marilyn Monroe who had recently passed. She emotes as a method actress. pretending to be a tree, she looks into the camera with a wide eyed very Marilyn look, it is really chilling and somewhat unsettling, here we have Monroe all over again, almost. Donna Douglas had more going for her than the once in a life time role as Elly Mae.
