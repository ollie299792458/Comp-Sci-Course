i've recently seen this DVD,5 years after the making and up till now it's massive impression is within me.seldom has modern cinema reached such depths of existensialist profundity.it's easy to recognize aronofsky and his dp's technical brilliance and praise it in that line or,on the other hand, dismiss it as too dark and depressive and unbearable,but what i think is that quite contrary to the latter approach,aronofsky, aided effectively by selbert's material,narrates a cautionary tale wherein harsh realism-though not expressed in a totally realistic fashion-serves as a metaphor for irresponsibility towards one's existence,NOT in religious or ethical terms but simply in human terms,in other words aronofsky's movie is in a way didactic,he's telling us this is what happens if you lose belief in yourself,if you sacrify your wisdom and compassion for means of escaping,rather than staying and taking afew blows but remaining on the cycle of existance,as an iranian fellow director icongragulate aronofsky and shake his hand.seeing this DVD(though ihope there will be some additions in the extras in next editons)is a must for any filmmaker or potential filmmaker interested in the dynanics of man.
