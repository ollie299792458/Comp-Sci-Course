I first came across this film by watching a video called 'Alpha Male movie scenes', which included the first scene in the film (where Roger Dodger is dominating a discussion about 'male utility').
Although this film isn't just about an Alpha male (in a similar way to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver</a> not just being about psychopaths), it is a dominant thread, and Roger Dodger is a fantastic lead in the mold of James Bond or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M2Z3BA">Brett Butler</a>.

The one warning attached to this is that, although the film does have some ideas of how to pick up women, it is far more a social commentary on the narcissistic personality that Roger represents. It's kind of like a modern-day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF8">Alfie</a>, but with scenes where Roger takes his virgin cousin to a brothel, amongst other dark scenes.
Still, so long as you can stomach such scenes and see past such faults, you will find a first class charactor film that explores dark themes with artistic finesse.

Last thing to mention is the extras. Occasionally DVD's offer budding film-makers a full tool-kit of how to make a film. The extras on here are one of those treasure-troves and illustrate that the director wasn't just going for offence-for-offence's-sake, but was after something artistic.

So, if you like films with dark themes and want to see an under-rated lead performance, then see this film. You also may be pleasantly surprised by the support role played by Jesse Eisenberg, who went on to play the lead in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P7G">The Social Network</a>.
And if you like dark but arty films, do try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0U4">Irreversible</a> (a film about a rape filmed in reverse - like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a> was). Also do try a DVD of George Carlin's later works (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I848K">Complaints & Grievances</a>) as few have equalled his ability to be clever with dark humour.
