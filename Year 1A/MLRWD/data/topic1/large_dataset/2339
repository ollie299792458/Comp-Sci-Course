I bought this series on a heresay of a few friends, and from looking at screen shots. Suffice to say I was really pleasantly surprised, seeing as I was prearing myself for some eighties rubbish (I love eighties rubbish, don't get me wrong!).

It turns out Hunter is a very well contructed action/drama series, with some assuredly tacky eighties moments and catch phrases, but two really affecting lead characters with excellent chemistry. The action scenes and car chases have my recommendation and respect, merely because they look so gritty.

Modern filming might be stylish, but it takes something away from the impact. I love the filming style hugging the wheel of fleeing vehicles, the sheer physicality of the fights.. sure sometimes you see stunt doubles, but very often it's the you'll see the actor doing realistic and rough actions.

Fred Dryer (Rick Hunter) has a fantastic Clint Eastwood thing going, but with a little extra quirkiness that really works. And long legs. Don't get me started on those legs. Dee Dee McCall is one of the few female characters that doesn't annoy the heck outta me, and actually comes across as tough rather than *trying* to come across as tough.

From a dvd perspective, the quality is fine. It played fine on my multi-region (I'm in the UK) although I hit the odd episode with striping common in cross-region playing. Pity, but probably unavoidable. The interviews are interesting, pity there aren't more extras, some documentaries maybe, but there ya go.

Overall, I'd recommend those with a love for the eighties, cute endings, fast action and dramatic plots to give this show a go. You won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't.

And I can't tell you how hard it was to write this whole review without saying "It works for me". Oh... bugger.
