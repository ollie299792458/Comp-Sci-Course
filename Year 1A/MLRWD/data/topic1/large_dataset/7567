Out of all the bad sword and sorcery movies, this one takes the cake. It's so bad, that it's totally funny. Not to mention Lucio Fulci directs it, so there is tons of useless, yet amusing gore. Like there's this one part where these werewolves/bad furry costumes/Chubaccas tear this one person apart by pulling their legs in different directions. It was painful to watch. And theres also a part where this lil pale and wimpy dude got infected and he got these sores all over his body, and they were like pouring this crap out of them. And then these ants crawled all over him and into the wounds. And of course with Fulci directing the whole thing, we got the close up. But thats just some of the eye candy. If you want to know the plot, I don't really know, cuz nothin in that movie makes sense. But I'll give it my best shot. Theres this lil gay dude, and he's got some relation to the god of the sun, or somthing like that. And for some [dang] reason he wants to go kill this lady in a gold mask. And the gold mask is pretty much all she wears. But whatever. But he's so [stupid] that he can't do it himself, so this Fabio-esque man has to come to his rescue. In the mean time, they kill this poor travelor for hunting practice, meet up with these huge frog things in cocoons, get chased by big furry guys, get killed, bla bla bla. Good reigns over evil, the same old crap we get in every sword and sorcery movie. All in all, this is an Italian B-movie, you just can't go wrong.

If you liked this movie, I recommed: watch Deathstalker 2, its hilarious.

What I learned from Conquest: When you hit someone on the head with a stick, all their skin and scalp and hair blows off, exposing all of their brains. Good stuff.

Caution! The DVD is pretty much crap quality, so don't mistake the crappiness for the fog thats in EVERY FRIGGIN SCENE! It drives a person nuts after a while.
