A movie of overall splendour with a world class cast,  where history, romance and thrilling battle scenes unfold before your eyes.  The glory of Rome in her downward spiral takes on new meaning when Attila, played by Gerard Butler, in what I believe to be one of his best performances, comes on the scene.  A great cast, each and every one bringing to life this masterful epic of rich history along with the pomp and ceremony of two entirely different cultures and civilizations.  As a fairly new and up and coming great actor Mr. Butler more than held his own with many well known movie names.  I predict great things to come for this young man and hope he gets the chance to play more epic character roles.  With his great acting abilities he certainly brings this type of role to life with his dedication to becoming one with the character he takes on.  A truly great movie, one I hope will become a classic, and well worth collecting and viewing.  Even if you view history as boring stuff out of dull, dusty history books - this will bring an entirely different meaning to "history" at it's best.  The special features is well worth a special mention as a must see addition to behind the scenes production, wonderful photography, hundreds of extras, including young, newly trained Asian army personell who took on the roles of Roman soldiers.  I can't rate this DVD highly enough; of course, I  love history and epic movies so maybe a little biased!
