Beautiful Boy is not your typical American film--and that's a compliment. This is a movie that could easily have become excessively maudlin and violent. It almost always hits the right notes. This is a testament to the intelligent screenplay, subtle direction, and brilliant acting.

The only child of a busy, self absorbed married couple goes off the deep end his freshman year of college and massacres students and faculty before committing suicide. Fortunately we never see the violence. The shooting is off screen so we do not have to witness horrific scenes that many Hollywood directors seem to relish.

The married couple is playing by Michael Sheen and Maria Bello, two wonderful actors who are pitch perfect. We see their worlds come apart as they attempt to cope with what has to be one of the worst things that could happen to a parent. It might in fact be too intense for parents--I kept thinking about how happy I am that I don't have kids. Sheen and Bello perfectly portray the utter helplessness of parents who did the best they could but might have raised a monster who they still love and mourn.
