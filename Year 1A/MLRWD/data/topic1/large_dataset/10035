Okay, maybe the early '90's wasn't exactly a sketch comedy "golden age," but it was a time when Fox was still taking chances putting unconventional shows on TV.  I remember watching the Ben Stiller show when it first aired, and absolutely loving it.  It's amazing to me that, as I watched the DVD for the first time, I could remember specific sketches and moments from 13 years ago.  This show was never really given a chance to build an audience, but I don't know if this show was meant to have a long run- each episode is all the more funny because there is so little of it to enjoy.  I don't agree with other reviewers criticism of Ben Stiller- he is very good in many of the sketches, and the fact that he sometimes is outshined is a testament to his ability to find truly exceptional talent and his ability to use them.  I find Stiller's imitation of Tom Cruise particularly entertaining. I think my favorite of all the cast, though, is Bob Odenkirk's "Manson" character.  This is worth a look for any sketch comedy fan.
