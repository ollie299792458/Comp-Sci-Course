Harold and Maude is just a delight to see.  Somehow, the wonderful acting of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort seem to get away with their relationship (which  at the time, was QUITE a scandal!)
What is so great about this show is  that it was written so beautifully and sensitively.  I don't know of any  other movie that talks about life and death in such a sensitive, but yet  lighthearted manner.
My favorite scene is when Harold and Maude are in a  daisy field and Maude says:  "You know Harold, I'd like to come back  as a sunflower most of all.  They're so big and hearty.  What would you  like to come back as?"  Harold responds by saying "One of  these" (meaning one of the daisies).  Maude says "How come"  and he replies, "Because they're all alike." 
Then comes the  Kleenex box when she replies  "Oh no, Harold, They're not all alike!  You see, some grow to the left, some to the right, some have even lost  petals, all SORTS of observer able differences . . .  You see, Harold, I  feel that much of the world's sadness comes from someone who is this"  (she picks a daisy from the field) -- "but yet ALLOWS themselves to be  treated as that" (gesturing to the entire field of daisies).
You  can't beat this show for its marvelous acting by Ruth Gordon, especially.  You will also never find another movie that can portray all of these  intense subjects in such a carefree way that they seem commonplace.
Get  this movie and watch it several times to really enjoy it.  I've seen it at  least 30 times, myself and have enjoyed it more and more each time.
