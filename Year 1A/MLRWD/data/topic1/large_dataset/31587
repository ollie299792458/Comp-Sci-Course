Rush Hour 3, is a good movie and many say that this movie is dull and boring.  Like an earlier review, I feel that when it comes to the Rush Hour series you pretty much know what you can come to expect. Many laughs, a predictable story line and action.  The 3rd installment provides all of the above.  I think the movie is good, but not great. I am a strong believer that the 1st installment in any series is typically the best because it is original and one doesn't know often what to expect. I am giving it 5 stars because it gave me what I expect.  Jackie and Chris work well together.  I do feel that this series lacked an in-depth storyline. I do think that a Rush Hour 4 should not be produced not because of a lack of laughs or action but because of storyline. I really don't know how much further in storyline the producers can go. Nevertheless, from the moment I sat down to when I got up, I laughed, and there was action throughout.  For any Rush Hour fan of the previous installments you won't be disappointed.
