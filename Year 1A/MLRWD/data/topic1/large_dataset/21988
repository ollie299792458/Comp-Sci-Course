I bought this to have segmented blocks of exercise to add to circuit training and this is a nice DVD for that.  I appreciate that each segment is very different from one another and that you can tailor it to you specific fitness level.

Seg 1 is great for getting into the workout mood through steady exercise and heart rate elevation. Advanced fitness types will find that this probably doesnt quiet get them into their HRM but increase the movements and you'll be fine.

Seg 2 has easy to learn/complete kickbox movements.  Nothing too fancy but enough to keep your heart rate steady (not really an energizing segment)

Seg 3 has polymetrics, lunges and hops, so if you have bad knees, try alternatives to decrease pressure.  Great blast in the middle of the workout.

Seg 4 has good use of interval training but the word bootcamp is a mis-title- nothing boot camp about it .. at least we didnt do this in our bootcamp but none the less it has challenging moves.

Seg 5, 3-5 lbs weights are good for this section or no weights at all are find too.

You have 3-play options: All in order at one time w/o having to manually advance/fwd; Organize your own or play 1-at a time.
