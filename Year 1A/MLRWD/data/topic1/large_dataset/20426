Thank goodness this film didn't get any media attention like "Lost in Translation" did, otherwise you'd have hoards of brain-dead children calling it "obscene" "gay" and "Anti-American" 
Could you imagine if the religious right became aware of it? You would have an overwhelming stench of conservative propganda on your hands; because this film represents everything they're against--morally, politically, and ethically. But this is a wonderful film, full of homages to cinema and to the kids who grew up with it as an art form and a revolution. It's also about the shattering of sexual taboos and how it may or may not lead to permanent change.
I saw this on a college campus with a few squeamish kids. If you feel strongly against sexuality in general, I advise you to avoid this. If you're curious about it but prone to embarassment, then rent it and watch it alone. Do not watch this edited or else you'll lose the full scope of Bertolucci's work. 
Film buffs need not read the above statement. They already know better :)
