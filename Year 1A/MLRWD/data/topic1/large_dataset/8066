When I first heard that there was finally a sequel to the original Boondock Saints I could not have been more excited!! That was one of the most thrilling, fun, humorous, and insightful movies I have ever seen. But the sequel....
The ending to the first gave the impression that they would continue on as the vengeful voice of the people who are fed up with crime bosses getting away with anything. Only to find out in the sequel that they RAN AWAY right after that public spectacle of vigilantism?? It made no sense!
There were a LOT of things that just reminded me of the first movie only not as well done (the idiotic side kick, the FBI agent ally, the moronic Boston cops).
The only thing I think this movie stayed true to is the relationship between the brothers. Their loyalty and affection for each other above all is remarkable. Also, their constant bickering which causes problems for the characters generally leads to huge laughs for the audience.
Another thing I couldn't help but notice was that Sean Patrick Flanery has not aged well. Each time they gave him full face shot I couldn't help but think of the Santa Claus movie where Tim Allen gets puffy cheeks and a beard to become Santa- SPF looked like he was undergoing the same change! Yes, I understand people change as they age but Norman Reedus didn't seem to have the same problem.
I do not know the process of how this second Boondock Saints movie came about but I think they could've done without! The first movie was perfect. The sequel kinda ruins the mythology a bit. And although I thought it was very interesting to learn how their family got started on their path I do think they spent WAY too much time on the back story.
I will watch my rental one more time to try and like this movie but I sincerely doubt this will ever make it into my movie collection.
