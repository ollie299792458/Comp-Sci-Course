this movie is simply the greatest movie of all time!  it has it all, great plot, great special effects, great acting, and LOTS of action!  this is one of those movies that everyone should see.  its a story about police officer  alex murphy who gets shot to death in the line of duty and is reborn as the  cyborg "robocop".  who knew about a movie about a guy who gets  shot to death then turned into a robot could be such a success?  paul  verhoeven was the only director who took the script after so many others  turned it down.  he did a fantastic directing job and basil poledouris  added a soundtrack that brought so much life to this movie.  the ED-209  sequences were just amazing.  i loved the ed209 vs robocop fight that was  action packed! 
  peter weller does an outstanding job as alex  murphy/robocop, he does such a great job playing the cyborg. nancy allen  also plays her role very good too, as the partner of robocop, anne lewis.  Clarence boddicker is one of the baddest SOBs that i've ever seen in a  movie, he is the ultimate villan.
  all in all RoboCop is worth the  buy!  you must see it, you'll never forget it!
