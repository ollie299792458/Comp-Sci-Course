This is a repost of my review from the IMDB site, but since my feelings on the movie haven't changed between then and now, hey.
Many folks find themselves laughing out loud at Al's latest song or video -- at least, the first time they experience it. They might later claim he's stupid or not funny, afraid possibly of being labeled a fan. They might avoid UHF in the belief that it's just an extended Al video.
Their loss.
'UHF' is one of those movies that had a miserable, worthless existence in the theater, shunned by the masses. The recognition of its genius was slow to arrive, but the movie did eventually find cult status on video and cable. The reason, simply: It's hilarious.
Part Naked Gun and part Al video, with plenty of sight gags, this is the kind of movie that only Al could make. "Wheel Of Fish" and "Conan the Librarian" are funnier than they have any right to be, and just wait until you see "Raul's Wild Kingdom".
The cast of 'UHF' seems almost prescient in retrospect; Fran Drescher and Michael Richards made memorable co-stars before they struck gold on network TV. Richards, especially, is hilarious as janitor-turned-TV host Stanley Spadowski. He's brilliant, better than anyone else in the movie and better even than the material he's given.
Although ostensibly a dig at TV, 'UHF' actually lampoons movies and commercials far more effectively, with hilarious send-ups of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Ghandi' and 'Rambo: First Blood Part II'.
But enough. I've already wasted too many words describing a movie that just needs to be seen. If you absolutely hate Al, or 'Airplane'-type movies, then avoid 'UHF'. Anyone else who just wants to laugh (a lot) needs to give it a look.
