It has all the subtlety of a train wreck.  Woody Allen is a clever man, and indeed there are several good zingers, but each one is repeated in such a juvenile manner that I fear Mr. Allen doesn't give his audience enough credit for getting it the first time.
For example, there is a scene where Woody is matchmaking two idiots.  He declines their invitation to join them by saying, "No, thank you. I'm superfluous."  To which one idiot replies, "Oh, you're not feeling well?"  What a great zinger! But then he belabors the joke by going on: "No, SUPERFLUOUS.  Uh... superfluous means unneccessary... I'd only get in the way..." This sort of audience-coddling continues throughout the movie, right up to the end, where even the final scene is amended with a clumsy explanation for the dim-witted. The movie ends with the same gag (a Broadway-Greek chorus) that has already been done 3 times in the last 95 minutes. We got it the first time, Woody.
Acting? You'll hardly notice. The characters are such obvious, stereotypical caricatures that they become entirely boring and predictable--if not offensive to Jews, women, boxers, hairdressers, husbands, wives and barkeeps.  I was embarrassed for the lot of them.
Unless you, too, are stuck in the sixties, you might do yourself a favor by skipping this one. Woody even managed to waste the incredible talent of F. Murray Abraham!
