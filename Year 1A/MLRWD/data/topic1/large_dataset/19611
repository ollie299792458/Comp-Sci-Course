I am not sure what movie all these other raters watched!!! I am a huge movie buff and was so excited to see this flick.  This movie started off great!  The movie had an excellent plot and a whole lot of potential.  The action, violence, camera work and acting were good.  As soon as the main character meets up with his girlfriend, the movie becomes asanine and just plain stupid.  In my opinion, she ruins the movie!  Sex does not bother me, but the sex scenes in this movie were pointless and completly unnecessary!  A critical part of any movie is the ending and this movie screwed that up too.  I am not sure who edited this movie, but they did a poor job.  Several scenes should have been cut and the ending should have been completely scrapped!  Do not buy this movie and certainly do not rent it!  If you want to waste valuable time in your life and feel less intelligent, find someone with a DVD burner and have them burn you a free copy.  Then you will see exactly what I mean.  Turkish, movies like this will kill your career!
