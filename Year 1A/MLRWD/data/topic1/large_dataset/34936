First of all, let me start off by saying that I have been a comic book veteran for years.  I have read a multitude of titles and the X-men being one of them.
When I had heard about the release of X-Men the movie I was very skeptical.  This had all of the potential of being a big-costume, big-budget bust.  Tim Burton's brilliance aside, I could not realistically see a good movie coming from a comic book.
Needless to say, Brian Singer proved me wrong.  Hugh Jackman gave the best performance in the movie by far.  The tragic characters of Magneto and Rogue were brought to life in a much different light then the comics have painted.  The special affects were absoluteley awesome.  I saw this movie and realized that I was not watching a comic book on-screen, but a story unfold.  OK, I can admit a bit of the dialouge was a little forced, but overall this movie has far exceeded my expectations.  
No you do not have to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie.  X-Men tells a story of tragedy and triumph, with no defined  good or evil.  Cheers to Singer and to the whole cast and crew for annhilating the skeptics.
