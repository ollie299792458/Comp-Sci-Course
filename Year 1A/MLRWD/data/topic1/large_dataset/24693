" The Other Guys" is now the funniest movie I have ever seen! I went to the movies last week to see the film and laughed so hard I thought I would have to leave the theater for being disruptive. A storyline that pulses from the very beginning, the use of backstory, character development, political and government references, a boatload of cameo appearances, the "frozen pic" bar scene, the sexual reference humor with a twist, the comments from Captain Gary, the  comedic reference to theToyota Prius and the absolutely SICK (ie cool) soundtrack are reasons to see this movie!  ( And I didn't even give any information about the movie away!!).

 For those who are not huge Will Farrell fans, Mark Walhburg and other characters keep him in check with comments and prevents too much silliness. Very enjoyable with an audience.

I went back to the theater and saw it again the next week! ( I never, ever do that!)

Regarding the soundtrack, I have been unable to locate the song that Mark popped into the CD player by Gorgon Thunder,  Let Loose the Dragon.  ( Sigh)
