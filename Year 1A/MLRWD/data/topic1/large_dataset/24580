This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that it's necessarily Oscar-worthy; it's just that it is so rare these days to see a good premise be so flawlessly executed. The writing is clever, slowly building tension then delivering jokes (or fatalities) before building tension again.

Anyone familiar with horror movies, especially of the "a group of kids go into the woods..." variety, will see references to classic elements from favorite films - the haunted-looking cabin in the woods, the use of certain power and hand tools, creepy townsfolk, etc. But the director does a great job of helping the audience to see both the frightening and the ordinary in each of those scenarios. Is the cabin creepy, or just a DIY project away from a great vacation home? Is the local yokel whose laugh makes your skin crawl actually dangerous, or just nervous around pretty girls?  and so on.

Likable lead roles and appropriately two-dimensional secondary characters are ably portrayed by the cast, although the rapport between Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) is truly exceptional and a key reason why the movie works so well. I giggled through most of the movie, well, when I wasn't gagging over some of the worst bloodshed, and was delighted by the way the movie both followed established horror "rules" and also turned the worst cliches on their ears. This is a great movie - something I'd consider to be (at last!) a worthy American response to Shaun of the Dead.
