In modern day American cinema I feel as though big budget Hollywood is more concerned with cheesy, overpaid acting and special effects.  Though Dead or Alive has its share of special effects, the camera work and acting is a throw back to movies such as Citizen Kane.  While I would not place this movie in the same company as The Godfather or Citizen Kane, this movie does have its moments.  In my opinion, Miike knows how to make a movie the right way, with skillful cutting and effective camera work.  Even if you see this movie for its camera work alone you can appreciate it.  Though this movie has its gruesome parts, aside from a woman getting killed in her own excrement, there's nothing we haven't seen already.  Do not let this stop you from seeing this movie if you are at all interested in it.  From the music, to the camera work, to the gruesome depiction of gang war, this movie reminds me of an Asian Scarface.  Though this movie has a completely different point, if you liked Scarface, you should watch this movie.  My favorite part of this movie is how Miike was able to switch from scenes of family and reality to scenes of gore and crime effortlessly, reminding the viewer that those are just as much a part of the world we live in.  The scene in which the main character has a meal with his partner and his 5 yr old son is one that stuck out in my head due to the incredibly subtle and realistic acting and lack of cuts made by the camera.  It is simple scenes like this that has become a lost art in Hollywood.  Though this movie was superbly done, it is for a mature audience and does contain scenes of gruesome violence.  Those scenes are no worse than the brain dinner in Hannibal or the shower scene in Scarface.  Watch this movie for its fine acting and direction.
