I really thought this would be one of the summer's most hilarious comedies....apparently not.

The humor in this movie gave me a very mixed reaction. Some parts made me laugh a little bit and some jokes fell flat. A lot of people say this movie is offensive to all the weird woman that Deuce goes out with. That probably isn't true unless you are offended easily.

Rob Schneider really isn't all that funny in this movie. He made me crack up in the first Deuce Bigalow, The Hot Chick, The Animal, and his cameos in Adam Sandler movies. I would probably rent those instead of spending $8 to go out and see this. Eddie Griffin as Deuce's friend made me laugh more than anything else. By more I mean like 7 or 8 times.

The reason why this movie isn't as funny as you'd think is b/c of its length I think. This movie was just too short (77 mins) and the jokes just went by too fast that they came off as stupid and unfunny. If the writers would have stretched this out a little bit to maybe 90 mins, it would've been a little funnier.

This movie still has its funny moments. I chuckled about 7 times in the movie. Those parts alone made up for the ones that fell flat. But I really wouldn't recommend this movie to most people unless you like really stupid humor, otherwise I would go out and see Wedding Crashers for some laughs.
