I see a number of five star reviews for this film. We can't

give any film a higher rating than five stars, so that means

there are people here on earth who rank this movie with

Rashomon, Sullivan's Travels, Children of Paradise,

and Dr. Strangelove - when in fact it's about as estimable

as an episode of Starsky and Hutch.

The most irksome thing about Cellular is the complete

absence of accountability for the crimes committed by its

protagonist, Ryan. Let's see: armed robbery, auto theft,

willful damage to property, reckless driving - that results in

innumerable automobile acidents ( which surely caused

serious injuries ), resisting arrest, etc. He swipes a man's

Porche ( at gun point ) - and apparently the director thinks

this is OK because the Porsche's owner is a repugnant

lawyer...Ryan gets away with everything, and winds up

with the babe on the pier.

There's another annoyance, smaller, but annoying never-

the-less. Jessica says that her husband is a real-a-tor...

Bill Macy is very good, as always.
