I've always been a little critical of American television and their long seasons. With 22 and 23 episodes every year, producers and creators are forced to fill up week after week even if they don't have material to make it work. Something like Eastbound and Down shows how a show with only 6 episodes can eclipse many of the shows with 3 or 4 times that amount.

Kenny Powers is one of those characters that makes you think about yourself. Such as "How can I actually be pulling for someone who is such an obvious trainwreck of a person?" He is consistently ill-mannered, makes the worst possible decisions, cares little for the feelings of others, and wears turquoise jewelry. Yet, by the final scene, you are behind him all the way.

It is a special kind of humor, and some people might not find it funny at all. For those who enjoy it, however, each episode is unendingly hilarious. Some great cameos by Will Ferrell and Craig Robinson are fun to see, but Danny McBride is top-notch.

I can't help but look forward to the new episodes, but in my opinion, the six episodes here could stand alone as a testament to how great comedy should be done.
