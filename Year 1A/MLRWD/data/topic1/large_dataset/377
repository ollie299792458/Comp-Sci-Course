Being a WV native, and Huntington resident from 1967-1992 as well as a student at MU 1969-71, I waited for this film with both curiosity and some fear of what the producers would do to the story.

Some of the landmarks have changed-the downtown bridge is long gone and the bridge in the final scene wasn't completed until the late 1980's.  The restaurant scenes capture the essence of Wiggins' 16th Street altho' it is gone as well.  However, the feelings and the emotions of the community were portrayed exactly as we remembered them, we being my wife, a Huntington native and Marshall graduate.  It took many months if not years before the community began to understand the impact of the trajedy.  I believe it was to the University's, the Board of Regent's, and the Collegiante Athletics Commission's credit that MU was allowed to return to play and field a team, no matter how makeshift.

Following the Young Thundering Herd gave us cause to begin the healing process.  Failing to re-instate the football program would have forever left the plane crash as a final punctuation point to MU athletics.

Matt Macconaughey's portrayl of post-crash Coach Jack Lengyel seemed a little over the top to me, but there is no question that Coach Lengyel is indeed a character. That outrageous sports coat was actually only slightly out of fashion in the day.

I saw the film in Florida, 2 months after it's release.  I was amazed that at the end of the film very few in the audience left.  Most folks, including us, just sat quietly in their seats while the credits rolled and then very quietly got up and left the theatre.

That was exactly the atmosphere on the Marshall Campus following the crash in 1969.  Well done!
