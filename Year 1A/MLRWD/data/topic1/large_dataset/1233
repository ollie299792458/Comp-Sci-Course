OK, I know there are some hardcore Rob Zombie fans that love everything with his name on it. And rightly so, he is a talented musician with an obvious love for the Horror genre. But you must admit that all the hype leading up to the release of HO1kC was just that....hype. Touted as being the film that would usher in a new age in horror. Well, it wasn't. But, "Wrong Turn" is all of that. Wrong Turn is politically incorrect(inbred and grossly disfigured cannibal hillbillies living in West Virginia), has some pretty inventive and gory mutilations, and a 70's horror movie feel to boot!
Stan Winston and his team have truly created a a 70's horror movie atmosphere with none of the wink and nod, music video vibe that was such a glaring mistake in Zombie's movie. Wrong Turn gets you interested from the very beginning and doesn't let go. There were people sitting around me in the theater that were actually wimpering in fear! No joke!
It's just too bad that such an exciting film never found it's audience in the theaters. If you are a horror movie fan don't miss the DVD release!
