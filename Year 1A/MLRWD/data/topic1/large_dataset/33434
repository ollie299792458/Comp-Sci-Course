I was very excited when this finally was remastered and released on DVD. I have always found the black & white films to provide an added element of mystery to the tales, and I must confess that I am partial to them for this reason.  This restoration from the original was very well done.

Having seen many different actors portray the legendary Sherlock Holmes, I have always found the combination of Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce portraying Holmes & Watson to be the most legendary.  This version of The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the best the two actors appeared in, along with The Scarlet Claw.

The story, of course, centers around a legendary hound that legend tells has stalked the descendants of Hugo Baskerville since his mutilation death by the beast some centuries in the past.  Holmes & Watson go to work in an attempt to prevent the current heir to the Baskerville estate from meeting the same fate as his ancestor Hugo did.

This is an excellent version of the classic tale, and is a must for the home video collection if you are a real Sherlock Holmes fan.
