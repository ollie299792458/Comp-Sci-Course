This is one of the funniest movies ever...

Lots of people are saying that it's a negative reflection on society...well I disagree.  It is a lot of stupid stuff, but that's exactly why it's funny in the first place--BECAUSE it is stupid.

How can you NOT think that going skiing down a flight of stairs isn't funny?  It's hilarious!  Or flying over a lake in a ROCKET-PROPELLED SHOPPING CART???  That's awesome!  How about hanging onto a firehose suspended in the air while it's spraying water everywhere?

...Or getting shot by a 750 caliber rubber ball mine?  The fact is, it's more guyish humor...I'm a guy, so I would know...and lemme tell ya...if you think putting on a helmet that's full of crap and farts is funny, then this is definitely the movie for you...or how about sitting on an electric stool?

Or trying to escape a herd of angry bulls running down the street?  Or the freakin' toro-totter???  Come ON, that's FUNNY!!!

You should buy this movie.  It's worth it.
