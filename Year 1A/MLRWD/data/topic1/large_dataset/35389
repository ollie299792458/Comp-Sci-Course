This was a very good movie, deserves four stars instead of five if we consider crude language that overpowers the theme, but will give it five because of Melissa Leo. There was too much license with trying to shock our sensibilities with crude and vulgar language; the point is that the main character, Kristen Stewart, is uneducated and has no filters when it comes to language and I felt that the language detracted from the film and suspended empathy for Ms. Stewart's character. Otherwise, this was a great vehicle for James Gandolfini to show that he has the chops to move from the small screen to the big screen and the big screen allows him a breadth of emotion that he cannot as easily display on a television series. He not only moved to the big screen with ease, but he owns it in this film.  Equally brilliant is Melissa Leo who plays his neurotic and damaged wife and her performance is the best in this film: Melissa Leo embodies characters and we forget that she is an actress and this film allows her to soar. Watching her face and her emotions is like watching a palette of her range. Returning to Kristen Stewart's role, the crudity of her language became a character on its own and it overpowered her performance; during one scene in a bathroom where Leo's character attempts to help Ms. Stewart there was an opportunity to allow real tenderness, but the scene is sullied by crude language - the language diminishes the depth of character - and our sympathy is stopped short. Melissa Leo's acting turns this film from a good one to a great one and without giving too much away her scene in the diner is the best in the film.
