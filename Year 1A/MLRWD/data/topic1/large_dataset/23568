About time FOX released this on DVD!...an awesome transfer, outstanding color and restoration. You have read the plot above about this 1943 BUSBY BERKLEY MUSICAL and it is a formula WWII story line...BUT...the production numbers and effects are SPECTACULAR!...and they didn't have computers! This DVD is also part of "THE ALICE FAYE COLLECTION" but CARMEN MIRANDA steals the show...the COLORFUL "LADY IN THE TUTTI-FRUITI HAT" number is the Quintessential CARMEN! The number to end all production numbers of the 40s! Although the DVD extras are all good...they are not what was supposed to be in the pre-release information. Where is CARMEN MIRANDA on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW? (an early broadcast showing color television in it's infancy)...also other clips from the Johnny Carson show doing a banana number etc. Somehow those people at FOX made a bad decision to leave these extras out in the final DVD release...are they all now too young to remember? However...we are lucky to have this...and other CARMEN MIRANDA films now coming out on DVD...let's keep them coming!

This is a 'MUST HAVE' for everyone's vintage film collection! SUPERB!!!
