I was taken to see "The 40 Year Old Virgin" by my sister, who is fivie years older than me and a non-virgin.  She took me on the account of I was still a virgin and therefore must be doing something wrong.  She figured this movie would sort things out.  About fivie minutes into the movie we are laughing as hard as we have ever laughed in our lives.  This Movie was HILLARIOUS!  It had all the elemetns a good comedy needs.  One part Crude Humor mixed with three parts good sitations going arye, add one part heart.  Stir until frothy and you got a dang good comedy.

The movie also makes you think about things that many people might not.  Like is it so bad to be a virgin if sex doesn't interest you. It also brings up the good point of does it really matter if your a virgin as long as your a good person?  I think the best thing about seeing the movie was as we were walking out of the theatre my sister said "I think you going to be alright" and the subject of my virginity was never nor will ever be brought up again.

All in all if you look past the more crude elements of the film you really do have a great movie.  That concludes class for today now go and spend some time with your significant other (be it man, woman, puppy, of goldfish.)
