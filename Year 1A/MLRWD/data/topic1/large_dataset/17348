My family (kids 15, 13 and 9) really enjoyed this movie!  It is the story of orphan Maria Merryweather, who must go to live with her mysterious uncle in an isolated manor house after the death of her father.  She discovers that she is the last of the "moon princesses" who can save the surrounding valley from destruction -- but only if she meets certain challenges and tests of her character.  The look of the production design is very appealing and interesting -- my 15 year-old called it "steampunk", sort of Victorian/dystopian.  Dakota Blue Richards does a good job as Maria Merryweather and Juliet Stevenson is priceless as the governess Miss Heliotrope.  Tim Curry is suitably creepy as the leader of the de Noir clan.
The movie changes quite a bit from the original book, The Little White Horse, by Elizabeth Goudge, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142300276">The Little White Horse</a> (which was published in 1946, four years before C.S. Lewis' first Narnia book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) but I still enjoyed it a lot and the plot probably needed a little updating to appeal to today's audiences.  Children who like the Chronicles of Narnia will probably enjoy The Little White Horse, especially girl readers.  It was my favorite book as a child and although this movie is not, in my opinion, as good as the book (when is a movie ever as good as the book?), it was fun and suspenseful.
