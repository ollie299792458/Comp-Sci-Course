I will have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that this movie was fluffed, and a little too careful with the production of this movie.  I feel that the director could have definitely included the incestuous act, as it would add a little more spice to it.  I mean it was interesting to the point where it made you not want to leave until you found out what was going to happen, but if you collect movies like most of us, and you will be watching this more than once, then it could use some excitement.  Excellent story line, and in the beginning, how their father died and they had to resort to living back home, where she escaped from years ago.Now, because of the mom's incestuous relationship with the children's father, how the grandmother  was going to punish them all for the mothers sins,including the mom. very sick. very interesting.At the end, I would have liked to see more reaction from the mother's wedding party when the children finally escape from the attic and tell everyone during the ceremony of the mom's marriage, how they were locked in the attic all that time and how the younger son was poisoned by his own mother, AND NOW HERE SHE IS GETTING MARRIED TO A MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA SHE EVEN HAD CHILDREN.  The mom, falls off the balcony and dies, the grandmother never pays for what she's done and is still alive, and the groom, just stood there with a slightly shocked look on his face. COME ON??????! Needs to be more dramatic but over all very interesting plot and story.
