Tom Selleck stars again as Robert B. Parker's flawed police chief Jesse Stone, balancing professional challenges, a drinking problem and lingering repressed feelings for his ex-wife. The fact that Stone is flawed just like the rest of us, and yet the compassionate "hero" of the film, brings a grim authenticity to the table, enabling the viewer to journey more deeply into the story. Robert Harmon (director) and his production team yet again acheive an atmosphere of almost film noir edginess. The dialogue rings true and demonstrates much respect for Parker's original dialogue in the books. Stone (beautifully realized by Selleck) is efficient and dry in his language ... "I'm the police chief, I know everything", not unlike Parker's other literary sleuth, Spenser. In fact, now that Robert Urich is no longer with us, Selleck would make an ideal Spenser. Although a small town, Paradise, MA is not exempt from the crime, scandal and corruption imbedded in any other town, big or small. At the end of the day, Stone's experience and quiet tenacity ultimately find the truth. Now that "Sea Change" has been released (the fourth and most recent of the Jesse Stone films), I have seen all four, and can attest to their high quality on every level.
