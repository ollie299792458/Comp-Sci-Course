It's FINALLY out!! Best musical movie I've ever seen (aside from Phantom of the Opera, 2004 version). I looove RENT so much, it's a wonderful message, really heartfelt and it hits close to home. A story of friends living the bohemian life in NYC circa 1989-1990 and most everyone in the clan has AIDS. Amazingly, now that I think back (and watch it again), the only real bit of comic relief that I can remember is Mark and Roger's answering machine's repetitive-ness: SPEEEEAAK gets me every time. :) At first when I went to see it, I didn't think I would like the movie very much, it looked too into the rock-music for me to enjoy. But I was (obviously and thankfully) mistaken. The music was wonderful and the parts were played by the seasoned Broadway actors who originated them (except Mimi/Dawson and Joanne/Thoms). Everyone's performances were the most believable that I have ever seen, probably because they've been so comfortable in them for so many years. I surprised myself as I felt tears running down my face at the end; I didn't think it had had that big of an impact on me. Wrong again.

The few things I warn about: make sure whoever is seeing this movie is... mature. There are a gay couple and a lesbian couple, a few F-bombs and someone gets mooned. Not too bad, you get used to the couples after seeing them long enough, and the F-bomb is... twice, in the same song. That's about it, I hope you enjoy it. No day but today, so go see it now! :)
