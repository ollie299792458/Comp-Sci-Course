Certainly a master piece in terms of animation.  Incredible to the point where you have to clear your eyes in amazement as to how real the characters seem.
The story line is "cute" yet it carries on for too long and there are times where you can almost loose interest and give it up, this specially when you expect amovie of this kind (Disney) to be full of adventure, songs, and "jumping around" at all times.  
I have a 2 1/2 year old and even though perhaps a bit to young to "understand" a movie about dinosaurs, I thought It would be a piece she would enjoy because of the scenery, and the characters (lemurs -monkeys-); well I had to stop the movie almost within 2 minutes into it, because there are some scenes that are a bit "cruel" although real, perhaps unnecessary in a film of this nature.  For the most part during the rest of the movie, this turned out to be not so bad, and we continued the show.
Yes, the plot is a bit long and there are not many "cool" scenes, just a lot of very good animation and at points some sound effects that are worth sitting thought.
I would recommend "screening" the movie before you play it for younger audiences, don't let this movie surprise you; just because it is from Disney doen't mean it is all nicey!
