If you like me are a historical person, this is a very well directed, acted and edited black and white hollywood picture produced by WB and filmed in 1939 (as Nazi troops invade Poland), about the French intervention to Mexico supporting Maximilian's ill claim to the Mexican empire in the 1860s.

The theme song of "La Paloma" as translated by Miss Davis is sublime.  Very interesting to compare the French intervention to the Nazi occupation of Europe at that time during the beginning of WW2.  Somehow, Paul Muni with too much make-up as Benito Juarez carrying Lincoln's picture is not credible, Mr. Aherne is perfect as Maximilian and Miss Davis as Empress Carlota gives a noteworth performance during the mad scene at her arrival to the French court collapsing before Napoleon and ministers. She should have won an Oscar!

Great set designs especially of Chapultepec castle.  Too short of a film to include all facts and should have been filmed in color. I waited for a long time to get this film on CD. A true jewel of the golden era of hollywood.
