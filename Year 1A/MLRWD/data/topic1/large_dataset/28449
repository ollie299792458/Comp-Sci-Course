This was one of the first DVDs I ever purchased and continue to be impressed by both the film and the extra content presented in this edition. Director David Fincher shows that he is truly one of the best film makers around by the way he handles the material. No shot is pointless nor is any of the dialogue throwaway.

The characters and plot all begin as if this is a run-of-the mill cliched cop-movie but the film soon evolves into something quite different. Sinister and unexpected this movie had me hooked as the two cops investigate a string of brutal murders.

I found the film enjoyable but not light-hearted. For fans of these types of movies this is easily one of the best. I would not recommend this to people who don't like profanity or violence. Even though most of the violence in this movie is implied rather than explicit it can still be hard to stomach for some viewers.

All in all a great plot, good acting, masterfully directed and very engrossing. The movie also brings out some interesting themes on morality, apathy and life in general without preaching to its audience. One of my favourite films of all time.
