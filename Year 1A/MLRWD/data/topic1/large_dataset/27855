I'd seen the trailers and read press releases for this movie. It didn't prepare me at all for what I was about to experience.

Machine Gun Preacher is the story of Sam Childers, fictionalized for a broader audience and appeal. Sam was once an ex-con, drug addict, and all around bad dude.

Upon his release from prison, he finds out his wife had become a Christian. Little did he know how upside down his world was about to become.

Gerard Butler did a fantastic job playing Sam as he went on his journey. You could see the pain in his eyes, the desire to do good, and the destruction it can sometimes bring.

Michelle Monaghan was good as the wife of Sam. She portrayed the hurt and despair as she seen her husband slip further and further away as he attempted to help the children of the Sudan.

I began watching the movie knowing the background and story. Yet I wasn't expecting the language, yes there is quite a bit of swearing, sexuality, and more in the movie. But that was okay. It setup the story and didn't hold back. If you're not okay with hearing and seeing these types of situations, you may have to pass by this convicting movie.

When you watch this movie, I feel you will be changed. You'll see a different side of the world we live in. One where pain and abuse are common place. Few men dare to go there. And yet Sam did.

If you're anything like me, you'll find a renewed, or new, desire to step up and do something about the atrocities happening in our world. That's what I feel the movie set out to accomplish and it did.
