Superbly cast, written and directed, this film will rip your heart out by the last 20 minutes.  Mired in the homophobia of a town and culture, the protagonist supercedes his own internalized homophobia to admit to and embrace the love he has for another man. Since I grew up in New York City way past Stonewall, at first I was rolling my eyes with the ideas of "typical" with the closeted love.  And growing up in the Bronx, a predominantly Latino and Black neighborhood, where the closet is a safe haven for some gays, I thought I new this story backward and forward, but hold on. The elements of magical realism employed expertly by Latin American writers and artists like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Reinaldo Arenas, create a narrative twist.  But still my jaded New York self rolled my eyes some more but found myself drawn into this story.  Then the progagonist, Mico, grows a pair of balls and acknowledges his love for Santiago and defies his community and his culture.  I haven't been so emotionally wrecked by a film since Brokeback Mountain.
