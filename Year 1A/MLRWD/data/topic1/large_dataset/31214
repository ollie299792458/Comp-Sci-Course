Ah yes, when men were men, and Burt Lancaster was the best of all possible men! He has always breathed a quality of three-dimensional life into the characters that he portrayed that made him almost mythical. But clearly this was one of Burt's best acting performances.  The man embodied sheer brilliance.

In one scene Elmer (Burt Lancaster) walks into an all black Church, takes a place in the pews and starts singing "I'm On My Way" with the rest of the parishioners.  Everyone stops singing... except Elmer.  He singings from such a depth of heart that everyone in the Church soon after embraces him as a brother.  That magnitude of passion is Burt being Burt.  He was one of a kind.

As the jilted Lulu Baines, Shirley Jones is not only breath-takingly beautiful but also heart-breakingly real and emotionally genuine.  If you can only remember Shirley Jones as Mother Partridge from "The Partridge Family" television series, then you definitely need to watch this film. She shows true talent and skill in this role.  (She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.)

This film should be rated "M" for mature; it is made for an adult, clear thinking audience.  If you are ready to put on your big girl panties (or big boy jockies) and deal with real world issues.... watch this DVD.  You will be a better person for having done so.  And that's something you can't say that about many films being produced nowadays.

If it is true that we have a panoramic life review when we die, then re-watching this film will be among the highlights of my current incarnation.  In my next life I want to be the sister, Sharon Falconer, to Burt's Elmer Gantry. That would be a life and love worth living! And what is love but the morning and evening star...
