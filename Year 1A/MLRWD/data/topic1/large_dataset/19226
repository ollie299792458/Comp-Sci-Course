(I won't comment on plot, since it's been covered.)
The theme of Patience is this movie's soul. Everyone seems to be waiting for a little humanity. In contrast to the rushing New Yorkers, Victor is truly alien in his huge capacity to wait. As an East European who knows the crush of bureaucracy, Victor's long, patient suffering under an American bureaucracy gone insane is painfully ironic. This suffering reaches a crescendo when another Russian immigrant literally grovels on his knees, begs and cries out for justice and mercy. In the end, humanity mostly prevails, but the waiting is a terrible process. This heavy material is encapsulated in a sweet comedy that has many light laughs, so this bitter pill goes down mostly sweet. The good-natured Victor never seems to flag in spirit and several subplots of romantic love brighten the movie in golden moments of light. It's clear that the characters have to handle their wait for a little blessed humanity in whatever way they can. Some manage it terribly and become dehumanized or even simply sadistic. Most get by. However a few, like Victor, wait it out courageously--even heroically.
