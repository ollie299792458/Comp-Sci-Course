Bruce Willis (praise God for him) is one of the few actors in Hollywood who is a pleasure to watch in any movie. This man even makes "Disney's the Kid" work. The only disaster he had was appearing in "Breakfast of the Champions" which rates as the worst movie I ever saw in my whole life. He can move from action hero to comedian in the blink of an eye. Only Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford have the same ability.
Matthew Perry is funny. Really funny. He is the fall guy in the movie and I think he performs very well indeed. Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet both impress with their beauty (especially Peet is quite generous with her body) and a bit of acting.
It is a fun movie which is about a poor dentist whose wife is trying to get him killed while he tries to get rid of his new neighbor who is a hitman for the mafia. Well, and as he falls in love with the hitman's girlfriend the situation gets into a very nice tangle. There are some nice surprises and a lot of good jokes. It is a good laugh.
This is a soap bubble of a movie. Nice to watch, very light and very forgettable. But good fun.
