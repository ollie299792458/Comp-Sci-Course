I remember watching this film as a child and finding it hysterical. Watching it again as an adult, when I am able to catch more of the jokes, made it even more hilarious. The performances are terrific, with Kevin Kline creating one of his funniest characters. He disappears completely into the idiotic, adulterous Joey, and never misses a step with his Italian accent. Tracy Ullman for once plays the straight (wo)man, and proves she has the strength to carry such a task. River Phoenix is wonderfully odd and idiosyncratic, and the fact that he doesn't really fit in works well for his part in the film. Of course the duo of William Hurt and Keanu Reeves is one of the high points of the movie, and it is amazing how watching two morons attempt to even walk and talk can make your day. My favorite character, however, is Joan Plowright's Mama Nadja, who is naively devilish and innocently sadistic... a combo that seems impossible, yet one she manages to pull off beautifully.
  The fact that the film is based on a true story makes the plot even more uproarious, and I don't think a 5 second span of time elapsed when I wasn't smiling. For light-hearted, ridiculous fun, I highly recommend this film. Enjoy!
