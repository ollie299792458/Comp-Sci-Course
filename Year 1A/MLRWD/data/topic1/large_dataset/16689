What do you get when Hollywood heavyweights like Kevin Spacey, Russel Crowe, Dani DeVito, James Cromwell and Guy Pearce combine forces and get involved in a movie with an excellent script? An instant hit movie, that's what.
Set in a 1950's surrounding, the movie shows LA's finest, the LAPD, as it once was. Corrupt, and struggling to make it's city a safer place of residence for it's citizens. 
After a shootout at a restaurant in which Bud White's (Crowe) ex-partner is killed, the LAPD quickly busts a couple of black kids for it, who manage to escape, and in turn get shot by Edmund Exley (Pearce) who becomes the city's hero.
Gradually, though, they find out that the three kids were in fact not related to the shooting, and they become entangled in a web of intrigue involving a rich millionaire running an escort service with girls who resemble moviestars. 
White ends up with one of those, Lyn Bracken (Played by Kim Basinger, who got an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the part), while Exley sides with Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Spacey), an officer who is mostly interested in getting some fame on a TV-show, and who is 'fed' stories by a sleazy reporter (DeVito).
Though friction exists between all of them, they somehow are dealing with cases that are connected to one another, and they soon find out that in order to unravel the big picture, they will have no choice but to cooperate.
The many plot-twists will make sure that for a long time the viewer will be kept guessing as to who-dunnit, and the characters were wonderfully cast. It's the classic story of bad-cop turns good-cop and vice versa, but with an unpredictable end. The actors all show amazing performances, and you cannot help but feel sympathetic for some, and loathsome towards others.
All in all, it's well worth the view!
