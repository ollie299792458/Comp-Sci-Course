You can still purchase both Sister Act movies, yet as of this review, Fistful of Dollars is still unavailable to the quality movie buying public.  Oh well, we've still got Whoopi!  Give me a break.  One could only dream  that it was Whoopi or any of her "nun too funny" cohorts who had  laughed in Clint's face when he asked for an apology to his mule.  Undoubtedly they would have met with the same fate that befell those five  (not four!) snickering cowpokes, and anyone else who was foolish enough to  cross paths with "The Man With No Name" in the first of the Leone  "Dollars" trilogy.  Contemporary audiences who fall over  themselves for a chance to watch a Tarantino flick may first wish to view  one of these masterpieces for an original treat in violence, humor, and  style.  While they're at it, they might as well check out the mesmerizing  original score by renowned film composer Ennio Morricone.  The film that  catapulted Eastwood to international superstardom still stands as a  visionary masterpiece, and patterned many an Eastwood character to follow.  So on May 4th, ride, don't walk to your local video retailer (or  amazon.com) and pick up a copy of this five-squint flick!
