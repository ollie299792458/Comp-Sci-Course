This concert is out of this world. The production is absolutely mind blowing and probably the biggest and most spectular ever. I'm a huge Floyd fan and already owned the following DVD's: PF: The Wall, PF: The Dark Side of the Moon, PF: Live at Pompei (Director's Cut), and Roger Waters: In the Flesh. I Love them all.

Just got this DVD "Roger Waters: The Wall, Live in Berlin" yesterday and watched it last night. I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances. To me all the guest performers renditions of the songs were great. I love Cyndi Lauper and thought her performance of "The Wall Pt2" was absolutely ecstatic and energetic (as she always is). Thomas Dolby's entrance was wickedly good. The scorpions opened the show with "In the Flesh" and what an opening it was. Absolutely electric. Bryan Adams was truly amazing. Sinead O'Conner's rendition of "Mother" was mystical. I can go on and on but in fact all the artists were great.

To tell you how much I enjoyed this concert I got up this morning as well and started to watch the DVD all over again. As well as playing back excerpts from "PF: The Wall" and "RW: In the Flesh" to compare renditions. There's something special in all the DVD's, each is different in its own way.

My recommendation is to buy this DVD now. Don't delay. You would not regret it. It is that good. If I had one wish though, it would be that Pink Floyd would reunite and give all of us what we've been waiting for. To see and hear them perform live again. I would buy that DVD in a heartbeat. The closest we've come to recently was them performing in the recent "Live8 Concert". Seeing them perform was the highlight for me. They were absolutely fantastic. I've ordered that DVD mainly because of them and should be receiving it soon. Can't wait to see them perform again. Pink Floyd, please reunite and give as at least one more concert before it's too late (Remember you guys aren't getting any younger).
