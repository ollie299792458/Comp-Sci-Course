I've heard a wide variety of mixed reviews about "The Mummy" so last weekend my wife and I watched it for ourselves. If you're a die hard Boris Karloff Mummy fan, you'll notice that several of the script lines are from the 1933 flick, although different people utter these. Boris was both Imhotep and Ardeth Bay while his old flame was Anchsunamun. Be prepared, they all show up in this new Mummy movie but as three different people (No Karis or Princess Ananka here). If you're looking for a Karloff/Chaney/Christopher Lee style leg dragging, bandage laden mummy movie, forget it. It's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Industrial Light and Magic, as usual, did a bang up job with the FX. To cut the long story short, it's a 21st century version of all of the old mummy movie plots with tons of action and amazing special effects. It's a new twist on an old story line, but hey, that's what Hollywood seems to have been doing here the past several years. We both rated it 5 stars because we both love action flicks and this one sure fits the bill.
If your're not into action or horror flicks(The Mummy is not really graphic horror), then don't even bother seeing this movie or its sequel (let alone rating it). However, if you are, then I recommend it highly.
