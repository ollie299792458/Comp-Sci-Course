We watched this movie before we watched the other two previous action movies with the big stars. At first I thought it was a bit cheesy, but our five year old daughter loved it. I really liked how people could relate to the characters, Velma was not an obnoxious nerd and Shaggy was very loveable, it was hard not to not like him. I thought Fred was cute and I loved that his traditional blonde locks did not make it in this film. The credits show you a picture of what he would have looked like with the hair....AWFUL! Daphne is down to earth and not some rich snob. Yes there was a mystery and plot to this movie. The only thing I really wasn't to fond of was the ghosts, they looked really scary to the point where our daughter wanted to stop watching the movie at first. She got over it quickly but even I was bothered by them.

After watching this a couple of times, we then rented the first dvd movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar, that movie was just awful. Bad acting and over produced, I wished for nothing but the movie to end quickly. Our daughter ended up not liking it either, if that tells you anything.

I look forward to hopefully seeing more of this cast in more Scooby movies to come!
