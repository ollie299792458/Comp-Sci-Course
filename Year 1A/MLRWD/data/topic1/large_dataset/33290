Die Hard began a subgenre in action films (as well as Bruce Willis' career as an action star)--that of the lone hero, a sort of cowboy for the modern era. Films like Under Siege ("Die Hard on a boat") and Passenger 57 ("Die Hard on a plane") are example of substandard entries that soon followed. What they missed is that Die Hard is a good film on its own. 
John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a New York cop transplanted to Los Angeles when his wife gets a job with the Nakatomi Corporation. When terrorists take over the building during a Christmas party, it's up to John to save the day. Alan Rickman gives an excellent performance as lead terrorist Hans Gruber but it's Willis that carries the film with his wisecracks, catchphrases, and charisma. 
Inevitably, there would be a sequel and we should consider ourselves lucky that it was Die Hard 2. Subtitled "Die Harder," it was actually based on an unrelated novel (58 Minutes by Walter Wager) that was then geared to fit the McClane character. 
Again, it's Christmas, and again Mrs. McClane is in danger. Her plane is flying over Washington, D.C., and is quickly running out of fuel. But more terrorists are attempting to fly in a drug lord and will have no planes landing until he arrives safely. 
Die Hard 2, although a lesser film than its predecessor, more than makes up for it in the fun factor. Self-referential remarks ("How can [this] happen to the same guy twice?") and a total lack of any coherent logic along with terrific effects (and a stunning high perspective shot) come together to make one of the best action sequels. 
A double feature is probably not in order, but either of these films make for fine escapist viewing. "Yippy-ki-yay, [melonfarmer]!"
