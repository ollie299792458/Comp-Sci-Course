A really unusual and interesting wartime drama with a stellar cast and unique situation. Filmed mostly on the one set, the boat, and using water tanks and rear screen projection, Hitchcock created a real challenge to himself, his cast and his crew by setting the entire film in, what else, a lifeboat drifting out at sea after a wartime maritime disaster. This is a brave film on a number of levels. One: The difficultly of shooting believable footage in a controlled environment. Two: Getting a script good enough to hold audiences interest for the length of a feature film that is set only in one place. Three: Casting actors capable of achieving an ensemble of interesting personalities that mesh so well together while being drastically different. Four: Convincing that cast to allow themselves to endure the kind of abuse that this picture needed to get the realism required. Five: Including some pretty grim and seedy elements in the script including death, betrayal and the ugly as well as the noble side of human nature. Six: Portraying the enemy. (A Nazi) as one of the characters in the film at the height of World War II. And yet, this film rises to the occasion, entertaining, thrilling, shocking and even teaching as it does. Tallulah Bankhead is luminous as the gutsy media correspondent of the day, but the rest of the cast, every last one of them, keeps right up with her and the film remains taut and flawless from the first frame to the last. You don't really know Hitchcock until you've seen Lifeboat.
