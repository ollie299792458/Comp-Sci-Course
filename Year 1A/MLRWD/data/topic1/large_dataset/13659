Ok, maybe not, but it does follow that story path.

This movie rates as an 7 on the bad movie scale, and a 4 on the good movie scale. It gets points on the good movie scale for its storytelling from a teenage girl dream perspective. You don't need to be inebriated, an insomniac, or on crack to enjoy this film. The art is of the Neil Gaiman style: detailed, darkly colored, and seemingly disjointed from its story. Tumultuous is how I'd describe the story in terms of the girl's journey about understanding her emotional health. This rating is similar to what I'd give The Craft, which may still be added to my dvd collection. It is, after all, a very good bad movie.

My interpretation of the film is that the darkness the girl experiences in her dream realm is the fear and self-loathing she feels about her mother's illness, possibly brain cancer as alluded to in the story, and how she behaved towards her mother just prior to hospitalization. The other good movie point is for the film actually ending with story resolution. Good films don't always have to have a finite ending, but resolution to the current story is always good. With no cliffhanger, it is likely that there will be no sequel. I would like to believe that I watch movies to gain something from them in exchange for the time I've spent watching it. Most of the time, I am after a well-told story.

I did find Helena's answer to her own riddle ("What's green, hangs on a wall and whistles?") to the sphinx to be quite amusing.

Helena: Riddle? Riddle. So have you thought of an answer yet?

Gryphon: You can't pass. I give up, I think, no wait, wait... Fine. What's the answer?

Helena: Okay. It's a herring.

Gryphon: But a herring isn't green.

Helena: You can paint it green.

Gryphon: But a herring doesn't hang on a wall.

Helena: You can nail it to a wall.

Gryphon: But a herring doesn't whistle.

Helena: Oh, come on. I just put that in to stop it from being too obvious.
