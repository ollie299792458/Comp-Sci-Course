My wife and I really enjoy the first Cranford film/series.  It is truly excellent in pretty much every way.  Unfortunately, this effort is not nearly on par with the first.  The script, character development, story-telling, and pacing are lacking.  I think the film is still entertaining enough to be worth watching as long as you enter with lowered expectations.  In particular the actors do their best with what they are given.  The performances of Imelda Staunton and Judi Dench are worth seeing.  Other than that, where the original used the characters to good effect, this new series almost universally wastes them.

Others have commented that the first part wasn't great.  It may not have been great, but still left the door open for a promising conclusion.  The second part is borderline not good and is the undoing of the film.

Suggested Alternative Title:

It pains me, but I can't give my suggested alternative title as it might constitute a spoiler.  Suffice it to say it's dripping with metaphorical irony.  For more, see the comments on my review.
