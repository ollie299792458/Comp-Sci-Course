"It seems our youngest, Chris was on something called acid and was firing a bow and arrow into a crowd."

"No, Ron's coming, its the pancake breakfast, we do it every month."

"I woke up in some japanese family's rec room and they would NOT....stop...screaming."

"Brick, are you just looking around the office and saying you love things as you see them?"

I mention these lines to most people and a smile appears.  That is what a comedy is supposed to do.  People complain about Will Ferrell dropping in and out of the Ron Burgundy accent haven't considered that is Ron Burgundy's character.  When trying to sound masculine, intellectual, intimidating the accent kicks in.  This movie is funny, funny, funny with great performances all around.  Who could have imagined a trident being used to kill another newsman who incidently was dragging a rival newsman away using a horse and a net?

I can never grow tired of this movie.  "This burrito is delicious but it is filling."
