Let me preface this by saying that I do not speak French but yet find most French comedies to be hilarious and completely engaging, or at least that become available in the U.S. Vaber continues his skillful laughter inducement with "The Closet."

SOME SPOILERS:

Pignon is an accountant at a condom factory. He learns that he is going to be fired soon and is consumed by sadness. He has lived a quiet life where seldom anyone notices him, not even his own teenage son.

In his grief he decides to end it all but is interrupted mid jump (off his balcony) by his neighbor who claims that if he jumps he will ruin his car! Let me say this alone got me hooked! I was laughing so hard that I couldn't see!

Eventually the neighbor and Pignon come up with a plan to save his job. They pretend that Pignon is gay. Being a condom factory that gets much of its business from the gay and lesbian community, his boss is unable to fire him.

The story continues with some of France's biggest stars (Depardieu, for instance)and the mixture is pure genius! If you are a fan of any French comedies (ComDads, La Cage of Aux Folles and most recently The Valet), you will love The Closet!
