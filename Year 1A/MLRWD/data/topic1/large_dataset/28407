"Ravenous" is such a surprise film. Normally, I wouldn't be interested in this sort of film--White Zombie being played in the preview, David Arquette, lots of blood and gore, but once again, this is simply  proof that mass-marketing can conquer one's desire to see a film. Luckily,  there was something that made me want to see "Ravenous". So when  I finally did watch "Ravenous" I was VERY pleased. Sure, there's  lots of blood and gore, but there are also serious dynamics that some might  even relate to the sexual politics of meat (Refer to the book by Carol  J.Adams). The music is beautiful (mostly by Damon from Blur), but sometimes  did not seem to go along with particular scenes. The acting is superb.  Those who are like me, will be happy to know that there is no White Zombie  or much David Arquette in the film. The ending is symbolically beautiful.  Not for everyone, but totally enthralling. Oh, and the ending (music and  all) struck me as oddly reminiscent of a Hal Hartley ending.
