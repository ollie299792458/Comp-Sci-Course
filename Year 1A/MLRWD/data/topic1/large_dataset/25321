This movie epitomizes the decade of Reagan and it was a great and fun ride due to movies like this with a great soundtrack. Why is this movie great? first, it is hilarious with the one-liners from Bender (Judd Nelson).Brian played by Anthony Michael Hall is a nerd in this movie, but a cool dork. Look for the scene when he responds to Bender's question why (brian) is in the physics club. Ally Sheedy playing the nutcase is funny when she dumps her dandruff on her art. Molly Ringwald is funny just being the stereotypical  stuck up "princess." Estevez is the cool-head in this movie.

Finally, the song, "Don't You Forget About Me" performed by Simple Minds fits perfectly with the movie. It plays at the beginning with the introduction of the actors and credits. However, it is effectively appropos when it's played at the end when everyone resolves their differences while Verner reads Brian's letter. The movie being filmed in a real high school in the suburbs of Illinois is effective as well.

Teenagers and kids today will realize how bad they have it with the no talent hip hop crap artists they listen to and the crappy movies they see nowadays.SInce the 80's ended, the music has been horrible. People viewing this movie will discover why the 80's had great songs and artists.

This movie is the best high school movie of all-time, but honorable mentions are Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, and St. Elmo's Fire due to all their great soundtracks.
