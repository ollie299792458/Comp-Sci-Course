Felicity was the first show I ever watched when I was actually the same age as the characters and although Flic and her buds can be stupid, daggy, melodramatic or even absurd at times, this show exhibits the finer points of that most finicky creature: the university student!!
I and so many of my friends could identify with her ups and downs, cringed at her over emotional moments, swooned over Ben and Noel's boyish good looks and roared with laughter at Javier (Flic's boss) and room-mates Elena and Megan.
The audio commentaries by the creators offer a great insight into how hard it was to make a show like Felicity on a shoestring and give a rare insight into the actors themselves. Reeves and Abrams' comments also show their real affection for the characters and the fact that the show reflects many of their own experiences.
This one's a gem, at last, I have found a show I can identify with on so many levels that does not patronise my intellect. All those who bag out Felicity are simply spoil-sports - everyone can find a moment or a character they can identify with, and that's such a feat.
Hooray for Felicity!! Bring on the release of the rest of the series!!
