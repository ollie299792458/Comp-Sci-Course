I'm not a dancer, I'm never one of the first ones to "catch on" in an aerobics class, but I really didn't find this all that difficult-I thought it was fun, and once I got the hang of it and could really put some energy into it (I'd say, by the third or fourth time) it felt like a great workout. I break a sweat and can feel my heart pumping a lot of the time, and I'm active and in pretty decent shape for mid-thirties. There are a few lulls but I think they are well timed and helpful for grabbing a sip of water and letting your heartrate come down a bit.

The instructor is a bit perky but no more annoying than most IMO. As far as the other people, that's not something I generally care one way or another about, but I thought it was kind of nice to see that they weren't all 95 pounds with washboard abs-they looked like real people and didn't make me feel like a lazy, clumsy, slug just by looking at them! I thought the dance moves were fun, haven't been to a dance club in awhile so I don't know if the steps are passe, but my goal was to get a workout, not learn how to dazzle a bunch of twenty-one year olds on the dance floor.  I agree with another reviewer that some of the moves are a bit hard on the knees, but like most aerobic workouts you can self-modify them a bit to avoid injury.

I would hate a lot more instruction, because I like the fast pace of the video and would get bored having to go over and over the same thing every time I used it. Now that I've got the hang of the moves, the forty five minutes really go by fast, which is what I like best about it.
