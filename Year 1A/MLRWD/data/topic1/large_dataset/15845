I have heard of Cirque DS years ago .. who hasn't unless you live under a rock .. and I finally bought 2 DVDs to watch.  Varekai and Quidam.  I have watched both and Varekai is hands down so much better than Quidam.  I have not seen many CDS shows (actually nothing .. I am dying now to see all the ones in Vegas .. O, KA, etc. These two look incredible) so I can't really make a definite statement that Verakai is the best .. but I can say it is out of the three I have seen.  I have also seen La Nouba (my mother in law bought it when she was at Disney World) and OMG, it was HORRIBLE!  It was so plain and boring and all the tricks were so mediocre. The only think I thought was cool in La Nouba was the trampoline part but back to Verakai .. The costumes were beautiful!  The show actually had a plot and the story flows and makes sense.  The other two were all over the place.  I actually LOVED the clowns.  The guys had me in tears.  I thought it was very creative.  I have seen other clowns in La Nouba and Quidam and they were again, horrible.  This guy in Verakai was hilarious.  I liked the girl too.  I thought overall the show was so much fun !!  I actually loved the juggling guy!  He had me mesmerized .. especially with the sombera hats.  LOL !  If you're thinking about buying this DVD,  DO IT!  It is excellent !!!
