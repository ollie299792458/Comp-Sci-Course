Why? I mean come on! Plot holes? Watch ressurection if you want plot holes!! But really, i think this movie is preatty good and it has my favorite "style" of all of them, but why do people hate it so much? It is a litlle disappointing for a sequal after "Aliens" (THe best in the series) but no sequal can top aliens! It also does get unique, with the alien being a runner (the facehugger facehugs a dog, in turn the alien is more orange-ish and uses all fours more) AND most of the inmates suffering from XYY chromosomes (most males have XY ONLY chromosomes) making them more brutal, stronger, and increased horemones and such. You know, people say it has no character development and such, but david finchers ORIGINAL VERSION was 2hrs and 50 minutes! MAybe more character developments in there! 
Also the part of the "plot hole" of the beginning with how the facehugger gets on board, i know the REAL explanation (They actually filmed it!) It NOT two eggs or two facehuggers like they say, it's actually a "super facehugger" which the queen carries (probably)onto the sulaco on ALiens. It lays a queen egg and then a "protecter" (wich has direct telepathic link to the unborn queen). THe super facehugger facehugs riply and the dog. Now they didn't film the explenation (i don't think) but they milmed a seen where on of the prisoners finds the superfacehugger and thinks it's a jellyfish (I've seen it!. It's a little bigger than a normal facehugger and has webbing between the ?fingers?" SO there
just wanted to explain that once and for all.
