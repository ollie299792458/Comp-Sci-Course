I'm of three minds on the subject of the greatest love story. It's either this remarkable film in which Rick (Bogart) sends Ilsa (Bergman) off for the greater cause, Gone With The Wind in which Scarlett O'Hara doesn't realize she loves Rhett until its too late, or Titanic in which Rose DeWitt Bukator carries the memory of Jack Dawson in her heart throughout a titanic lifetime. It's tough... so, I don't think I'll even try.

I will say that Casablanca means so much to so many people, to even write a review, I feel like I'm walking on pins and needles. The dialogue is still some of the best written ever. You've got the most timeless lines; "Here's lookin' at you, kid" or "Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she walks into mine" or "We'll always have Paris". But, visually, it's not quite as inspired, stunning or meaningful as its big-budget counterparts. Is that a good or a bad thing? Tough to say.

I think the three films outdo one another in certain areas. Where Casablanca fails in terms of its visuals, Gone With The Wind and Titanic succeed with flying colors. No pun intended. Where Gone With The Wind may get tiresome after the first three hours, Casablanca and Titanic succeed so much better in terms of pace. Where Titanic fails with dialogue is where Casablanca and Gone With The Wind succeed gloriously. It's a beautiful triangle of great romance, great action, and great drama if you ask me.

After so many years, Casablanca still looks great. Die-hard fans should love all of the new extras in this set.

For being one of the three legs in a tripod of love set against apocolyptic backdrops in which the lovers are tested, forced to separate, and ultimately give their audiences a greater view of the world... (let me catch my breath)... Casablanca may be the one leg that supports the other two best.
