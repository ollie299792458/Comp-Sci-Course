First of all, I am only 15 years of age, and when I saw this movie shown on television, I swear I sat there the entire time it aired and did not get up once; right from the start, the music kept me and the dog fight  sequences were so thrilling and daring....I was just hypnotized! Tom Cruise  just looks so cool in that F-14! The supporting cast provided comic relief,  and the action was such a delight that sometimes I'd forget what the entire  plot was about. Omigosh! I'd have to tell you that during all the dog  fighting sequences, I was so into the movie that whenever the jet would  make a tight turn, I would just throw my body into that position also! Tom  Cruise...whoah! He wasn't just ONLY a pretty face, he had that sense of  arrogance in him that made him play the role of 'maverick' well. I loved  everything about this movie, from the perfect music weaved into it, to the  'macho' kind of thing, puppy romance, and probably the most touching thing  was towards "Goose's" death. It tought us that life is quite  short, hang on to it, but in the end, you'd have to let go at one point or  another. This is one of those movies you really enjoy, but don't find often  because of it's fast paced action and speed. It's also MY love for speed  and excitment that makes me enjoy this movie so much. With Cruise in it,  gosh! He's the best!
