I actually wanted to give this movie 4 1/2 stars. Liu Chia Liang aka Lau Kar Leung, actually plays two different roles in the movie.  Guess they figured no one would notice...or care.  Now that that's out of the way, let me get to the good stuff.

  This movie is one of Shaw Brothers' best.  It's one of Lau Kar Leung's best.  It's one of Gordon Liu's best.  Are you noticing a theme?  In truth, it's not THE best.  But the action in this movie is superb.  The plot is good as well. Not as campy as most of these movies tend to be.  Watching Fu Sheng was kind of surreal after realizing that this was his last role.  But he was excellent and it's easy to see that he was on the verge of being a major star in Hong Kong.

  I also gained a new appreciation of Lau.  As a director, but even more so as a fight instructor and choreographer.  Kara Hui shows off some excellent work with the sword as well as the Kwon Do.  For someone who didnt study martial arts she really shows an incredible level of athleticism.

  Overall this movie will not disappoint.  If you love martial arts movies, then this is a must have.  A classic!!
