This movie is essentially me and my friends growing up in the early 70s. Just like the Bad News Bears, while baseball is center which both stories evolve around, it's about more than that. It's about growing up, innocence of youth, and summer's spent when the only concerns about the future is when school starts again. Like the main cast members, every day we waited for who would start the chain of calls to wake everyone up to play ball at the nearby grade school lot. And with some variations, we spent the time not playing ball doing the same exact things these guys do. This movie is about love of baseball, and why so many cling to it: in addition to the love of the sport, it's the memories the sport evokes for many who played it. Until current times when organized leagues are everywhere and year round training facilities abound, the main memories baseball centered around was our summer vacations, our last years of innocence with no worries or obligations that adulthood would soon bring, whether we liked it or not. Which is kind of the synopsis that "Smalls," the movies main character, makes at the movies end as an adult. How things changed as time move on, but how "that" summer will always be the best. Any 40something or older can fully relate to that sentiment. Which is why I think the viewers' age proportion is widely spread. A fabulous movie to watch w/ younger kids, as it has some great, subtle common sensities sprinkled throughout the movie.
