I finally got a copy of this universally reputed movie, after many of its characters and themes already enticed my curiosity through the years, and, basically, as I wished not to miss such a milestone in Peter Seller's career (being a staunch fan of him as inspector Clouseau). Well, I have been pleased and over-pleased by every minute of the movie, and found Seller's acting over the top. The sadistic smile of Strangelove while describing mass-destruction or the "unfortunate" case of a women/men 10-to-1 ratio in the post-atomic scenario were pure delight. But Sellers is not the only star shining in the movie. Praise be also to Kubrick's hilarious plethora of funny (but meaningful) names, from U.S. generals Jack D. Ripper to Turgidson, to the soviet ambassador De Sadesky and premier Kissoff...
And what more smartly funny than the mocking of the then well-known Cold War vocabulary, as the "peace race" or the "mineshaft gap"? Obviously, that's not a movie to be easily understood (and thus enjoyed) without some knowledge of contemporary history, politics and even military doctrine (the automatically-triggered apocalyptic reaction was less theatrical than one could think nowadays, in contemporary military conceptions, and the pre-emptive strike funnily described through Turgidson's delirious suggestion was about to be launched in at least two occasion in real history), but given the high level of Kubrick's productions this is just the masterpiece one could expect from such a director.
