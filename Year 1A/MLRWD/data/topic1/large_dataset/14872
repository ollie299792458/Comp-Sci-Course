...but I don't think he has a single line. I don't even know the name of his character, but he was right in the middle of this struggle between two brothers running this Italian restaurant.  Primo the expert Chef who refuses to compromise his art, and Secondo the businessman.  Secondo seems to be in charge here, yet he respects his brother's opinion, as demonstrated when he decides to keep risotto on the menu although it is not a favorite with the customers.  Pascal, the competitor across the street, gives the customer simple dishes that they demand on the Jersey shore. The brother's Paradise restaurant is doomed to failure.

Ultimately this was a movie about the value of family, art and perserverance.  The movie began at a slow pace as we learned about the struggle, but the pace and humor picked up as the Big Night approached.

Little things make this movie great. I like how Secondo nudges Primo to make a connection with a woman that he clearly likes.  As Secondo test drives a Cadillac, he asks if the car is "this year's model" without actually saying the year, leaving car buffs estimating that it had to be late fifties.

Isabella Rosellini is beautiful and Minnie Driver is the proverbial girl next door. Secondo looks impeccable in his suits and Pascal's excitement is catching as well as funny.

Subtlety runs throughout this movie, except for the scene where the brothers wrestle in the sand, exchanging dialogue in Italian (subtitled) the entire time.  It isn't long after this though, that the movie wraps up with a powerful piece of film with no dialogue at all that says it all: this family is strong enough to endure this trial.
