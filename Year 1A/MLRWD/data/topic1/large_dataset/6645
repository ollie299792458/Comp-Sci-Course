For anyone who owns the MPI transfer of this film on VHS and is wondering if the Criterion DVD is worth your while (did you ever doubt it?) -- it most definitely is!
I am stunned by what Criterion have done with my favorite film! The uncropped format is only the beginning -- artifacts from obviously decaying source material have been cleaned up and the whole thing takes on a brilliant, sharp look. The technical quality is so good one begins to forget it wasn't filmed yesterday. The sound is clearer and more audible and the subtitles are now of course legible.
I couldn't be happier. It's brilliant. It makes the film that much more immersive and enjoyable. Get the DVD now, you won't regret it.
(As a side note: I have also recently had occasion to see the "other" single-disc, non-Criterion DVD transfer of 8 1/2. There is absolutely no comparison; the Criterion DVD is spectacular, while the "other" DVD release is hard better than VHS, if it is at all! Do yourself a favor and shell out the few extra dollars for the Criterion DVD!)
