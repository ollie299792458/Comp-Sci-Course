The only thing that saddens me about this movie, aside from the heartbreaking climax of a brutal attack that you must simply see to savor, along with the fact that this priceless artifact never made it to the "Big Screen" was poor advertising.

If this movie had been properly advertised, I would have been PERFECT for it's time, making movies like "Making Love," "Parting Glances", and "'Broke Back Mountain"

Harvey Fierstein wrote, directed, and produced this Broadway adaption of his fine work from the stage, and brought to the big screen, SEAMLESSLY, although Harvey of course, in his adorable self-deprecating humour, denies it all, making his quiet private demeanor a stark contrast to his "Diva" like status as a performer.

It's just no use to even try to explain this movie, for I personally, PERSONALLY believe one must be a young gay male in this country to have been raised from the 50's to the early 70's, when homosexuality was a "sickness" that must be cured.

Shudder...

Don't EVEN get me started on that subject.

Later, I may go and edit this review, as I have many times, but alas, I have other things to do in my nonstop, hectic life. Dog to walk, couch pillows to rotate...you know how it is.
