Two different movies came to mind as I was watching this film - The Crying Game and Velvet Goldmine...both of which I loved, for completely different reasons.  Overall, I think Breakfast on Pluto captured the essence of what it was trying to accomplish - expose the fragility and equal toughness of the main character, Kitten.  Cillian Murphy is quite the chameleon when it comes to acting and I look forward to his future work.

Positives:

* You really feel for Kitten and want him/her to succeed in finding happiness, whether that's finally locating his/her mother or finding love.

* A great supporting cast.

* The music is fun (although the music in Velvet Goldmine is much better).

Now a couple of negatives:

* I thought he sounded like Mrs. Doubtfire and at times I had a hard time getting past that, although you do get used to it as the movie develops.

* There were too many storylines, which left some questions unanswered.  Now I realize that was to show the development of the character and how s/he came to be where s/he is today, but I still felt a sense of incompleteness.

Overall, I liked this movie - I think I'll watch it again.
