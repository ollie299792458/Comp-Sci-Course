The security guard is creepy. Angela screams. For a movie about a woman running around in her underwear, this is a strangely inert deal. The main problem seems to be that the filmmakers relied on a pretty standard stalker script and forgot to populate it with interesting characters. The woman is cute. The security guard has some fun with Elvis impressions and Santa Claus costumes. But there's just a lot of scream. Scream. Run. Fight. Get beat up. Run. Fight. Repeat.

It doesn't help that the stalker is more interesting. Don't know if he's the better actor but he does get the most to do. For these thrillers to work, you have to side with the victim and want her to get away. When the victim is a cypher and the stalker is more interesting, you really have no one to side with. By the halfway mark, I was starting to want the stalker to get his heart's desire whatever that might be - doesn't really go into the psychology of stalking or obsession - he's just crazy in movie script crazy speak.

Essentially this is a play that's been adapted for the big screen. Sometimes that works like with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKG9">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> but most of the time it just falls flat - like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T3R">The Big Kahuna</a>. Even the strongest actors can't get over a weak script with limp direction and these aren't the best actors in the world (although I will withhold judgment until I see either of them in other movies).
