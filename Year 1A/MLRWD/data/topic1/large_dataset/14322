"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry relies so heavily on gay stereotypes, that at times it feels like audiences are laughing at us, not with us." I can't think of a quote more fitting for this film than that one. This Adam Sandler comedy is inane, childish and so often ridiculous that I can't even begin to see why GLAAD gave it its stamp of approval. The premise revolves around two straight firefighters who pose as gay men and along the way learn about tolerance, but this lesson doesn't occur until the end, so really, will an audience or anyone learn anything from this comedy after watching an hour and a half of gay stereotypes with everything from a limp wrist, to a lisp to the overly flamboyant son of the male protagonist, gay slurs, homophobic characters who shudder at the thought of watching these two men kiss, and who fear of an over-done joke of 'dropping the soap' in the shower room? I doubt it. Take this for example, upon me seeing this title in theaters, the audience laughed wildly when Sandler questions "What, you mean fags?" but began to muster sounds of disgust when at the end two men share a quick kiss at their wedding in the film. Skip this film, and instead opt for Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore to get your Adam Sandler fix, or better yet, Milk if you're looking for an intelligent film centered around the gay community.
