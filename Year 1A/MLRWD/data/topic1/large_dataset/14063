(Contains Spoilers).......Just finished watching this movie and I spent 15 minutes trying to think of 3 movies that are worse than this one. The preview of this movie would lead you to believe that you are in for some sort of Aliens type scifi thriller. Instead you get what can only be described as a character development film (as it really isn't scifi, and it really isn't a thriller) with entirely unexplained character changes. Both Adrian Brody's and Sarah Polley's characters take turns wanting to save or wanting to kill the creature they created. Then suddenly with little to no underlying reason Adrian Brody's character engages in one of the most pathetic, gratuitous, sex scenes ever filmed. After seeing that I think that his Oscar should be taken back by the academy. But the film makers don't stop there, no sir, from that point in the movie the creature dies (this happens every time it is about to mutate, you would think the molecular biologists would catch on to this) then changes from female to male and grotesquely rapes Sarah Polly's character. To top it all off the end scene shows Sarah Polly's character pregnant and signing a contract with the research company. Absolutely horrible. Imagine the story of Frankenstein, then imagine Doctor Frankenstein having sex with the monster, then the monster changes gender and rapes Dr. Frankensteins's assistant. It makes you wonder how this stuff gets green lit. Maybe I am all wrong and this was supposed to be a comedy?

Bottom line, NOT SCARY, NOT SUSPENSEFUL, POORLY WRITTEN, POORLY ACTED, if you are tempted to see this spare yourself the agony.
