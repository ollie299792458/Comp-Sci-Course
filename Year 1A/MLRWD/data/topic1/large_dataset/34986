It is no surprise that "Baseball" is so well put together.  Ken Burns has repeatedly shown he is a talented documentarian, and the same quality evident in "Jazz" and "The War" can be seen here. Unfortunately, the series is more than a decade old now, and some of the topics covered are out of date.  The narrator will often intone something about Boston never again winning a World Series, Or Maris' homerun record looking unbreakable, or Gehrig's consecutive games streak being unrivaled, and though this discrepancy is understandable, it sometimes makes the film seem silly.  The series is also pretty centered on New York, and more than two-thirds of it deals with baseball prior to 1950 so it may not be for everyone.

Pros:

Excellent production value
Well organized and entertaining
Features some of the best baseball interviews you will find anywhere

Cons:

Sometimes seems out of date
Packaging is not particularly attractive (particularly the PBS gold around the top)
Deals primarily with pre 1950's baseball, which means a lot about new york and Boston and Chicago and little about the rest of the country.
