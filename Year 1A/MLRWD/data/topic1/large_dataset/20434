The first thing I'd like to do is just clear up a few things that negative reviews have been hooked on and maybe shed a bit of clarity on what is being shown in the movie.

-Origins : It comes from a manga written by Osamu Tezuka, the founder of anime, and is loosely based on that. It borrows themes from the black and white movie "Metropolis" as well but when you watch it, its best just to let the movie unfold itself instead of you forcing it to fit any particular mold.
-The animation : There are a lot of different animation choices moving around here. you have the deco-style buildings which jut across the skyline of metropolis, the astro-boy style human beings with large eyes and exagerated features (eyes, arms, noses), and then the cyberpunk innards of the city, as well as the much more "real" and dirty areas beneath the city.  the humans are MEANT to stand out against the deco, everything isn't supposed to fit neatly together in a single style.  in the movie this is shown in the plot; the elite humans (duke red, the president, etc), common people, the robots, and the city all are at odds with each other. Its not supposed to be hyper-realistic, the styles chosen are deliberate and invoke specific contrasts.
-Plot : At times things trip and fall, but I think part of the incongruity is on purpose. The chaos and sort of non-sequiter plot lines are actually just intended to encase the story of 1)humanity's fear of the 'other' 2)Tima and Kenichi. Except for Tima, the other characters just kind of putter out (aside from Luke, or Rock in the U.S. version) but her story was fantastically strong when placed within the struggle of humanity (with its own inner turmoil) and the servants they created.

In conclusion, this movie is just saturated in AMAZING visuals and great jazzy music (I couldn't think of a more appropriate use of "I cant stop loving you" by Ray Charles at the end), and it contains a story of a search for a 'self' within the fantastical world of Metropolis. Characters broaden and shrink the scope of where they place themselves here, yet everyone lands in own unique niche. But for the staleness of character development/bogged plot I drop half a star.

4.5/5 - A must see, for movie fans with open eyes.
