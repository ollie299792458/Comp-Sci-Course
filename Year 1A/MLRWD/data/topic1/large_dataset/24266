Aside from the great acting and brilliant concept, I didn't find too much to be WOWed about -- generally because it's an old movie and no matter how classical an old movie is, it's a bit blah for me, although I appreciate cult-classics which is why I gave this 5 stars. Peter O' Toole is a fascinatingly sadistic and yet intellectual director in the movie known as Eli Cross. Steve Railsback plays Cameron, a Vietnam veteran who is running away from the cops when he runs right onto a movie set and ends up avoiding a near-roadkill from one of the stuntmen. The stunt man ends up dying and Eli wants Steve to be his replacement, that way, it's also a solution for Eli to disguise himself from the cops. From there on, you see Cameron involved in a lot of stunts and movie shoots and the combination of action and comedy picks up. It gets quite interesting but the real power of the movie comes from Peter O' Toole's great performance, without him, I really don't know how good the movie would be regardless of how good the screenplay is. This movie was released the same year as Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" and I'm not even sure if they can make another movie like it today. You should watch this movie at least once because it shows the complication of whether or not we're in reality or fantasy, whether or not things are real or fake and whether or not you're running away from the cops or being filmed. P.S -- No one on earth (I don't care who you are) should be called "God." There's only one GOD and he's the man upstairs. Au Revoir!
