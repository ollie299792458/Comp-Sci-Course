"X2: X-men United" is the movie that SHOULD have been put out instead of 2000s X-men.
THE STORY:
In this sequel, the mutants are faced with an even greater threat.  Following a Presidential assassination attempt by a mutant, the community at large, already full of anti-mutant sentiment, begins to call for even greater sanctions against mutant-kind.  The X-men are soon forced to join forces with the mutant terrorist Magneto to stop a hate-Mongers insidious plot and to simply ensure the continuation of the mutant race.
THE COOL STUFFS:
Going far beyond the first movie, even more mutants from the comics make appearances in this movie including Beast, Siryn, Colossus, Shadowcat, etc.  The action sequences in this film are MUCH improved from the first one. Making their "major" debuts in this film are Iceman, Pyro, Nightcrawler and Deathstrike.
One of the great improvements in this movie is the simple fact that Wolverine is allowed more free reign in this film to simply kick butt.  One of my pet peeves with the first film was the amount of "pulling of punches" they did with the violence level.  That is not an issue with this film. Wolverine was allowed to go into "berserker" mode and cut the bad guys up in this film.
For comic purists some developments in this film include a further look into Wolverine's Weapon X background as well as Jean Grey's Phoenix powers.
PET PEEVES:
I still take SOME issue with the movie's disregard for the comic's original continuity and storylines.  Iceman and Rogue as well as Pyro are presented as classmates at Xavier's.  Oh well,  the improved action makes up for some of this.
Best Scenes:
1. Nightcrawler versus the Secret Service
2. Wolverine and Colossus defending the school
3. Pyro takes out the cops
4. Professor X uses Cerebro
5. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike
THE VERDICT:
Waaaaay better than the first.  This is easily one of the best action films of 2003.  Can't wait for the third movie.
Highly Recommended
