"Pleasantville" is the greatest movie of our generation, a movie that slaps the collectivistic liberal left in the face, and laughs at the attempts of the conservative right to dictate our actions. It is movie about individualism and the beauty of life for life's sake. Only after the characters truely understand what it means to be free were they able to turn color (notice how Reese Witherspoon's charcter, who takes her 1990's afforded freedoms for granted, takes the longest to turn color). The freedom the writers understand is not only political freedom (capitalism), but more importantly, it is a personal liberation from the perceptions of others.
This is not another tired movie preaching the liberal mantra of "tolerance." Rather, this movie flies in the face of "tolerance" and begins to expose racism for what it is; another form of collectivism. Rather then preach tolerance of groups (another form of collectivism), Pleasantville tells us that real freedom is rooted in the individual. True freedom is the ability to act completely for one's own sake, and not to succumb to evil of selflessness (altrusim).
Pleasantville is my favorite movie precisely because it does not apologize for individualism.
