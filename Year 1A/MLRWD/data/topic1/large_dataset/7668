Every American should see this film.  They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.  
I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain "toughness."  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.
As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.  
If you are interested get Howard Fast's "The Unvanguished."  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .  
The acting is good to very good.  The script is very good.  The story moves along well.  The settings are realistic and well done.  This is no sacrifice. It is real entertainment.  But it could inspire you to a little sacrifice for your country should the need arises.
