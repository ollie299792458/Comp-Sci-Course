Well folks, I'll tell you, one of the most ingenious action films to date, following up on the success of Annie: The Musical, Betsy Hutton gives the world her final masterpiece that isn't afraid of saying "movies are awesome". Some critics are critising the move to release this movie on what is called 'VHS'. Yet this new medium is being praised by technology buffs as being the "standard of the new millenium". And seeing that this movie is being released on the 50th anniversary of the first Major Motion Picture, I say kudos the Lucas for blazing a new trail in Movietekniks. Correographed by the same man who gave May_Tricks it's punch, the action in this film is non-stop. What may have been seen as risky choices for other directors, seems natural for Hudgson, but Hey, You know what I always say "I like my movies, like I like my coffee... with lots of women in them." and let me tell you folks. This movie does not dissapoint. There are plenty of guns in this one, and Annie's got one. When Annie says to Mr. Starbucks "play it again, Sam" and those credits rolled.. she walked off the screen and took a piece of my heart (god bless those surgeons who saved my life, Hutton you'll be hearing from my lawyers). It's a hard knock life indeed. The sun will definately come out tomorrow, as long as I have this little gem in my movie collection for a long time.
