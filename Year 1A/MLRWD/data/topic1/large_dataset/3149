It's definitely Gregory Nava's best work!!!!  It's FAR better than "Mi Familia" or "Selena" (I kind of hated "Selena").  Best of all, it looks AMAZING in Blu-Ray!!!!!

I agree with the people who say that this movie is timeless!  It's still as relevant today as it was in 1983, which was when this film was made.  It reminds us that not much has changed since the 1980's in terms of attitudes towards immigrants and the hardships they have to go through.  Sure, some things have changed and border technologies are now different, but the core message of the movie is still as relevant today as it was in the 80's, and as relevant since the existence of racism in this country.

The BLU-RAY version, besides making the film look crisp and better than ever, also has some interesting BONUS FEATURES.  It has interviews with the original main actors (we get to see what they look like today), and they talk about their experience making this film.  It also includes an interview with Gregory Nava and the producer of this film.  It's amazing to see how much they accomplished with not a lot of money and many obstacles. There's an option to watch it with the DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS throughout the movie too!  And of course, optional English subtitles are available which were remade for this Blu-Ray release, since the original subtitles tended to blend with the scenery in the original release (they have been fixed with this Blu-Ray release).

I also have shown this film to the children in my family (sister, niece and nephew, etc.) so that they can be aware of what undocumented immigrants have to go through in this country.  I definitely recommend that other young people watch it so that they can expand their awareness too.
