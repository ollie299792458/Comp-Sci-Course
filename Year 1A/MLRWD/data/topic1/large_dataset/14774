Britney Once Again wowed fans and  stund critics with her sold out "Dream Within A Dream" Tour.I can some it up with one word Incredible! "Britney Spears Live From LasVegas" that was broadcast live on HBO wase truly Britneys bigest show yet.Songs Included a up beat remix to "Oops I Did It Again" and a very cool remix of You drive me crazy" inthen "overprotected".This preformance wase very cool, I might add, with cool green and gold lazer lights and a cool video playing in the back ground I thought nicely done. Songs also included "Boys" "I Love Rock and Role" "Im A Slave 4 You" and a killer encore prefromance a cool cool remix of "Hit Me Baby One More Time". Songs in all 15# if you are a Britney Spears fan  youl love love love this dvd. you might be a little disapointed like I wase even though her dancing kicks but! and her preformances are explosive! but she is lipsincing and its quit notecible and there are no special features but nevertheless she makes up for it. I love it beause every song is like a brodway show  they all got there owen story line and all have to do with dreams.Fore those of you who arent fans will love it to! IF YOU LOVE DANCING AND BRODWAY SHOWS YOU WILL LOVE BRITNEY SPEARS LIVE FROM LASEVEGAS!
