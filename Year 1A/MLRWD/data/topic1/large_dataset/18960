Just finished watching this last night. I have to suspect that Eric hadn't discovered girls yet, in order to play that brilliantly!! In other words, he must have spent a lot of time, especially in the mind-boggling "speed" department!
  Of course I'm joking about the "girls" bit, I say that about all truly great musicians.
  I can't really make any critisisms about this concert, however, it would have been nice to have say, a rhythm guitar, Hammond keys, or a Rhodes behind him, but still, it's great!
  Finally, after watching the concert, I read the liner notes, and was delighted to see that he mentioned Jeff Beck,(my favorite guitarist, who even influenced Jimi to a certain extent- don't believe me?, then do your research!!), as one of his three major influences, which includes Jimi, of course. Jeff doesn't have that unbelievable speed picking, (up and down the neck), he doesn't use a pick for starters, but he's one of those people who only fully displays his remarkable brilliance "in concert", and does so intentionally.
  But this review is about Eric, (who's probably somewhat of a friend of Jeff's anyway), and Eric is so incredible throughout, that he even manages to imitate Jimi Hendrix's "reverse, backwards-taped recorded" guitar from "Are You Experienced", without any "backwards" effects, no less!! You'll not be dissappointed!
