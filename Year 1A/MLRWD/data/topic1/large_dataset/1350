If there's one thing I look forward to in the mail, it's an Argento movie. I loved some of his other films and couldn't wait to grab this movie. In the end, the overall plot is wonderful, though poorly executed. All the characters' personalities seem a bit off, one way or another. Too stiff, too strange, etc. And then there are MANY loose ends that keep the viewer hoping they will be answered at the end, but they aren't (for example, the anniversary necklace/bracelet, what is its meaning?).

The actual plot itself, though, is superb. The twists and especially the final revelation of the killer himself are excellent, especially the manner in which they reveal him. The murders, or even the attacks (there are some where the people don't actually die), are just amazing and intense. I honestly wonder if I've seen such brutal murders anywhere else before.

I still like this movie and recommend it if you are a horror or Argento fan for at least the plot and murders, but the acting and characters may get you a tiny bit.

Also recommended: Suspiria, Deep Red, any other good slasher movie
