I've only seen this movie quite recently after hearing about it for years and being told that it's a must see.  While actually viewing the movie my opinions were mixed but afterwards everything slid into focus.  On the technical side of the movie the directing and editing were nothing new or original, Mario Van Peebles played everything straight out of a textbook and the pacing didn't create any great flow.  Most of the acting was far from award winning but not so bad as to distract from the movie itself, for any real length of time at least.  Everything about the quality and look of the film screams early 90's, but in an endearing manner.  As far as the films influences go, the 1983 version of "Scarface" is the most acknowledged and the one film that this movie will probably be compared to for the rest of its rememberance.  However I began to notice something very quickly at the heart of the movie and with the blurb about drugs and drug dealers in America at the end, it became clear that the 1932 "Scarface: Shame of the Nation" had just as large of a part in the shaping of this movie, it serves basically as a PSA to America.  This also may account for why everything technically seemed very plain and stereotypical (mind you with very high production value).  Take these two movies, throw in a dash of "Cops", a very pop show at the time, add in a lot of the earliest mainstream MC's and you have New Jack City.  A movie that still holds appeal after more than 15 years and an eclectic piece of 90's cinema that makes a decent viewing.
