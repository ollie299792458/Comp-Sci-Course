This film, which centers around the first year in a class of contract law at Harvard, is one of the very few I know which makes you want to study, whatever subject it is that you are studying, and to be like the main character, James Hart, played superbly by Timothy Bottoms. The suspense in The Paper Chase is whether or not he and the members of his group of study will manage to pass under the overpowering rule of professor Charles Kingsfield, which is a truly unforgettable character and made the actor John Houseman win an Oscar for Best Supporting Role. Believe me, you have to see him to believe him, there are no accurate descriptions adequate enough to tell you how good he is. I also very much like the fact that being this a film about the study of law, it doesn't deal with criminal law, which any one might have think was the more interesting subject of that career. Instead, it deals with Contract Law, which I, before seeing this picture, would have thought was a very boring subject. This shows that you can make something good out of any subject. Credit for that the director James Bridges (The China Sindrome, Urban Cowboy), and the intelligent script by John Jay Osborne and James Bridges.
