Yaaaay a DS movie that makes sense! I don't know why this movie gets soo much criticism, seeing as it was VERY CREEPY and it actually made sense, not like HODS! If you haven't seen the series, it [HODS] makes noooo sense whatsoever! But this movie [NODS] actually makes sense....and in a twisted, creepy DS-type way, too!! The one-of-a-kind way that only Dan Curtis could dream up ;) The actors and actresses are just *wonderful*, Quentin's [David Selby] performance was VERY memorable, he does a great job going on and off being possessed by Angelique. Kate Jackson is wonderful, of course! I loved her so much as Daphne, and now she's Tracey...but as long as her and Quentin are together. That's the only thing I didn't like about this movie; her and Quentin didn't end up together :( The ending scene made my friend and I scream, it freaked us out so much!! The ending addendum is very chilling, and the music that plays while it scrolls will give you goosebumps! Now WHERE is that lost footage??? I'm dyyying to see it!! It helps explain a lot about Gerard and has some really cute scenes between Tracey and Clair [I've read the script]. WHERE IS IT!?!? Anyway, this movie is soooo good and interesting and creepy! Watch it and review it!!!
