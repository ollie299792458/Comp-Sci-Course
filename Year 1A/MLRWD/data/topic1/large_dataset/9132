Fear of most was that this film would never be released on DVD.  It's such a touchy subject.... and I think many people close their eyes to stuff like this because they don't want to believe that it exsists.  Many people suffer with severe depression and this is a Prozac nation.... but so many people out there don't want to take the time to understand what these people are going through, so the comments are always made that only end up hurting the depressed person.  I've been in Lizzie's (Ricci) shoes.... more than many can imagine..... and the words said to lizzie by her friends were just what was said to me time and time again.... and they only made things worse.... they didn't understand, thats true -- but they didnt take the time to understand.... and sometimes even made it look like the understood when they really didnt.

I think that those people who are really depressed would benefit if the entire world watched this movie.  This movie gives an excellent glimpse into what depressed people deal with.  But dont let it worry you... the film is entertaining... it's enjoyable to watch but it will get to you at the same time... Ricci is certainly amazing in this film.... one of the best performances by any actress ever.... she IS the character.... she is really into it..... it's phenomenal.

Buy this DVD... you need it.... and if you have a loved one in your family that deals with depression or another mental illness, you dont only need it but it's your duty to watch it....
