A wonderful treat for mystery lovers... Fantastic star cast is the icing on top of an excellent plot.  The cast led by Cate Blanchett is accompanied by Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Keanu Reeves, Greg Kinnear and Giovani Ribisi.  Rabisi, for his role as a emotionally disturbed man who finds solace in the character of Cate Blanchett, deserves at the very least an Oscar nomination.  Keanu Reeves also gives a performance worth noticing of an abusive husband to Hilary Swank.  Katie Holmes up to the mark as the promiscuous, rich young woman of the small little town in Georgia, where the movie is set.  As Holmes' fianc&eacute; Greg Kinnear plays a perfect southern gentleman with brilliant ease.  The supernatural psychic powers of Cate Blanchett's character are the connotation of the title of the movie.  The movie revolves around the disappearance and then murder of Holmes' character.  The mystery unfolds as Blanchett gets premonitions leading to the real culprit.  The film is grasping frame by frame.  It is very delicately handled as required by the scripts involving paranormal activities, this is a worth see and own movie.
