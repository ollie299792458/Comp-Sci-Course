While Ken Burns did a MUCH better job than most Television documentaries  on the Civil War, it is far from perfect.  It has a bias -- that the war  was almost entirely about slavery.  While slavery was a Key Issue, Burns  elevates it.
There are other problems.  The Myth that Robert E. Lee never  referred to the Union as "the enemy" is perpetuated.  Yet even in  one section of the documentary Lee is quoted as saying "the enemy is  there..." which begs the question.
There are numerous factual  errors.  The film states that over 100,000 Union soldiers were under the  age of 16 (it was closer to 1,000) and even gets the age of Lincoln at his  death wrong.  Nitpicking?  Perhaps, but these are easily checked  facts.
Burns also seems to have used as one of his principle guides to  the period the writer Shelby Foote.  Foote is a good writer (and looks  every bit the perfect figure on TV) but is NOT a historian.
In short,  don't use this as your only reference point.
