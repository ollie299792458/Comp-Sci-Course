Although I'm not one to write reviews of something not yet released, I couldn't help myself when it came to this particular dvd.  While not quite the shows best season, the final 22 episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer were none the less meant to become instant classics for the fans of the show.  We saw the high school rebuilt, Giles' return (on a more permanent basis), a final reunion between Buffy and Angel among other things.  Sure, we had to put up with the annoying potentials and some unresolved plot stuff, but it's Buffy!  This will probably be a bittersweet purchase for many since it heralds the end of a show that's been with us for so long, that has given us characters with whom we've grown up alongside with.  Well, better stop myself before I venture into sappy-land.  Enjoy this wonderful DVD!

The First: "Ow, mommy, this mortal wound's all itchy.  Well, you came pretty close to smacking me down.  What more do you want?"

Buffy: "I want you...to get out of my face."
