Deepa Mehta's _Water_ was one of the best films I've seen in a really long time.

Nine-year-old Chuyia barely remembers her wedding, and now her father has come to tell her that she is a widow. Her parents take her to an Ashram - a sort of rest home for widows - to live out the rest of her days. There, she meets Auntie, an aged senile old woman, married when she was seven years old, who still longs for the sweets that she had at her wedding. The leader of the ashram, an old, overweight woman and the only one of the women living there who gets full meals, rules like a tyrant and pimps out the young widows to Brahmin men on the other side of the holy river.

One young widow, Kayalyina (sp?) falls in love with a young Brahmin who has embraced the teachings of Ghandi. Tragedy strikes, however, when the differences in their caste prove impossible to overcome. Chuyia escapes the Ashram, but only after much suffering.

The acting, especially by the young girl who plays Chuyia, is incredible here, and the cinematography was astounding. I was deeply moved by this film; I don't believed that I've wept at a movie as much as I did tonight watching _Water_. This film is highly recommended; I can't wait to see the two 'prequels' - Fire and Earth.
