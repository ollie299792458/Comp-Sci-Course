When I saw the cover of this, it looked like the hottest AND funniest thing I would ever see. I mean -- hello? It's got CARMEN ELECTRA. Also Kim Kardashian, she of the world-renowned, legendary backside! Girls in bikinis standing around screaming while twin asteroids are about to fall on their heads. "Lewd, crude, rewd, newd. Celebrate end times!" I was sold! But then when when I actually saw it, I felt robbed, because in Kim Kardashian's only "nude" scene, you don't get to see that incredible butt at all, sorry (in fact you don't get to see anything). In fact, the only nudity you ever see is some GUY'S butt! I mean, who wrote this anyway? Whoever did it could've -- you know-- ruined an erotic dream, so to speak. The gags that the movie does have are really just very gross and tasteless, something like a MAD TV skit that has definitely gone on about 90 minutes too long! If you want to see a satire like this that is better made and DOES show some hot female nudity, I recommend "Not Another Teen Movie -- Unrated Version".

P.S. I gave this movie 1 star just because it has Carmen Electra in it, but in reality, this movie is so incredibly bad that it really deserves no stars at all. I don't think wild horses could drag me back to watch it again even once!
