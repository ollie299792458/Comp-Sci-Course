This movie is simply amazing.. Its hard to know how to describe the impact it had on me except to say that it is the slowest movie that I have ever seen that DID NOT BORE ME FOR A SECOND. 
The tale of a German submarine that is sunk (sort of.. that's not a spoiler), this movie has some of the most awe-inspiring portrayals of the horror of war and the struggle of man to overcome all obstacles I have ever seen.
The visuals are amazing, from the way the condensation gathers on the bulkheads to the way the characters slowly become more grimy, bag-eyed and filled with dread as the movie progresses. At each turn, this movie draws you in and makes you feel as if you are right there, trapped in the submarine with them.
There is one scene involving a U-Boat and a Destroyer which I won't spoil that really reinforces the humanity of people who are easy to write off as the 'enemy'. This movie serves as an excellent reminder that while war is a dreadful thing (albeit sometimes necessary), everyone involved is riding along on the same human condition.
One of the best movies I have ever seen. The only people who won't like this are those addicted to non-stop action (which I like too) only. For the rest of you, do not hesitate to buy this movie!!
