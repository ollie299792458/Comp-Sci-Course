I watched this movie all the way through because of Edward Norton.  Personally, I think he and Jodie Foster are the two smartest and best actors of their generation.  However, I had real problems with this movie.

I have never seen John Voight chew up the scenery as badly as he did here.  It is bound to be the directors fault.  At the Christmas dinner they had us viewing John Voight's patriarchal character as a bad drunk.  Turns out that was a non-sequitur.  In another scene, a hoodlum comes to Colin Farrell's house.  Farrell takes the guy out in the backyard and roughs the guy up.  He threatens the guy to stay away from his home and his family, but the scene ends with the hoodlum unimpressed by his rough treatment and telling Farrell's character that he has just made a bad mistake.  Based on that you would expect the film was going somewhere with this issue, but you never see this guy again.  He isn't mentioned.  He just didn't happen.

I rate it 2 stars for Norton and Farrell, but this is obviously no Guy Ritchie film.  Cut it further, to an hour and a half and there might be something there.
