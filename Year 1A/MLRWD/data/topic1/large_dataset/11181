To put it simply, this two movie dvd is an awesome combo package at a great price. The First Conan movie, Conan the Barbarian is off the hook. It has great, memorable characters, a really good story of love and vengence and ofcourse at the end, justice always prevails. As for Conan the Destroyer, i must say that it is alot better than it gets credit for in other reviews. While it is slightly toned down, the PG rating didnt hurt it much as there is still plenty of violence and blood throughout and right from the start. The story is not quite as good and more sci fish but its still a decent story and at the end of the day you just want to watch Conan destroy enemies which he does plenty of. And the end leaves it open for a sequel although one has not been made to date. Hopefully that will happen soon though. All in all, The destroyer isnt quite as good as the first one but its still pretty good. You have to keep in mind that Conan the Barbarian is so bad a** that its impossible to make a sequel better than it. Buy this DVD. You wont regret it.
