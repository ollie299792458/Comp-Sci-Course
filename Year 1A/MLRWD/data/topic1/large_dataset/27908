I won't bother to review the movies here--there's plenty of reviews for that.  Instead, I'm just going to give a quick overview of what to expect from the Blu-Ray trilogy.

First, SPIDER-MAN 3 is the same release as the double-disc Blu-Ray stand-alone version.  It has lots of special features, commentaries, an extras disc, etc.  The movie itself looks very, very good (video quality).

It's SPIDER-MAN 1&2 where the set takes a hit.  Again, video quality is excellent.  SPIDER-MAN 2 includes the "2.1" cut (via seamless branching, meaning you can watch the theatrical or the new version off the same disc) with extra scenes, including at least one that is VERY funny.

However, what you lose are ALL the extras from the SM 1&2 DVD releases.  No commentaries, no deleted scenes (other than "2.1"), no "makings-of", etc.  To me, this was more than disappointing.  It's almost criminal.  I expected many of the old items to appear in standard-def.  Only one bonus blu-ray disc would have been required to hold every single non-commentary special feature, as BD's have 50GB of space compared to 9GB for a standard DVD.  Why skimp here, Sony?

Ultimately, this is the best way to view the movies.  They look AMAZING.  The extras in this set, however, are underwhelming, to say the least.  You're getting everything you need for SM3, but the first two films are severely shortchanged.
