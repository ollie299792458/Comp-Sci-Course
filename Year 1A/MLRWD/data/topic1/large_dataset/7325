I've only one major complaint about Mike Leigh's 'Topsy Turvy'. At a bit under three hours in length, it's too short -- we don't want it to end! This is one of the best musical biographies extant -- its leisurely  development lets you see into the life of the early performers of the Savoy  Operas, and in the end, the film is as much about them as it is about  Gilbert or Sullivan. We care for these characters, for their ambitions, for  their insecurities and weaknesses. Under the perfect frivolity of the music  lies frailty and anguish, and that's the strength of this film.  The only  weak link in the casting is in the role of George Grossmith, who lacks what  must have been that character's extraordinary charisma, wit and charm.  Grossmith's modern successors, notably John Reed and Dennis Olsen, are  actor/singers who could claim the entire stage -- a stronger actor in this  role would have claimed the entire film. But that's a minor quibble about a  film so true to its subjects, so imbued with love for its characters.
