The story kind of sags and plods along at points. But it has some of the greatest classic elements of the franchise. The soundtrack is by far one of John Barry's best. It's classic Bond and fits the action like a glove. I'm surprised they didn't recycle the outer space theme in future Bond films as they with with the 007 theme (not to be confused with the signature James Bond theme). It's note perfect suspense.
One of the greatest Bond gadgets (some will argue THE greatest) appears in the form of "Little Nellie", the one man auto-gyro that arrives in large suitcases. Once assembled, Bond flies this over Blofeld's volcano lair, while taking down several well armed helicopters.
Finally, there's Ken Adam's spectacular volcano lair set. The set piece is so over the top that not only does it launch and land a spacecraft munching rocket, it has it own monorail to shuttle Blofeld's evil minions about.
So while this isn't the best Bond story, it has some of the best Bond stuff ever. It's worth the price of admission simply for it's spectacle.
