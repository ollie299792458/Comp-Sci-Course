Based on the trial of New York gangaster 'Lucky Luciano"

Combining the star power of Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart with the street smarts and bristling talents of some of Warner Bros.' best contract playes of the 1930s. Marked Woman is a fastpaced racketeering melodrama and rousing entertainment.

After mobster Johnny Vanning (Eduardo Ciannelli) takes over management of the nightclub where she works and turns it into an unsavory "clip joint," a hard-boiled B-girl (Davis) determines to turn the tables on her new boss. But even with the encouragement of a crusading assistant district attorney (Bogart), she finds she can't do it alone, and has to recruit her fellow "hostesses" (Rosalind Marquis, Lola Lane, Isabel Jewll and Mayo Methot) - all at peril to their lives.

Reuniting Davis and Bogart after their triumph in the proceding year in The Petrified Forest. Marked Woman was another Warner film ripped from contemporary head-lines, as it was based on the trial of New York gangster Lucky Luciano, who was sent to prison on the evidence of prostitutes.

This is a superb film a beautiful teaming of Davis and Boagie. Deffinate must for every Bette Davis collection.
