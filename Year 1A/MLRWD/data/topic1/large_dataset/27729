It confuses me why so many people do not understand the plot. Some people also call the plot "weak", "non-existant", or "lame".
Hmmmmmmm. Anyone who says that must only be able to understand cheap films with no plots like Tomb-Raider. And with all of those descriptions above applied to this movie, something must be desperatly wrong with america. First of all, for all the idiots out there who thought the plot was weak and non-existant, maybe I should give you a little re-cap:
In the distant future, earth has become a wasteland. Alien biengs, called "phantoms" patrol the earth. Humans cower in domed cities. Dr. Aki Ross, who is fighting the remains of a phantom inside her body, is trying to destroy them. She and her partner/mentor Dr. Sid travel the world collecting spirits, or souls for all you hyper-religous types out there.When they collect eight special spirits, they can create a wave that is the oppisite of that that the phantoms generate. This wave effectively wipes out the phantoms. Opposing them is General Hein, a hot-headed military official who wants to blast the phantoms to hell with his giant orbiting laser called the "Zeus Cannon". But the Zeus Cannon could destroy the earth. Other characters include Aki's lover, Grey, who looks disturbingly like Ben Afflec. Grey is part of a rag-tag band of soldiers called the "Deep Eyes".
Now, tell me that is not a complex plot. And if you can't, I pity you for your ignorance.
Now, besides the excellent plot, the film has the best CGI of any film previous. It is completetly CGI. Sometimes I forgot that the CGI characters were not human! All in all, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a groundbreaking film that deserves compulsery viewing.
