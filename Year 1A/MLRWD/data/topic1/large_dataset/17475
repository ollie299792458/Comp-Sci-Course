Brilliantly acted, masterfully staged along with the best possible effects for their day (1972), and well scored, this under-appreciated gem is hauntingly beautiful and terrifying, all at the same time.  Whether or not  it turns out to be prophetic remains to be seen, but a good case can be  made today that we are certainly well on our way to being in the condition  that inspired Earth's inhabitants in this movie to send out a fleet of  spaceships that carried with them the last of their forests and wildlife.  
One of the biggest and best payoffs of watching this beauty is the  absolutely stunning performance that Bruce Dern delivers.  More often than  not, Dern portrays conniving, sneaking pyschos and killers to an absolutely  chilling degree, but not in this baby! Yes, there are those who would say  that the character of Freeman Lowell does a slow descent into madness here,  but it is ever-so slowly brought about by Dern's restrained acting that we  barely notice.  That is the mark of exceptional acting ability!  This is by  far Dern's best performance, and his supporting cast of Cliff Potts, Ron  Rifkin and Jesse Vint as fellow crew members that bear varying degrees of  contempt for Dern's Freeman Lowell are perfectly cast.  Kudos to the  exceptional actors/actresses who portray the loveable drones Huey, Dewey  and Louie.
Long before Star Wars and the rest, there was Silent Running,  and it holds up extremely well, despite today's seemingly constant need for  faster, harder, bloodier and more violent by the second.  The message  contained within this movie is as applicable today as it was the first day  it was released.  Watch it and see for yourself; you won't regret it for a  second!
