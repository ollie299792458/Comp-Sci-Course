I am a movie addict ever since I saw my first movie at the age of four years. After a movie was over I would run down to the screen to ascertain how the people accomplished this feat. Since I grew up in the late 1940's and 1950's, every weekend and sometimes during the week, if I had completed all my homework completed, I would make a beeline to the Rosewood Theater in Memphis. I watched every movie released, re-released, shown on the TV Late Show, and the TV Late Late Show. The movies of today are aimed at the 15 to 24 year old male and female (equal rights, women's rights, etc.). There absolutely must be at least 15 minutes of a gratuitous sex scene. The movie "Fatal Attraction" is a classic example of sex selling. Of course the movie "Unfaithful" has more than its share of nudity and sexual intercourse, but the story line as brought to the screen, demands the revelation of the intense and devastating relationship between a typical husband and wife when the wife is unfaithful. My wife asked me after we had seen the movie were they really having sexual intercourse? I am glad that Amazon.com is a quick resource on the Internet for the unabridged DVD. Sometimes sex augments the tempo of the movie and most of the time it merely is added to the movie to get an "R" rating so that the 14 to 25 year old male/female will be enticed to view it in their "local theater."
