This was one of the best bond films of the 80s along side the living daylights. Timothy Dalton was a very good james bond. People can say what they want but much like connery was the bond of the 60s, moore for the 70s and brosnan for the 90s, dalton was the james bond of the 80s. I think the films strong points were of course dalton as bond, robert davi and benecio del toro as the bad guys as well as a solid 80s druglord storyline.Even though some might say that the stunts or action scenes weren't good I think it contains one of the best finales in a bond film with the tanker chase and also the dispatching of the villian  The main weak points of the film were the two girls were fairly average and the music score which could have been a bit more exicting. Otherwise the villians were considerably evil and bond was just as brutal in a good guy way. definitely a film you could watch more than once unlike octapussy or moonraker which has to be turned off thirty minutes into the movie. I think dalton should have played bond more than twice but not goldeneye (he was too old than) he should have done moores last two movies in which moore was 100 years old. All in all an excellent bond film and a very good film in its own right
