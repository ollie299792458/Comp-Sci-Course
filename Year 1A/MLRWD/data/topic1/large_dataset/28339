With respect for his talent, I am not a big fan of Sayles' other works -- just because I never found much to interest me in their stories and moods.  
So this movie came as a big surprise to me.
I first saw it soon after its initial theatrical release and was immediately impressed.  The quality throughout the production made a definite, positive impact on me.
But, more than appreciating the technical proficiency with which this film was made, I see this as a beautiful story told with grace and love.  
Having viewed it once more on video and a couple times more on DVD, I am amazed that this film has lost none of the magic it had for me that first time I saw it.
There is something wonderful in the simplicity shown here.  It makes clear that good story-telling can draw us in without relying on millions of dollars in special effects.  All that is required is a certainty of expressing the events and giving them the dramatic weight they deserve.
This is a movie that I want to share with everyone I know.
It is definitely one of my favorites.
