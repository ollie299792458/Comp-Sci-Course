John Denver was at his best when singing to an audience - I always felt that his studio albums didn't do him justice.  So, this DVD set reveals the full extent of his talent!  Most of his well-known songs are here, as well as some lesser-known gems that deserve this opportunity to be enjoyed by a wider audience.  There is even an unlisted surprise - John's wonderful rendition of `The Lord's Prayer' in American Indian sign-language is included in the 1984 solo concert from Lake Biwa.  This goes some way to compensate for the omission of `Boy from the Country' from this concert.

The two documentaries on the final disc show something of John's concerns for the natural world and the environment.  The 1990 Earth Day documentary reminded me a little of Al Gore's excellent film `An Inconvenient Truth', though of course it pre-dated that film by 16 years!  `Day at the Bighorn' was, I believe, the first of John's documentaries about the natural world; it would be great to follow this with `Rocky Mountain Reunion' or `Alaska: America's Child' on the next boxed set.

Heartfelt thanks are due to Barry Ehrmann, producer of this set, and his colleagues who helped to bring us this treasure.  I look forward many more DVD releases from the John Denver archives!
