Back in the mid 80's I used to catch this show every so often when it was a weekly series. Steven Spielberg was the driving force behind this episodic show and you can tell he really put his all into it. This show really reminded me of the old Rod Serling shows which I love so much. This set includes every show from the first season which aired in 1985-1986 I believe.

Some of my favorite episodes include: Mummy Daddy, The Mission, The Amazing Falsworth, The Sitter, One For the Road, and hands down my favorite of the entire season, Dorothy And Ben. Selected episodes include deleted scenes from the original show, a nice touch. If you're at all a fan of shows such as The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Night Gallery etc, but with an updated 80's Spielberg twist then you will not be disappointed with this impressive show.

The packaging is simple but effective. A nice box with a synopsis for each show printed inside. For those of you waiting for Season Two to come out on DVD in the USA, don't hold your breath. Seems that Universal cancelled the DVD a while back although it seems to have come out as an import from Germany (In the PAL standard). From what I've read it was (is?) available via Netflix but don't hold me to it since I don't subscribe to that service.
