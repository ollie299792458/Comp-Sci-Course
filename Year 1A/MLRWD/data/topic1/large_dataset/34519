"When Harry Met Sally" is my favorite movie of all time. I would estimate that I have watched it in theaters and on VHS  and DVD more than 500 times. Today I was too lazy to track down my DVD, and I purchased it to stream from Amazon Prime. I was horrified to discover that much of the soundtrack had been changed from the original release of the movie. The soundtrack, much of it sung by Harry Connick, Jr., and including many classic songs of the early-to-mid 20th century, is an integral part of the movie. Changing it significantly changes the movie. Amazon tells me that MGM would have made that change, possibly for copyright reasons. Even so, they replaced pertinent music with elevator music and it destroys the final third of the movie.  The original soundtrack in its entirety is still available from iTunes, so none of this makes any sense to me.

If you love and know this movie, you will be disappointed if you choose to stream it. If it is new to you, please be aware that this is not the real " When Harry Met Sally."

It was like getting a grocery store baloney sandwich on white bread when I was expecting pastrami on rye from Katz's deli. There is just no comparison.
