Wow I'm having trouble reviewing this just because Roger Ebert said everything already. This movie is superb and a true work of art. Without a doubt the best in the man with no name series and quite possibly the best western of all time. With outstanding performances by not only Lee Van Cleef and my personal favorite Clint Eastwood, but also an amazing performance by Eli Wallach as Tuco. The additional footage only makes this movie better by better  explaining the story and by making the joy you get from watching this movie last 18 minutes longer. This is without a doubt the finest hour for Sergio Leone, who made many other classics including the first two in the "dollar trilogy".
  Another great thing about this DVD is everything you get with it. I love the little movie posters you get and the booklet with a wonderful review written by Roger Ebert. And then we come to the special features disc. They include some great documentary's on Sergio Leone and others and about 4 or 5 easter eggs. Overall a fantastic edition of one of the best movies of all time at a wonderfull price. Also, if you have the money I recommend picking up the other two movies in this trilogy(A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More) and watching them in order but if you don't have enough money this DVD is PLENTY!!!
