I saw this movie at my school in a somewhat theatre experience, but it was worth it. I wish that I could've seen this film in the original 3-D process, because then it would've been much better. But I thought that Vincent Price gave a really great performance as the mad curator of a wax museum that was burned down by his money hungry partner that wanted the insurance money. In a very creepy few minutes, all of the wax figures melt down as Vincent Price tries to get out. Then VIncent Price opens a wax museum that a woman recognises her friend as the Joan of Arc model. She then gets to suspecting, but we already know that Price uses real dead bodies for his models.  I won't give away the ending, but I think that you  must see this movie. Price is the best villan of all because he gives in more acting than anyone else in the film. I suggest that you see this movie because it shows 50's horror at its peak. Watch this movie. It shows Vincent Price when he first got into the horror market, which was made for him
