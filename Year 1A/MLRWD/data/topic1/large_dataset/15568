Maybe a movie can be comedy, ironic satire, and musical all at once, but it's a tough balancing act to pull off.
For example, the opening song "Baltimore" should be hilarious - - the whole idea of singing in delight of a famously dull city - - but instead drags on too long and can't quite decide whether to be serious about itself. In fact, all the songs last too long. I suppose that speaks to the quality of the song writing ("is the damn thing over yet?").
Or consider the domestic scenes, exaggerated proletarian misery in wildly perky pastels. Is it supposed to be misery? Or Disney Channel comedy? or a mockery of misery? In the end it looks like they wanted to make fun of miserable conditions, while still being nice to them, but also not being too scary for the kids in the audience or offending the sponsors (god forbid the movie should have the ferocity of, ahem, a John Waters film).

Can't review the entire movie because I walked out after about 20 minutes of this idiocy.
