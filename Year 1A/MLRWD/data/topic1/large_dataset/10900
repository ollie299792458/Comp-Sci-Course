I guess the film does about as well as you can when trying to put a book on screen.  The acting didn't so much bother me as the narrating; Greene's book tells you a lot about the characters that the film's narrator (Caine) tries to relay, but it's only cursory and awkward compared to the book.

Case in point: the scene where Pyle tracks Fowler down up north by going up the river alone.  If I remember the book correctly, this scene and its build-up were quite good in terms of "internal dialogue" and description, but I didn't feel like the movie captured it and Pyle in all his grandiose, well-meaning naivete.  You just get Fowler telling Pyle he's crazy, and then Pyle gets scared by all the guns . . .

Speaking of which, I also thought Greene's book portrayed Pyle as a more naive character, more of a vehicle for myopic American idealism-cum-imperialism; whereas he seemed more scheming and aware in the film.  Not necessarily a villain, but more manipulative than idealistic.  Did anybody else get that impression?

By the way, Phuong has "no personality" in the film (as at least one reviewer puts it) because she represents Vietnam itself; both Pyle and Fowler are explicit on this point.  Phuong is a sort of passive vehicle or recipient of these foreign suitors.  She has "no personality" because this talk of love and liberalism and containment means nothing to her.  Will you be there for her?  Will you take care of her?  Will her life be livable and honorable?  That's all she cares about.  Pass the opium . . .

Overall, and like the book, I  really like that this is a Vietnam story that doesn't just frame it as "America against the world," or doesn't just focus on PTSD or something.  It's more philosophical and worldly than that.  Specifically, I like how it shows Vietnam as a colonial issue (not only or necessarily communist), and it doesn't hesitate to portray American involvement as colonial involvement.
