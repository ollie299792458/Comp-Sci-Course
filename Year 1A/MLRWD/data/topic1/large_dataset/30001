Overall notes of the new unrated cut vs the orginal DVD -

-I count 8 of the 18 deleted scenes were incorporated in this version- the rest are missing and not in extras either, as the 'deleted scenes' extra was not

included;

-as advertised there is 10-11 minutes of new footage not found anywhere on the original DVD;

-cast commentary is not available - most surely left off cause it wouldn't sync with this new, longer version of the movie;

-I believe all the Easter eggs are there- I know the Mia-old lady kissing scenes are there and Chyler's wedding proposal;

-all the other extras are there from the orignal DVD - the omissions are the deleted scenes and the cast commentary mentioned above;

-very nice DVD case design, and also new music and a new menu choice design at beginning of the DVD;

More detailed analysis:

1) The 8 deleted scenes incorporated:

areola and janey go to class;

the bbq;

janey's transformation (with Mia);

Jake and Father;

Ricky at Party;

Pillow fight;

bruce and areola at prom;

ricky at prom;

The Good:

-you get high-res versions of the above scenes never before available;

The Bad:

-is an absolute crime the other 10 were not not still included as extras- some of the best scenes on the orginal DVD;

2) Some notes on the extra 10-11 minutes:

a) Some scene additions or major length additions:

-Janey-Ricky scene in hallway discussing the prom;

-Mitch and friends at cafe discussing sex;

-Jake and Ricky meet at Janey's house when chasing her at the end;

-Footloose parody scene at the prom;

-some exta 'shower footage' of the girls Mitch and his friends are looking at through the vent;

-little extra footage at football game and at the major party scene;

b) you will notice all kinds of extra few second splices right from the beginning all through-out the movie- too many to mention them all but a few examples-

-early scene when they all arrive at school- extra footage of Priscilla walking down hall- exta footage of them all walking over 'fat guy'; an extra comment

by the guy who shows up 3-4 times in the movie and makes sarcastc remarks;

-girl having sex against window at school says '**** me harder' instead of 'love me harder' (Chyler Leigh's voice btw);

-Mia Kirsher sucks on her brother's hand in their 'bedroom scene';

-dozens more like above;

The Good:

If you're a NATM fanatic you'll enjoy the xtra shots/footage gernally;

The Bad:

-most of the xtra footage is completely forgettable and was edited for a reason;

Overall:

If you can only buy 1 DVD- I'd highly recommend the orginal- has all the 18 cut scenes which are generally superior to the added footage and has the good cast

commenatary. Also the original edited movie cut is better than this one. But if you're a fanatic or collector, I'm sure you'll want this version as well though - getting high-res versions of the 8 previously cut scenes is nice and a few of the added scenes are funny or sexy.
