I can empathize with those who are disappointed that we don't get this movie in widescreen.  Of course we should.

However... it's $10, and life is short, and you don't want to go for the old dirt nap without seeing this one.

The basic plot set-up is simple enough -- clever bad guys rob the wrong bank (a Mafia money drop) and all hell breaks loose.  And I'm not giving away anything you won't see in the first few minutes.

What makes this film work is the intelligent script (this is oh so far from a dumb "caper movie") and letter-perfect performances.  Walter Matthau is wonderful as the phlegmatic and judicious title character, Andy Robinson does a great turn in his effeminate psycho character, and other highlights range from Normal Fell to the great suave and sinister John Vernon (yup, Dean Wormer as a mid-level mafia executive).  But wait, there's more!  Joe Don Baker is wonderful as the dogged, cornpone-flavored hit man who is set on Matthau's trail.

And even at this, I'm missing some great smaller performances -- this is one of those films where everyone shines.

One of the things that makes this film so wonderful to watch is that nobody's cast against type.  Everyone's doing their usual thing, but they get to do it particularly well in a great setting.
