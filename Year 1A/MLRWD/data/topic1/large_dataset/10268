While I'm relatively new to anime as a whole, I don't think that's a dis-qualification for an objective review. However, the way Shinkai eloquently displays his talent makes it very difficult to give just that, an objective review. Besides the fine lines and perfect quality in art, the story by itself is to heart wrenching, I could barely stand watching the third chapter without taking time to take it all in. I'm not going into detail about the story line, many other reviews about this movie give enough about it. However, as each chapter progresses you feel more torn apart on the inside. Even from a guy's perspective it was difficult to watch. It's a slow moving movie, filled with one-liner love statements. There's no action, no comedic parts, and there's hardly any character dialogue, except in the second chapter. However, the movie gives enough character development to get emotionally involved.

All-in-all, the movie's storyline carries you much farther than you could ever expect. And when you add fine detail to art, the end result is a synergistic bliss all rolled in to one. I recommend at least a box of tissues.
