I had no real intention to see this film, but after being dragged to see it, I had to admit it was truly an incredible movie. Even though I live in a beach city, I am not exactly an avid surfer, yet I still enjoyed it a lot. This film is interesting enough to be viewed by anyone, interested in surfing or not.

The history of surfing is very fascinating and it is very cool to see interviews with the people who love the thrill of riding giant waves. The footage of the surfing is especially amazing, seeing the tiny guy riding in a monolith of water is just dream-like and truly incredible. I also loved the retro footage of 50s and 60s era surf culture, if you are in to that culture or stlye at all, I recommend this film simply for that aspect.

Another great part of the movie was the music, which I enjoyed so much I bought the soundtrack. It covers a diverse ammount of surf rock, hawaiian music, and epic rock ballads, and every piece fits brilliantly well with the visuals.

A very high-quality documentary and interesting film in general. 5 stars.
