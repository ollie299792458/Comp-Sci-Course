The movie is extremely witty and provides for loads of laughs while still doing quick moral lessons.  The actors in this do an incredible job.  The only problem is the ending, which happens to be the last 4-5 minutes, once they reach the hotel.  This last scene just doesnt make sense in terms of the rest of the movie.  There isn't enough evidence throughout the movie that this can end so abruptly.  Theres nothing out of the way or jumpy in terms of the speed of their relationship at times, and yet at the end, it is incredibly confusing just what everyone's feelings are of the situation besides that of the mother of the girl.  The boy leaves, leaving the audience to use their own experiences to fill in the blanks.  I seems, then, that the ending says there were no morals that they were going for in the ending, but to merely provide a faceplate for people to ponder, agree with, or be totally confused about, as I am.  I suggest watching it up until the end of the summer (in the movie).  "The Graduate" was much better....watch that...
