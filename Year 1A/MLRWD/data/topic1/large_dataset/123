This is probably Peter Greenaway's most accessible film. It's a controversial film and has a NC-17 rating in the US. It's a tale of sex, lust, food, gluttony, murder and revenge. The film opens with a vulgar scatological scene, when a man is smeared with excrement by 'The Thief', Albert Spica. Most of the film is set in an elegant gourmet restaurent called Le Hollandais. Spica dines at this restaurant frequently, along with his gorgeous wife Georgina (played by solemnly sexy Helen Mirren) and his group of coarse associates. 
Spica is a vulgarian, who growls his orders towards those around him. Georgina then becomes fixated with a customer in the restaurant (Alan Howard) and the two of them have a dangerous sexual affair there. Eventually, Spica discovers their liaison, and the film draws to its memorable and shocking conclusion, which is the ultimate retribution. Sumptuous to look like at and superbly performed. A must see.
The DVD image is in widescreen 2.35:1 and it is a good transfer. It is well defined and the colours are splendid. The sound is in Dolby 2.0 and pretty good. Michael Nyman's excellent soundtrack uses the surround channel to good effect. The main menu is nicely animated with a sexual scene at the bottom of the screen and a boy singing at the top, with Nyman's music playing. There are 30 chapters. Sadly, the extras are just two trailers.
