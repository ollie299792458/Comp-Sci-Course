I absolutely love this show. The only thing I want to add to what others have said is that I'm now convinced the best way to watch "Lost" is on DVD. I just recently watched all of the previous three seasons in order to get ready for the new season. I was watching the episodes in bunches - at least two at a time and often four together. It was great! But now that I'm watching the current episodes they seem sooooo short. They end way too soon! But, no, I'm not going to stop watching and wait for the next DVD set to come out. I did that midway through the second season because my DVR failed to record an episode. I immediately stopped watching the show that year and patiently waited for the DVD release. The show's ratings took a hit at about the same time. I wonder how many other people did what I did?
"Lost" is easily the richest, most absorbing, thought-provoking show on television. I have no idea how they can make the ending live up to the rest of the show but I'll be there faithfully to the very last episode.
