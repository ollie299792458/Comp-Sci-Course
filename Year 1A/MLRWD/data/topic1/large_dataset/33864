I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was nine years old.  From that time on, it has haunted me ever since.  I have never seen a movie that deeply effected me like The Exorcist.  Now that I'm a grown adult, I'm able to sit through a full viewing of the film, but still feel an eerie feeling surround me as I watch what true evil looks like.

I think that is why so many people are frightened of this film.  For the first time, people are able to come face to face with The Devil himself. There are no one liners to break up the tension.  In fact, this movie is so dead serious that it's almost like watching a documentary as to what would happen if some innocent person were to have Satan knocking on their doorstep.  Many people will say that this film is blasphemous, and in a way it is, but the writer and director wanted to truly show how evil Satan can be.  Copious amounts of profanity, desecration of religious objects, and freakish supernatural incidents are prevelant throughout this film, not to add to shock value, but to convey the message of true evil.

In some other horror movies (such as the slasher films), victims are able to escape from their enemies either by physical force or intellegence, but for some innocent person being attacked by an invisible, malevolent force is scary as hell.  It is something that cannot be explained.  The victim is being surrounded by a macabre scene that is enigmatic over a prolonged period of time.  The viewer gets to witness what a tortured soul is subjected to.

For those who do not believe in Satan or for those who do, but believe that possession could never happen, can still be frightened by the visual aspect of the film.  Sure, some of the special effects may seem outdated, but the general ambience is still frightning.  Anyone who has not seen this movie, but is a big fan of the horror genre or just wants to get scared, this is a must see.
