Though I must admit that the acting is generally pretty good, especially from the lead actor, as well as compelling photography, my problem with this film is that, in my opinion, it absolutely depends on being able to convince the viewer that the small psychological "turns" that are taken onto the path of violence, and even killing, would be irresistible for the viewer too, and this simply did not happen for me. Any viewer who reads the description on the cover of the DVD would know what the outcome of the film was going to be, so there is no interest in this; what is of interest is to be able to identify with the decisions of the characters who turn to violence by small increments - the coming to power of the Nazi regime in Germany being a perfect example of this process - and I just couldn't buy it, so the film simply deteriorated into silly and laughable violence (such as the incarceration of the experimenters which did not happen in the original experiment, AND there was no killing!), and had nothing to say about the tragic inevitability of violence among humans, and the corrupting force of power, which is what I think it set out to do. Big idea, good idea, but just no subtlety or psychological nous from the the script writer and the director.
