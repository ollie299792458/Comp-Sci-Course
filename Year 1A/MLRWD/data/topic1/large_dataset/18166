Children of the Living Dead is a film that deserves to go down in history...and flames.  With makeup effects rivaling only the most innovative of grade-school musicals, and dialogue dubbing that is matched in futility only by the most obscure chinese kung-fu films, this blatant attempt to cash in on the Romero legacy with the least expense (and apparently, talent) possible is a disgrace to both film, the DVD format, and the western world.  Upon only a cursory examination of the film, it is obvious that the production cost less than your average 1974 Dodge Dart.  The plot seems to have been structured using a Magic 8-ball, while the film has been edited so as to maximize the confusion and exasperation of the audience.  Decades pass with no evident aging of the actors, sets, or relative environment.  The only obvious attraction inherent in the project is Tom Savini, who appears (after losing a bet, hopefully) and manages to extricate himself from this obscenity of a film in under 15 minutes.  However, also not to be missed are the obviously two-dimensional tombstones, the clips falling out of weapons while in mid-firing, and the amazing mixture of night and daylight shots...in the same scenes.  The only bright spot is the swaggering, Travolta-like movement of the "head zombie" who resembles an extra from the "Thriller" video, complete with bad '80's wardrobe. In truth, no words can express just how bad this movie is. Ed Wood himself is probably spinning in his grave right now, realizing that he had barely plumbed the depths of bad filmmaking which have been charted anew by...this piece of crap. Far more frightening than the small group of pastel zombies in this film will be the hordes of angry customers who descend upon their unwary video store owners who will have to face their collective wrath...and vengeance.
