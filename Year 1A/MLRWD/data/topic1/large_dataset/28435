I grew up watching Technicolor MGM/20th Century Fox/Paramount, etc. Movies.  In these movies stars were glamourous, handsome, wore glizty gowns, tuxedos, and tails.  That is what a movie star looked like back in  those those days, classy, real classy.  
They always had a (Let's put on  a show scene) that included wonderful costumes, dance numbers, and  everybody lived happily ever after.  I was shaped and formed by these  movies; I really enjoyed seeing them and being in a fantasty world for two  hours.  These movies helped give me an idea of what glamour and drama were  back in the turbulent 60's.  I think White Christmas is a great movie  because it combines many of the elements that make a good movie.  It has  two love stories, not just one with Kaye and Crosby.  Also, they play off  of each other wonderfully.  Rosemary Clooney sang and did a spectacular  job.  There are fun song in this movie such as (Snow), and (Gee, I Wish I  Was Back in the Army) that I have never been able to forget.  I have seen  this movie at least 25 times and it is still a great movie.  Irving  Berlin's songs you never forget.  The last scene around the Christmas tree  is spectacular, with the costumes, the ballerinas, and the title song.  Now  that's entertainment; old-fashioned Hollywood style; done with style and  class.
