Though the premise appears a bit farfetched (Lincoln rose from obscurity to be President of the USA) , I did find The Amazing Mrs Pritchard most entertaining.  Jane Horrock did an excellent job with this part.  To rise from a place of obscurity to being Prime Minister of the nation of Great Britain was refreshing!  She is definitely, politically naive and way out of her depth, however, her cabinet is made up of some very fascinating characters, who are more knowledgable about politics than Mrs Pritchard. Janet McTeer turned in a first class performance. Interesting to see how she reacts to her political mistakes, how real she is when she has to make a decision where lives might be at stake. We also see in this series how Mrs. Pritchard's passion to serve her country has its' affect on her family. I do wonder, had 'she' been a 'he', would the family impact been one of the series' emphasis? As a true Anglophile, I always welcome good British programming.
