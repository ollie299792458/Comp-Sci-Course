The plot has already been pointed out by other posters on this film. Let me tell you some great elements. The scene where the sniper shoots those on the highway brilliant. The home scenes of the sniper's wife and family are very good too. Fine incorporation of Karloff's real life being into the fictional Byron Orlock (though Karloff, according to director Peter Bogdonavich, didn't put himself down like Orlock does). The drive in climax is also splendid. I'm not bothered by the sniper's reaction  to meeting Orlock in the flesh and not beating the old guy up. He's supposed to be stunned to meet this big movie star. Lots of other great stuff too. The only way this film falls down from great to very good is the totally stupid asian secretary bit. She works for Orlock and is accepted by him as such an equal. Yeah right! And what's more she's the love interest of a very white film writer named Sammy (director Bogdonavich in an acting role). Yes, so many struggling white writers in the 1960's would love to have risked becoming morbid social outcasts by even dating someone Chinese. Real believable stuff. And just to throw salt on dumb wounds she's supposed to have gone to Oxford! Like Sidney Poitier in To Sir With Love she's a minority character way too good to be true.The commentary by Bogdonavitch is good too. Learn things like how the people at the real life gun stores used in this movie thought this was a wholesome film about a young man going hunting with his father. They knew nothing of the sniper story it really was!
