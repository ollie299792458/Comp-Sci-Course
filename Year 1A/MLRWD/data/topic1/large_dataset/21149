I've seen 2 other Cenerentolas, and this is by far the best.
Cast is not just one superstar, but 6-7 really good
singers in perfect form at the height of their careers.
I think von Stade just retired this year here in the Bay Area.

However, I'm commenting because this is my 3yo daughter's
favorite DVD.  In fact, when she sees Disney Cinderella
on screen, she says "I want to see the real cinderella instead".
She's probably watched her favorite arias 50 times now.
She knows the story, and since the actors expressions
are fairly expressive, she knows that "she's sad", "the
daddy is angry", etc.

Both of the kids have seen various other operas including
Barbiere and Mozart's Figaro, but they have a hard time
following the story (and having your 8yo interrupt every
30 secs to ask what is happening gets old).  This opera
also has a lot more singing and very little recitativo.

Show this to your kids early, show it to them often.
And I don't have to listen to Barney in the background.
