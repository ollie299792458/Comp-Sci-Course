Well, I rented this movie from the library based on reviews here. Definitely some interesting aspects to this movie, but it is a message movie. The acting is kind of wooden; everyone is playing their roles in this morality drama. The sexual double entendres are clumsy...this is not Bogart and Bacall. It is definitely more frank than a lot of movies in terms of issues raised, but it's not like the story arises from a Leave It To Beaver kind of atmosphere. The small town of Grantville she comes to seems almost like a community that's been nuked. Hardly any people around. Maybe he just couldn't get enough extras, but there's no warmth to this town. I see it more as sort of an early exurbian town, you really don't know people yet, and where people are on the move a lot and no one knows each other. The brothel is "across the river." Anyway, I would group it with other morality message movies of the 50s and 60s. A lot of heavy symbolism. Has almost an Invasion of the Body Snatchers feel to it (the original one). The final scene, with the close ups of these anguished faces that are really hard to read...that was great. Close up faces of anger and fear, as many message movies would do at that time (kind of like "The Miracle Worker," too). Those faces stick with you as she walks down a completely abandoned street.
