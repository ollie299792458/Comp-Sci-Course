As the mother of two daughters, I've seen a lot of children's movies over the past decade. And Brave is one of the good ones!

Set in 10th Century Scotland, Merida is a Scottish princess and her parents are preparing to marry her off in a manner consistent with the times. Her hand in marriage shall go to the prince of one of the neighboring clans; the one who can best prove his worth by winning a competition in some area of traditional masculinity. But spunky Merida has plans of her own, she carefully chooses archery as the designated contest and then boldly competes herself to win her right to stay single.

When that doesn't work, Merida follows the woodland wisps to seek her fate.  She makes a bargain with a witch exchanging her valuable necklace for a spell to make her mother understand her better.  Suffice it to say that the  result was unexpected.

Mixing accurate historical Scotland with ancient folklore, this charming little film does a terrific job of depicting current family issues and the underlying love that provides the family foundation.

The scenery are based on real settings in Scotland and were breathtaking in brilliant colors.

But the thing I really loved about the film was the strong female protagonist who was both physically and emotionally tough. A heroine with a mind of her own, who doesn't need a man to complete her. These are the types of characters that I want my daughters to grow up with.

Well-done, Pixar!!
