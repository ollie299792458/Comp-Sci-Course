I enjoy Sandra Bullock's acting and felt she was good in her role in this film, but the film itself was a big disappointment.  The writers wanted a thriller and had no compunction being inconsistent and inacurate in getting there.  They go for the easy shock -- arranging for a severed head to roll out of a dropped casket, without considering the fact that the fire-ball explosion in the accident causing the death would probably not have left anything to roll.

Worst of all, though, is the blatant inaccuracy of the film's title.  It's called "Premonition" but there is no premonition present!  The film is not based on what happens to someone faced with the problem of dreaming or otherwise tuning in on a future event and the difficulty of trying to cope with that future possibility in the present.  Instead, it deals with a person effectively stepping into another point in time -- out of normal chronological sequence -- and interacting with friends and family who are living a normal chronology of life. It's an interesting concept, but one having nothing whatsoever to do with premonitions.  The featurette, a  quasi-documentary on people who have had experience with premonitions, was interesting and fairly informative on the subject.  Too bad the writers couldn't have viewed that before creating the film.
