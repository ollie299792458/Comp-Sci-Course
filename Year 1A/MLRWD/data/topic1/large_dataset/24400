The 2002 Hen's Tooth DVD release is by far the best release of this film I've yet seen. It is literally night-vs-day better than the previous VHS releases as far as print quality and clarity of the image and sound.

My only complaint is that the DVD is an "un-squeezed" pan and scan full frame version.

A previous reviewer stated that it was full screen because it was filmed that way.

This is quite inaccurate because while the DVD release is fullscreen, the entire running time of the original VHS release (as well as the credits sequence on the DVD) was released in a "squeezed" anamorphic full-frame format.

The DVD is an "un-squeezed" pan and scan full frame version. Watch how the image pans during the long shot to follow the boy as he runs across the field in the pre-credits sequence.

There is no such pan on the anamorphic VHS release, proving the original image was supposed to be wide screen. Owners of the "squeezed" anamorphic VHS version who also own a widescreen monitor can use the "strech image" function to approximate what a properly formatted letterboxed release might look like.

Owners of the DVD must content themselves with "stretching" the image during the credits sequence for this effect.

By the way, does anybody know what the other two DVD releases look like? Does a letterbox version exist in ANY format?
