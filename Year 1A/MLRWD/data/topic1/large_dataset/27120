I remember seeing this movie almost 15 years ago and falling in love with it. When I saw it on the store shelf the other day in DVD finally, I couldn't resist. I didn't even realize new footage had been added until I started watching it, and I began seeing all these strange new scenes.
I tend to agree with other reviewers about the full-length edition kind of dragging the movie out. There should be an option to see it either in full, or as it was cut. That would have taken a minimal amount of effort, as they did for Independence Day.
The worst part I thought was the shoddy attempt to dub the audio in the newly restored scenes. Not only were the characters mouthing (syncing) something different than what you heard, but the new voices weren't even close to the originals! I don't expect perfection, but they could have found more accurate dubbing voices if they really tried. It was quite distracting, but those are my only complaints, which calls for the absence of one star in my rating. The rest of the movie is a treasure to watch. I like the 2 new songs that they originally left out.
Not everyone may like the movie as I do, as it wasn't that popular to begin with. If you are hesitant or unsure, I would recommend renting it first before you consider adding it to your collection.
