A great but disturbing film noir from the master, Fritz Lang. Especially for the Vince Stone character (Lee Marvin), who seems to enjoy torturing and killing women--a remarkable character for a fifties movie--reminds me of the Dennis Hopper character in David Lynch's BLUE VELVET 30 years later. Very violent. Fast-moving plot. Great performances from all, especially Glen Ford, Lee Marvin, and Gloria Grahame, perhaps the greatest role of her career. Ford is a homicide detective investigating the murder of a prostitute that no one wants him to investigate, because of corruption in high places. The organized crime syndicate has his wife killed, and him taken off the force, so he is forced to seek revenge on his own, even though he resists the urge to kill. When Stone's girlfriend, Gloria Grahame, talks to Ford, Stone throws a pot of hot coffee on her face. She then befriends Ford, and helps him achieve his revenge. I guess she is the femme fatale character, but she's fatal for the bad guys, not Ford. The corruption is finally cleansed and Ford returned to his position, but his wife is still dead, and the violence lingers hauntingly in our minds. Visually, this is classic film noir, with lots of menacing shadows.
