Trigun is a complex piece of anime. It starts out as a lighthearted western comedy with sci-fi elements and slowly turns into a very serious science fiction story.
The story basically tells the story of Vash the Stampede, a gun sliging man with a 1 billion dollar price on his head.
It starts out silly, with two female insurance agents sent to find and convince Vash to stop destroying entire towns so that the insurance agency won't lose so much money from insuring towns. As those insurance agents discover, Vash is a complete goofball with a heart of gold.
As the unrelated stories unfold, the first few episodes introduce us to the characters and the desolated world that Vash and gang live in. As we move on, more of Vash's mysterious story is revealed and the story turns more and more serious.
The story owes alot to older silly/serious characters and anime series such as City Hunter. Overall the Trigun series is worth watching for its funny moments and action sequences. Athough its got an interesting story, the story gets too depressing and just drags on for too long at the end. The animation is also a mixed bag with some beautiful episodes and some which are just mediocre. Overall Id say give the series a shot and you'll come to love it.
