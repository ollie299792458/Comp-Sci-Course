This movie is meant to entertain and it does that. I for one appreciate the opportunity to see such as Angela Bassett and Rick Fox. There are too many outstanding black actors that you rarely seen except in Mr. Perry's movies.  He uses a mixture of slapstick, satire, and drama and I don't think that it is fair to try to say that there should be more. As for his work in general, I appreciate them all. I especially appreciate the opportunity to see actors such as Cicely Tyson, Lou Gossett, Jr. etc., and as usual the Mann's are wildly funny.  You won't often find most of these actors elsewhere and that is a shame. If the comedy seems over the top, so be it.  My complaint with this movie is that I would have appreciated more time in between when the film morphed from the kiss in the gym to the kiss at the marriage ceremony.  I feel that we are owed at least a sequel for that lapse.  I look forward to seeing Ms. Bassett, who is always outstanding in all the roles that she has played in, as often as roles can be found for her. I have bought nearly every one of the Tyler Perry DVD's and I will continue as long as he doesn't change from the artistic to the vulgar.
