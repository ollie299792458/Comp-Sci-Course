Some friends and I watched this last night (Halloween night).  It was a riot!  Once we braced ourselves for the entertainment values of 1976, and the poor quality of the recording, we were sucked right in and laughed at Paul Lynde's corny jokes.  The others cast in this special were also fun.  Margaret Hamilton and Billie Hayes were spot-on as witches.  And seeing a young and still-striving for stardom KISS was a delight.  The energy level really jumped up for "Detroit Rock City" and "King of the Nighttime World"  (Including explosions and fire-breathing!)  "Beth" was, well, as gentle as the song is.

The late Paul Lynde was a comic master.  Everybody loved him and he really stood out in his roles in "The Munsters" and "Bewitched."  That grin, that laugh, that delivery -- infectious and irreplaceable.

This was my second time seeing the Paul Lynde Halloween Special -- first time was the original (and only) airing on October 29, 1976.  Being a huge KISS fan was my motivation to watch then.  It was just as enjoyable to see my rock heroes in last night's viewing, and I enjoyed all the other skits as well.  With the possible exception of Florence Henderson singing a disco-tinged "That Old Black Magic."  Embarrassing!
