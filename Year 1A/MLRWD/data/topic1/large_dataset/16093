La Ciudad is an expressive film which allows people to see what immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, have to go through in order to survive in the United States and the struggles they go through to get there. La Ciudad tells a few different stories of immigrant families. Although these immigrants are so different, they have more similarities than one could imagine. La Ciudad shows the struggles immigrants go through such as working hard and long hours with little or no pay wondering when their checks will come, the struggle to survive, trying to give their children good education, and most of all, the struggles of living apart from their families and loved ones.

 La Ciudad is filmed in a narrative perspective. Each different story starts with a family or individual taking a picture, and with a snap of a picture, a new story begins. Each picture taken captures each individual immigrant, and although different, all seem to have similar situations and share the same struggles and hardships. The pictures that are taken are all families have left to be remembered by their families. La Ciudad is filmed in black and white which helps to show how immigrants' lives are far from colorful. This aspect also shows that their lives are much more dark and depressing than anyone unfamiliar would know. Viewing this movie in black and white also emphasizes the slums of New York which is barely seen or recognized. La Ciudad also focuses on children a lot. This is possibly to emphasize that immigration affects every person in a family, regardless of age. Overall La Ciudad shows that immigrants tend to live their lives looking through glass windows; the opportunities are there, but for immigrants they seem impossible to reach. La Ciudad is an excellent movie which allows people to see the struggles which immigrants, illegal and legal, go through upon immigrating.
