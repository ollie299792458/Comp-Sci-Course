The team at the BBC got it right-there is another series of invigorating 'big animal' natural history stories AFTER the dinosaurs went extinct-the radiation and development of the mammals. 
This DVD series covers the early expansion of mammals into vacant ecological niches left by the disappearance of (most) of the dinosaurs-from early cat-size horse ancestors, to big carnivourous flightless birds, to giants in the sea (carnivorous whales 18m long), to giants on the plains-eg rhinos trying to be giraffes (up to 6m at the shoulder), elephant ancestors (up to 4m at the shoulder), giant pig-like ancestors, giant carnivorous hoofed animals (Andrewsarchus-about 2m at the shoulder), the sabre tooth cats (smilodon-about 1.2m at the shoulder-bigger than the modern tiger), upright small primates wandering the African plains (australopithecus-about 1.4m at the shoulder), mammoths (about 3m at the shoulder) and eventually a 'big' primate-man (about 1.7m at the shoulder). 
There are two DVDs in the set, 1)-the 6 part series, and 2) 2 40 minute-long documentaries, which for those who want deeper analysis, are better than the series. These documentaries take us to the famous fossil site of Messel in Germany, the Sahara desert, Ethiopia, South Africa, and various other locales, with background rationale explained as to various aspects of the series. Most of the stories are indeed based on scientific research-for example the lake beds at the famous fossil site of Messel in Germany appear to have been anoxic-and there is evidence of sudden unusual extinctions which have been surmised to be due to mass releases of carbon dioxide (episode 1). Other examples are leopard teeth marks found in skulls of australopithecus-(episode 4), mammoth kill sites adjacent to ancient cliffs (episode 6), impact injuries in Neanderthal skeletons (episode 6), and exposed fossil mangrove roots in the Sahara desert (episode 2). This sort of background information is essential for a deeper analysis of many of the stories in the main series, and provide good information for the enthusiastic amateur palaeontologist.
This is a wonderful 65 million year story, which has been somewhat neglected during the modern science era, and this series attempts to fill in many gaps for the wonder and scientific endeavour of the chattering and lumbering primates who eventually came down from the trees.
The BBC has left some significant Quaternary and Recent megafaunal extinctions out, in such places as Madagascar, Australia (eg diprotodon, megalania), New Zealand (eg the moa), and other places, so I hope they will visit these places in another series!
