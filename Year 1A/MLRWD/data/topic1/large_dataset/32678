First-off let me unabashedly say that I generally don't like Donizetti's music but I like Natalie Dessay so I bit the bullet and got this DVD.  The good news: Dessay and co-star Juan Diego Florez are brilliant singers and pull off their parts very well.  The rest of the cast does a good job as well and support the leading players very well,  the chorus work is clean and tight, and the orchestra sounds great and gives a very spirited rendering of the overture under the baton of conductor Bruno Campanella.  The bad: The production itself.  Ugly, distorted sets, drab and very clumsily executed costumes, singers that are not allowed to stand still for longer than a nano-second, and a generally over-the-top take on the opera itself.  I found myself bored after 30 minutes, turned it off, came back the next night, lasted another 30 minutes and then, just as I was ready to take another nap-break, something interesting happened - the story finally started.  There's something wrong with an opera that takes so long to get moving (unless it's Wagner - but he's a different story).  Anyway, I did enjoy the second act much more than the first and, in spite of its "bad" qualities, this DVD will not join my shelf of "dust-collectors".
