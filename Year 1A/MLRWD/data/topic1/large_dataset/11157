This is a five dollar item that gives me more choices.  It's that simple.  If this company is going to give me new opportunities to watch movies, I'm all for it.  I read that Flexplay DVDs may be made available with delivery pizza.  Talk about a winner.  Who would want a 15 year old movie delivered with your pizza if you can get a new release movie on Flexplay? The last pizza and a movie deal I got suckered into delivered Weekend At Bernies on DVD, which was bad enought the first time I saw it on VHS.

I can't help but laugh at all the environmentalists trying to suggest DVDs are going to ruin our environment.  How easy is it to think about a million other conveniences we enjoy that create a ton more waste than DVDs will?  Even if you go through 10 of these things every month, how much space will they take in your weekly garbage? I would venture to say your junk mail and magazine subscriptions create 5 times the waste that a few DVDs will.

If you make it easier, cheaper and more convenient, I'll be buying.
