I have to say that TSTL has the most gripping plot and concentration-demanding storyline of all time.  While it does a marvelous job of enthralling the audience (to movie thrill-seekers and the "cinema intelligentsia" alike), it subtly portrays the coldness and desolation of capitalistic America.  I am no sociologist (coz I'm a 17-year-old for crying out loud!:), nevertheless, this symbolic indication is still quite perceptible through my observation.  Last week I attended a lecture (one which I paid a commensurate amount of $9 US) and the lecturing scholar pointed out two fascinating (or not) consistencies of all the renowned serial killers the world has endured over the past several centuries.  One being that their motives usually pertain to the acqusition of recognition/fame in his/her (those of the latter gender is extremely rare; makes me wonder why...) society, which is immersed with white-collar workers.  The while-collar worker detail signifies the fact that these "anomalies" only dig for middle~upper class citizens (e.g. Christian Bale in American Psycho).  How come?  According to this professor, third world countries do not appeal to these "special people". What I mean is simply that death is commonplace in these regions (therefore their desire for fame via murder is precluded); hence, they find it difficult, if not impossible, to create a "market" (of notroious homocides) in death-plagued sectors.  This is all the material I consider the essence of the lecture, I hope reading has not been a waste of "what we make of it" (time).  Thx for reading!
