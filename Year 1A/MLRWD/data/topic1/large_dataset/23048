After all the hype, the meteoric rise of Jennifer Hudson, the media-contrived "cat fights" between Jennifer and her co-star, Beyonce Knowles, and the ultimately disappointing result of Eddie Murphy's Oscar nomination, this film stands on its own merits.  There are strong acting and vocal performances all around, particularly those of the amazing Ms. Hudson.

The story is loosely based on the backstage saga of The Supremes, but never really makes one-on-one personal comparisons. Rather, the writers of the original stageplay, staged in the 1980's, used the real-life story as a launching point to tell a new tale. The screenplay enhances the story with stunning visuals and viable new tunes, including "I Love You, I Do," and "Listen," which were both nominated for Best Song.

The DVD has plenty of engaging extras, including cast interviews, and rehearsal/production coverage that enrich the home viewing experience.  On a side note, the talents of Anika Noni Rose have been grossly overlooked, not only in the promotion of the film, but as evidenced by her impressive audition, available among the DVD's extra features.
