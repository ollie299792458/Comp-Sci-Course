This movie is only 2 hours long, but being so fragmented in deliverance it sometimes seems like it goes on forever. I didn't mind it the first time, but when showing my friends movies I start to worry about them getting bored or "not getting" the whole message. Regardless, the title of this movie had many people I know thinking it was about drugs. Drugs are only vaguely mentioned. The 21 grams in question is the weight of a hummingbird, a stack of quarters, and the weight a human body loses just as they die. The theory is that the soul is the item lost. This film is so compelling to me that it's made its way to my top 10 list, and that's a difficult feat anymore. I cannot even think of a movie to relate this to, since it stands on its own simple plot laced with fantastic acting, awe-inspiring direction, and a powerful mess of film editing. Maybe "Memento" because of the here-it-is-live-with-it method of drama, as well as the reverse sequence of events. "21 Grams" avoids any melodrama and cheap sappy shots, something the director could have easily dwelled on. The fragmented editing takes away any cliche's but still provides a powerful impact in the pit of my stomach. Any way, Jesus gave me this dvd.
