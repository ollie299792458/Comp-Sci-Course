I respect all of the reviews that have been written thus far regarding Season 6 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  However, I must say that the authors of these reviews are blatantly wrong.  Well, maybe not wrong, but definitely misguided.

After John Quincy Adams painted the Sistine Chapel, I bet he got the same flack from his supposed friends and colleagues when he painted something else.

"Oh, I don't know, John.  I mean, it's good, but it's no Sistine Chapel."

What is he supposed to do?  Certainly everything can't live up to the standards of a masterpiece.  Otherwise, there would be no masterpieces.  There would just be John Quincy Adams paintings.

I guess what I'm eloquently saying is that if your perception of a particular season is vastly superior to another, it doesn't mean that the "lesser" season is bad.  It doesn't even mean that it's average.  It is just different.  The point is that it's still a very clever, hysterical show with a mean streak that we all love--or--if you're not yet familiar with the show, will come to love.

The season by itself is GREAT.  Buy it.  If you don't buy it, it means that you're wicked dumb.  However, only buy it if you actually have the money.  Don't buy it and then regret it when they shut off your water or whatever.  That'd be a mistake.  Just buy it if you can afford it.

Thanks for reading.  I hope that I cleared up the wrongfully abysmal rating that this season has garnered.
