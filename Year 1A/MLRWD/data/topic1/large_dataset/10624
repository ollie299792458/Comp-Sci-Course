K so heres the thing, everyones being so ciritical and whining about the good old days of B.T.V.S. (buffy the vampire slayer) and claiming season seven didnt center in on the three main charactors enough or that there was not enough nastalga. This, pontential buyers, is wrong. As we learned from season four on: Things change, Peolple change (Buffy, Willow, Anya and Dawn, for a start) and lives change. Sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The piont of the season is to watch the charactors grow and change, take charge, become who they will be forever. Dawn is a over emotional teen in an identity crisis, but in this season she finds her place in her family and becomes a mature young women. Willow meets Kennedy, one of the potenial slayers and they form a romantic relationship. Now many fans were upset that Willow forgot Tarra so easily but as you can see from the episode "Conversations with Dead People" she did not. But as we also know many people enter into toxic or bad relationships, like Buffy and Spikes thing back in season six. Not healthy for either of them. But they grew from it. And so mabye Kennedy isnt the best partneer for Willow but, everyone enters into bad relationships and yes she grows from it. This season is touching, innovative, and nastaligic. It is everything you could ask for, for a final season. truly a new chapter for each charactor and something everyone can enjoy. New characotrs, Old chactors, flashbacks, and boundries breaking are just some of the things you can except from season seven and is definitly worth your hard earned cash.
p.s. the last episode is a tear jerker.
