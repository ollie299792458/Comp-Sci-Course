You really cannot easily classify GREMLINS into a particular genre. Is it a children's film? A comedy? A horror flick? It's a little of each, so there's something for everyone out there, and when added together, it makes for one entertaining package.
But let's talk about this "Special Edition" DVD. Unlike the previous edition that was released on DVD a few years ago, this one has quite a lot of features. The filmmaker's commentary is funny and informative, the actor's commentary, though less educational, is also amusing to listen to. Lead star Zach Galligan seems to have a photographic memory, as he remembers quite a lot about every scene he was in, and has a fun time reminiscing.
It's quite fortunate that instead of incorporating the deleted scenes into the film and coming out with a new cut of the film, they just add these as a supplement, since the scenes merely slow down the story. Watch out for Judge Reinhold in many of these scenes. His entire subplot practically got cut from the final version of the film.
The photogallery is easy to navigate, just forward and back buttons; the featurette is a 5 minute 1983 "On The Set" piece.
But the real collectible on this disc is the film itself. Unlike many films from the 1980s, this one does not feel dated. It has that little quality that makes it timeless. It's rare that a film can have you laughing hysterically one minute, then jumping out of your seat the next. This is simply mixed-genre filmmaking at its finest.
