I want to preface this by stating that I liked the movie and would recommend seeing it.  I do have a few quibbles.  It misses being a better movie because it relies too heavily on the sweep and grandeur of the 4,000 mile trek to satisfy us, amazing as it is.  The script is a bit predictable and formulaic - you can recite some of the lines before they are said.  And the acting seems exaggerated at times, especially Colin Farrell as the "criminal," as though the characters need constantly to remind us of the significance of what they are doing.

Even so, I enjoyed how the escapees from the Gulag all coming from different backgrounds learn to appreciate and complement each other as the journey progresses.  I think it is a great lesson on the importance of each individual.  Plus the story reminds us of the horrors perpetrated by Stalin and the millions who suffered and died.  Finally, Ed Harris has become a real treat to watch over the years and he always lends an edge to his characters that elevates whatever film he is in.
