Okay, so this movie has all the trademarks of what should be a great romantic comedy: Location (out-of-town press junket), great concept (movie publicist needs to keep estranged movie couple looking like a happy pair, even though they can't stand each other anymore), and a cast to die for (Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Christopher Walken, and Hank Azaria). Why, then, is so much of the show flat? Maybe it's the direction, although I can't really think of any massive flaws. Maybe it's the script which, although peppered with great one-liners, goes one time too many for the cheap laugh. Maybe it's just over-expectation from this cast; whatever it is, this movie certainly ain't one of the greats.
That's not to say that there aren't joys to spare here. Julia Roberts is a treat as the cinderella sister of the deliciously bitchy Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack is one of the funniest neurotics since Woody Allen's better movies, and Hank Azaria, as is his wont, steals every second of screen time available to him. Toss some classic Crystal one-liners into the mix, and you've got a worthwhile evening at the movies.
