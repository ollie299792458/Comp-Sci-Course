For once, I'll be brief.

Having seen the original I never thought there could be a worse film, but it seems I was wrong.  While the original was dull, at least it was thoughful.  This new one is not only a perfect example of slick, too-fast, cliche-filled 21st century moviemaking, but the attempted message (to replace the well-crafted and thoughtful message of the original) was not only poorly considered but actually offensive.  This film makes me despair for humanity.

It actually put forward the idea that rich, powerful and beautiful women are more intrinsically special, more objectively important, than any man could ever be, and that men are slinking, jealous, threatened creatures that should consider themselves lucky to be graced by those women's mere existence.  Seriously.  People think like this.  Because clearly people shouldn't be judged on individual merit.  All this time here I was believing that everybody was equal, that the idea that one gender was inherently superior was a laughable notion, and that the last things that should be valued in life are money and power, when it turns out that all along I was completely backwards!  What would we do without Hollywood to correct our misconceptions, eh?

And to add insult to injury, the man who directed this film, who actually made it explicit what the message was meant to be in the five minutes' worth of special feature I managed to watch before my gorge rose, was Frank Oz.  Jim Henson's best friend, Fozzie Bear.  That he could be so utterly clueless and self-loathing... this film has banished the last of my respect for him, and that hurts.  Oh well, at least I don't have to be quite so upset that he's handed over all his Muppeteering duties now.

If I've ever seen a film that more completely advanced a painful, disgusting, backwards notion, then I'm currently at a loss to remember it.  It's vile.  Please don't watch it; it may infect you, and you'll only be encouraging these people.
