I had originally seen this film during some late night horror movie channel marathon.  I love Clint Eastwood but didn't know much else about the film until I purchased it on DVD.  I had asked a guy I worked with what films he would classify as extremely horrific or scary.  This was the only film he mentioned.  He said that this film still gives him nightmares and that he can't sit through it without giving himself the creeps.
I didn't understand why he felt this way until I finally bought the DVD and watched it again.  The film isn't scary in the traditional way you might think of a horror movie.  It's scary because of how real it is and how easily it catches you off guard.  The story in this movie could potentially happen anywhere to anyone.  The story line follows a psychotic woman who stalks a radio DJ (Eastwood) and falls deeper and deeper into insanity.  Most people don't think of women acting in this way, usually it's a man or disgruntled ex-boyfriend who becomes psychotic with this type of behavior.
The movie is actually very scary even though there is no faceless slasher with a machete hiding in the closet.
