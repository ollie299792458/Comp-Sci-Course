I can't believe how many reviewers neglected the fact that part of the genius of this movie is the way it is passed off as a true story.  Even the rumor that the cop was really a man just fuels the belief, although it is pure fiction.  The acting is great all around, but Macy steals the show as the complex, pathetic Lundegaard, a spineless, wimpy guy who married the overbearing, egotistical boss's ditzy, innocent daughter.  We never really find out why Jerry needs the money, although schemes involving a parking lot investment, insurance fraud, and a phony kidnapping are all backfiring as the plot unfolds.  Perhaps he simply needs the money from the kidnapping and/or the investment to cover the auto insurance fraud screw-up when they call his loan back.  It is never really explained, and to good effect.  The impetus for the capers is irrelevant.

Macy's lies (very realistic for a used car salesman), private temper tantrums and loss of control, and lack of authority over his father in-law are perfectly played.  The police interview scene in his office with Frances McDormand is pure genius, from the acting to the writing to the filming.  This is movie making artistry.

Buscemi and Stormare are perfect as the not-quite-competent thieves hired for the project, with Stormare a cold-blooded and obvious sociopath and Buscemi an almost likeable lost soul.

This is a fairly realistic movie, other than the scene where Stormare fires a single perfect shot at over 100 feet into the back of a fleeing crime witness, who is running in deep snow and illuminated only by car headlights.  It's nice to actually see a character in serious pain after getting shot, with lasting wounds, such as Buscemi's Carl Showalter suffers.

Not for the faint of heart, I recommend this movie 100%.
