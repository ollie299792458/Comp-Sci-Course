There is a school of thought that the best form of revenge is success.  In this case, the Revenge of Frankenstein is accurately titled, as the character is not interested in any of the more standard forms of vengeance.  Instead, Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) has moved on from his life of murder and monster-creating to a gentler life of tending to the ill under the name Stein.

Even though Frankenstein is far more benevolent (and outside of a murder at the beginning of the story, he commits less real evils), he is still Frankenstein, and that means he has to tamper with life and death.  Once again, he intends to create a man from the parts of others.  This creature is more well-put together than the Christopher Lee creature in the first movie in the series (Curse of Frankenstein) and a willing candidate for the brain:  Frankenstein's loyal but disfigured servant, Karl.

And since this is a Frankenstein movie, things will go wrong, although this time a lot of it is not Frankenstein's fault.  The man becomes a monster with the usual amount of murderous havoc.  This, in turn, threatens Frankenstein's hidden identity.

This is decent, standard Hammer Films fare:  there are nice sets, limited special effects, okay writing and competent (but stiff) acting.  Tame by today's standards, this film does still have its moments and will please many fans of more "classic" horror.  It rates a high three stars; it is not the best introduction to Hammer horror, but it is a slightly above average effort.
