I bought this movie assuming I would like it because it's popular, has a great cast (especially Owen Wilson), and is a comedy.  The first half started out funny, though very far fetched, and some of the lines and facial expressions of the characters were great.  But it seemed to deteriorate in the second half, and the writing became so unbelievable that it lost most of it's humor for me.

In the movie the main love interest of Owen Wilson (Rachel McAdams) is engaged to a guy who is so obviously a jerk, that I began to lose respect for her stupidity in staying with him for three years.  And Owen WIlson supposedly falls madly in love with Rachel McAdams in two days, after sharing a few laughs, a nice bike ride, and a game of hitting each other's hands on the beach.  She seems to be falling for him too and even kisses him, yet proceeds with plans to marry the abusive jerk she had been dating.  Because she finds out that Owen lied about being a relative, she never listens to his explaination, despite him trying for months to contact her.  And irregardless of whether he lied or not, it's still unbelievable that she'd continue to marry the jerk.

I am all for zany comedies (I usually like them and loved 40 Year Old Virgin), but when they cross the line into poor writing and poor character development, they lose some of the wit and humor.

This movie had some laugh out loud moments, but for me there were too many things that didn't fit and didn't work to make it a good movie.
