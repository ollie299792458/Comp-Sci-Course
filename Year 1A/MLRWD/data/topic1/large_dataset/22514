I LEARNED ALL I KNOW ABOUT CLASSIC MOVIES FROM MY FATHER. ON MY OWN, I KNEW OF FRANK CAPRA ONLY FROM "ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE". I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ANY OF HIS OTHER FEATURES. "MEET JOHN DOE", WAS I THINK THE 3rD MOVIE I WAS INTRODUCED TO AND IT WAS ALSO THE ONE THE CLINCHED IN MIND, THE GENIUS OF THIS MAN WHO I BELIEVE MAKES JOHN HUGHES LOOK LIKE TOBE HOOPER(NO OFFENSE TO EITHER ARTIST). THIS MOVIE HAS MANY THINGS GOING FOR IT, MOODY AND AT THE SAME TIME EXCEPTIONALLY OPTIMISTIC, THE THEME CARRIES THROUGH-OUT THE MOVIE,WITHOUT GIVING AWAY TO MUCH, GARY COOPER PLAYS A DISENFRANCHISED SOUL, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE AN EX-BASEBALL PLAYER. HE BASICALLY ACCEPTS A ROLE"JOHN DOE" FROM A NEWSPAPER REPORTER TO BE A PHYSICAL PROTEST OF ALL THE WRONGS / EVILS IN THE WORLD, DECLARING HE WILL COMMIT SUICIDE ON XMAS EVE...PRETTY HEADY STUFF FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME.
THE ENSEMBLE CAST WHICH INCLUDES WALTER BRENNAN(PRE-REAL McCOYS),BARBARA STANWYCK AND EDWARD ARNOLD. THIS IS A TRUE CLASSIC AND A TIMELY STATEMENT OF WHAT HUMANITY TRULY MEANS WITH REGARDS TO OUR CIVILIZATION'S MEANS JUSTIFIES THE ENDS MENTALITY.
