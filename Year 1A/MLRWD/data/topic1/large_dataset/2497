This is the only racially conscious sci fi movie that I've ever seen so it scores some points on that account for originality. This movie was made four years after the Rodney King riots so I suppose at the time people had a real fear of a racial violence. Part of the foreboding dystopian mood of the film is a sense of an impending race war as the new millennium approaches. Added to the mix is ethically questionable technology that allows people to experience other people's memories, and a psychopath who rapes and kills women and records the murders on snuff videos. You can probably tell the plot careens into many directions. This might have worked smoothly had the screenwriter not been James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar). Still, it's a worthwhile movie. Its socially conscious messages aren't perfect, but few movies even tackle this territory. The acting is at many points laughable. Angela Basset is the best in the cast. As an actress she's been great and over the top, and she's both in this movie. Some scenes work, some don't. So, overall, the movie is a mixed bag, but even if you consider it a train wreck, it's an interesting and unforgettable one.
