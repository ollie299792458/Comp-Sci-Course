The Hunted is an action movie fan's dream come true. But first, a note:  the "cruelty of hunting" is never really a theme of the movie, at any point. Watch closely; those two "hunters" Del Toro's character kills are not hunters but rather "sweepers," sent to kill him. Similar to Jones's character in "Under Seige," who has an attempt made on his life by his employer, the CIA. Then he takes over a ship and Steven Seagal gets to display his acting skills...
  Well. The knife fights are fantastic. Not realistic, as they probably wouldn't last more than one or two slashes in reality, but fantastic as in well-choreographed and well-acted.
  Also interesting is Tom Brown Jr.'s involvement with the film. Brown is a man who learned tracking (among other things) as a child. He owns a tracker school in New Jersey. He was an advisor on the film, and taught the actors a number of things, including how to flake stones into knives, and other fun stuff. He has a ton of fascinating books, containing a combination of practical advice and insight on survival and everyday life, as well as spiritual insight, which, like all spiritual insight, can be taken with a grain of salt and possibly utilized in one's daily existence.
  Anyway, fun movie, and it doesn't belabor any points. It shoots right on through to the end. The acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, but do you watch action movies for the acting?
