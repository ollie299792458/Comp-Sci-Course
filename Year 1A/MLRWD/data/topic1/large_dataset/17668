This may well be one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen. Veteran actor Warren Oates tries valiently to save it, but he really is swimming against a cross-current of abysmal fellow-actors, unbelievable unsympathetic characters, inchoherant writing (I would never refer to this stuff as a "script") and the poorest sound quality I can ever remember. I kept watching, hoping something - anything - interesting might happen at some point. No soap. My biggest disapointment was Will Hutchins. I was a big fan of his Tom 'Sugarfoot' Brewster character, but the idiot he portrays in this flick was sickening to watch. I can understand now why I never saw more of him in more movies. He got lucky with one role that was well-written, and well-shot, with decent co-actors to carry him, but he could never bring much to the "game" by himself.
The actress in this movie, Millie Perkins, was too lightweight for just about any kind of movie that required her to learn lines (if you get my drift) and not pretty enough for any other kind, although she did appear in Ensign Pulver. I can't imagine why.

Jack Nicholson puts in an extended cameo. Mumbles about a half-dozen lines and gets beat up. I was impressed with his quick-draw, but we never learn exactly why he's in the movie. Well, he DOES kill Hutchins, and THAT was certainly worth a days scale pay, I suppose.

Do yourself a favor - skip this one.
