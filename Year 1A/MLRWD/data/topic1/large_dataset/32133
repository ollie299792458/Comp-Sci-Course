Beethoven's unique opera work is really a great musical and drama development of the stage art. In this case, one of the greatest moments of the german master is performed by a great cast of singers, actors and of course, the musical direction by one of the best american directors of the twenty century: maestro Leonard Berstein. This 1978 version is unique in all details. The stage production by Otto Schenk have the closest aproximation to Beethoven original ideas of the drama set in Seville, Spain rather than other modern and fancy productions. All the performance is full of great pasion and dramatic force, excellent singers like Gundula Janowitz and the beloved Lucia Pop have just gone at the highest point of the german vocal art. Maestro Berstein impressed us with his marvelous and carismatic way of conducting and keep us from the opening oberture up to the finale with any hesitation or boring whatsoever. Its really gorgeous! The Chorus and Viena State Opera Orchestra put the right complement of sublime beauty, pathos, joy and hope which caracterize the all escense of the Beethoven 's only opera. We highly recomend this version on dvd to all Beethoven music lovers and must be in the collection of all opera fan. Thanks Amazon for having this video on your records!
