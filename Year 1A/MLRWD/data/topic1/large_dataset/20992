The formulaic young female blonde is a familar object in American Movies, particularly in recent years; invariably "Clueless," shallow, vain, and blended with a little streak of mean that always gets, in the end, its just desserts.
I watched "Legally Blonde" with low expectations, expecting to see this bit played tirelessly to the hilt. I was pleasantly surprised to see a few unexpected elements added to the standard mix in the character of Elle Woods played so warmly by Reese Witherspoon, the most notable of such elements being intelligence, integrity, and that rarest of things in modern film, a sense of ethics.  Witherspoon plays the role finely, with an overweening optimism that breathes real life into a script with almost as many unbelievable plot twists as, say, "The Fugitive."  Here however there are no amazing special effects to make up for the plot, unless of course you count Ms. Witherspoon's winning smile, which somehow does more than Harrison Ford can do by jumping off a dam.
The rest of the cast is pretty good too:  Of special note is Matt Davis, as Werner Huntington III, the boyfriend who jilts Elle for a fellow Harvard Brahminette, played by Selma Blair.  Davis plays Warner like a latter day George W. Bush, a mindless self satisfied far overrated automaton who relies on connections and an unearned sense of birthright to push himself far beyond the realms in which he might safely function.  Ms. Blair is also especially good as Vivian Kennsington, the new girlfriend, an ice queen before the fall.
Also worth noting is a little throwaway role played by Bruce Thomas, the UPS guy.  He does it perfectly.
Definitely worth watching, even if the plot is preposterous.
