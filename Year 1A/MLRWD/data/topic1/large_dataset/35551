This is Arnold's best movie of all time, with Commando coming in at 2nd place. This is actually my favourite movie of all time. It has everything; romance, betrayal, mystery, action, mutants with three boobs...etc. There is something in it for everybody. For those of you who say Arnold can't act, you are completely wrong, as this movie is perfect evidence to his acting skills. Sharon Stone is awesome in this movie. It leaves you guessing the whole movie. Is it really happening or is this all just because he has a skitzoid embolism (sorry about the spelling)? The other actors in the movie are all awesome. For those of you who say the effects are poor. GET OVER IT. It was 1990 okay? Vilos Cohaagon is a fantastic character. You may recognize him from Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2. This movie is so exciting, you never know what is going to happen next. Arnold just basically kicks ass throughout this whole movie. It has a billion quotable lines throughout the whole movie. Honestly, I cannot think of a single thing that I don't like about this movie. Everything about it is awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, you really need to watch it. It is for every age too! You don't have to be someone that grew up when Arnold was making his movies. I am a 24 year old female, and I love Arnold more than any other actor of all time. I find all of his movies relatable and awesome, this taking the top spot. Give this movie a chance. You will not regret it! I promise you this. I could listen to Arnold pronounce Mars as Mahz all day, every day. I am sorry if this is a bad review, it is my first one. But again, this is the best movie of all time. I am jealous of the other person who wrote a review saying they worked on the set, because I feel like nothing can compare to this movie and everybody who got to work on this movie should consider themselves lucky!! Arnold for life. I apolgize for the repeated use of the word awesome, but it is the best word to describe everything about this movie.
