Coach Carter is a fantastic film. Samuel L. Jackson plays the outstanding role of Coach Ken Carter in this very real-life film. Carter is the only person in this film that emphasizes the first word in the title "student-athlete" over the second. "Basketball is a privilege. One that you all must earn," is a line that Carter uses in the film. Even the principal seems to be against him when he benches his entire undefeated basketball team because they failed to keep their end of the contract up that they all signed at the beginning of the season. In this contract the players agreed to do things such as maintain a 2.3 GPA, attend all their classes and sit in the front row of those classes. They were required to wear jackets and ties on game days. The principal says to Carter, "Now you and I both know very well that for some of these young men this basketball season may the highlight of their entire lives!" Carter replies, "See now I think that's the problem, don't you?" He is a very strict and well disciplined man who comes to teach these boys the game of basketball, but more importantly, he comes to turn 25 boys into 25 men. The parents of these "student-athletes" care more about their son's ability to shoot a basketball than whether or not they're going to go to college, and get a better life for themselves. 10 out of 10 stars, 2 thumbs WAY up, and highly recommend it to anybody who thinks this movie is no different than other basketball movies, because I love to prove other people wrong.
