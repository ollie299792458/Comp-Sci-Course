Just like any other horror movie fanatic, I was thrilled when I was told that a new movie had come out about a serial killer. The name of the movie was "A horrible way to die", just listening to this title got me interested and made me want to watch the movie. I rented this movie and popped it in, within 20 minutes of the movie starting I found myself to be extreamly disinterested as well as disappointed. The reason I say this is because throughout the movie I found that the camera was shaking making it hard for one to pay attention to what is going on in the film, as well as the camera constantly going in and out of focus, again making it rather difficult to follow the story. The plot in this movie I felt was extreamly weak, which could be because the movie is low budget, even though the actors seem to do a decent job with their assigned roles. I do find it interesting that an escaped serial killer would come back for his ex girlfriend that was responsible for placing him behind bars, however what I don't understand is why he would save her in the end essentially allowing himself to die to save a woman who took his life away from him for taking the lives of other people. That is the only part of the movie that I found to be extreamly interesting, other than that the first hour of the movie was extreamly unworthly of my time. If you are going to watch this movie, save yourself the money and just rent it. In my opinion 20 minutes of decent movie is not worth the 15 dollars that one would pay to buy this movie.
