This is one of those movies I like while watching it, but soon after forget the plot.  It has a great cast, lots of action, but leaves me feeling a bit empty afterward.  So for me this is a rental and will not be added to my collection.  The picture quality is decent, but I'm not sure I would replace the SD DVD with the HD version (if I owned it.)

The whole Blu-Ray vs. HD DVD argument is getting a bit tedious, but I'll weigh in.  I've owned my Toshiba HD DVD player since launch day and I've enjoyed it.  I was originally going to wait until a format "won", but the release of Serenity pushed me off the fence.  If HD DVD dies, I'll still have a collection of dozens or hundreds of movies to watch-much like I did with laserdisc after DVD killed it.

Right now, Blu-Ray only has single layer 25 GB discs and Sony is using the inefficient MPEG-2 codec (compared to Microsoft's VC1 used in nearly all HD DVD titles).  This has resulted in a poorer picture and fewer extras.  Dual layer discs are on the way, but studios may not use them (they may be too expensive in the near term.) Also, the studios could switch to VC1, but again that is up to them.  While the picture quality on even the best HD DVDs is excellent, most will not notice the improvement over standard DVD unless they view both side-by-side.  This makes an HD DVD player purchase difficult to justify.  The lower picture quality of Blu-Ray, combined with the much higher player price is even harder to justify and will keep me from getting Blu-Ray until it can at least match HD DVD's quality.
