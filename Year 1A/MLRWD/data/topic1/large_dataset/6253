I loved this movie from the first time I saw it several years back.  As some of the other viewer's have remarked, the move is good because it's so enjoyable and humourus.  I know that Will Smith is often cast in the same type of role, but I cannot help but laugh at his character more and more each time that I watch this DVD.  If you're feeling down and just need a laugh, pop this one in the player!

Having moved to New York City, I can see how the storyline is at times frighteningly realistic.  Half the people here DO look like the auto guy that Frank the Pug was hanging out with in the movie, and having ridden in way too many cabs, one can certainly understand Jay's assumption that cab drivers are aliens.

Having the bonus DVD with this deluxe edition is cool as well to see more of the behind the scenes bits to see how everything was made/done.

My final comment is that this one of those excellent movies that gets a little bit funnier every time you watch it, so it's definitly worth buying the DVD to have for your own.  Enjoy!
