On the surface, this film seems to have little going on.  Several childless American women, each with different character traits and backgrounds, travel to Mexico hoping to adopt a baby.  Conversations ensue and maybe someone will get a baby.

The films of Johns Sayles tend to focus less on character development and more on character contrasts, archetypes rather than stereotypes.  Less interested in character transformations from A to B, Sayles opts to pick representatives from larger forces at work (or conflict) in society.

The sizable cast frequently woe their lot in life.  The childless women wonder "why me", and offer varied perspective on what be the best way to raise a child.  They raise age old concerns as to whether a baby is a blank slate, and what they must do ensure they get a child of "good stock".  An out of work architect hopes the lottery will change his life around, the young women giving up their children have dreams ranging from being a model to just eking by, and the infants will seemingly randomly be assigned to perspective mothers ranging from the resilient to the personality disordered.  Those less fortunate may end up as street urchins.  While the women hoping to adopt have idealistic hopes for their child, the hotel owner winces in disappointment at her 30-something son, lacking work skills and perhaps over-romanticizing his revolutionary anti-capitalist ideals. Hopefully Sayles will continue to create these films of small budget that are anything but little.
