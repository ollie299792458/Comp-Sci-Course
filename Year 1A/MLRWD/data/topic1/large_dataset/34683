It seems that this series suffers from a heavy handed effort to appeal to a narrow demographic of technology enthusiasts, specifically it seems to try to appeal to the success of the channels Modern Marvels series, and as a result the team that developed this program hammer a square peg into a round hole with two-dimensional historical figures and gross oversimplification. This "technology motif" becomes so heavy handed by the end of the series as to strain the credulity of even the most historically na√Øve. Beginning in the first episode by following a very narrow story line that is presented as a microcosm of the colonies and proceeding through successive episodes further stretching the facts so that by the final two episodes they are a presenting history so warped it is laughably absurd including my favorite that the southern economic boom was triggered by the invention of air conditioning! The facts, and worse the partial truths presented as the whole, do not support more than half of what is presented in the series - for example of the many reasons industry moved from northern states to southern states air conditioning was at best incidental, and invented decades before the boom began. What is most regrettable is that the visual production values are very high and wasted on this poorly written failure.
