After 007 aka. Roger Moore saved the world twice (in "The spy who loved me" and "Moonraker"), the legendary spy went back where he actually belongs - down to earth. And so did director John Glen. Instead of telling another absurd story, he set 007 in an realistic atmosphere, where he not only has to safe a precious code-machine from a sunken ship, but also has to keep back the beautiful and mysterious Elektra from killing the murders of her parents before she gets killed.
So much to the story - and she's good! - the rest of this great film is nothing but pure action, mixed with a little taste of humor and a slice of romance (of course). This Bond-movie also has some of the most memorable casts in the whole history of the series: From French actress Carole Bouquet to charming Topol and fierce villains Julian Glover and late Michael Gothard, everything fits perfect. And coming back to the action part - it's insane! Starting with the opening scene where Supervillain Blofeld returns and moving fast from ski chases to shark attacs to mountain climbing - YOU NAME IT, YOU GET IT!
Really, this movie hasn't lost it's fascination and ist perfect for everyone who seeks good alternatives to the boring TV-stuff.
Definitly one of the best Bonds ever - and one of the best Action-Movies!
