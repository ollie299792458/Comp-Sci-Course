Marnie is one of those movies that stays with you forever. Even if you don't absolutely love Hitchcock, this little gem is worth watching. Yes, it is suspenseful in that most unique Hitchcock way, but it's the love story that captivated me the most. The lovely Marnie (played brilliantly by Tippie Hedren) is such a complex character that viewers alternately become enthralled with, frustrated by, and inevitably heartbroken for her. Marnie has never recovered from a traumatic childhood and she remains that traumatized little girl in a woman's body. She is still a little girl desperately searching for love, only she doesn't realize it. The only love she knows is her horse. And Sean Connery as Mark Rutland. Wow! He is every girl's "Knight in Shining Armor" as he tries to come to Marnie's rescue. The expressions on Mark's face as he looks at Marnie seem so genuinely real. It seems he would do anything for Marnie to help her get better and to make her love him. Louise Latham as Marnie's mysterious mother is also excellent. A haunting, beautiful love story. Highly recommended!
