I saw flock of dodos at a screening while in college a couple of years back. At the time I was conveniently in an evolution department so there was a huge buzz around it. Needless to say, the movie made an impression on all of us. To this day I still say this is a movie that every ecologist and evolutionists needs to see to avoid the pitfalls of stubborness and just plain 'smartness'.

But at the same time, it is not a movie made for scientists only. The movie is made in such a simple and straightforward way that anyone can (and should) watch it as well, and the various GRE words definitions throughout the movie make for a very fun diversion for anyone who has had (or is) studying for that exam. There's a good deal of humor and contrary to popular belief, it is not made to insult or demean as most other movies of this genre would.

Silly as it sounds, this movie is very much worth it and I highly recommend. This now stands proudly in my dvd collection and I keep making friends watch it. So far, no one hated it.
