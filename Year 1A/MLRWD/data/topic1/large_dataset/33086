Peter Bogdanovich's "The Cat's Meow" is a picture-perfect, yet fictionalized, account of a little-known 1924 incident aboard a yacht owned by media mogul William R. Hearst. The characters were all real people, although modern audiences may not be familiar with all of their names. Doesn't matter. The story is the thing here, and it's a terrific one, driven by power, love, lust, lies, desperation and duplicity. Edward Herrmann embodies Hearst like a second skin, while Eddie Izzard channels Charlie Chaplin and Jennifer Tilly oozes her way into a delicious portrayal of famed and feared gossip maven Louella Parson. Kirsten Dunst seems just a tad too young and modern for the Marion Davies part, but she gives it her all. Cary Elwes may surprise fans who remember him more for his comedic turn in "The Princess Bride" or as the villain in "Twister."

In short: full of twists both above and below deck, "The Cat's Meow" could leave most viewers with just one complaint -- that it should have been filmed in black and white.
