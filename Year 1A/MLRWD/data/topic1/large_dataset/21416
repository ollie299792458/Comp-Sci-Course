As with all others from my generation of 80's kids, I Love this movie. This is one of THE most iconic films for both teens and younger kids, and I can only imagine that it will be clear and amazing on Bul-ray. Additionally, all these bonus goodies are fantastic for die-hard collectors, but not really necessary if you simply wish to just let the movie serve as all the awesomeness you need. The one thing I aboslutely must discredit this release for, even in spite of giving it 5 stars (solely for the movie and bonus features, as they are the same as the 2001 release), is the lame cover picture. First off, why is it that studios feel the need to change the original artwork that served as the Theatrical Release poster!? DVD releases make these cheesy cover pictures thinking they are fresh and new marketable ideas that are going to work at selling the movie. Well newsflash, this movie has a cult following (myself included) that will love the movie no matter what, but would prefer that it at least show a picture of the cast. The 2001 release wasn't a drastic deviation of the formula used for the original, but this cover is cheesy and I hate it.

Lastly, what would make this release really bitchin', is to include the out-of-print soundtrack. Seems like a no brainer, even if you omit a few songs, just include the best songs. I own the soundtrack personally (actually I own 3, they're still available and cheap in Japan), but I'd like to see other fans get that little something extra instead of a board game many are unlikely to play. I'm just saying.
