I first saw Seven Samurai late at night on PBS when flipping through the channels as a teenager.  The movie kept going and going, it was so long, but I was totally absorbed and before I knew it I had spent the whole night watching it and didn't go to bed until around 4am in the morning.  Now I'm 37 years old and it remains one of my favorite movies.  When Criterion released a DVD of the movie in 1998 I bought a copy right away.

I enjoyed watching the movie once again, and got the added benefit of Japanese film expert Michael Jeck's excellent commentary.  After reading the reviews about the higher video quality of this new Criterion release, I bought the new DVD as well and have enjoyed watching it on my 50 inch plasma.  It's worth every penny to have the best copy of this great movie.

The one thing that puzzles me though is the different subtitles on the new release.  Michael Jeck's commentary on the 1998 release was partly based around the subtitles.  For example,  in the part when three of the Samurai go and set the bandits' fort on fire and cut down the bandits as they come running out,  afterwards one of the Samurai tells Kikuchiyo "Well done" because he came up with the idea.  Mr. Jeck points out that this is actually the moment when Kikuchiyo is accepted and becomes a full fledged member of the Seven Samurai.  On the new release, according to the subtitles, the Samurai simply says "We did it."  What was the point of changing the subtitles like that?  Still, Seven Samurai is a timeless classic.
