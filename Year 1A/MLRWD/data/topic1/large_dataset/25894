This is one of the funniest and greatest films in modern American cinema. i love at the beginning when the cops tell the stoners to pull over and theyre like 'we cant pull over any farther'. you have to see that part to appreciate it cause once you do you will be using that line for years. the guy in the back trippin out cause he ate the whole bag of pot and shrooms. hes like 'the snozberries taste like snozberries'. great line.
best character is farva. hes on radio duty cause he pulled over a bus full of kids and he attacked them after they threw something at him from the window.
top 2 farva moments:
1) farva asks for a 'liter cola' and the stoner kid at the burger place is like we dont have those and when farva gets his burger and drink he tears off the game piece to see if he won and theres a whole and all the drink falls on farva and he beats the kid up and he gets suspended from duty.
2) farva brings everyone coffee during the meeting and for the rookie he writes 'stupid rookie' on his cup and puts a bar of soap inside. before he came in the rookie was singing the vermont highway patrol officer song and farva missed it so when he comes in hes like 'sing it again rookie bia*ch'.
anyways this movie rules and you should buy it cause it never gets old.
