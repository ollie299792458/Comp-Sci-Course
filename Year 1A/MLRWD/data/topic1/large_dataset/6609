This movie really had it's ups and downs.  I thought the acting was spectacular.  Paul Giamatti was a wonderful choice for Santa.  He was so sincere, and his voice is perfect for what I think Santa would sound like.  Vince Vaughn is great.  He's really good at playing that brother who is generally a schmuck, but has a couple redeeming qualities to bring you back in.  Kevin Spacey did a great job with the "bad guy" role, and he's such a chameleon that you almost forget it's him.  The person that stole the show, for me, was Bobb'e Thompson who plays "Slam."  This kid is so funny and so good you forget he's a kid.

Here's the bad part:  The story line.  Fred is a down-and-out guy who has one more scheme to make him rich, so he calls on his brother Santa.  Of course, Santa has that tug-at-your-heartstrings reaction that makes him want to help Fred, but we all know he shouldn't.  Clyde (Kevin Spacey) is sent to "review" the operation with the intention of shutting it down.  Fred is put to work to earn his "gift" from Santa, and it puts the factory in jeopardy.

I found the movie to be funny, with spectacular acting and set design.  However, the over riding theme of codependancy was sometimes a little too much to stomach.  There were times during the movie I found myself really hating Fred, and think Santa to be too big of an idiot, that I couldn't enjoy what was happening.  But because there were other really funny moments, I couldn't give this movie too bad of a review.
