... A visual feast that will leave you starving for a plot. Yikes! What a disappointment this movie was.  Visually, it is undeniably beautiful to take in, but unfortunately, it's just not enough to keep you interested. The dysfunction in this family is monumental. The emperor is poisoning his wife, but why?  By his own admission, he knew of her incestuous affair prior to poisoning her.  Why didn't he start poisoning her from the get go? He kills off his first wife (were they ever really married?) and her family but there isn't a plausible explanation as to why. Supposedly, because of his lust for power, he convinces Gong Li's father (a king no less) to give him her hand in marriage, but how?  He was a lowly captain. Why would a KING marry off his daughter to a captain.  How did he become emperor?  We find out later that his first wife did in fact survive and went on to marry the imperial doctor who showed kindness to her, unbeknownst to the emperor. How is that the emperor didn't know his own private physician's wife? It makes no sense.

In the end, all the unaswered questions were too distracting. I really wish I had rented this BEFORE I bought the DVD.
