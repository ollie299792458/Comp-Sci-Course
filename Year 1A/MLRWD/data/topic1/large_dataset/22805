It's probably billed as science fiction rather than comedy, but it fits both classifications in my opinion.  The comedy is more of the satiric make-you-smile variety than of the laugh-so-hard-you-need-to-rewind type --  sort of on a par with the humour in 'Star Trek IV' (the one with the  whales), only more of it.  This is definitely a film that doesn't take  itself too seriously.  A lot of the futuristic look appears to be borrowed  from 'Bladerunner' (the flying Oriental eatery, the monstrous Zorg  building, et cetera), but none of the associated darkness came along.  The  picture borrows thematic elements from all over the place, in fact -- even  from the 'Love Boat' -- and the result is outstanding.  Ian Holm as the  priest is hilarious, and Chris Tucker is jaw-droppingly outrageous.  And if  you didn't think the ultimate human being came in a model with hot-orange  dreadlocks, think again.  This is an excellent film to watch on a night  when you just want to settle back on the couch with some munchies,  something cold to drink, and be entertained. (But if it's milk, it might  just come out your nose, so watch out!)
