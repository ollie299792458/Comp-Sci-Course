OK Kevin, you've made your point! Yes, you are clearly one of most  interesting flimmakers out right now. I've seen all the movies and Dogma  was only an appropriate follow-up to your stream of brutally funny and  intelligent films. 
Dogma is not for the religiously up-tight or the  squeamish, it's a contraversial treat for the open-minded intellectuals who  know there's more to this experiment called Existence than meets the eye or  soul. Although sometimes Kevin Smith's films get overly talky and in this  one a tad preachy, the light of his magnificent concept is illuminated. It  has most of the usual Smith film elements, tons of vulgar dialogue and a  few consistent characters Jay and Silent Bob. Like all his films, Dogma is  very animated and has the energy and texture of comic books. This film  stirs up a religious stew and may leave many with a sour taste. It has its  moments of sheer lunacy and some may see it as simply a cartoonish  fantasia. But listen closely to the words between the words and thoughts  being provoked and you can see that this comedy on religion, God/Christ,  faith, and myth, is actually a cinematic paradigm of questioning belief  systems. Ha--llejuah!
