In a word: wierd. Which isn't too surprising since The Trial was directed by the always interesting--and iconoclastic--Orson Welles, based on a novel by Franz "Metamorphosis" Kafka and stars Anthony "Psycho" Perkins as Joseph K. (Kyle MacLachlan took on the role in the 1993 remake). 
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen Welles' The Stranger (1946) or Touch of Evil (1958) beforehand (or Citizen Kane, for that matter).  Those movies make a lot more narrative sense and represent a less difficult introduction to The World of Welles. Perkins' embodiment of the constantly beleaguered K. is more restrained than I would've thought, however, which helps to ground the film in some--very loose--semblance of normality. Welles (Albert Hastler, i.e. "The Advocate") actually gives the more bizarre performance, since he whispers the entire time. He also speaks the end credits (in a non-whisper) instead of letting the words scroll down the screen (as he also did in The Magnificent Ambersons).  The film features a number of other odd touches like that.  
According to Barbara Leaming's "Orson Welles: A Biography", it wasn't Welles' idea to adapt Kafka's book in the first place; Miguel and Alexander Salkind brought it to him as an inexpensive production since the material was in the public domain. Although Kafka never tells the reader whether K. is guilty or not (of the unnamed crime with which he's been charged), Welles does.  Which is likely to please fans of his work more than Kafka's...
