So much effort and time went into this series, it's such a pity that the main theme is a one sided and anti "white settler" agenda. We have to imagine that Kevin Costner's lead role in "Dances with Wolves", has made him an authority on the history of the Native American peoples.
This series gave us the highly sanitized version of the lives of Native Americans; peaceful, down to earth types, totally in touch with nature and their Creator.  Left out was the brutality of some of the plains indians and tribes of the South West, where rape pillage and torture were the accepted way of life.
We were told of some horrendous and unjustified massacres of Native Americans for example, at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, but where was mention of the atrocities committed by Native Americans during the period from Jamestown to Wounded Knee?
Serious students of history know that only after researching many and varied sources, can they make credible comment on their subject.
Getting objective and accurate history from Hollywood is much like learning English Literature from a Marvel Comic. 500 Nations is certainly not objective, nor is it accurate due to its omissions.
