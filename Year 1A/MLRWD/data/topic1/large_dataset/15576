This is a classic 80's vampire movie. In this some times comical movie, we follow Charlie Brewster, a typical horror movie loving teen, and his friends with their normal teen lives. Normal, that is, until some one moves into the old house next door and decides to "fix the place up." Charlie notices some strange goings on next door, and poor Charlie, no one believes him. Not his Mom, his girlfriend Amy, or best friend, "Evil" Ed. And good luck trying to explain to the police what he sees them carrying into the cellar. And the whole time, the vampire is on his trail. This is my fav horror movie, and probably one of my favs period. I love Chris Sarandons role in this movie, he is like the ultimate vampire. He is sultry, and sensual. Every one in this movie did such a great job, I totally love this movie. I know just about every line, and never tire of it. Scary, and might have you waking from a nightmare needing some hot cocoa! But watch out, the microwave never melts the marshmallows right!
