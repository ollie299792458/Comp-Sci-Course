Ed Zwick's "Glory" is a compelling, memorable film. On the surface, it's the historical telling of the Union's first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts, and its role in the War Between the States (or, as my southern friends refer to it, "The Late Unpleasantness"). Beneath the gritty surface, finely woven strands of discord intertwine. There's the unease between the new regiment and its bigoted Union counterparts (led by Cary Elwes, thoroughly unlikeable in a fine performance), and the tension and distrust amid the former slaves themselves, as crystallized in two excellent performances (what else is new?) by Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. Freeman, as Sgt. Major Rawlins, butts heads with Washington's bitter Trip in a battle for the minds and allegiances of their fellow soldiers. Self-determination is at the heart of this latter-day morality play, and the issues--particularly those broached by Freeman's character--are still pertinent today. Freddie Francis won an Oscar for his cinematography. The film is visually stunning, with horrific battle sequences. Excellent Grammy-winning score by James Horner. Denzel won a Best Supporting Oscar; too bad Morgan couldn't have received one as well. Matthew Broderick also gives a fine performance as the 54th's leader, Col. Shaw. Based on Shaw's letters home, "Glory" honorably represents a fascinating chapter of American history. It's certainly worth seeing, and the DVD is a must for any collection.
