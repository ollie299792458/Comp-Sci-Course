Along came polly is about  a guy who is going to an island for his honeymoon with his wife. It was going well and they decided to get scuba lessons. Well Mike (Ben Stiller) went off to take a break leaving his wife with the sexy scuba instructor, a awhile later he comes back to get his wife. He walks in to find his wife and the scuba teacher were doing it. In a mad rage ben gets off that island and his wife dumps him before he dumps her. So after the first day on their honeymoon they dump each other. He comes home to his new house they bought. After that he was all scared to try something new. Untill polly came along. Polly, (Jennifer Aniston) was in ben's middle school together and were close friends until jen moved to Michigan. She came back to the City. And ben's friend named Sandy was trying to help ben out. Ben was trying to get Jen to like him by saying he liked stuff he really did not like. Then ben's wife came back hoping he would let her have another chance. Of course he said no and moved on. Jen was scared that ben was going to propose, and she did not want that to happen, so she was going to move. But she left her pet ferret behind and came back to get it. Then ben got her, and found out she did not want to married to him. He did not care, and they vacationed on the same island that he broke up with his wife. And stayed there. The End. Along came polly was a really funny movie, and had alot of crumy jokes. And the romance was a little chessey. But who care its a good movie. I give it a 4 out of 5.
