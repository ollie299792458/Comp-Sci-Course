If ever there was a filmmaker/musician who deserved to fail and fail miserbly, it was Troy Duffy (of the Miramax buys him a bar fame)...and fail miserable he does in this amazing doc made by two of his friends.  I use the word "friends" losely, because as it becomes obvious in the film's opening minutes, Duffy is so rude and unlikeable that I truly doubt he can have actual friends.  When given a golden opportunity, instead of working 24/7, Duffy chooses instead to drink and drink and drink some more, all the while publicly mouthing off about half the powerplayers in Hollywood.  This is so the text book example of how NOT to behave.  Duffy becomes truly delusional by the end of the film, talking as if he were the most brilliant musician/filmmaker of all time, and mouthing off how no one understands his genius.  His abusive treatment of his brother and the two guys who co-managed his band (who were also the two who made the doc - brilliant move there!) is especially telling.  He treats everyone around him like crap, and it comes back not only to bite him, but to rip out his jugular.  Talk about a satisfying ending!  This is a GREAT MOVIE!  I hope Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith have a long career making films, and that they keep going back for a celebratory drink wherever it is that Duffy now works, just to rub his nose in it.
