Don't you hate it when a perfectly good, brainless action movie suddenly goes so awfully bad, sloppy and poor that it just ruins the rest of the flick for you?  This is a very dumb movie, but the special effects are a delight, and we were having such a good time watching them when -- the wolves showed up.  Okay.  Poorly animated.  Typical Red-Riding Hood vicious.  No clue on the part of the writers that a trio of tame zoo wolves would see people as part of their pack -- and probably alpha members of that pack -- rather than as food.  And why would wolves bother eating live people when there were piles of dead human flesh all over the place?  These domestic howls would have been more likely to run up to the humans they found with their tails and heads down, whimpering, "Feed us!  Feed us!"  And the wolf animation was... well, in 1987, it would have been forgiveable.  But now?  There's no excuse for this sort of second-string slop.  I really do take it personally when a film obviously sniffs, "Well, that's good enough for YOU -- you don't know any better."  We were frankly offended by having the rest of a perfectly good rotten action movie ruined for us.  It was worse than if the film had been bad from the beginning.  And our library spent perfectly good money to buy this clunker!  Pft.
