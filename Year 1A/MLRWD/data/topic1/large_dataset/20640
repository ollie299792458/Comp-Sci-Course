This movie really can only work if you take a good long look at yourself and your emotions and the way you experience and act on them, and then see the film.  Because I truly don't think that this is a film to get if you just want to be entertained.  Teddy (the robot's talking stuffed-bear) and the special effects aside, it REALLY isn't an entertaining movie...
But it raises interesting questions about love.  What is it?  What creates it?  It really is only a feeling, you know?  Why is it more genuine in us than in that robot? Just think... if something feels love, how can it NOT be considered alive?  What is really the difference between a robot and a human at that point?  They're just made of different systems...
So if you're willing to get a little philosophical, I'd reccomend this film for sure.  
And just to answer to a few of the major complaints I've seen-- yes I agree, this movie was TOO long!  But I thought that the last bit was really good if you're the least bit empathetic with this kid who has wanted his mother for so long... 
And as for the "aliens" in the end-- I was under the impression that they were highly HIGHLY advanced A.Is!  I think that makes it a WAY more interesting ending than if it's just some creatures who zoom in from nowhere.  No... I think the OH SO superior human race couldn't survive on the earth at somepoint, and the A.Is could and did.  Make sense?
