I rented this DVD for my daughters and wound up watching it myself before it was returned.  It was FABULOUS!
I'm utterly thrilled that the producers agreed to make this teen movie and keep it rated PG.  The love story was great, but even better were the portrayals of Mandy Moore as Jamie--a "religious geek" who sticks to her standards despite what the high-school in-crowd thinks or does--and Shane West as Landon--a "big-man-on-campus" who ultimately discovers that there is more to life than fun.  Both performances were believable and realistic; the chemistry between Moore and West helped move the story forward.
The film's ending is a bit abrupt(I want to read the book and find out what I missed), and although the storyline finishes somewhat sadly, I think it does so in the most positive way possible.  I also think this film is a great example  (from, hard as it STILL is to believe, Hollywood!?!) of how faith and personal integrity help a person get through the trials of life.  As Jamie once says, "We need pain to help us learn compassion." (Or something like that!)
I recommend this to EVERYONE (I think even guys wouldn't mind it).  I generally don't buy DVDs, but this is one I'm definitely getting for our family labrary.
Enjoy!
