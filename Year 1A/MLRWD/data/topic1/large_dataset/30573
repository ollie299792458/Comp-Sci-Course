Without a doubt my favourite animated film and suprisingly it is not made by Disney but Fox Pictures.

Although it does not follow the factual history of what happened to Anastasia Romanov and her family it is a heart warming tale of courage, love and a quest to find something that was lost but eventually found.

The voice talents throughout the film include those of John Cusack, Meg Ryan and Kirsten Dunst.

With this double disc edition it also features 'The Sequel' Bartok The Magnificent but buyers beware this does not centre around Anastasia at all it is quite a poor attempt at a children's film not that you could expect greatness from a direct to video animated feature.

So if viewers want to buy it for the magical movie Anastasia and wish to view special features regarding it, I support your decision 100%  But don't buy it just because of the fact of having the poorly done sequel accompanying it.

I hope viewing the film awakens a yearning to find out more about Anastasia Romanov.
