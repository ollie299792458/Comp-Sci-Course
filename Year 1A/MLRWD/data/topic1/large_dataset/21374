Despite the bad reviews (many of them came before the orginal film was even released) and despite a despotic director (Michael Cimino single-handedly brought down United Artists), Heaven's Gate in the orginal  3 hour 40 minute wide screen is perhaps the best american western ever  made, and ranks in the top ten of american films. Seen in its enitirety,  again despite the reviews, there is a magnificent story told here: of  Cattle Barrons, Immigrants, of Lawmen and Outlaws, and although the story's  characters (for the most part) are heavily fictionalized, the core story is  absolutely true, based on a book, banned in Wyoming for many years entited  "The Banditi of the Plains". Of note is the incredible  cinematography, superb acting-especially William Hurt and Christopher  Walken, spectacular art direction and a set that is immense. 
Heaven's  Gate never got the chance to be seen in theaters the way the Cimino had  envisioned it, but in widescreen video it comes close. Pay particular  attention to the internal rythms that Cimino and his editor have built into  this film!
Give it chance-it pales anything that Leone, Ford, Hawks and  Hathaway have made-but it is different, more of a foreign film than  american in style and structure. ENJOY!
