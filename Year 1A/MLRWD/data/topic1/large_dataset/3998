I got the DISpleasure of watching this DVD as a gift. I was originally excited to watch it due to the near-universally good reviews from viewers and critics alike for the 'rated' version of Bad Santa.

This version, I feel, is a great illustration of how skillfull scene selection, editing, and cutting, can vastly improve a movie. This version has a lot of more racy stuff that won't be found in the rated version of Bad Santa that was widely released in theatres. Unfortuantely, this also completely changes the tone of the movie. When you get to actually see some of the implied bad behavior of Bad Santa in its full glory, instead of chuckling at his bad behavior, you start to feel disgusted. Why would you possibly root for such a horrible person? In the rated version, we get the sense that he's more of an unfortunately placed individual who ends up in a lousy role, but with the unrated version, when you can actually see some of his misogynistic and pedophiliac behavior up close and personal, you stop laughing at all those bad behavior jokes and start to feel a bit sick.

I actually saw this version first, and thought the lead character and movie was so poor I quit 3/4 the way through. After reading the reviews on Rotten Tomato which were near universally solid, I rewatched it on cable as the broadcast version. By eliminating those over-the-top bad behavior scenes, the movie was vastly improved. It took me awhile to forget about the unrated version, but about halfway through, it became clear that the rated version was a far more balanced and better version.
