I now have HTWWW on three different media-- Laser, DVD, and BluRay.  The coming together of BluRay, Digitizing, and BluRay is simply dazzling.  I hoped, but never really believed, the movie could be "fixed" for home viewing-- but it is.
There are some scenes where the vertical join lines can be seen.  But, you know, that kind of reminds you that this is an almost fifty year old movie shot in an analog world-- the lines recall the way the film was made.
Some will complain that the movie should not have been digitized to remove the lines.  Nonsense.  If the original film makers had had the option to have lines or not have lines, which do you think they would have chosen?  Same with black and white.  I firmly believe in the concept of "colorizing" films that should have been in color, but either for financial reasons or because color had not been invented then (Things to Come comes to mind) were filmed in B&W.  (Of course, no one has yet come up with a decent method of colorizing.)
I won't comment on the story of How the West Was Won-- you either like it or you don't.  It is a magnificent film, in its way similar to Mike Todd's Around the World in 80 Days, and, yes, Titanic.  Blockbusters all.
