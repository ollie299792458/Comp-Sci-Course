It is always easy to write a film review about a really bad film because there are so many things you can point to that don't work. In The Weatherman, veteran actor Michael Caine tries desperately to hide his cockney accent (it doesn't work); quirky actor Nicolas Cage wants his acting to be taken seriously (it isn't) and the vacuous script can not decide if it is comedy or drama (it is neither).

Director Gore Verbinski is obviously more comfortable when he knows his genre. He made huge successes of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. He just could not grasp trying to make a film where the actors are not caricatures: where characters are supposed to have genuine depth and are realistically generating true emotion.

There are many asides that are supposed to have meaning: Spritz (the weatherman) keeps getting hit with fast food. Is this supposed to demonstrate that the characters life is less than other people's garbage? Or is it-- as it comes across-- vapid and disingenuous.

So, the asides are phony, the acting is abysmal, the dialogue is absolutely shallow and at times downright stupid. Spritz's monologue trying to demonstrate his thought patterns will make you want to shout enough!

The movie did not fare well at the box-office, despite the big names associated with it. I've got a few names for the film, but viewable is not one of them.
