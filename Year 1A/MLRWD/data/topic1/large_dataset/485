The Odyssey  is a great educational aid.  The movie is a great explanation of the story of Odysseus (Armand Assante).  If I would have read the translated story in a book, I really wouldn't understand the story at all.  Odysseus has great preserverence.  HIs family has even more, considering the fact that after 7 years of war and 10 more years after that, they still believe Odysseus will return.  Penelope, (Greta Scacchi) Odysseus' wife, never gave up on Odysseus, and kept the promise he asked of her the day he left for war.  Telemachus (Alan Stenson) did his best in walking in his father's footsteps.  It was hard to name Odysseus as the only protaganist, because Penelope was also a main character.  After viewing this movie, I have a better understanding of why the writer Homer would write a poem about the adventures of Odysseus.  I have a better understanding of why the greeks had polytheism.  In the movie, it shows how strong polytheisn was. When Odysseus' son, Telemachus is born, he shouts out, "The the gods and Penelope. . ." .  During the movie Athena (Isabella Rosellini) appears to give Odysseus and Penelope her wisdom.  The movie also shows how olives were pressed for olive oil in those days.  I thought that was pretty interesting , knowing that the Greeks used olives in practically all  their food.  Overall, The Odyssey was a unit on Greece all by itself.
