I think by now, most people have a pretty good idea what The Voyage Home is about. (Kirk and Crew travel back in time to find some Whales to save the future.)
So lets get down to the details. This is a great movie. It's one of Star Trek's finest outings on the big screen. It's considered by many to be one of the best Trek movies. I'd give the movie itself 5 stars, but the transfer isn't all it's cracked up to be. The transfer of STIII:TSFS seems, to me, to be far greater than this one. If you view it on a small set, you might not notice it, but pop this baby in a state of the art 52" HDTV plasma screen, and you start to notice tons of annoying little [things] that could have easily been taken care of if they had paid a bit more attention, money, and detail to restoring this great movie by giving it the treatment it deserves. Paramount obviously feels they can just cut corners though, and the target audience will eat it up anyway. (Which, I guess, was likely spot on...) But it's a shame that they didn't. The Voyage Home deserved better. The Commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner is a great addition however, and does give you a nice reason to view it a second time, and the other extras on the second disc are all pretty decent and standard stuff for the Special Edition ST DVD's.
