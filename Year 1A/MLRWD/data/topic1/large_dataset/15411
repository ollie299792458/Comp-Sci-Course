UPDATE 5/15/09: I bought the disc, and have now watched both movies in the package and the special features.
The Blu-Ray Disc itself: Top-notch, with every feature you want in a Bu-Ray disc. and if you're planning on getting this DON'T BUY THE ORIGINAL! It's included in this package! Picture quality on the new movie is fantastic. Sharp, detailed, and no grain. It's like you are there. Special features are great, lots of "Making of", type stuff, and a preachy "being green" behind the scenes that isn't too boring. The remastered original looks and sounds probably better than it did in 1951. Film artifacts are pretty much gone (hair, blotches, etc.), and the sound is fairly clear. Remember though, it was made in 1951, so the source material has limitations. I watched the original one night, then popped in the new movie the following night. I thought they did a good job of trying to associate it with the original (Gort could have been more modern, but being a humanoid is a nod to the original movie, etc). You can see where they tried to tie it to the original, and yet update it for the present society, standards, and technologies. The original wouldn't have been a match for today's technology. Also, a Klaatu as personable as the original would not fly in the remake. Keanu is playing an alien in a foreign (human) body, and maintains it well. Now I'm reviewing the movie, so on with the movie review!

The Movie: I will definitely buy this when it comes out, or soon after (I did), so that should tell you how much I liked this movie (I saw it 3 times in the theater, once in iMax with my brother). I've seen both the original and this one. They did take a lot of license in updating this, and I applaud their boldness. If you haven't seen the original, see this one first, and then see the original. Your perspective may see them as just two different movies with similar stories and characters. This is what I saw. Seeing them in this order will also help you avoid the emotional snag that nostalgia can cause (as a stand alone movie, I found it outstanding). It has the foreboding doom of The Happening or War of the Worlds (I liked the latter original and remakes a lot as well; if that helps you in weighing my opinion), but with a global take and shots of events around the world. This at least isn't a hollywood story like Independence Day (Which I really liked too), but has more realism, and..

**POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW**
*#*#*#*#*#*#* it doesn't get tied up in a perfect bow at the end like Independence Day or other modern or classic apocalyptic movies. I felt very connected to the main characters too. The ending didn't leave me feeling relieved, but rather sorry for one of the main characters, and all the mayhem left behind by the alien's self-cloning nano-tech destruction bugs (nice take on technology, in a style similar to Michael Crichton's Prey or John Robert Marlow's Nano). #*#**#*#*#*#*#*#**#*#*#*#*#*#*
