When O Brother came into theaters last year I thought it looked pretty cool. But when the critics started trashing it, I decided that I was going to wait untill it came to DVD.This Friday while at work,I got pretty interested in the film when I saw that the DVD's were selling like hotcakes. So I said what the heck and bought the last one. Boy were the critics wrong! This is a superb movie. It is rich and vibrant with color along with humor and a great story. Since it was based on the Odyssey by Homer, (which we read in Englis class), I found it fun figuring out who all the charachters were. Not only is this film fun, clever, and exciting, but it also has a deeper, less notable undelaying theme mocking todays society. I hope you go out and buy this movie no matter what anybody says. The only problem with this film is some of the charachtor's southern accents are hard to understand (me being from connecticut and all) so I had to turn on the sub-titles one in a while. But otherwise A damn good movie. I learned only one thing out of all of this. Screw the critics, just go with your gut feeling.
