Once in a way you can a movie which is truly path breaking - it breaks all rules, all dimensions and creates a genre of its own.  Borat is one such movie.

If you still have not watched the movie, buy this DVD and watch it - it does not require hi-fi sound systems or graphics, but just any dumb TV.

If you watch the movie, not only will be laughing during the movie, but the movie scenes will keep coming back to you and you will laugh again, you will discuss with friends, watch borat video clips on youtube, read about borat on the internet and keep laughing again and again - let me tell you it is endless.  But you need to have the taste for this kind of comedy - if you like movies like Austin powers, good chances are that you will like this movie, even though it is a of totally different kind.

After you see the movie and had lot of funs, once you know that major sections of the movie were shot with real people without their knowledge that they are getting into this major motion picture - on one side you pity those poor people and on the other side, you will want to watch the movie again and see if he really fooled those people that well and also got these sane people to sign agreements that it was ok for them to filmed.

Something which you have read/watch

In youtube, there are a couple of videos which did not really make it into the movie - look for the video where borat goes for hunting, Borat on David letterman - very funny videos.
