This film does a few things that I found immensly unusual, interesting and praiseworthy.  
First off, although the scenes in which the main character, B-Rabbit (Eminem), turns the put-downs of his race to his advantage are both flamboyant and hilarious, the movie itself frames the anti-white racism that working-class whites routinely encounter in the same matter-of-fact style with which most of us working-class whites have learned to handle it.  
Secondly, the hero-journey here is just one of the steps along the way to success, not the customary last big push before the talented but poor protaganist makes it out of the ghetto/trailer park. After B-Rabbit walks away from "flippin' the script" on his rap rivals, he's still in the ghetto. But, now, just a little bit better prepared to handle the challenges ahead.
Last, but not least, I enjoyed the portrayal of today's young love. The gritty Gen-Xer kind. The kind that can evolve into a "I-love-you-so-much-that-I-know-when-to-flip-you-off-and-walk-away" type of love. And no, I'm not being sarcastic.
