Firstly can I just say Octavius doesn't know what he's talking about. The plot here is not ridiculous, yes this sort of thing may not happen very often in real life but its a movie....DUH! This film is not perverse in any way, they have a father daughter relationship, what is perverse about this? Her real Dad didn't care about her so she looked to Leon as a father figure and Leon was a loner who had no family and meeting Mathilda, as he said, gave him a thurst for life and he didn't want to be a killer any more, so your point that he shouldn't care about the girl is ridiculous, everyone is capable of loving & caring for someone no matter what you do for a living. And you say he isn't professional? Did you see the way he killed people? Or were you watching a different movie?

This is one of the best movies ever, I can watch it again & again, its so moving. The acting is superb, Jean Reno, Natalie  Portman, Gary Oldman & Danny Aiello give phenominal performances. Video quality is excellent with some really nice shots of NYC.
