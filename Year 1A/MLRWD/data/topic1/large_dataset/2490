Disclaimer: This is not a "The Story Begins With..." movie.  The plot is incidental.  No one dies, discovers themselves, becomes a man/woman through struggle, or learns how true love feels.  'Dude, Where's My Car?' has a more solidly aligned plot.  Tax, tags, title extra.
Everyone should have that one friend who is overly sarcastic with bone-dry wit.  If you do not, then you may not have an appreciation for this movie.  Broken Lizard has assembled numerous scenes forced into a poor "boy meets girl" and "corrupt law enforcement" plotline.  These scenes are individually funny, proving that this is simply top-notch sketch comedy.  Each "joke" is simply a razor-sharp wit battle between characters (minus Farva) that doesn't wait for the laugh track to kick in.  
There is no plot synopsis because there is no plot.  Unfortunately, some people who have seen this are inflicted with Smartest Guy in the Room syndrome (a rare infliction which forces the sufferer to see his/her opinion as correct and the 100 opposing opinions as incorrect.)  If you don't like the content of "R" rated material, don't see this.  If you require 2 hours of pre-recorded audio and video to change your life, look elsewhere.  If you have that friend that never smiles, yet leaves all around him/her in tears and cramping, buy this movie.  As another viewer deftly observes, it gets funnier each time.  Soon, you too will be offering moustache rides to acquaintances and fitting "Meow" into unknown song lyrics and conversations.  Fare thee well.
