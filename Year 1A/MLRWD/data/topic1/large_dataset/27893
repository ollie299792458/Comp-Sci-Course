Despite its being over 30 years old, this recording is quite possibly the best one available.  AND the DG engineers did a super job restoring it.  The sound and the picture are both very very good.  The singers... where I begin?  They're all downright phenomenal.  Price and Cossotto both have incredibly creamy soaring voices.  While very different in timbre, they blend with astounding beauty.  Just look at their faces -- they are so clearly inspired by the Higher power, it's a pure joy to watch! Nicolai Ghiaurov is truly The voice of God here, his immense basso used to earth-shattering effect. To top it off, this video has very young Luciano Pavarotti singing with rare sensitivity and real feeling.  Back then, Pavarotti was a relative newcomer, while the rest of the principals were already well-established singers.  But, while no doubt aware of it, he really focused on the music and his fresh lyric tenor rings with silvery brilliance.
Von Karajan is shown at his best here.  You can clearly see the care for the singers and for the music, and his obvious enjoyment is a pleasure to behold. Don't delay in getting this DVD!
