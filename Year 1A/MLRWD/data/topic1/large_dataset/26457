Okay so 'smart, fun and awesome' doesn't tell you too much, but Wonder Woman is one of the most impressive direct-to-DVD animated features I've seen and if you are a fan of superheroes or animation, I whole heartedly recommend this disc. The animation is fantastic, a step up from 'Justice League', and the story is complex, smart and really entertaining. At first I wasn't overly impressed with the voice acting, but then I realized how perfectly the actors voices represent the characters. Keri Russel as Diana may come off sounding wooden at first, but then you see that she really does sound like a strong warrior who needs to be warmed up a bit by Nathan Fillion's character. He does a great job at the red-blooded, all American male role and the chemistry between the two characters crackles and pops with sexual tension and humorous banter that makes for a fun romantic comedy. The action in this feature is compelling and it flows nicely with the plot, never dragging out or anything.
I was never a fan of the Wonder Woman character before I saw this movie but now I am and I have become compelled to re-watch Justice League and the like because of this. A truly exciting DVD movie that is filled with love and heart by its creators. Rent it, buy it, whatever. I think you'll really like this one.
