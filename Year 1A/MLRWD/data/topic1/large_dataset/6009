I rented this, based on several freinds saying it was a great movie.  This sort of film is not usually my type, but I decided to see it based on one particular strong recommendation.
Well, needless to say, I was totally blown away.  Jamie Bell's performance was superb, and his emotional roller coaster ride was extremely convincing.  His dancing was also top notch.
The characters did a great job with the hopeless feeling of a struggling town, and the awful effect of the strike on the town's inhabitants.
I laughed and cried, as Billy finally breaks free, and his father finally breaks down and admits that maybe he should give his kid a chance.  The scene in the coal yard with Billy's older brother and dad was a serious tear jerker, and showed a previously unseen tender side to a really nasty dad.
If I have to complain about anything on this DVD is the over all sound quality, and the very difficult to understand dialect.  There were a few times I had to hit the repeat button to understand what had been said.
However, this did not stop me from enjoying the superb movie.  This DVD will now join my growing DVD library on a permanent basis!!!!
