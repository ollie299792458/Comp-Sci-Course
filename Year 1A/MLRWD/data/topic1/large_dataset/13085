Very interesting but many facts omitted. To be fair, it's possible they were simply trying to avoid the series being 85 hours ;-) There are many facts here, and just as much coverage of what a given expert thinks and feels. When you can tell the political stripe of a historian, it's a red flag.

For example, the man dominate in discussing Bill Clinton practically gushed as well as giving him credit for things he did not do. The same man was the main expert in judging George W Bush - he clearly hates him. It makes me wonder what else this documentary has glossed over and slanted. Maybe, maybe not, but when sold as history, I want history not personal opinions and theories.

To be fair I should note I'm Conservative and am probably equally slanted the other way. But I listen to all. I didn't fast-forward through Bill Clinton now did I? ;-)

Overall though I'd say buy this set, as well as "Founding Brothers" and "Founding Fathers" also from History Channel. They are great. Who knew Samuel Adams wore the same red suit everyday?
