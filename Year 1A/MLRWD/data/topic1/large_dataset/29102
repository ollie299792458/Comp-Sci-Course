I am a confessed Smallville fan and believe that the show has gotten better with each passing year, with the acception of certain forced romances, but I digress.

The DVD really isn't that good. Included are the following features, a documentary of the Green Arrow and how he's developed in the comics, a documentary of sorts about fans of Smallville and the Oliver Queen Chronicles for sprint phones and the Justice and Doom deal that occurred during the season.

Aside from that, some of the episodes boast deleted scenes but that's it! Zero! Zip! Nada! Nothing more! There were good episodes that I would have liked to have had commentary on. Arrow, Labyrinth, Justice, Noir, Phantom, Zod but there are none! Also, there aren't any other blooper reels or any behind the scenes sort of features like they've had with previous seasons.

While a good season, the DVD just doesn't measure up to how I would have liked. While I would definately recommend the season and the series to see a re-envisioning of the Superman mythos I can't recommend the DVD at the current prices. Wait for it to come down a little more in price because there just aren't enough special features to warrant a $40 purchase right now.
