like another reviewer said somewhere, a director could tell christian bale to stare at a wall for two hours and he'd pull it off somehow. like the taxi driver review says, this film is far from "training day 2" despite the similar backdrop of l.a.'s seedier areas and is more of a commentary on the effects of war when it comes to an already morally ambiguous person. the other characters talk about how "chill" he used to be before joining up for a tour or two in what he calls "trashcanistan". as he is drawn slowly toward his violent past and rejected by the l.a. police (for - guess what - a sketchy psych evaluation), his mental state starts to return to an instinctual and heartless automaton. his friends, his beautiful mexican girlfriend that he wants to move stateside, himself - they're all fair game when the feds offer him a job messing around in colombia.

that's pretty much the plot - this ex-soldier guy and his never-soldier friend both get "real" jobs and decide to celebrate their postponed adulthood by drinking, smoking pot and occasionally jacking a drug dealer or two. when it goes downhill, it goes downhill FAST.

like i said, for all this film's flaws (and it has a few) bale pretty much nails the character of an ex-military dork with a little frat boy and a little hick thrown in for flair. he acts like a jerk at his job interview and gets some good laughs in the process...he snaps and you can see true anger in his face - he's doing "crazy" without getting stuck in "patrick bateman" crazy or "the machinist" crazy.

i'd recommend it, but don't expect perfection...just a great watch with some wicked performances all around.
