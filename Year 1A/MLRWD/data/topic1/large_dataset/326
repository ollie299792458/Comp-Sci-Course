A wonderfully engaging translation of several of Mrs. Gaskell's novellas to the screen.  While the knitting together of the stories isn't as perfect as the the knitting of the residents of Cranford, it does very well.

The central characters of the story, set in mid-nineteenth century England, are two spinster daughters of a clergyman, Dorothea and Mathilda Jenkyns (Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty to you!)  Even though Miss Jenkyns is of a forceful nature (and beautifully portrayed by Eileen Atkins), it is dear shy Miss Matty  (Dame Judi Dench) who dominates events because of the respect everyone feels for her sweet nature. They and their neighbors must contend with the changes associated with the disconcerting transformation of rural Britain by the Industrial Revolution, as well as with the inherent challenges of life.  The ladies face poverty, death, servant problems, love, wandering cows, evil stepmothers, and questions of attire with aplomb, assisted by a few brave men:  the frank and winning Captain Brown; Mr. Morgan, the doctor, and Mr. Harrison, the doctor's new young partner, who has recently set the hearts of all the village maidens aflutter.  At a distance reigns the aging but elegant Lady Ludlow and her steward Mr. Carter, who must decide how to deal with a local poacher and his bright and capable young son, and how to pay the mortgage on the estate.

This series is wonderfully acted and beautifully produced--really a living window on a vanished life.  Each character grows and develops, sometimes in unexpected ways--sometimes funny and sometimes poignant.  The most winning thing was the way in which, as much as they contended and struggled with each other at times, the ladies always faced real emergencies with utter kindness.

Very, very enjoyable.
