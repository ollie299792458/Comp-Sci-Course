Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy are masters of subtle humor.  Their movies do not have the in-your-face/big puchline type jokes.  This is why their movies are generally released to "Art Houses" rather than the Hollywood Colossal-Plex theaters.  Best in Show is the latest installment in the "mockumentary" genre created by Guest.  Best in Show is more like Waiting for Guffman than This is Spinal Tap.  Like Guffman, Best in Show introduces the characters one-by-one during Act I.  You learn that each character has his own flaw (or flaws), and each has a quirky history.  What I love about the characters in Guest/Levy's films is that great care is gone in to creating them.  There are no "throw away" characters.  It's obvious that these guys love the roles they created.  I loved Spinal Tap and Guffman and this film fits in the genre beautifully.  I wouldn't say that this humor is for everyone.  This is very much unlike "Ace Ventura" or "Scary Movie."  Jokes develop slowly but have big yet subtle pay-offs.  I eagerly await the DVD and Guest/Levy's next installment!
