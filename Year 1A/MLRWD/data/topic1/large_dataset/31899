Ill skip the synopsis; everyone else seems to have laid it out well enough.
One of my favorite aspects of the film is the dialogue.  This movie is full of memorable expressions; its one of the most quoteable films out there.  The dialogue is short and concise, and the characters manage to carve themselves out within it.  But thats not whats so remarkable about it.  The cool part is, half the dialogue is unspoken. Most of the time the two protagonists dont even speak to each other, the communicate with demeanor, not so much facial expressions and body language, but they make it clear to each other and the audience exactly what theyre saying, wordlessly.
The ending may be predictable, but the closing monologue, like the rest of the script, is fantastic.  And i wonder how many of you people who didnt like it, and even those who did, know whats really going on in the film.  Theres a backstory here thats never quite revealed, but is fairly obvious.  I suggest you all watch it again, and really watch it.
