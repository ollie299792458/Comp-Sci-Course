Raw Deal stars Dennis O'Keefe as Joe Sullivan; a crook doing prison time for a robbery masterminded by crime boss Rick Coyle (played by Raymond Burr). Coyle helps Sullivan to break out of prison with the promise of $50,000 (his share of the loot), which awaits him at a rendesvous several hours to the south. Sullivan does not know that Coyle plans to double-cross him for the money if he isn't killed in the escape attempt. Sullivan's girlfriend Pat (Claire Trevor) drives the get away car to his lawyer's secretary's apartment to get out of sight for a while. They kidnap the secretary Ann (Marsha Hunt)and take her car and head south. Ann tries to talk Sullivan into surrendering but he won't consider it. The girlfriend Pat hurts her ankle on the trip, so she stays in a motel while Sullivan & Ann go to the rendesvous seeking his cut of the robbery loot. Sullivan walks into an ambush and is badly beaten at the rendesvous but Ann saves him by shooting one of the ambushers. Sullivan and Ann realize that they love each other but he releases her and puts her in a car heading home. Pat & Sullivan escape and go to San Francisco preparing to go to South America, but Sullivan's desire for revenge against Coyle won't let him merely flee. Pat finds out that the bad guys have Ann but she resists telling Sullivan until they are on the boat ready to go. Sullivan runs to rescue Ann shooting his way through a gauntlet of armed hoods and having a climactic battle with Coyle while Coyle's apartment burns. Ann gets free, but in typical noir fashion Sullivan "doesn't make it". This film was directed by Anthony Mann and it is really good film noir with lots of foggy night scenes - conflicted, dark characters great starkly lit camera work and of course violence. The image and sound quality is really good. I give it an "A" !
