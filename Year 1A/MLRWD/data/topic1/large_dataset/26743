Since we have been over exposed to shark attacks in film since Spielberg's Jaws in the seventies, after a number of years I did not think I really needed a shark movie to know that it is summertime.  In a vacuum containing no other shark movies, I might rate this film with 1 more star, but that is not the case, and the best I can do is three stars which I regard as generous.  Perhaps if we could give sharks a rest from cinematic portrayals, we could learn to like shark thrillers once again.  So far, the annual shark movie has outlived its entertainment value.  In the meantime, I think one shark movie every 5 years should be sufficient for all of the adult needs for such a film and would also satisfy adolescent needs for fear and gore.  My recommendation is that this is an average film and if you have not experienced one of the shark films released in the last few years, it probably would not hurt for you to see how desperate Hollywood has become.  I could have been just as happy not viewing the latest version of shark genre but cannot say what alternative might provide the same excitement. I can understand the lack of excitement of other subjects Hollywood has come up with that exceed the thrilling shark movie even though I think it has been overdone.
