The first thing that struck me about this movie was the cinematography.  Treating the movie as his canvas, the director use of a variety of colors made this a visually-pleasing movie to watch.
The movie borrows heavily from Aliens, which really set a high standard for the action sci-fi genre. This movie falls short due to a lack of strong characters. With the exception of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the characters are pretty forgetful. Although your appreciation for their performances may increase with repeated viewings, your appreciation for the movie will probably drop. But I look forward to more work from Diesel, who plays a convincing tough guy. In fact, I didn't really appreciate the movie until watching the featurette with commentary from Hauser, Diesel and the director. One of the most enjoyable DVD commentaries I've heard.
The real treat of the movie is the special effects.  Without a doubt, the crash in the opening scene is best I've seen. Kinda reminded me of the plane crash scene in Fight Club. The aliens move with frightening realism, and some of their attack scense will make you wince.  All in all, Pitch Black is not the best of its genre, but it's noteworthy and deserving of a rental, if not a purchase.
