I liked the premise of this movie when I first heard of it and it made me think that this would be an extremely disturbing and fascinating film. The problem is that while the director does manage to make the premise of a partially dead baby that survives on blood believable, he fails at depicting human interaction and at scene transitions, especially in the first act and the last 5 minutes of the film. The direction has this weird quirk were people are talking but the camera does not show you the face of the character who is talking, and when it does show you someone's face in a conversation, they look bored. The foreshadowing and symbolism are way to heavy handed for a narrative driven film.  None of the characters act rationally except maybe Vivian and Patricia, which would make sense because they have all been through a traumatic event when Madison's husband, who apparently does not have any emotions, dies in a car accident along with the unborn baby Grace, except that none of the characters act rationally before the accident either. This movie looks like it was originally two hours long but the studio cut it down to 84 minutes in post-production, because it has no scene transitions and just shows us events that only vaguely have anything to do with each other and sometimes resorts to showing us images that don't even seem to serve any purpose.  These directing quirks, along with the interesting but bizarre cinematography create a stream of consciousness atmosphere that makes it really hard to feel legitimate fear for the characters involved.  Despite all this, the movie is not completely worthless. It manages to make Madison's desperate attempts to keep Grace alive believable and disconcerting, but it is still not worth siting through unless the premise is so fascinating to you that seeing the movie is the only way to get it out of your head, like it was to me.  To be abundantly clear, this is not a bad story, this is a badly told story.
