After all these years, this movie remains one of the world's favorite classic holiday movies.  (I say "world" since thru the years via different postings during my career, I've seen/heard this movie in Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portugese and Hawaiian to name a few).  Is there anyone who hasn't heard (and maybe even hummed along with) Bing Crosby singing "White Christmas" and/or Bing and Rosemary singing "Counting Your Blessings"?  And who can forget the hilarious rendition by Bing and Danny of "Sisters"?  The ending show put on by the stars for the "General" (admirably portrayed by the late, great Dean Jagger) can't help but bring tears to your eyes.  This classic movie was made during a period when morality was still envogue and does not, therefore, contain even a single curse word or sexual innuendo.  It is genuinely a true family movie in every sense of the meaning.  It also instills the lesson that when one jumps to conclusions without having their facts straight, results can lead to unjustified, even hurtful actions.  Although all of the major stars appearing in this movie have now passed, they will continue to live forever via this film for generations to come.
