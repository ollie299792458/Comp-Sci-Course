This is just one of the most delightful movies in history, in fact the whole series is to be treasured.  But this movie in particular is a gem.  Granted, the cast of characters can be a bit convoluted at times to the point of confusion, and a lot of the supporting characters cross the line into caricature throughout the film.  Some of the dialogue is a bit dated as well, enough to make a viewer chuckle.  However, the brilliance of Powell and Loy is more than enough to excuse all ills.

Nick and Nora are the type of couple I wish I could be part of: Charming, witty, urbane and adventuresome.  But that's the couple itself, as it exists on paper.  It's the actors who truly bring them to life.  They just have so much fun together onscreen! Watch carefully the wordless physical exchange between them while McCauley (sp?) is on the phone at their apartment.  Notice the way Loy screws her nose up when Powell shoots her an amused look while Maureen O'Sullivan is crying on his shoulder.  Just the affectionate way they address each other...you can't pretend with such things.  They obviously adored each other in real life, and it was a bit of genius to pair them in this series.  They make it worth watching over and over.  And the one liners are a hoot, not to mention Powell's explanation to his wife of his acquaintance with O'Sullivan in the beginning of the film...I always laugh at his delivery and timing.  A must for any film fan! WATCH IT!
