I've seen all the episodes of the first and second aiyoriaoshi series before they were even in english and i own the first 3 aiyoriaoshi dvds

The anime Uses its comedy act alot, with nnice good mixture of romance. The nicely made storyline kills any signs of pervertedness and the comedy in it has made many people laugh.

I recommend this anime people to any anime watcher and I even recommend it to people who don't even like romance because the comedy will get you into the finely made storyline of the show.

The quaility of the dvds a really nice, way better than most anime dvds I buy, the dvd cases are very fancy, also these dvds have tons of ncie features, like previews to anime movies and japanese movies, textless endings and openings, music videos with the person who sings the openening and ending themes.

5.1 surround sound, which alot of dvds out there only have 2.1, pictures of the anime episodes, and a few otehr features I can/t think about right now.
