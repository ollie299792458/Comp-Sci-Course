Given with the stuff of acceptable fx made-cheap by computer and digital animation jitz these days, its a disadvantage that movies could now get away with a bad overall compusure  - whence on the other hand - this could also serve as the advantage for the side of moviegoers that movie producers would then need to pull up some more collectively brilliant individuals in their staff in order to really come up with a real notable flick.

Hence with this film- its not that different from such flicks that would've never made it to any amount of loss if you would've had missed them- the likes of GOTHIKA, THEY, and most of the previous films that've recently seen its day to've surfaced in the celluloid market.

STEALTH could've been a better movie with a high flying concept of a HIgh-tech Fighter-Plane with its own brain (nothin' new) just as it was done with the eighties tv series (starring that guy who became even more popularized when he'd starred in that nineties bikini fest series Ba(be)yWatch) called Knight Rider, where a car named Kit completes itself as a self-thinking Einstein on wheels- kinda like that good early 70's b-horror THE CAR; and even further back, there's ChickyChicky Bang Bang.

Not knowing the plot on what the movie's all about when I watched the flick (all i know is that its about a bunch of american pilots with all of their typical americana schtick that the movie'd depicted in full boring glory during its first half thus (boy, watta yawner)), when the plot went on to reveal that its three special select unit of exclusive pilots who've made it to pass for the STEALTH planes operation would then be accompanied by another pilot named DICK (?), or rather Edi -- i get to thinking 'uh-oh, it's another guys-with-a-bad-android/computer-brained-company' thing by the likes of the first ALIEN movie (where the bad android is played by the guy who played Bilbo Baggins from the LOTR movie adaptation) and that of (the mother of it all:) Stanley Kubrick's classic sci-fi rendition of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 A Space Odyssey.

Hence as tis predictably- they have to get rid of the computer brained plane as i've guessed, but it never went to anything full throttle, with a plot that's been seen before - mainly instigated by some bad officer in the operation, which would then move you to sympathise with the computer brained plane villain and see that the hightech Stealth plane is such an innoscent creature after all? bring on the hankies then! nah, its far too cliche infested and it would give you the impression that the producers dont give a hoot at all once you're inside the cinema watching this flick - since they already got what they're aiming for: the buck you paid for watching this movie.

However, In spite of all the cliche-ness, and the staleness of its plot and conceptual context- it could've flown high indeed if the movie've been well thought out despite. (for a minute there when they began to chase after the stubborn STEALTH creature, i thought things are really gonna pull up for this flick)

Borrowing from its predecessors the movies TOP GUN, IRON EAGLE (and even much further back that Clint Eastwood flick whose title i momentarily can't remember for now); and eighties TV by the likes of BLUE THUNDER and AIR WOLF (which both consist of Hi-Tech choppers on their stride), the whole scenario of this movie

even reminds me of them 70's classic japanese robot animation series's that i use to watch when i was a kid by the likes of BALATAK, MEKANDA (this one's no good), and STAR ZINGERS from the same producers who made DANGUARD ACE- where the robot (a humongous ship that transform into one) made only such very rare occasions of showing up in that animation series-- way before the popularization of Anime's and the likes of fancy fashionable phony sci-fi crud like the MATRIX.

In passing, forget everything I said - but one thing's for sure though: worse than its 80's fighter-plane movie ancestors- this plane Edi have some real bad taste for playing some passe wanna-be dork rock music, believe me.
