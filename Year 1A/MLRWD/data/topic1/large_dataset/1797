I have been a George Carlin fan since the late 60's so I hate to write this review but, to keep it simple, don't waste your money.  This is the worst single performance I've ever seen Carlin give.  It's not only not funny, it's sad.  Carlin slurs his words and, at times, forgets his material.  At one point, he picks up a sheet of paper and reads from it stumbling as he does so.  He clearly could not remember the routine although it concerned the topic of the show.  I couldn't help but wonder if he noticed the audience wasn't laughing.  And the audience only laughed three times that I heard.

After 50 years in comedy and legendary performances in those years, it's time for Carlin to realize that he doesn't have it anymore.  He is no longer funny or relevant.  As I watched, I wished there had been someone close enough to this great comic to tell him this routine was one too many and that he needn't embarass himself.

Oddly enough, I bought two of "Life Is Worth Losing" because one was to be a gift to someone who'd love George Carlin.  This is so terrible, I sent the gift back.  Please let it go now George, we'll still love you for all you gave us.
