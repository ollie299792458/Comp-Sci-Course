At long last, the campest of all Joan Crawford camp classics, "Torch Song," is on DVD!  Only in 1953 -- with the Red Scare, the threat of nuclear annihilation and the growing threat from televsion bewildering studio executives -- could so tone-deaf a concept get green-lighted.  You see, it's an MGM musical with our Joan as a voice-of-brass, heart-of-brass, Helen Lawson-esqe Broadway diva who falls in love with a disabled rehearsal pianist (Michael Wilding.)

Yes, you'll shudder as a chorus boy trips over Joan's outstretched leg during a not-very-complicated dance routine! You'll cringe as Joan belts out the politically incorrect "Two Faced Woman" number! And you'll retch as Joan, on a lunch break from rehearsal, stomps into a restaurant and snarls her order at the maitre d': "Lobster thermidor and black coffee!"

Also included in this set, The Joan Crawford Collection, Vol. 2, is one of Joan's very best performances in "A Woman's Face," a rare employment of her startling beauty as something more than mere eye-candy. Another change of pace film is "Strange Cargo," with Joan as a Sadie Thompson-ish hooker (in fact a much better performance than what she did with the real thing in "Rain.)

"Sadie McKee" and "Flamingo Road" are more run-of-the-mill films, but they do demonstrate most clearly the differences in face and manner of Joan pre and post "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008ENIAC">Mildred Pierce</a>."
