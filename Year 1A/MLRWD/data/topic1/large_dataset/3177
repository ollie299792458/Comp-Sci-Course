I have seen A Dance to the Music of Time at least twice during the last two weeks and I have found myself both enlightened and confused by it.
This is the type of British television series that I like but never quite
understand, even if I am an Anglophile.
If you like All Things British then this is for you as well as for me.
I am both entertained and saddened by the Human Comedy I have been watching.
I witness the stories of several characters from the 1920' until the 1970's.
I feel the passage of time and the lives of its people too.  I can relate
more to the later chapters of this comedy-drama as the highly priviledged
people in it move from middle age to old age as most of us do.
I remember a quotation from 1972, which Bill Moyers quoted back then:
"We have gone from Youth to Decadence without an intervening Golden Age."
I think this quotation summarizes the experiences of the characters here.
They experience life just after The Great War in the 1920's with almost everything in life in front of them.  Then they experience the vagaries
of experiences after youth and are not really encouraged by the passage
of time.  There is really no Golden Age for any of them from the 1930's
to the 1970's, and many of them do not survive that far.
I feel a note of sadness in the end as nearly everyone in the story is
dead and I wonder, "What was all this for?"
The cast is excellent, but the story is hard to follow at times.
However, I am glad I discovered this series ten years after it was televised.  I do not regret it, but I am mystified too.
