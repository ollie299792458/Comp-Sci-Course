This film is probably the only version of Clive Barker's seminal work "Cabal" that we'll see in our lifetimes, so for fans of the book, it's definitely worth a view.
Aaron Boone is a guy with a history of mental problems and a most unusual psychiatrist - and things take a sharply downward turn from there.
The film is very well-cast, with just about everyone looking the way they should. (Just think of Cruise in "Interview with the Vampire" and you'll know what I mean - this is not always the case in Hollywood.) The main difference between the film &amp; novella versions is that the 'Breed are much more friendly and accesible in the film, and so some of their mystery is lost. The film definitely has a sort of "comic-book" feel to it - but, you make do with what you get when it comes to Barker movies :-)
The film adds several characters and increases the importance of others - a minor quibble. I was disappointed with the way Baphomet was portrayed - his original appearance would certainly have raised a few eyebrows! Here we see a dark statue with a few glow-in-the-dark limbs; not very impressive.
The ending is drastically changed - leaving the possibility of sequel films, which is understandable but totally dilutes the power of the novella's ending. The point of the work was not Decker (interestingly twisted though he might be), but the relationship between Boone and Lori and her willingness to pass beyond the boundaries of the Human to be with the man she loves. 
If you have not read the novella, you're missing a treat. If you're a textual Barker addict, "Nightbreed" will entertain you, even if only on a superficial level.
