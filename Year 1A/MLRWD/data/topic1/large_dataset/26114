While based off the popular manga, the 2003 "Fullmetal Alchemist" series was ultimately a loose adaptation of the source material. Indeed, the second half of the series went its own direction and created its own original ending with the film "FMA: Conqueror of Shamballa". It was still, however, a well executed show and deserving of its acclaim as one of the best anime series of the modern era. In 2009, Bones Studios decided to return to the world of alchemy with a second series, one that could now adhere more closely to the manga.

"FMA: Brotherhood - Part 2" opens where the last set left off, as the Elric brothers confront the Homunculus Greed and his crew. The Dublith encounter was a key part in the 2003 series, the point where the adaptation branched off from the manga. This time, it stays on course and now the saga of the Elric brothers enters into new territory. The change is marked by several developments. New characters are introduced in the form of Ling Yao and May Chang. Members of the Royal House of Xing in the Far East, the two have come to Amestris to acquire a Philosopher's stone. They bring their own unique brand of sword-fighting and alchemy - not to mention a mini panda - and could prove to be great allies or dangerous enemies to the Elrics. The Homunculi conspiracy also takes on a new direction from the original adaptation as we meet the new ringleader. It's setting things up for grand, ambitious developments in the later DVD's.

The animation is still detailed and fluid with a rich color palette. The dub also maintains the same high quality of the previous outing. Again, it's good to have Vic Mignogna and Travis Willingham back as Ed and Roy. Maxey Whitehead also sounds more comfortable in role of Alphonse and honors Aaron Dismuke's performance while making it her own. There are even appearances from several FMA alumni (Monica Rial, who voices May Chang, voiced Lyra in the 2003 series).
