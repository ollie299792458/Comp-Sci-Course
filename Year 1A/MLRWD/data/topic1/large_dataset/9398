Normally I don't expect a whole lot from a movie, especially a sci-fi/horror movie.  But when you see the merger of the two finest existing franchises in the genre, you'd hope that someone would pay attention to enough of the details to make the effort worthy of the creative efforts that have preceded it. If you're going to claim the title, you'd better be able to do the job.

This particular case should have been pretty easy, after all there are already several existing trade paperbacks based on this exact -versus- concept (from Dark Horse Comics); most of them read like movie scripts to begin with, and have the added bonus of being partially story-boarded to boot.  The first trade paperback even layered on a good "evils of the corporation" parable into the mix that mirrored the vibe in the first two alien movies.

But nope.  Let's bring in the "creative" and "visionary" force behind every lame video-game-to-movie project from the last decade, and put him in charge.  Several others have posted some pretty good critiques of the illogic and inconsistencies, my favorites are, if the temple is buried under thousands of feet of snow and pack-ice, how come the whaling settlement only has a few inches?  How would the hunt have gone forward in 1800's, or the 1700's with no-one around?  I guess "creative" and "visionary" in this context means co-opting someone else's designs and concepts, so that you can pee on them as hard as you want.

The actual fight scenes are decent, but you'd expect that in any take on this concept, so no real points awarded there.  The one or two amusing twists that you'll see (and there were exactly two) really aren't worth the effort of screening out the garbage in the rest of the movie.  Lance Hendrickson is under utilized, but hopefully got a paycheck.  The rest of the cast, and in particular the leading lady, have the charisma of a stale beer.

Rent it if you see it at all.
