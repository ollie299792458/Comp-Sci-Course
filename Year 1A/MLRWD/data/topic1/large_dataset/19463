Shall we dance was a wonderful story about a businessman taken by a woman in a window, and he ends up taking (and loving) the dance even more than the woman, although his wife, once learning why he is coming home late, doesn't quite understand the need to dance.  Oh yes, it was Japanese, the dance was classic ballroom, and the notion that a man taking dance lessons could somehow be almost shameful made perfect sense. It was a great movie.

Now Hollywood, not quite satisifed in thier never-ending quest to take movies made right the first time and remaking them and destroying any charm, humor, or romance (see Sabrina, Charade/Something about Charley, Alfie, Tall Blond Man..., has gone and tried to adapt "Shall We Dance" as a star vehicle for Jennifer Lopez.  Maybe it's just that she constantly choses bad movies, or maybe ("horrors") she can't act, but there is no chemistry whatsoever with Richard Gere, and the dancing is just mediocre. And not enough of it, because you have to suffer through dialogue which has as little resemblence to the original script a Kerry's health plan has to Bush's.  Susan Sarandin is wasted. The only good thing was realizing that Gere can actually dance, and may have done the bulk of his work in Chicago (excpet the last tap number, where the shoes were defnitely smaller....) Rent the original.
