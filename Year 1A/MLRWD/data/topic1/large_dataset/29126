Amazon shipped my order for the 2010 release of the remastered Astaire and Rogers 10-Film (Ultimate) Collection, which arrived to me here in England with commendable rapidity.
I have, as yet, just spent a few hours checking out the discs, but, as usual with the recent Warner collections I am astonished with the visual and sound quality. Even The Gay Divorcee, which was very bad on the VHS tape release of several years ago, is good on these re-mastered discs. I can now watch The Continental without having to shield my ears from the screeching of the badly recorded violins (the engineers have tamed them quite well, but surely there must be a better master copy somewhere).

Like all the Warner Home Video collections from the USA these discs are labelled as Region 1, and should only play on region 1, i.e North American, DVD players. That is true of these discs, and they really are Region 1 only. They will only play on my region 1 player, not on either of my region 2 (Europe & Africa) players.
My other collections from Warner (The Rooney & Garland Collection, The Busby Berkeley Collection, The Classic Movies from the Dream Factory vol 3, and a few individual discs of this ilk) are all labelled as Region 1, but actually are also coded region 2 and most of the other regions of the world.

Regionalisation makes sense to the movie studios when releasing a new film in stages across the world, followed by DVD releases. But when re-releasing 70 year old films on DVD there is no sense in regionalisation. The people at Warner seem to have recognised this - till now. So, to anybody outside North America be warned. This release of old films, wonderful though they be, are of no use to you unless you have the means to play Region 1 DVDs.
