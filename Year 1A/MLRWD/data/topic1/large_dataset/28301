With a such a promising cast.. this movie was absolute trash. There is a reason it went straight to DVD. The script sucked, the directors vision sucked and the movie budget had to have been a rented out office and a HD cam from best buy. Not sure how they paid the actors and expect to get ANY kind of return from this with the DVD sales. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. You will be terribly disappointed. Apparently it's the directors first movie and it will almost definitely will be his last.

The guy with 1 review on here saying all these great things that are in it is 100% part of the movie in some way. There can't be one person who would ever think this movie is good. Fighting scenes get summed up like this: one 60 year old lady with a putter will intimidate and beat up 3 assassins who don't even try to fight back.. yes, that's a real scene. You wont laugh, you'll just wonder "why am I still watching this?"

I just truly feel sorry for the actors who agreed to do this film not knowing what the director was capable of. Sucks for them and sucks for anyone pulled in by the cast that will watch this movie, like I did.
