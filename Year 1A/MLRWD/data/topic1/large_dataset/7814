This movie is the original, and although not the best, it is very much still the comic book super hero film to measure all others that have come since. This movie deserves recognition for the daring to attempt a comic to screen adaptation in the first place and to make a man believably seem to fly. The catchphrase in fact took great pride in the fact that the filmmakers were certain that the audience would be convinced a man could fly. Christopher Reeve, an unknown at the time stepped in the red cape and would forever embody Superman for the generations that would watch this film. Gene Hackman is dead on as Lex Luther and Ned Beatty as his cohort is hilarious. Marlon Brando's brief and multi million dollar appearance does exactly what the producers had hoped and gave this film a very rich, real and strong resonace with the viewer. The story is heartfelt and genuine, the action segments are realistic and exciting. This film defined the very reasons we go to the movies. To this very day i still truly believe that a man can fly.
