This is a rather well-done adaptation of one of King's finest works. There are actually some chilling scenes, which is a rarity for a made-for-TV-movie.
It is the story of seven childhood friends who band together to beat an evil entity, only to have it resurface 30 years later. The friends, having made a pact to return and defeat the evil should it ever come back, must face their fears as adults and fulfill their promise.
The strength of the book, which is the friendship formed between the kids in a town inhabited by evil, can't be exactly mirrored on the small screen, but, again, a fine job at hitting most of the important points.
CAUTION: The two-sided disc is incorrectly labeled "Full Screen" and "Widescreen." The "Full Screen" side is actually Part I, and the "Widescreen" side is Part II. If you don't know the chronology of the plot or haven't read the book, this could spoil some of the story. However, it is interesting to note that both parts still convey an effective plotline when viewed independent of one another.
