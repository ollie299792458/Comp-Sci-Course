As the screen lit, exposing a man sitting in a car on the countryside and a beautifully orchestrated take on B E King's classic hit, "Stand by Me", I knew I was in for something good.  I really hadn't an idea of what the film might have instore for me, but it had left a good impression.  As the movie rolled on, I found myself completely involved with the world of our protagonists, and caught up in every vowel spoken and every movement made.  It's very rare that I find a movie so captivating, so entertaining, and so emotional.  However, "Stand by Me" was one of the few films that I found very very few flaws with.  The dialogue was easy to follow, the atmosphere was perfectly corresponding with the scenes, and the story was amazing.  The film is about four twelve-year-old boys, like any other twelve-year-old boys in 1959, who engage on a journey they'll never forget.  As the innocent, lighthearted "fat kid" Vern was looking for a lost jar of pennies under his porch, he overhears his older brother talking about a kid they found who died three days earlier.  In search of stardom and becoming home-town heroes they leave home and follow the railroad tracks to where the body supposedly lies.  Along the way, they face what's been eating away at each of them individually and have an emotional experience that is deeply profound to the characters.  The boys face the end of their childhood by the end of the story, and come back to their town completely changed.  This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
