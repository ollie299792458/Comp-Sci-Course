I don't usually do written  reviews,  but this time I have to say that I'm EXTREMELY disappointed on how this version of the so called blu ray and Dvd combo was packaged.  Using only one dics to have both  the blu ray and Dvd version? HUH? I could have saved myself money and just bought the Blu ray only if I only wanted one disc.  I like fact that every  blu ray/ dvd  combo I have bought  have had  two discs separately.  One for my blu ray player and one for my dvd player.  It was a shock to get this one with  both formats on one disc.  I think for the price they should have done two or at least make it clearer that it was only going to be one disc which to me is a dumb thing  to do. Back when I preordered this item I don't recall it being advertised as a Single-Disc, as it is now.  It may be cheaper  for them but not for me.  I will not be buying any more combos done this way.  I have learn my lesson.  Save yourself some money and avoid them too.  Either buy only the blu ray or the DVD since you will only get one disc with the combos, and save yourself some bucks.
