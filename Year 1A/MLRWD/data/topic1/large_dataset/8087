As mentioned by my title this is a good movie and a must see for baseball fans.  "Moneyball" chronicles the 2002 Oakland Athletics with their no-nonsense, savvy General Manager Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt,  A's manager Art Howe played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Jonah Hill also plays as Billy Beane's genius assistant Peter Brandt. The movie begins when the Oakland A's lose in the playoffs after the 2001 season, not to mention they also lose their two highest priced talented players Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon.  Since Oakland does not have the money the money to compete with the big boys(Yankees, Red Sox), Billy Beane must make do with players who weren't highly sought after.
Here's what the movie fails to mention the A's had offensive power hitter Miguel Tejada(won MVP in 2002), the A's also had 3 Cy Young caliber pitchers( Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, Barry Zito) Zito won the Cy Young in 2002.  The movie makes no reference to them. The A's beat the odds and win 100 games in 2002 to make the playoffs.
