End of Days received some pretty dire reviews from the critics, but it is actually an exciting and highly enjoyable movie. Arnold Schwarznegger, back after a two year absence from the big screen, performs solidly. It isn't a stereotypical role for Arnie, as he plays Jericho Cane, a widower and struggling alcoholic with real vulnerability; he does at times struggle with some of the emotion that his character has to deal with, but nonetheless, he gets stuck in. The really meaty role in the film belongs to Gabriel Byrne who plays Satan, the devil. Byrne strolls round the streets of New York without a care in the world, and delivers his lines with great panache. The whole cast is pretty strong however, with Kevin Pollak playing an amusing sidekick for Arnie, Robin Tunney as Christine York, the girl who has been chosen by the devil to give birth to the Anti-Christ, Miriam Margolyes as the girl's foster parent, (one of the best scenes in the film is when Margolyes gets to toss Arnie around like a rag doll) and Rod Steiger as Father Kovak. The story is fairly straightforward, with Jericho Cane desperately protecting Christine York from the evil charms of Satan, who needs to plant the seed of the antichrist in the girl before midnight on New Year's Eve. Occasionally, there are some slightly disturbing scenes, and some devoted Christians might not want to watch the film. However, there is absolutely no attempt to be blasphemous. Indeed, Andrew Marlowe's script is challenging and realistic. The music soundtrack isn't the type to buy and listen to on its own, but in the context of the movie, it is very atmopsheric. Overall, I would recomment the film as an enjoyable and challenging watch, with enough action in it to satisfy the tpyical Arnie fan, but with an extra edge to it. It isn't flawless, but few films are, and if you can cut it some slack, you'll enjoy watching it, although it might prove disturbing for some.
