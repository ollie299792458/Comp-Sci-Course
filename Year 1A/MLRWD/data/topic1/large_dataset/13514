The Coen brothers are easily the best film makers working today, and with each new release they move closer to the top spot of all time.  Selecting a favorite from among the brothers' films is difficult, but if I were forced to choose it would have to be "Miller's Crossing".  This film is superb in every respect - writing, direction, cinematography, even music.  The film's theme is honor among thieves, and the opening scene in which this theme is enunciated ("if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?") is a classic.  The Coen brothers' genius in creating memorable characters is displayed throughout; each of the major characters is a delight to watch: the cynical (and devious) Tom Regan, the vampish (and devious) Verna, the treacherous (and devious) Bernie Birnbaum, the sentimental (and murderous) Leo, the philosophical (and murderous) Johnny Caspar, the sadistic (and murderous) Eddie Dane (you may start to notice a pattern or two emerging); and even minor characters, such as Frankie and Tic-Tac, are sharply drawn and brought vividly life.  And nobody writes better dialogue than the Coens (Tom: "[Rug was] not a bad guy, if looks, brains, and personality don't count." Verna: "You'd better hope they don't.") If one were so inclined, one might describe "Miller's Crossing" as a post-modern exercise in cinematic revisionism, an ironic deconstruction of the traditional gangster film in which the Coen brothers take the elements of the genre and assemble them into a decontextualized parody which emphasizes surfaces and shapes: the fedoras, the cashmere overcoats and leather gloves, the smoking tommy guns with limitless magazines, the cigarette (no filters please) and the whisky bottles and the vintage autos.  But why would one want to do that?  The Coen brothers defy facile categorization of every kind and just continue producing one masterpiece after another.  "Miller's Crossing" is their best; don't miss it.
