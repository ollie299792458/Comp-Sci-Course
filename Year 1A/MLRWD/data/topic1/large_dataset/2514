"I HATE Terminator 2!" I have uttered this phrase many times in the last ten years since I first saw T2 and have taken a verbal beating every time! Everyone I know seems to like T2 better than the original, but I still stand firm. With the obvious exception of special effects, The Terminator is far superior to the sequel in every way, and remains James Cameron's masterpiece. Way back in 1984 he turned an action-science fiction flick into a violent, depressing, totally compelling work of art! The writing, direction, and acting are all outstanding, with a sense of style being maintained throughout the entire experience. And, unlike in the sequel, Arnold is believeable as a murderous cyborg, that will do anything to complete its objective. The action sequences are truly brilliant with slow motion, foreboding music, and razor sharp editing all combining to create an original and brutal benchmark for both action and science fiction films! Well, in my opinion, anyway. Seriously, though, what happened Mr. Cameron!? From raising the bar with awesome films like The Terminator and Aliens in the mid 80s, to turning out meaningless garbage like True Lies and Titanic a decade later!! I thought you could only get better with time! I guess I was wrong...
In conclusion, I think it's fantastic that the studio released a Special Edition DVD of The Terminator. It was long overdue, and deserves to be in the collection of anyone who even remotely enjoys science fiction films.
