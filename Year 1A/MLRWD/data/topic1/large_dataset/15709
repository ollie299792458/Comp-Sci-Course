I seem to be one of the few who have read the novel by Gerald Petievich that this movie is based on.

Although many movie scripts differ from the book they are based on, the changes made here eliminated the most intriguing aspects of the original story.

Among the most regretful changes are the motive and person responsible for the plot against the president.

The revelation of the villian in the book took me by surprise and would have added a needed twist to the movie, which can only be described as conventional in every way.

The other major change from book to film is the climactic attempt to kill the president. This scene in the book provided true tension with plot elements that seemed plausible.

While it is unusual for a movie to be able to surpass the enjoyment of reading the book it is based on, (with the rare exception of something like "The Godfather"), it is most regrettable when the changes involve the unique elements of the book that make for a satisfying reading experience.
