They don't make cartoons like this anymore. This is the original '80s Chipmunks, not the live animation nonsense they have today. Ugh.

At the start of the movie, Alvin is pestering David to take him, with him, on his business trip to Europe. David says "no" and that he has to stay behind with the elderly Miss Miller.

Later on, The Chipmunks and their friends, The Chipettes, are at the local ice cream parlor playing an arcade game, Around the World in 80 Days. Alvin is still complaining about David's trip to Europe.

At the next table, a typical rich, '80s, couple overhears Alvin's complaining. The couple are actually diamond smugglers and need a dimwitted person to trade the diamonds for cash. The couple confronts the Chipmunks and Chipettes. They trick them into thinking it will be game. They have no idea that they will be escorting diamonds hidden in dolls across Europe.

Alvin then tricks Miss Miller into thinking David called from Europe and is sending the boys over to join him. The next day, they set off on their first quest in hot air balloons.

Like I previously said this children's movie would never work today. You have diamond smuggling, kidnapping, scenes of violence. Parents would be protesting! Ugh.

Amazing movie! I wore out my VHS copy back in the '90s, and bought it when it was re-released on DVD several years back. I'm never parting with it.

I also have the soundtrack on my iPod. I listen to it on occasion.
