I really like the Peter Pan movies, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is my favorite version they have made of this loveable tale. The fact that they stuck so close to the book was amazing, it is the most accurate that they have made.

 The movie special effects were wonderful. The fairies were magical, and made me want to shout out &amp;amp;quot;I do believe in Fairies&amp;amp;quot; while in the movie theater! Flying was always a childhood wish, and to see this movie where they fly off to a world that was perfect in a childs eye was great. Tinkerbell does a great job and even when she is jealous the director allowed her to be more of a girl, and less of a fiction. And Peter, as clueless as ever to what is going on is truly a boy. (No offense to the guys, but seriously, you are clueless when it comes to girls.)

 The chemistry between Wendy and Peter is so cute, it made me smile and remember what it was like to be young. The thimble made me laugh and the story made me cry.

 The actor that plays Hook does such a wonderful job, he really is very talented. To be such a good actor to play such a bad guy, it is just wonderful to see that! Normally the bad guy is down played, leaving the Hero looking like the strong one and the villian like the wimp. But Hook really does pull his own, and makes his presence known through the capture of Tiger Lilly, John and Michael. He is truly an evil guy, and the actor did a fantastic job!

 The whole cast is extrememly talented and fun! I enjoyed every minute of watching them interact and wonder how much FUN they had off screen while making the movie.

 It honestly takes you back to your childhood, and I believe this movie will be treasured by both young and old.

 Bravo for making this movie, I am just sad that no one seems to have seen it or had any desire to see it. I personally will tell everyone I know how good it is, and that it deserves 10 stars, not just 5.
