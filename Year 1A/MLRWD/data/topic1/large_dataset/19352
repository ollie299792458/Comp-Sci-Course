Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions didn't just make music, they sent
great sounding and universally useful social messages and it's no exaggeration to say their records were the true heart and soul of many a disc collection. (Just mention the name Curtis Mayfield and a deep warm feeling arises in nearly anyone who has ever heard and been moved by he and they.)
This splendid DVD overview of Curtis, Fred and Sam was long overdue. In addition to welcome video footage including Germany's legendary Beat Club,the Joey Bishop show, "In Concert", some corny Dick Clark staging and much more we get to witness Mayfield's impact be given a proper and fitting perspective from those who were there.
Hearing the Curtis story from the mouths of his wonderful wife Altheida, surviving Impressions Fred Cash and Sam Gooden, Andrew Young, producer Johnny Pate and musicians Carlos Santana and a revealingly impressive Chuck D we learn of ths history, impact, and driving force behind the sound on both the personal and macro levels. And as many of us have always known,that driving force was Curtis's deep love for not just music but for humanity,which,through composition he aimed to bring together.
Bravo to the director, producers and interviewer for this labor of love and gift to fans and will be fans. The gospel of Curtis and company is one that,even now, could benefit our world.Plus his music had a beat..and you could dance to it-even when you danced,as sometimes evidenced here, horribly!
