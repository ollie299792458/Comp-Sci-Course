It's a funny thing to see how America can make a young beginning actor, a star at a point in his carrer crucial enough,but unbelievable.But of course I speak of newcomer Vin Diesel,that even after a low-grossing sci-fi debut film like PITCH BLACK,walked on water throughout this unmatchable flick that portrays the true 'youth' related action where bad is good.At the side of another newcomer Paul Walker,Diesel stars as a troubled master car-racer that even though following his tough-guy methods,deep inside stands as a family man in relation of his close appreciation to his sister,as seen in regards throughout the film towards Walker's character: "YOU BRAKE HER HEART-I BRAKE YOUR NECK".On the other hand,Walker's character a more hidden 'persona' stands as the film's major riddle assisting Diesel's dark secret that brings out the full set of action the film promises at it's 'bullet' climax.With fights and speed chases as well as a smartly written script,"FURIOUS" offers you not just a film but an opinion,that in comparison to it's 'hero' characters tells you that when there's action you don't get locked and sealed in goodwill,you get FAST and FURIOUS.
