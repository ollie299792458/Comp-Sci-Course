For anyone looking for a romance/adventure/foreign setting/feel good movie, Lagaan hits the spot. I was just browsing through the video store looking for something new and interesting, and I saw Lagaan's bright yellow box. And the title, Once Upon A Time In India, completely sold it. The story is not only inspiring but also romantic. For anyone who dreams of what the world is like in other countries and different time periods, this movie is magnificent. For the full 3 hours and 45 minutes, the viewer is wisked away to mid nineteenth-century India. Aamir Khan is an incredible actor, one whom I was unfortunately unfamiliar with before I rented this movie. I really wish he could be more well known here in the United States. His acting is far better than the cheesy actors here in the states. He shows true passion in what he is acting, as does his co-star in Lagaan, Gracy Sighn who plays Gauri. Their love is the perfect example of what everone wishes to find.
  Lagaan is an incredible story, one that I feel truly deserved that Oscar!! But as long as many people get the chance to experience the feeling this story brings, i think it will really have achieved its goal. Great job Aamir Khan!
