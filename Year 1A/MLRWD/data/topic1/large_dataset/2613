I actually called the network last Summer when I heard that this show was not going to be on for another season.  I talked with someone connected with the show and was informed that it would be in the Fall lineup.  What a sad day it was to find that Jay Leno had taken the spot for this amazing production.  EVERYTHING about Life was top notch and even above the performance of any Dick Wolf production.  I have seen every episode of Law and Order - all of them - since the first episode of Law and Order was aired many years ago.  I even love the re-runs.  Life surpassed even L&O with fantastic music, tightly drawn characters and fully developed plot lines.  I wish that one of the other networks had picked this up.  How sad to see such a fine entry, in a rather lackluster lineup, be sacked for Leno.  This was a show that hit on all levels for both young and old viewers.  I watched it with my Grandkids!  We have the two seasons on DVD but already feel the loss of a third and fourth seasons.  Television executives took something from the viewing public when they let Leno have their spot.  Frankly, more than one Leno in a week is turning us away from the network.  A true loss.
