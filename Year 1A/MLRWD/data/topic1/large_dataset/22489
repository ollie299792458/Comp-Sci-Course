The great ensemble acting in Petrified Forest brings Sherwood's story to life.  I don't think Sherwood's speeches are "unintentionally dated." Each character (with the exception of Howard's) is supposed to be something of a broad stereotype, and the humor of the movie (yes, I said humor) derives from the interplay of these characters. C'mon, it's supposed to be funny when Alan asks Duke Mantee his opinion of astrology. Think along the lines of Marie Dressler and Jean Harlow exchanging pleasantries in Dinner at Eight. Howard's character is of course more than one dimensional, and because of his great acting, he is able subtly to undercut his own grandiloquent utterances while proclaiming them, as his better instincts do battle with his self-loathing. Richard Burton but not too many others could also pull this off.  Charley Grapewin and Genevieve Tobin are brilliant in supporting roles, and kudos to Sherwood (and Warner Brothers?) for casting an African-American as Slim, one of Mantee's henchmen, without the usual ethnic stereotyping of the period. In that connection another very funny exchange--providing good social commentary--between Slim and the bourgeois couple's African-American manservant.
