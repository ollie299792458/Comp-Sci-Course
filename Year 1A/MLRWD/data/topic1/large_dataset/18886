"The Third Man" has all the elements of a film, that different groups of people would like. It has suspense, drama, romance, action and mystery. Acted out by a top of the notch cast. Joesph Cotton, Trevor Howard, and Alida Valli. Joesph Cotton is a great actor. But very undervalued. He's not remembered among the great actors of the 40s and 50s. Even though he did a chilling performance as Uncle Charlie in "Shadow of a Doubt", which should at least given him an Acadmey Award nomination for best actor. But he was ignored by the Acadmey Awards. In this film, "The Third Man", Joesph Cotton comes to Vienna upon being called by an old friend of his, Harry Lime played by Orson Welles. Supposdely Lime has died due an automobile accident but Cotton thinks differently. So he's out to find out what really happened and ends up getting invloved in with racketeers, the disappearance of a man named Joesph Hobbin, and watered down  penicillin. Trevor Howard does a very good job as Major Calloway, the charming British police officer. And Valli does a splendid job as Lime's lover. Who can't decide to love Cotton or Welles. Orson Welles plays one of his most unforgettable roles as the sinister, evil minded gangster, Harry Lime. That scene when we first see him and he's standing in the doorway with that evil smile. That's the best entry of any character into a film. Sure you can have Batman jump through cellings and stuff. But you can't beat the entry of Lime. Extremely well done film, that music is great.
