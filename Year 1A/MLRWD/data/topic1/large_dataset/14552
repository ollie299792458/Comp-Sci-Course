In case you have never seen or even heard of a person called a "pinhead", they are strange looking folks from days gone by who were used in the circus sideshow acts back in the early 1900's. I believe they were slightly retarded or maybe just slow, but also odd looking, who patrons would pay money to see and talk to. In this movie they form a group and keep an eye out for each other and help each other when needed. Well, the leader of them who is a little person himself, falls in love with an average size women who leads him on into a marriage which is doomed. Once they get married she makes fun of him and puts him down every chance she gets. At one point she tries to get her new hubby so drunk he can't stand up, at which point the other take control. Very old B&W movie, and less than one hour long, but one movie that you will never forget. I saw it back in the 70's as a teen, and knew I had to own this true classic. Disturbing, strange, scary, but also touching and sad at the same time. I owned the VHS tape, and now the dvd, and if it ever comes out in another format I will buy that as well. It IS that odd and off the wall, but also can never be made again, as those people no longer exsist. One of my all time favorite movies, and one that will be your's as well. Gooble Gobble, one of us!
