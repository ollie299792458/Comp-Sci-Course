I enjoyed The Green Mile the first time I saw it in a theater. I had to add it to my library and was I pleasantly surprised when I viewed it. The detail in this blu Ray disc is excellent, but the real bonus is the extra features at the end of the film. Anyone who purchases this film should watch all of the special features. The amount of work that goes into making a first class motion picture is amazing. In the special features you get to see many of the details the director had to work on to produce this outstanding film. You'll see the enthusiasm of the actors as they read their lines and how the whole thing came together with all of the special magic of film making. The Green Mile has to be one of the best films ever made and the entire ensemble of actors delivered performances of the highest quality. Steven King should write more great books like this and Director Frank Darabont has to be one of the greatest directors of all time. I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must be to coordinate all of the efforts that go into movie making. It must be a lot like commanding an army and General Darabont lead this army to victory. I wish that I could thank everyone of them for the entertainment that they provided.
