Alright, everybody. If you thought Gigli and Catwoman were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. The trailer looked decent, I loved the cast. So, me and some friends rented and watched this turkey last night, and you know what? We had a blast, but not in the way you might think. Where to start? A laughably bad script and direction, with most of the dialogue being variations (or not) of "Oh my god!" and "Oh S**t!". You don't see that much of Basinger, but that turns out to be a good thing, as one might think this was her first (and last ) film. In fact, Macy, Statham and, especially, Chris Evans perform as if they were doing some kind of "Naked Gun" type parody. This thing is so ripe for "MST 3000" style ridicule that that's exactly what happened, with all of us wincing and laughing all the way through and cracking jokes ("did your dog write this thing -- while under sedation?"). Along with "Showgirls" and "Color of Night", "Cellular" is the greatest awful movie to come along in years. You owe it to yourself to have a party around this one. You will laugh so hard there won't be a dry eye in the house!
