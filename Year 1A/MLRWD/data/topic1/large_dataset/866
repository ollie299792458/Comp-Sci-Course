Excellent in all aspects.
I could care less about the flap about whether this all happened as others have pointed out....it is film making like they used to do....the breath taking beauty of the desert and the colors of it all were enchanting. The dedication of Hopkins to his horse was endearing....."You don't hurt my horse" and another time he speaks of not saying anything against his horse....it is an exciting and fun filled two hours plus of old fashioned entertainment......I thought Viggo Mortensen was perfect in the role as Hopkins...He has an interesting screen presence. I hope to see more of him in the future as I think he has considerable charisma and talent.....
just sorry it did not last longer on the big screen as this needs to be seen on the screen to get the scope of it all......surprisingly enough the local theater, one of those old fashioned one screen theaters, has been showing it now for two weeks.......apparently someone, besides me thinks it worthy of viewing......
