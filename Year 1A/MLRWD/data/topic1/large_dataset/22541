This, my friends, is more than just a horror movie.  It is a symbolic commentary on the fear of living, and obsession with death.  Our hero is trapped in a world of death and is too afraid to go beyond that.  
Those who see this as a confusing mess or just a cool zombie flick are missing the point.  Sure, it has everything from the graveyard setting to the dead rising, and yes, it takes a splitting of the head to kill the dead, but there is so much more to it.  It has story and symbolism amongst it all.
And there's more.  The film is certainly a visual treat as most Italian horror flicks are, and is highly humorous.  For all you sick bastards like me, there is a decent amount of gore, and Playboy model Anna Falchi bears her assets several times in this film.  But it's all done tastefully.  This film has STYLE.  It is very artsy, and if you're not a fan of those types, steer clear.
Now to the symbolism.  If you haven't seen the flick, I would recommend skipping this paragraph unless you enjoy spoilers.  The snowglobe is symbolic of how our hero is trapped in his place in life.  He is trapped by his own doing however, as he is afraid to live.  His occupation with death is very clear.  Lines like "We're born to die" and "We all end up here sooner or later" are evident as life being viewed as meaningless.  Anna Falchi's character is the embodiment of love and death.  In this film love and death are seen in the same light.
Also this film is a tribute to the genre itself.  The familiar setting and basic story about the zombies returning and such (which turns out to be merely a backdrop) pay great homage to horror films, mostly the classics though.  Ironic, however, because to most horror fans, this film will go down as a classic itself.
