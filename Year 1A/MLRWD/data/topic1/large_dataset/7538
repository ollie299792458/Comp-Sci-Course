For those of you out there who are multi talented, able to read and watch television, you already understand that any book that is later represented by a movie is usually far different so if you take the movie for what it is worth as a movie this is one of my favorites. I feel Albert Finney does a fine job of more closely representing the character of Poirot. Though if you are a fan of Peter Ustinov as Poirot you may not like this movie at all. There are some big names in here for the time when the movie was made though I doubt most people today will know who half of them are. There are two actors in this story that also appear in a later Agatha Christie Movie (Evil Under the Sun). And there is also a young Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates from Pyscho). It is a fairly long movie when it was released on VHS it actually came on two tapes. The movie has a richness to it that seems to capture what we believe or want to believe that time period was like. Honestly at the price you not taking a loss, I hope you enjoy.
