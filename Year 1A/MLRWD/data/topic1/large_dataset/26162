This is a tremendous DVD. The astronauts themselves tell you all about their adventures to/from and on the moon. The extra features are superb abd Gene Cernan's commentary section are exceptional and every single human person should listen to them. This DVD is a reminder of who were are as people, our need to explore, to expand our awareness. You get a beautiful description of our planet and our place in the universe. The rare footage is remarkable and clear. It puts the viewer next to the astronauts and allows us to relive what they did. Never before known or revealed facts are offered. The photography is maginficent, the music superb and fitting. After viewing it, I felt a deep appreciation of how glorious, rare, once-in-a-lifetime and amazing the voyages to the moon were and are in our history. It is a must see DVD. I am encourageing my nieces, godchildren, and young people I meet who did not live through these events to watch it and for those of us who did, it makes us grateful for being alive on this planet and able to experience the greatest, most courageous human exploration ever done. You will also develop an admiration of just how special the men who went to the moon and returned are. It is also a beautiful memorial to those who gave their lives along the path, lest we forget. Get a copy now, keep it and make sure you pass it along to a young person. It is touching, funny, amusing, entertaining, dramatic, and awe-inspiring.
