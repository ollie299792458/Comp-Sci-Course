Renee Zellweger, the best actress of her generation, appears in her first big-time role in this movie. Just looking at her facial expressions is worth the price of admission. However, I'll spare you the review of a movie you have probably already seen. Let's talk about the special edition of the DVD.
First, the sound and picture are first rate. This is why you watch DVD's.
But, the special features are why you want this version of Jerry Maguire. The deleted scenes are great and, while brief, the (obviously very early) rehearsal scenes are fun. However, I thought the best special feature was when Crowe and the three stars sat down to watch the film, with a running commentary.
There are two ways to get this commentary. On disk one, which is the feature, you can turn the commentary on and off. I recommend you just use this disk to watch the film; because the commentary is only a voice-over. The session with the film principals on disk two is more fun, because you actually see them, gathered together to watch and talk: Cuba, Tom, Renee, and Crowe. The film is in a window below. Since their remarks are the point, it makes more sense to watch it this way.
I wish more of my favorite films had the extras that are on this DVD. Of course, the extras only add more depth to the movie that is already there. If you didn't like this film, why would you want to see more about how it was made? But, if you liked the movie or, if you are just crazy about Renee Zellweger, like me, you'll love this DVD.
This is a great, great DVD package. Highly recommended.
