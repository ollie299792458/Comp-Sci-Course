Stargate Atlantis is quite possibly the worst spin off I have had the displeasure of watching. I'm giving it 2 stars only for the music and special effects.  It is a poor attempt at taking a wonderful story and turning it into a complete failure. Dr. Rodney McKay comes off as the same annoying; know it all, blowhard that he played on a couple episodes of the original SG-1. He is a pale attempt at giving Atlantis it's own version of Samantha Carter.  Dr. Elizabeth Weir is a failure as a leader with a sweet smile and clueless actions on how to deal with a military situation. Major John Sheppard seems totally out of place in this show. The wild haired Major comes off more as someone who wants to look good rather than someone who has any idea about the military. Rounding out the foursome is Lt. Aiden Ford. This character seems more like a high school freshman trying to fit it than an SG member. I will give credit in regards to the basic plot and the special effects. You can see the same desire put in each episode as have been with SG-1, but it lacks the solid acting and creative characters that SG-1 fans have come to enjoy. I was also pleased with the creation of a new enemy. The wraiths are a welcome change from the Goa'uld and I feel there is great potential with them. Overall this show has come to be a great disappointment to me. It has the look and feel of SG-1, but none of the depth from a character perspective. Watch at your own risk.
