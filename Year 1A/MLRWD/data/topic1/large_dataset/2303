Slayer are the kings again , after "war at the warfield" wich didnt seem to show that much energy they take back the throne and make their own , track by track "still reigning" recreates this time in visual terms the legendary album "reign in blood" with the same sound and ferocity and intensity you can hear in this album but this time you can put an image to this songs this guys take back youth from the past and they look in very good shape , Lombardo (back with the band) is yet a tornado with drums as in times when he was younger , Araya still can pronunciate dozens of words in seconds and headbang like a maniac, Hanneman keeps playing his guitar with amazing velocity, and King plays his riffs like no other human being can (now that sadly Dimebag Darrel is gone), final cut (reign in blood of course) end with a especial blood rain effect that falls over the stage and the four Slayer members, creating an apocaliptic finnale that drives the audience insane and madness is the main emotion in the final picture, really is something to recognize how this band have keep loyal to trash metal after all this years , their integrity is unquestionable and this is the only way to reach inmortality in heavy metal History , they are survivors and definitelly they deserve to be the kings
