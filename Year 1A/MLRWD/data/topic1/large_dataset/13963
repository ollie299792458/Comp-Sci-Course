Like many other fans I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this classic series on DVD. And let me say that I was not disappointed with what we received. Back in the early 90's when Nick At Nite aired this series I recorded it on VHS and have watched & rewatched these episodes over & over again. I purchased the 30 public domain episodes that had been put out over and over again on DVD. But, still I longed to have this entire series on DVD from episode 1 all the way through episode 156 and now we are finally on the way with the release of Season 1 which has been beautifully remastered.

Aside from the episodes themselves, which run around 26 minutes not the 22 or so minutes we find on syndicated prints, the bonus material is superior. Where possible the original openings, closings & cast commercials that were used during the original broadcasts are included as bonus material. Or if you prefer you can chose to watch each episode with or without this Vintage material included (I prefer to watch with the Vintage material included).

The interviews with Lucie Arnaz & Jimmy Garrett are wonderful. Tony Maietta was the perfect choice to do these on screen interviews. He obviously loves his subject (in this case Lucy) and was knowledgeable about her and the show. At one point Lucie Arnaz commented on the amount of knowledge he had. But he accomplishes this without coming across as gushing.

Though I love this entire series the first three seasons with Viv & the kids are by far my favorite. With season 1 being the best of the whole series in my opinion. Lucy & Viv Put in a Shower, Lucy & Her Electric Mattress & Lucy Puts Up A TV Antenna are just a few examples of how great these ladies were together.

This set is a must have for every Lucy fan. CBS Home Entertainment has hit another homerun with this release. I could not be more pleased and eagerly await the release of Season 2.
