I really expected better from this film with all these top notch actors that I'd watched in various Japanese films and JTV dramas, Miike's directorship, and with Tarantino's involvement. I thought I was going to experience a powerful and action packed film with just enough tongue-in-cheek comedy to keep things moving along, but instead I received a dull and painful film that felt threadbare and immensely clich&eacute;d. The constant parodying/mimicry of spaghetti westerns was fatiguing, as there's a big difference between paying homage to the past and forcefeeding the viewer at every turn.

Also, I knew going in that the spoken dialog would be tough for native english speakers to handle, but boy was it bad, so very bad that it was really cringe-inducing. But if that was all that was poor about Sukiyaki Western Django I wouldn't feel so disappointed. The movie was very slow moving for the first 45 minutes, the characters were quite two dimensional without the force/presence that most spaghetti western characters have, and I didn't really develop much empathy for any of them at all.

The film wasn't all bad. The sets, costumes, and landscapes were really enjoyable. The last 30 minutes picked up the pace and had some fun moments. And the end song gave me goosebumps.

I knew going in that this wasn't supposed to be a very deep film, but as a fan of westerns, and Chambara, I expected to have enjoyed myself more and I didn't.
