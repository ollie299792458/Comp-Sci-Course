This movie has an excellent premise: the "twin" fetus that died in utero so that the heroine/main character could survive now wants its own chance at life. Perhaps bringing in the Jewish concentration camp survivor was a good idea; I'm not sure. It seemed to make the plot a little foggier. Had it been the spirit/consciousness or ghost of the unborn twin rather than a long-lived, erm, Monster-Demon? I think I'd have found it more interesting. But since they did go with a Jewish demon, and required a rabbi and a Hebrew "exorcism"(Spoiler alert -- quit here if you haven't seen it and want to be surprised -- although after the first half hour surprise is unlikely)they should at least have done a few things right. Did anyone else notice that they read the secret Hebrew book from front to back, and each page from left to right? Hebrew, like Arabic, is written from right to left, and books are read from what readers of English and European languages consider back to front. OK, so I'm picky. But when the plot is thin to begin with, it doesn't take much to break the suspension of disbelief. That broke mine. And the ending? She's pregnant, with TWINS? Could it be more cliched? I think not. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't a scare fest. The best thing about it was that it relied slightly more on suspense and fear than slashing and splattering (the latter seems to require little to no plot at all these days). The acting was so-so, better than a lot of recent movies, but if you're looking for a good tight plot, you won't find it here.
