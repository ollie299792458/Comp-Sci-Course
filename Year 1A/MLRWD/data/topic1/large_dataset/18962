Never one to be close-minded, I expose myself to all sorts of movies.  I really do enjoy action movies when they are done well and have an interesting story line to go with them. MI2, however, does not fall into the aforementioned category.  The characters were flat and bland.  When Cruise's female love interest injected herself with the virus, I frankly could have cared less if she was rescued (not that I ever was at the edge of my seat with suspense as to how it would turn out - that was sooo obvious) or not.
As for action, I wasn't even impressed with that.  The beginning opens with Cruise's rock climbing scene, which was panoramically impressive.  After that, however, there is little, if any, action until the very last portion of the movie.  Since the story was so inane, I would have at least expected more action sequences.  Instead, the movie bombards the viewer with lack luster dialogue and plotting.
If you want to see a really great, action packed flick, I strongly suggest X-Men or Gladiator.  X-Men is non-stop fun with interesting characters that you both want to see more of and care about.  Plus, X-Men's Hugh Jackman gives a great performance - I strongly suspect that he will follow in the footsteps of his other Australian predecessors, Mel Gibson and Russel Crowe, which in turn leads me to segway into Gladiator.  This is a movie of epic scale that manages to be emotionally uplifting while at the same time satisfying even the most carnage-craved fanatic.
My suggestions - skip MI2 and go buy either X-Men or Gladiator, both of which I gave 5 stars.  If you still need a strictly action-based flick, however, I suggest The World is Not Enough - you can't go wrong with Bond - that is James Bond.
