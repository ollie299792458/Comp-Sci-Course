Tommy Lee Jones gives a somber and yet dignified portrayal of executive Gene McClary, the right hand man and best friend of a hardened CEO who has made the calculated  "business" decision to axe thousands of jobs to boost his company's sagging stock.  Sickened by those around him who seem emotionally detached to the effects the layoffs have on lives and families, McClary wrestles with what to do.

Two middle management executives in McClary's division  (Ben Affleck and Chris Cooper) are soon axed as well and each struggles in his own way to bounce back from the loss of the job that they were once so secure in and the devastating effects the layoff has had on their families and their own self esteem.

I liked this movie. Tommy Lee Jones' performance was great as I felt his character conflicted over what to do with all the layoffs going on around him while his boss (himself included) continued to enjoy the corporate high life.  On the flip side, it was interesting to see the difference between Ben Affleck and Chris Cooper's characters after they were laid off and confronted with the harsh reality of losing their cushy jobs.  I wondered how each was going to handle their plight and the movie does take a few unexpected twists and turns following them.  Although the movie's message is a bit clich&eacute; in its demonizing of corporations to make a buck no matter what the human cost, the movie was enjoyable and entertaining and captured the unfortunate spirit of American corporate culture as it exists today.
