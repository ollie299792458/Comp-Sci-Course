About a year ago, I had started a band with the intent of being the lead singer. After a few weeks, I discovered that I had a decent screaming voice, but then I got to thinking, "If I keep this up for more than a few years, will I begin to lose my voice? Permanently?" I started to look for things that might've helped me and this definitely helped.

  The most important part of this DVD was Melissa Cross and her approach to all these different techniques, whether it be harsh singing or grunting/growling ("heat and fire"). With heavy metal and various types of music like it, the singing isn't always the most peaceful and delicate and as such, the approach most people would take to doing it would just be to scream their lungs out. But in this DVD, Melissa will take the most unusual ways of explaining how to do these different things that make it a whole lot easier.

  The thing I liked alot about this DVD was how she emphasized the importance of the method you should take when breathing, pronouncing words and how to let air out when performing. The only drawback I found with this was that, when she explained how to do a death-metal growl/grunt/shriek, she only did it for a little bit at the end of the DVD.

  All in all, I found this DVD to be a great help when learning to a scream without hurting my voice. The thing you need to remember is that it takes along time, repeating the exercises over and over, and not all at once. As long as you listen to what Melissa Cross says and you take your time, then you'll be able to get a pretty good screaming voice.
