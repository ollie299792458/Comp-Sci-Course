People who have given poor reviews to "Shall We Dance?" seem not to have gotten the point of the film:  "Shall We Dance?" is primarily a romantic fantasy and on that level it works like a dream.  Do not come to the film expecting a serious true-to-life docudrama of the dance world; that notion should be dropped immediately. Never mind the supposedly illogical premise that Richard Gere's bored, dissatisfied businessman cannot tell his wife and his daughter that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons.  In this macho world of ours it is considered an absolute no-no for men to take dance lessons.  Stanley Tucci's hillarious turn as Gere's co-worker, a lover of Latin dancing, also takes lessons on the sly, and proves that real men do the tango.  Jennifer Lopez is fine (and you can quote me) as the sad, wistful dance instructor who inspires Gere to take lessons in the first place.  The supporting characters are funny and loveable, including the ascebic, charmingly obnoxious waitress who is Gere's partner in the dance competition.  I could not help but connect with the secret yearnings of each and every one of them.  Anita Gillette as the slightly dipsomaniacal owner of Miss Mitzi's Dance School is the heart and soul of the film as she is at the school.  The dance numbers at the competition are great and the clips of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse from "The Band Wagon" dancing up a storm are a beautiful homage to what "Shall We Dance?" is all about.  So forget the negativity of the critics and come and enjoy "Shall We Dance?"
