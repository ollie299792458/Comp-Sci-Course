I was biased when I first watched the pilot and didn't really pay attention (leaves and comes back to it and missing some scenes).  I came in thinking that they're trying to remake "It Takes a Thief".  I initially tuned in because I recognized Matt Bomer from Traveler & Chuck, though I didn't know him by name at the time. I had a chance to really watch it a year and a half later when USA ran a White Collar marathon and by the 2nd episode shown that day, I wanted more.  I bought the first season and had a chance to watch more of 2nd season on the website.  Now, I can't wait to own 2nd season on DVD.

The Neal Caffrey / Peter Burke interaction is wonderful.  It's not perfect, but they care about each other...no disrespecting each other.  The supporting cast really do shine in their own roles.  The caring June to Neal, the most helpful and again caring as well as funny/unique Mozzie, the supportive, loving and insightful Elizabeth (I think the glue to both Peter and Neal sometimes), the strong, smart and great-supporter-of-Peter Diana, and Jones, though in a small role, has strong presence. I like every single one of the supporting cast.

I also love the ongoing story about finding Kate.  Neal and Kate.  Love it.

The stories isn't based on shocking & gory images or crime (which turns me off to most crime-fighting shows) nor is it constantly bombarding the audience with sexual dialogs.  I get so involved with each episode and wondered how they can solve the crime and what unique ways they're do it this time...which comes from great writers of the show.  I like how the characters are developing through each episode ...they don't dwell on it constantly but touches on it enough. I can watch this with my preteens.  Love the smart dialogs and banter. Love all the sites of New York that they've shown. The attraction of this show is that it is just simply wonderful/ enjoyable entertainment.
