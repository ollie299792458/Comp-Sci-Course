I really didn't care too much about seeing the sequel but I went ahead and watched it anyhow. The second part makes the first seems simple and weak. It is probably one of the few movies in which no doubt the character development has matured but in which the sequel has far outdid the first part. Here in this movie, the conflicts centers around the ever changing problems that has plagued cities over the last decade--urban renewal. Not only are the characters are dealing with big companies posing as afro-sheeps but their very own enemies with a lot of cash at hand like nappycuts.com ,the website used in the movie, ready to undo what the owner and workers of the barbershop has been doing for a long time in just weeks what took them years to perfect and gain respect for. The movie is far from being passe and weak compared to the first one. It has some dark humor, historical memories and nostalgia that made the movie come off stronger and more powerful than the first one. I liked this movie a lot, it was really a movie. I sat there and watched it and it surprised me, showing me something new instead of being very predictable and trite. I recommend seeing this movie
