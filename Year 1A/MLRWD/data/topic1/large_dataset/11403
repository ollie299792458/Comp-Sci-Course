I'm not sure if it was purposely trying to be a bad martial arts movie or not, but if it was, it succeeded. If they had added comedic scenes, then it might have been salvageable. I'm going to be a little vague only because I don't want to spoil it if you want to watch it anyway.

I don't normally write reviews for movies, but this one was so horrible I felt obligated to warn anyone considering watching this ... or worse, buying it. I kept watching the DVD progress bar to see how much longer I had to watch it (I can't stop in the middle of a movie or a book).

The special effects aren't very realistic. The fighting scenes are mediocre, about the bare minimum you would expect from an action movie. The plot was thin. The main antagonist is after a box of artifacts, acceptance of the sensei, and revenge (?). The artifacts are suppose to have magic capabilities that are never explained - so I think it's really just sentimental, but who knows...

They waste a lot of time on the main character's parents but nothing comes of it. It doesn't really drive him or affect him. It just provides an excuse for why an American is spending his life in Japan. There was absolutely zero character development.

Also at the end, the "Ring" Organization wastes a lot of resources trying to kill the main characters. It doesn't really give a reason why a financially motivated organization would try to stop them to such an extent other than as a favor to the main antagonist (however, the "Ring" tries to kill him too at the end).

I'm also annoyed that the ninja poison (only ninjas know the poison/antidote combo) was used twice on two other ninjas but no one but the bad guy had the antidote. You would think the sensei/soke would have had one handy.

The cops and the "Ring" bad guys were just fodder. The detective just gave them an easy out to push the plot along.

It was all very predictable and cliche.
