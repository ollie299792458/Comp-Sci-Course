This was a great story and even if your not a Notre Dame fan(i'm not), you'll be cheering for the Irish! It's starts out when Rudy's a little boy and tells his family of his dream to play football for the Irish. They just laugh and don't pay any attention, but Rudy's determined to carry out his dream. It then shows Rudy when he's in high school(he was a football player). But he didn't get very good grades in high school and doesn't go to Notre Dame after high school. He then works for four years at his father's work but through out the four years he saved enough money to go to college, he can't get into Notre Dame and instead goes to a smaller college. Rudy works very hard in school and works even harder to accomplish his dream. Rudy is such a Notre Dame fan that he knows more about Notre Dame that the actual students. This movie teaches us to never give up, although Rudy comes close to quitting he sticks to it. I must warn you though that it's a very emotional story but it's a very good one. When you see this movie, remember that it's a true story and that Rudy was a real person. Knowing that, it makes the movie ten times greater. And in the end you can't help from chanting Rudy!Rudy!Rudy! along with the movie.
