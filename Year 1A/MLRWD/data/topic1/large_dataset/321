Recommended because of its new features, namely the "Blooper Reel" and the "Wrap Party" which are both less than three minutes apiece, and I really wouldn't miss, but the keeper is the "L.A. Pretty Woman Tour" which takes you on a trip to the various filming locations in Los Angeles, narrated by Garry Marshall.  The best extra is Marshall's audio commentary which is updated from the 10th Anniversary edition.  If you know the movie very well, it's a welcome addition.

Fortunately, you can skip the previews of other movies at the beginning of the disc by pressing the Menu button.

The sound seems better on this disc than the earlier DVD.  It has a better loudness ratio so the music is not too loud compared to the dialog.  This is the Widescreen 1.85:1 version.

Finally, I don't know why this film is rated "R".  There's virtually no nudity and they only curse three or four times during the whole movie.  PG-13 is more like it (which these days is "R-Lite" but oh well).

Enjoy it!
