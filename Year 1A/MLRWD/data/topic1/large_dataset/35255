If you are new to yoga and want explicit instructions and want to learn exactly what to do, this is the DVD for you!  If you are expecting a bun-burning, sweat-drenched, cardio workout, then you will be disappointed.  After all, with a title like "Yoga for Dummies," one would expect an instructional DVD for the, um, uninitiated (I prefer to avoid the term "dummy" when referring to myself :-)).  After viewing this DVD a few times, you will have no doubt as to whether you are performing the postures correctly.  The instructor lets you know where each part of the body should be, how to breathe during each posture, and what not to do (important for beginners--to avoid injury).  I would definitely invest in the DVD (as I did) because there is an additional 20-minute "intermediate" yoga workout at the end, that the video does not have, that is lighter on instruction and more of an actual workout, much more "flowing."  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is truly a yoga beginner.
