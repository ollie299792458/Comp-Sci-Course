I just watched this movie tonight. I love Walter Matthau, and there's plenty of his classic character bits here to keep the viewer constantly entertained. Although it received mixed reviews when it came out in 1980, Hopscotch still remains popular and is driven by a more than average, clever plot. Glenda Jackson has good chemistry with Walter, even though there's an age difference to deal with. And there's a surprisingly good deal of Mozart and Rossini sprinkled throughout the sound track, mainly because Matthau loved these composers. Matthau's character, who's writing an expose (his memoirs) of the CIA, needs writing music and inevitably puts on a record of a Mozart opera (The Marriage of Figaro). This was Matthau's own idea. He seemed to have brought much to this movie. For instance, he dreamed up the sequence where he becomes reacquainted with Glenda Jackson via a conversation with her about wines. That scene works very nicely. You won't waste your time watching this one. I recommend it as a good brief escape from our mad world. Also, don't miss the introductory commentary from the director and the writer.
