Lets see a tale of media run amok all in the name of ratings and money. Sound like a "60 Minutes" piece? Well its not. It is incredibly articulate and scathing movie from 1976 which portends the coming age of  media craziness in search of ratings. Paddy Chayevsky's screen play  literally foretold the future of television and should be viewed in the  same light as Kubricks prediction of the societal changes in his 60's movie  "A Clockwork Orange". The acting by everyone in this movie is  memorable. So much so that Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty both garnered  Oscar nominations although they appeared in but one scene. And lets not  forget the other nominees from the movie -  Faye Dunaway and William  Holden. Top this off with the Oscar winning performance of Peter Finch as  the insane (or is that messiah-like?) anchor man. Finch spouts one of the  signature lines of the 70's when he whips up his audience with the cry of  "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!" The  bottom line is that the powerful acting was fueled by an emotionally  charged script that produced one of the best movies of the 70's.  I highly  recommend this movie not only for its entertainment value but because this  movie was ahead of its time and has more relevance and meaning today then  it did at the time of its release.
