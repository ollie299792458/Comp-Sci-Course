...though how in the (blank) could Universal have released this on DVD and NOT done WIDESCREEN?  The DTS transfer is as crisp and clear as you'd ever want, but this is a movie of astounding visual scope that cries out for a widescreen version.  (I have this movie on VHS, DVD, and Dolby Digital Laserdisc, and the DDLD is by far the best of the three, because it's widescreen and the DD is amazingly crisp for LD.)
Still, though, there's a lot to like about this movie:  Alec Baldwin is dead-on perfect as Lamont Cranston and his darker side, The Shadow; Baldwin can go from charming to chilling with one flex of his facial muscles, and that ability is nicely on display here, even if The Shadow is buried under a hat and cloak and heavy makeup.  Penelope Ann Miller looks gorgeous as Margo Lane, the blonde bombshell with a brain to match, but isn't challenged much by the material.  John Lone chews up scenery as Shiwan Khan, last descendent of Genghis Khan and darker reflection of The Shadow's edgy goodness.  The art deco sets are terrific; the music is rich and moody; the visual scope of 1933 New York City is breathtaking.
I recommend this one with qualifications:  If/when a widescreen version comes out, get it instead of the other DVD or VHS versions.  But the movie itself is well worth seeing, particularly if you're an old-time radio fan.
