Remains of the Day joins Goodfellas and Breaking the Waves as movies that did not win Best Picture Oscars in the 90's, however will be be remembered as truly three of the finest flims ever produced. Merchant and Ivory has always been an aquried taste, however this movie truly crosses all boundries. As the years go by (I'm writing this review in 2005), Anthony Hopkins brillance as an actor gets dimmed somewhat with every mediorce script he takes, although if anyone has earned the right to sell out for money, it is he and Deniro.

This movie will truly haunt you, and I don't say that lightly. Lesson for all young movie directors who think you have to have raunchy sex scenes with wafer-like women and thick headed men to generate heat on screen: the chemistry between Thompson and Hopkins in the library scene is the most intense, heartbreaking, sexually-charged scene I have ever witnessed on screen, AND THEY DON'T EVEN TOUCH EACH OTHER! The fact that BOTH did not receive Oscars for their roles is borderline criminal. The last 35 minutes of this movie will stay with the you for weeks, if not years. That last scene of Stevens the Butler releasing the trapped bird out the window, while he is left inside looking out and wondering all he has missed, and eventually lost, is almost to much to bear. The beautiful harp-centric soundtrack is worth noting as well.  The excellence of this movie is hard to overstate; it is simply one of the 10-15 greatest movies ever made, while Hopkins and Thompson's performance in my estimation rank as the two single greatest performances of the 1990's.
