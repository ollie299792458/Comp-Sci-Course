This DVD is great, the picture quality on both the japanese and english version is excellent. The english version is slightly poorer in quality than the Japanese version, but still not bad. Both films look better than the recent 2 disc release of gojira/godzilla, less dust etc on screen. It is not as good of a film as the first godzilla, but definately worth owning. I got mine on january 5th and there is no trace of the problems mentioned below. The commentary is only on the english version, it is very informative and you find out alot about why the film was disquised as a non-godzilla sequel in its US release as Gigantis, the fire monster. Highly reccomended for godzilla fans and sci-fi fans in general.

And, more films are on the way, the following films will be released:

GHIDORAH THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER, INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER/MONSTER ZERO, ALL MONSTERS ATTACK/GODZILLA'S REVENGE, and TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA. There are plans to follow the Godzilla DVDs with Toho's RODAN and WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS.

nice job! Cant wait for the japanese version of Rodan!
