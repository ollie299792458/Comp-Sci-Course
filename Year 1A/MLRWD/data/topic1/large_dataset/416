One of the most underrated movies ever, and that is why I am taking the time to give a short review. I would like to direct the reader to the Metacritic page to see how some critics labeled this as some sort of atrocity. I must say these people are absolutely full of ****. I have watched over a thousand films and this is in the top 100. I adore the acting, the direction, set design, and most of all the wonderful script.

For now I won't go over much, but people need to know that loving care was given to this film by Adrian Lyne and written by Bruce Joel Rubin; you can see this love in the beautiful opening shots of vietnam to the interiors and the loving way each actor exists in the movie, they all need each other, and the direction for each involving scene is quite immersive and satisfying. The soundtrack is very pretty but sombre and sad at times. Nothing ever shows a hint of any weakness.

The TIME article is so far up its own *** that I am angry at the fact this film is so mistreated by these 'professionals'. As if it is more cliche than something like Saving Private Ryan, for all its astounding splendor, the actual movie wasn't even that well tied together. This movie is tied very tight with resounding themes about dream, angels, demons, and what war means for the living and the dead. You will find that for every weakness you look for in this movie, a strength outshines it by tenfold. I cannot say enough about the acting, FROM EVERYBODY, and how this 1990 movie just doesn't feel dated, at all, and you would almost expect that from a supernatural thriller of this type. It just proves that 'they' are not making movies like this anymore in Hollywood's non Indie scene.

Anyway, despite my overwhelming hatred for petty and contrived reviewers, don't listen to the bad ones, they mean nothing. The NY Times and Roger Ebert have fair and balanced reviews of this film, scoring around 90 on the Metacritic. Read them, but watch the movie first. A true American Classic.
