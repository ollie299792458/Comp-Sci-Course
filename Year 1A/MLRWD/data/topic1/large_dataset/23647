I bought the monster edition of this movie, Im not sure when it was that I last saw this movie, but Im sure Its been awhile.Watching this movie from beginning to end I kept thinking well this is a load of ****.I guess what I wanted was a realistic godzilla movie, what I like is the design of this godzilla(american godzilla) Its more reptilian shape gives it more of a creepiness than the japanese gojira.But mainly the problem sometimes is I had a hard time taking the cast of characters seriously, I mean this is a giant monster destroys the city movie, and the characters sometimes dont act like it. I should note that in making the movie the actors all acted there parts with an invisible/ghost godzilla in there scenes and afterwards The CGI was put in, the special effects are preatty awsome, CGI godzilla looks preatty outdated but still enjoyable.But again Its the cast that just didn't deliver for me, the movie can be a bit of a joke because of this, goofy character design, corny dialogue, And the group of military that have to deal with godzilla seem like a bunch of imbeciles.Its just not a very well executed godzilla origin film.So my final verdict= 2.8 stars out of 5.

EXTRAS= All the monster edition dvd of this film has is 1. All time best of godzilla fight scenes wich isnt even that great trust me 2.Three episodes from godzilla the series and the episodes are=1.What dreams may come2.MONSTER WARS PART 1 3.Where is thy sting, these episodes are also available on seperate dvd media.And finally a production art gellery that has about 20-25 art pieces and I only liked abut 4 of them its not that great.
