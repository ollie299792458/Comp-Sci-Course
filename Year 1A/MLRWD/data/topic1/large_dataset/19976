I bought this movie out of necessity, and it will now be in my collection for years to come.  The description does not do the movie justice. I had to write a report on the differences and similarities of the families in this movie for a college course, who would have guessed that what I was getting was fantastically entertaining. The struggles and family values you see here are really missing in today's family groups, though we express our culture very differently now this movie transports you to a better way of life at a troubled time in the history of the world these two teens teach us about life and friendship in the face of adversity and change.
As for my experience with Amazon, it was spot on, my shipment came quickly and the movie was priced very competitively I will defiantly be purchasing more in years to come. I was getting nervous about finding this movie because it was not in any rental place or video store I went to but I had to go no further than my home computer and that was delightful.
Thank you Amazon.
