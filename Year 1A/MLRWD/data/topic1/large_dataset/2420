Great movie. Of particular appeal to me was the "From This Moment On" number. First, working the women into the number was ingenious - notice them sitting as the men pass by. But what really floored me in this number was the incredible performance by Carol Haney. If you watch her closely (which I didn't have any trouble doing - by the way!), some of the steps she does are absolutely incredible - extremely athletic. There is a type of a slip step she does - side by side with Bob Fosse - where she slides down with her right leg slipping under her, then coming up with the full weight on her left leg - all without skipping a beat (and she and Bob do that step twice!). She also performs this same step in The Pajama Game (choreography by Bobb Fosse) with the same degree of dexterity. Watch that step and see if you can duplicate it without straining all your leg muscles or landing on the floor - not to mention the timing and balance involved with that step. And also notice how every inch of her body goes into her dancing - not to mention her exquisite sense of continuity and line formations. 
I understand she was Gene Kelly's assistant. Whew! I believe it. 
I am always on the lookout for movies in which Carol Haney appeared. And she is not always given a billing. "Invitation to the Dance" and "On the Town" are two other movies in which she appears - ever so briefly.
