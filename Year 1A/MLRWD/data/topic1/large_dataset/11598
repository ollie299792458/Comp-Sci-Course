"Taxi Driver" is another one of my all-time favorite movies. True, it's a haunting and disturbing film in some cases but it's also a work of art. Scorsese and Paul Schrader(he wrote the screenplay) bring to life an unforgetable picture that should be recognized because to its universal themes and not because of the controversy surrounding it.
Robert De Niro gives a performance of the highest calibur. He plays the main character, Travis Bickle. Travis is a lonely and alienated man who's both fascinated and repelled by life in New York City. When he tries to fit in the norm, he finds himself posing as a threat to the 'normal' people. When he's rejected by a beautiful socialite, Betsy (Cybil Sheperd)as well as a twelve year old prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), he begins to go over the edge. Travis begins to become more earnest in making his presence known to everyone. He does so by taking extreme measures.
Travis Bickle is someone we can all relate to. We've all felt loneliness and detachment from our surroundings at one point or another. So it's easy to sympathize with him, but you can't forget what all he goes through in order to get that recognition he desperately wants. It's an intriguing and disturbing look at a man's tortured soul. 
Scorsese has always done a wonderful job of getting into the minds and hearts of his central characters. His interest in learning what makes people tick is always evident. 
I don't recommend this movie for the faint-hearted. It's not a movie for everyone. There are many things in this film that would prove to be too much for some viewers to take. However, it is a wonderful film despite that and it's important to be open-minded.
