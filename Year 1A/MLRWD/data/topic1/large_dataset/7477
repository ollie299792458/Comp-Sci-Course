When making a sequel, one should concentrate on new plot twists, yet stay true to the original story. This movie, though not bad, is a little too repetitive and lacks a real interesting plot. Brendan Fraser, as usual, has an overall decent performance, but his character, like before, is a little too heroic and it is too hard to enjoy his performance in this type of role. The introduction of the Scorpion King is almost a complete waste of film. His debut is not much of anything. He plays a total of about 5 collective live action minutes, proving that this movie is too concerned with impressing its viewers with computer graphics and not with acting.
Overall this is a good movie. It is action packed and full of eye popping special effects. It really doesn't touch on the original movie's ideas, but tries to add something new. Its direction is kind of confusing, and the viewer will notice many likenesses to other movie ideas. The DVD has a few special features that, like all movies with animation, are filled with the how-they-done-its of computer animation. 
If you already own "The Mummy," this movie is a nice addition, but it is not really worth owning by itself. Hopefully the creators know when to quit and will not "curse" us with another Mummy film after this. The story has now been played to death and should be laid to rest.....
