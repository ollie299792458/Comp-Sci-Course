Venom is a classic-style horror movie with elements of mystery, adventure and minimal gore. It is also an "Indie" type of movie, in that it stars a group of young actors with lots of energy, who are having fun, planning their lives (and getting killed-off:) I rated it a Nine within this context.

The mystery theme, involving a group of young friends, reminds me of a Nancy Drew type story line. These young friends, with their whole lives ahead of them, are forced to learn about Voodoo quickly (to avoid getting killed-off:)

The horror/Voodoo theme is well-known: A Voodoo Zombie is created when a dead body becomes "possessed" by a legion of escaped bad souls. These souls had previously been extracted from unfortunate victims and "confined" by a good Voodoo priestess during intervention/cleansing rituals. Unfortunately the bad souls escaped their confinement during an accident).

The adventure theme is classic chase-and-kill: Obviously the Zombie is out for a hellish romp, and killing people left-and-right to strengthen it's evil occupants. Who is going to step-up and kick it's butt?

This movie was deliberately made to be fun and entertaining, as well as provide some Voodoo folklore. A great Friday night romp in the swamp with an evil Zombie! Where Friends get to gather at Voodoo temples, get chased thru a bona-fide Louisiana Swamp, and often get to die!! There's even a hero at the end:)
