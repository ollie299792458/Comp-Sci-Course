Sir Edward Shackleton was one of the greatest leaders ever born but never taught of.  His family motto was "By Endurance We Conquer" and you see this beautifully portrayed in this documentary.  The most amazing part of this movie is the scene in which Shackleton is watching his ship being crushed by ice and how unbelievably calm he was.  Lesser men would have broken down at the thought of being low on supplies, out on moving ice pack in the Antartic in the middle of winter - not Shackleton.

You also see his leadership in the details of how, low on warm, water-proof sleeping bags, he rigged the selection process so that his men got all of the good sleeping bags.  This is remarkable and shows how concerned he was for their survival.

If you want to teach your children about leadership, buy this movie and show them that in the year 1914, having no GPS and no communication with the outside world, Edward Shackleton led 27 men through the Antartic for 2 years and every single person lived to tell about it.
