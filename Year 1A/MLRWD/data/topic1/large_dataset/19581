Even though I haven't purchased or seen this yet, I've still given this collection a 5 star rating.  After all, it is peanuts and it is on Blu-ray.  Although, I really can't imagine how much more detail can be pulled from decades old masters of a simplistic animation at best. Don't get me wrong, I love IGPCB , and CBC, but at some point, you have to start seeing the paint strokes on the animation cells.  Regardless of how timeless or heartwarming peanuts is, I have to say that I agree with the other reviewer.  How can you call this the ultimate holiday collection when not every holiday is on in the set.  I would love to see "What have we learned, Charlie Brown" on this set as it is probably my 3rd favorite holiday episode...Admittedly, it might not have been billed that way as it was an add on to Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown and the entire 2 hour show was shown as a memorial day or Veterans day special (IIRC).  I only recall seeing it once growing up, and I still have my copy on VHS.  It still stands in my mind as one of the finest works of the peanut crew. I'm sure you can probably get it in the Peanuts 80s collection, but it would have been nice if all the holidays had been included.  Either way, I guess I will continue to hope for "What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown" to be included in the Blu-ray release of Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown. Not sure if that helps you decide whether to buy this, but its nice to vent from time to time.
