I was waiting with great anticipation the release of The Bride of Frankenstein DVD.  I ,like many others, consider this movie to be the greatest horror film of all time.  I already own the movie on VHS but I  couldn't wait to see the sparkling, crystal clear picture that I know the  DVD format can deliver.  Unfortunately, Universal decided to dig up the  worst print they could find to put on DVD.
The worst thing about it is  the horrible grainy look of the film.  There are so many tiny little black  dots on the picture that it is almost impossible to concentrate on the  actors.  It is a terrible looking picture.  And somehow or other they have  managed to mess up the framing of the picture even though it is a 1.33:1  image.  You only get to see about 85% of the picture compared to the VHS.  Universal....how could you? 
The extras on the DVD are quite good but  it's the movie that counts!  Other titles in the series of classic  Universal horror movies are better but none of them so far are what true  DVD enthusiasts and real movie fans want to see.  I really hope that  Universal quickly decides to remaster The Bride of Frankenstein DVD and  then allows us poor souls to exchange our current copies for a new one.
