To show you just how bad my timing is......I just bought all 4 seasons of Rocky and Bullwinkle on eBay and the day after I just happened to go to Amazon.com to see if there was a Season 5. Well lo and behold up pops "100% Complete Bull" with Season 5 on it. I was furious to say the least. Then I contacted one of the people that I bought Season 1 and 4 from and they were nice enough to cancel my order with no penalties involved. I also purchased Season 2 from them and they told me that when it arrived to just refuse it and they will credit my account back less shipping and handling (3.00) As for Season 3, when it arrived, I just resold it back on eBay for the same price I paid for it. Then I ordered the complete set from Amazon. And I'm glad I did. This is everything that I wanted plus more.I completely understand why people who bought the 4 Seasons were upset but my suggestion is to just sell them on eBay or Amazon and use that money to get this set.
Being a baby boomer, I grew up watching cartoons and Rocky and Bullwinkle was one of my all time favorites (along with Yogi Bear and Crusader Rabbit) Although at the time I didn't appreciate the puns, as I got older, the pure genius of these cartoons became abundantly clear. Fractured Fairy Tales and Aesop's Fables always cracked me up. And although it stretched history, Mr. Peabody was actually very informative.
I am so looking forward to reliving the memories associated with this cartoon and I hope that those who are mad at the distributor will not take it out on the cartoon. You will only be depriving yourself of countless hours of hilarity and fun.
