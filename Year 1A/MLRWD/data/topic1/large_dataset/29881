Lovers of classic WWII British cat and mouse thrillers will like this movie.
I enjoyed the twisting, intelligent story of Enigma.  I'll try to sum it up in two sentences.  It's about a British codebreaker in WWII who suffers a breakdown after his lover jilts him, then returns to service to learn that the Nazis have changed the code of their Enigma machines.  He must re-break the code, evade a government agent who suspects him of spying, and rely on his ex-lover's roommate to help him solve a parallel mystery about missing communications from the Germans in Poland.
Dougray Scott is haggard and believable as the brilliant mathematician on the verge of another breakdown.  Kate Winslet de-glams to play the slightly frumpy but intelligent roomie of the elusive Claire.  Jeremy Northam plays the dapper, light in manner but deeper than he appears, agent on the trail of the spies.
The story has great dialogue and respects its characters, giving them depth.  I liked that the hero and heroine were not all prettied up.  When Dougray Scott is chasing the traitor, he looks like an academic running through the streets.  The scenery is stunning throughout, with English countryside, large manor houses and tudor cottages.  One point that some reviewers has missed is that the story is layered.  There's the thriller aspect with the codebreakers trying to crack the code and save the convoy steaming across the Atlantic from the German U-boats, but there's also the personal tale of a man struggling to unravel a personal mystery.
