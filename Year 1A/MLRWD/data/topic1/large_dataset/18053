Recently watching Badlands for the second time, I was less impressed than after the original viewing. But I figure enough people have given their reasons for liking or not liking the movie, so instead I'll throw out a couple thoughts upon watching it. For one, the couple is never in the actual Badlands of the Dakotas. They spend all their time on the Plains, unless I'm mistaken, whether it's the town they first live in, their holdout by the river, or their drive through the flat landscape. Badlands may be a purely metaphorical title, but the movie is actually set in a landscape more like that of Days of Heaven, if I'm remembering that movie right.

Also, I was struck by the plight of Kit's fellow trash collector, who's probably heard about Kit's mayhem, and is stuck on this isolated ranch house when he sees Kit show up brandishing his rifle. What terrible luck for him! This guy who happened to work alongside this asocial drifter now has only two options, try to take the gun from Kit or escape at the first opportunity he's got. Either way someone's going to get shot. Once Kit's picked up his gun and shot Holly's father, everyone he goes on to meet will be in mortal danger simply because Kit's so egotistical he'd rather kill people than run the risk they'll turn him. For me, the menace that floods the rest of the movie came from that fact, much like how watching No Country for Old Men I was constantly wondering who was going to die next.
