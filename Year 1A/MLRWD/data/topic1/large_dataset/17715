This DVD titled Journey Through the Chakras is wonderful. Other Chakra DVDs are mostly positive affirmations, breathing and are usually very slow. This one keeps you throroughly engaged as you work the way up the body. 1st Chakra includes grounding exercises(standing poses) and working the legs, 2nd Chakra is lots of hip opening, 3rd Chakra is ab work. The 4th Chakra works the heart center and upper body, and so on. You get a wonderful lymphatic flush  in the process (I feel it is this flush that is giving my skin a new glow and many comments). The whole time you are gaining a wealth of information and insight about this fascinating subject. Things you don't hear elsewhere. Before you know it you have gotten a full body workout that has worked you on so many levels you may never be satisfied with any one dimensional fitness regime again!  Journey Through the Chakras goes thru each of the eight chakras (8th is Aura -radiance and charisma) using exercises which include postures combined with breath techniques.
I really like the production values. The music too is some of the best I have heard on a yoga DVD.
