If you want mythic Jim, watch Oliver Stone's film.

This is a repackage of 3 existing Doors videos with some added material that rendered the videotapes obsolete.

The "Live At Hollywood Bowl" shows a Doors concert with Jim in his prime and the theatrics that got them recognition instead of notoriety. The only disappointment is that it clocks in at an hour. Supposedly Harrison Ford was one of the cameramen at this show.

"The Soft Parade" features a post-Miami incident Doors on PBS with an excellent rendition of the title track.

"Dance on Fire" is a mix of live, spoken word and early music videos (aka promo film) that has most of the hits you know and love.

The surviving members of The Doors add commentary, and the extras are pretty cool, including a student film by Ray Manzarek. I do think that they should have considered putting Jim's short film called "HWY" in this package as a bonus as well as the "Feast of Friends" documentary and the Isle of Wight performance that documented their last performance on film.
