Amy Adams plays Rose, a young woman who was popular in high school but who, several years later, finds herself supporting a young son, unmarried, and working for a cleaning company. Rose is having an affair with her former high school boyfriend, a cop who is married to someone else. Knowing Rose needs money, he suggests she clean up crime scenes. Rose and her sister form their own cleaning company and seem to be doing pretty well until Rose ditches a cleaning job for a shower with her former high school friends, leaving her sister to go it alone, which results in a disaster. So Rose once more finds herself working for the cleaning company, and all of the above. But this time, she ends the affair with her boyfriend and is resolved to improve her life, if only things would go her way, for once.

This indie is wonderful to watch simply because of the fine acting and interactions between characters. Amy Adams plays her part well, as does Alan Arkin, who plays her father, a man who is always looking to make a great deal, which never seems to happen. This isn't your quintessential romantic comedy, but more of a realistic look at a young woman's life and her desire to be a better person for herself and her son.
