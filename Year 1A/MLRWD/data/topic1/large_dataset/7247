1) The film definitely WAS NOT designed to be shocking or even entertaining and there's NO even slight resemblance to "Basic Instinct", etc. In fact, if you want entertainment, Kubrick's art is not really your cup of tea - all of his films are depicting not the  moment's rush, but eternal meditation. And they are too complicated for the  lovers of all-nation hits.
2) Does anybody at all think WHY Kidman &amp;  Cruise? Such an amazing casting is the only way to grip the audience when  you're about to tell it smth really important.
3) But this important is  not to be seen, it's what it DOES to you, and absolutely without kind  permission of your mind.
4)Hence, accept the fact that sometimes making  movies is not about telling stories, and general audience may not be able  to understand the 'morals'. Moreover, often understanding is totally  impossible on the existing cultural level, so the message should be  indocrinated. That's the case of 'Eyes Wide Shut'.
5)Please please don't  be that mad at Stanley. Remember that we always tend to hate what we don't  understand.
