Superman for President...no, he wouldn't go for that, it's not his place.  Superman vs the Elite is based off a darker side of comics where the Justice League was split by a belief that there are some criminals not worth trying to save.  This goes against everything Superman stands for and this movie is not only entertaining, it makes you think.  For all of us who are huge fans of DC comics and their animated adaptations I have to say this one is a definite keeper.  At first the Elite appear as a force to stand along side the Man of Steel and promote justice in all its forms, but over time the Elite's true nature appears, they believe they can be judge, jury, and executioner.  Superman wasn't meant to be political at first but the more the movie progresses the more political the plot seems to get, who is right?  The Elite say that people who commit heinous  crimes should be punished heinously, Superman says everyone deserves a chance for redemption, it's a harder road not to take these people out, it would be easier to skip due process, but due process is the right thing to do.  Superman believes he is a symbol to inspire people to become better than even they believe is possible.  In the end it appears Superman falls away from his principles and takes the Elite's stand, that sometimes you have to put the animals down...  Is this the end of the Man of Steel as we know him?  Find out in Superman vs the Elite!  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
