FINALLY, THIS FILM HAS BEEN MADE AS A DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION CONTAINING 7 ADDITIONAL SCENES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CUT. NOW RUNNING AT 3 HOURS AND 7 MINS., COMPARED 2 IT'S PREVIOUS 2 HOURS AND 49 MINUTES, THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN EVER. WITH 18 MINUTES MORE FOOTAGE RESTORED, THE FILM TELLS MORE OF JUDY'S LIFE AS SHE STRUGGLES 2 MAKE A DECENT LIFE 4 HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN. HAVING HAD 2 OR 3 BAD MARRIAGES, AND HAVING 2 WORK WITH DEVILISTIC MOVIE PRODUCERS WHO ONLY CARED ABOUT THEIR GOD, WHICH IS MONEY, JUDY WORKS NIGHT AND DAY IN ORDER 2 MAKE ENDS MEAT. HARDLY EVER HAVING ANY REST, SHE UN-EXHAUSTINGLY TAKES PEP PILLS 2 KEEP UP HER STRENGTH. I REALLY FELT SORRY 4 HER. SHE DEFINATELY DID NOT DESERVE THIS KIND OF BRUTAL TREATMENT. HER MOTHER WILL ALWAYS B GUILTY 4 STARTING HER ON THOSE PEP PILLS. HER FATHER, WHO WAS A SICKO CHEATING ON HIS WIFE WITH MEN, WAS JUDY'S ONLY EMOTIONAL ANCHOR 2 GET THROUGH WHAT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH UNTIL HE DIED. HER FINAL HUSBAND WAS THERE 4 HER UNTIL THE VERY END OF HER LIFE IN JUNE 1969. JUDY WAS IN THE EIGHTH YEAR OF HER FORTIES [47]. HER LEGACY WILL LIVE ON 4-EVER. THIS FILM, NOW RE-FORMATTED 2 WIDESCREEN, LOOKS MORE LIKE A MOVIE. JUDY DAVIS AND TAMMY BLANCHARD DID A TERRIFIC JOB OF PORTRAYING JUDY GARLAND. BRAVO 2 BOTH ACTRESSES.
