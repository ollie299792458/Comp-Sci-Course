What happened to Julie Stiles and Ben Miller? Other actors have been changed also. Why bother making this a sequel if you don't have the same people?  If they wanted to make this movie, it should have just been a stand alone instead of tying it to a previous movie.

I didn't care for the change of actors.  I also can't imagine a girl who would go through all that and still hang around a while after he would not answer that he would not give her up for the throne and immediately make plans to marry someone else.  Get real!  She found the loop hole after all that!  It wasn't until the last minute that he decided he loved her more than the throne but she had been working all that time to find the loophole.  Instead of just having someone tell the "wicked" girl that they weren't getting married, they tried to make something comical by locking her in a room and having her ride a horse, fall in the mud and run in the church.  I'm sure that was supposed to be funny but it was just stupid.  The change in actors, the bad acting and the attempts at humor in this movie actually made it just sad.  A movie with the theme of prince and "norm" could have been pulled off with a re-write, not being tied to another movie as a sequel, break-up with the "princess" and a prince who showed his loved instead of getting immediately engaged to another woman.
