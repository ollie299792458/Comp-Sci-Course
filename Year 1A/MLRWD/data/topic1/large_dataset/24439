Imagine the story of "Enchanted April" reworked by the devious mind of Patricia Highsmith and you'll get an idea of the kind of kinky pleasure that awaits the viewer of this film. Here we have two women sharing a lovely country cottage in a romantic locale. But instead of discovering love, they discover hidden animosities, secret connections, and murder. But the story is not entirely downbeat. In fact, it shares a number of similarities with the Diane Keaton/Jack Nicholson comedy, "Something's Gotta Give." Both films feature a successful fiftysomething female author who is enjoying the solitary life in a beautiful country cottage when suddenly everything is turned upside down by the unexpected arrival of an oversexed commitment-phobe. In "Something's Gotta Give" the unexpected guest is the boyfriend of the author's daughter. In "Swimming Pool" the guest is the daughter of the author's boyfriend. As in "Something's Gotta Give," the author/protagonist takes an early disliking to the intruder and then, over the course of the picture, gradually revises her early opinion until, ultimately, a strong bond is formed between the two of them. In both films the author's creative juices are reenergized by the stranger's arrival. Each author ends up producing her best work simply by writing about her relationship with the intruder who has so topsy-turvied her life. The movie is funny, intriguing, beautifully photographed and flawlessly acted. Overall, it's a more truthful picture than "Something's Gotta Give" and a more exciting picture than "Enchanted April."
