Reviewer Robert Graves (another Amazon customer) voiced the same concerns I have with the show.  They pick easy targets and are guilty of the same problem they accuse others of: fudging or overstating facts.  The episode on second-hand smoke is the most obvious.  The EPA findings are old and new studies show second hand smoke exposure is harmful.  Penn and Teller skew the statistics (which most over zealous skeptics do).  Of course someone who sits in a bar for 10 minutes isn't at high risk, but a waitress working there is.

Other errors include genetically-modified foods: still too early to gauge long term effects not just on people, but ecologically.  They also failed to mention the overuse of milk-producing hormones in cows.  Debunking ESP also lacked the mountains of verifiable data indicating some form of ESP does actually exist.  This has been scientifically tested worldwide and is not new-age mysticism.

Another problem is their "experts" are themselves practioners of what the same skeptics use to consider pseudo-science such as psychology and socialogy.  That's hypocritical.

Otherwise, this is an entertaining show with good pacing to keep viewers interested.  Extras are watchable, but some of it may be filler.  Video and audio quality are great, but is geared towards documentary tv so your 5.1 audio system is going to get little use.
