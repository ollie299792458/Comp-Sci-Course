There were two themes in this move.  The theme of prejudice, and the "go to hell, authority" theme.
This movie captured the moralistic attitude of the original episodes where a science fiction world was used to tackle a  present-day problem.  The movie goes into detail about Kirk's prejudice  toward the Klingon race; how the Klingons are different from the rest of  the members of Starfleet.
Through the course of the movie, other people  are shown to have taken a more extremist stance in their prejudice toward  the Klingons than Kirk, which makes him reevaluate his own prejudice.  Isn't that what happens in life?  We are born with prejudices.  We have  examples of people who fight against those prejudices and people who  epitomize prejudice.  We embrace the fight and scorn those who embody  prejudice.
This movie, more than any other Star Trek movie, exploited  Kirk's defiant attitude.  Every chance to scorn authority was taken by  every regular member of the Enterprise. Spock even says in response to  authority, "If I were human, I believe my response would be ... go to hell ...  if I were human."
Worf's minor part in defending Kirk in a Klingon court  was a much better bridge between the series than Generations. In addition,  displaying the signatures of the main cast at the end was an incredible and  fitting final tribute.
