Flawless performance by the master and his band. Despite his mind-bending technical abilities his playing seems even more lyrical, more than what one can say about most of his "high speed" contemporaries, especially in the Metal genre where the boys just rip off endless arpeggios. Sound quality excellent and cameral work gives one a good picture of what's going on. The latest issue of "Guitar Player" has an interview with Joe about the DVD. Two possibly interesting factoids: He was eager to work with the brothers Lamoureux, but was a bit bummed out by the size of the stage (small), although it doesn't appear cramped. Because this was filmed in 3D, camera angles and the positioning of the players had to be tightly controlled to avoid articfacts, and he couldn't do things like point his guitar at the camera. Hence, there are only a few camera angles used and the boys don't move around a whole lot on stage, but that's OK as there is still ample coverage of what's going on and this set up is probably preferable to some concert videos where the camera bounces around every few seconds for some new shot.

One word of warning about the DVD: The Blu-Ray version is advertised as either 2D or 3D. I don't have 3D and this DVD wouldn't load. Amazon sent me a replacement; same story, wouldn't load. I got the non-Blu-Ray version ($1.00 cheaper) and it works fine. Problem might be at my end as I've had some 2D Blu-Rays that wouldn't load, and I've been through 3 different DVD players in the last year. (Even weirder, I've got a Stevie Vai concert that used to play, now it won't - go figure.)

All-in-all, one of Joe's best performances backed by a great band. I thought this version of "Crystal Planet" was a bit strange, but "Why" just blew me away. If you like Satriani you gotta own this DVD.
