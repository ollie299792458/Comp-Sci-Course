This film is so close to being a truly great, great sci-fi epic.  But the flaws are so painfully fatal...I have been fond of this film since I was a child and in later years realized just how close they came to greatness.  What's great: it is the most visually stunning sci-fi film ever made (the wayward Cygnus ship, while completely impractical for its supposed purpose, is a masterpiece of sci-fi gothic weirdness), inspired casting and performances (notably from Maximilian Schell as the mad Dr. Reinhardt, Anthony Perkins as impressionable science officer Alex, cowardly reporter Ernest Borgnine, and stalwart commander Robert Forrester), a fantastic premise, majestic musical score in parts (but not so great in other parts), a wildly trippy but nonsensical ending worthy of "Clockwork Orange" mixed with "Fantasia", and one of the most genuinely frightening villains ever in the mechanized Frankenstein monster created by Reinhardt named Maximilian.  With such a great premise and dark atmosphere, it is shocking at how cheesy and just plain bad the dialogue is.  Perhaps it is the fact that it was a Disney film, they couldn't fully commit to the dark masterpiece they almost had on their hands.  The cheesy robots Vincent and `Old Bob' are hard to take (clearly created to attract the kids, Disney tried to create another R2D2 and C3PO).  Some of the supporting cast falls off precipitously from the quality of the big names.  The action sequences could have been done a lot better as well.  A fascinating case study of an almost great film, but I love it anyway.  Of all of the remakes out there, this is the one that I think is most ripe for another look and to be done right.
