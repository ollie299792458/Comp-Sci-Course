I recently saw The Hired Hand for the first time, so I don't have a reference point for 30 years ago.  I agree that it is not the fast paced, action packed western with which we have become so accustomed.  As an historian, I have to say that it is a more realistic presentation of the time period.  Life was not easy,smooth or filled with shootings, robberies and other mayhem.  It was the difficult and boring routine of life on the frontier.
I loved the simplistic, downplayed acting and dialogue as well as the magnificent cinematography.  I understand that for die hard fans of the more robust, action packed western adventures it may have been boring.  But for many of us the subtleties of life, relationships and personalities was great.  One must understand the reality of life during this time period to truly appreciate this movie.  Like life, there was no happy ending with song, rainbows and heroism so often seen in not only western movies, but other genres as well.  I found the poignancy and realism to be most refreshing and enjoyable.  I rate it 4 stars.
