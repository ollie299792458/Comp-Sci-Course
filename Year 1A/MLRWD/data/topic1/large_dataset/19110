So, the who are not kids anymore, but they're still alright.
I've been a fan of the Who since I first heard "Happy Jack" way back when. I remember buying the single and playing the grooves off of it.
This turned me on to one of the greatest rock bands in history, and I never lost my enthusiasm. I'm glad this two DVD set came out, and I'm glad it revealed the ups and downs the band has had over thier long career.
Glad because it shows the Who as a bunch of human beings with all the faults and shortcomings of any human being. But, it also shows them in thier glory, as the greatest rock band you could ever imagine. The sheer power and brute force of the Who is shown, as well as the tender side.
The recording session for "Real Good Looking Boy" is excellent stuff.
By the way, Zak Starkey looks just like his dad, even if his drumming style is different. And seeing the great Greg Lake on bass was a real treat! Anyhow, this is great stuff, this DVD, and if you're a Who fan you should get it. If you're a Who fan, you already know most of it anyway, but you should still get it.
