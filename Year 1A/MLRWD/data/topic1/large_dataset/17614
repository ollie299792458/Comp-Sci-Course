or not.  This is one of the best Burton films ever, and even maybe is the best Burton movie.  It has alot of big stars in it like, Jack Nicholson, Peirce Brosnan, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, and Jack Black.  Althou, this film may be a little graphic, it is still a movie for the family.  I have one question, it says Danny DeVito has a big part in this movie, but he's only in it for about 10-15 min, and maybe even less.  People with big BIG parts are rare in this film, cause all the main charcters die, which I think is stupid.  At least let Jack or Peirce live.  Anyway, ok when it comes to features.  The trailer I thought was pretty good, and the picture was perfect with the odd flaw.  The sound was EXELLENT.  To me, nothing seemed wrong with the sound.  On the disk of this, it says it is rated R, but on the back, it says PG-13.  I must say I disagree with both of those.  I think it should be rated PG.  One of my favortite parts in this film is when the aliens come to earth for the first time.  The ending is hilarious...You'll have to watch and find out.  So, this is a great and hilarious film and is one of Burtons best.  I highly recommend you ordering or picking up your copy of Mars Attacks, right this instant.
9/10
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi fantasy, violence and brief sexuality.
