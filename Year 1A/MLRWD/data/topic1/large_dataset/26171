So, obviously I am a bit biased. But this is a movie I have returned to several times over the years. The existential issues it raises are so universal that I think it will be relevant forever. Fantastic performance by Jeff Bridges. Early performance by one of my favorite actors, Benicio del Toro. 
I was working at Virtus Corporation in 1991 late on a Friday evening when I received a call from Suzanne Peck, the art designer for the film. At that time we were teaching our 3-D design software for Macintosh at the American Film Institue in LA. Peter Weir had heard about our software and was interested in having it for one of the scenes. I think that there was originally more background to a character named Nutty Nick. But I guess he was cut from the film. Suzanne asked me to create a 3D model of the Nutty Nick's project and save it as a real-time 3D model for Bridges and De Lancey (Q from Star Trek), playing partners in an architecural firm, to review in one scene on the plane. I created the model over the weekend and sent it to Paramount for shooting by Monday afternoon. I had forgotten all about it until I went to the movie two years later and saw my work on screen. I didn't make the connection because all of my correspondence with Weir and Suzanne had the movie titled "Joyride". This was one of the first examples of real-time 3-D "CAD" software in a motion picture. 
Get this movie and watch it on rainy afternoons. It will definitely give you some perspective on life.
