For reasons I struggle daily to understand, this movie has been all but forgotten. I never hear it mentioned by my peers -- even huge film buffs I frequently speak with have told me they haven't seen it. Why?
Every great movie begins with a great script, and that's what screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had when he penned this dialogue-heavy satire of network television in the late 70's. But the script alone would not have sealed the deal, for it would take a truly talented cast to bring to life a script of this caliber.
And, boy, did they land a superb one. William Holden ("The Wild Bunch", Best Actor: "Stalag 17") plays a network head ready to hit retirement when he is told he must fire network news anchor and long-time friend Howard Beale (Oscar winner for this role, Peter Finch). Beale's nationally-televised response is hilarious and gives rise to a series of televised rants, including one of the most famous moments in movie history, the "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!". It isn't long after that Beale has become a national TV sensation.
As great as this moment is, the rest of the film is hardly ever mentioned (though it did secure a spot in AFI's Top 100 Films of all time) despite sizzling performances by Faye Dunaway (in an Oscar-winning role) as the television-obsessed Diana Christensen, Robert Duvall as the "take no prisoners" Frank Hackett, Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen (in THE smallest part to ever garner a Best Supporting Actor nomination), Beatrice Straight (who also won an Oscar) as Holden's wife, and Marlene Warfield as the "[.....] Commie ______" Laureen Hobbs!
I urge you to rent first, then buy one of the greatest American satires ever made and winner of 4 Oscars (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay) and nominee for 6 more (including Best Picture, Director and Cinematography)... "Network".
