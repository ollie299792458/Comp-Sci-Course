I am a fan of melancholy movies, and I am a fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman. These alone made this a good movie for me.  Hoffman's Jack cares deeply for Amy Ryan's Connie, and puts so much effort into learning to cook a perfect meal for her, and learning to swim so that one day they might go boating.

His friend Clyde and Lucy are supportive of his efforts, as Clyde teaches Jack to swim, and both Clyde and Lucy encourage him as he practices his cooking.  But Clyde and Lucy's own relationship is fragile, with troubles that gradually build and eventually erupt in ways that quickly change the tone of the movie.

I was surprised at what I felt was a sudden shift in where the movie was headed, but in the end I really liked the movie for all its ups and downs.  All four lead characters were well played, with Hoffman and Ryan standing out as troubled people who want to find love.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman seems to gravitate toward characters who challenge you to care about them (his role in Love Liza, in particular, was a challenge).  His role in Jack Goes Boating is no exception.  If you've liked his work in roles up to now, you will no doubt like this one as well.
