Can someone PLEASE tell me why Elizabeth Berkely has top bill in this movie? With Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn on the bill, why does she even get honorable mention? This is a great movie, full of fun and full of tears. When three former schoolmates (and ex-wives) all find themselves being jerked around by their philandering husbands, they decide to take matters into their own hands and get a little 'first wives' justice. The result is a hilarious comedy where 3 former husbands find out just what slime balls they really are, and first wives don't simply go away when they get a bit old and baggy.  Goldie is the best choice for the aging actress, Diane plays the mousy one who can't make a decision, and Bette is the connsumate Jewish housewife who finds herself replaced by a 20 year old bimbo who lives well, while she and her son struggle to make the rent. Maggie Smith lends her considerable talent to this movie, and the result is a hilarious comedy that evey jilted wife whishes she'd thought of. In the end, revenge isn't the sweetest thing, but friendship and outreach to other hurt women is. The music is great and fits each scene, A fun show for all.
