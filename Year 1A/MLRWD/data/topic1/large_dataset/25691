Based on a biographical novel and narrated by a teenager, this powerful story reveals a portion of the holocaust story that I had never understood. A family of three flees to Kenya as the Nazis take power in Germany, leaving the rest of their family behind, ultimately to perish. Leaving took both foresight and pessimism. Staying involved (what proved to be misguided) belief in the strength of German culture. This is one of the great lessons of the story. A second lesson is adaptation. Survival in Kenya is not easy, but the child, Regina, adapts better than her parents, who struggle with the loss of their social status and find themselves in constant conflict. Regina learns three native languages and accepts native customs with ease. Ultimately, she attends an English school, where she excels despite the disdain of her teachers. Throughout the story, the family cook provides Regina with love and support. Her bond with him is deep and constant. No review would be complete without mentioning the beautiful cinematography. And be sure to watch the special features on the second disk after you see the movie to more fully appreciate how and why the movie was made.
