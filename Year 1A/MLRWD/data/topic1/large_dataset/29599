This is a great film. I've loved it since I first saw it when it premiered. Anyone who likes Gilliam's work should like this film. The DVD commentary is excellent and features Gilliam, Palin, Cleese, Warner, and Warnock. Definitely buy the Criterion version if you can.
There are a couple things that need to be clarified though:
1) the film is a) NOT a Monty Python film, it is a Terry Gilliam film; and b) NOT a comedy like Python films but a dark comedy/fable like Brazil. 
2) the Criterion version is "Director Approved." That means it's shown the way the director intended. As one other review thanklessly pointed out, letterboxing does crop some of the picture, but that's how it's shown in the theater. People claiming that the DVD is a "butchered" version of the film don't know what they're talking about. Any picture that you can see in the pan-and-scan version (what DVD "Standard" and most VHS formats are) was not meant to be seen. Pan-and-scan is the butchering.
