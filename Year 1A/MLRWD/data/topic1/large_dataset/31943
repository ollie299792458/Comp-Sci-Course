The Cowboys is not your standard John Wayne Western movie. Two big differences. First off, due to circumstances, the Duke has to work with schoolboys for this cattle drive. A task he is not too found of, but that he takes head on. But, I guess that is the main point of the movie...what would it take to teach school boys how to handle a man's job. According to this movie, a whole lot of man sized training. Second, John Wayne dies in the movie, and pretty early by Wetern standards. I was a little surprised by this turn of events, but is does help make the main bad guy out to be much meaner than most since he guns the Duke down in cold blood.

Apparently, the movie was pretty controversial when released, I can see why given some of the tough love that the Duke shows the boys. I have a feeling that this movie still has a place in a young man's life, despite some of the violence it invokes. If you are a John Wayne fan, then you should see this movie. It is very interesting with some tough lessons from a hard time.
