The Motorcycle Diaries is one of the most beautiful and engaging films I have seen in a long time. At the risk of sounding corny, it had enormous impact upon me, as it made me reconsider my sense of self-worth and imperative. The experiences and achievements of Ernesto and Alberto makes the viewer pause to reassess the potential of a human being's life and experiences, and I think that this is all the more significant for this film because it shows the two mens' experiences BEFORE Ernesto becomes the 'Che' of international renown. I was left with a feeling of the true scope of experience that one can conceivably attain in a lifetime, and frankly, it made my life seem quite inadequate in comparison, and thus gives the viewer a sense of drive and purpose, a feeling of unfulfilled destiny.

But the film has a lot to offer other than this. The scenery, as so many reviewers have already mentioned, is breathtakingly, awe-inspiringly, beautiful (as is Gael Garcia Bernal...). Bernal gives an impassioned and nuanced (for the lack of a better word) performance as Che, capturing the sensibility of pre-revolutionary Che in a quite refreshingly non-political manner. But for me the performance of Rodrigo de la Serna as Alberto was the real standout. He was so charismatic and full of vibrancy that it was impossible not to fall for his character. The interaction between the two leads was wonderful and the whole film makes for an entirely fulfilling experience, one of the best movie experiences of past years.
