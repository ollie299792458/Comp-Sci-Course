A very powerful movie, by all means.

I think it is a movie that will be enjoyed by many. The cast is amazing; from Redgrave to Fry. I also believe that this was by far one of the best performances given by Jude Law, as the lover of Wilde. I always thought all his performances turn out to be powerful and at times honest, but very similar to each other in general. But here, he molds himself around such a different personality, it is very hard to dismiss his existence and influence to the story depicted here, even in the scenes where he is not present.

Both Jude Law, and Jennifer Ehle could turn out to be two-dimensional, slightly 'whatever' characters, but they are truly much more than what you would expect. They were not dry, and their relationships with Fry were written and acted wonderfully.

A good script, very powerful performances, never loses momentum, decisiveness, or its artistic strength. Plus, many young talents as Orlando Bloom, Ioan Gruffudd, Adam Garcia can be seen in small roles, which is a factor that makes this movie come off as even more precious.
