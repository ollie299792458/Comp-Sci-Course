The Condemned was a wild movie. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. It is about a group of cons that are on death row that are taken to an island by a guy that is putting them in a snuff film on the internet. He promises them that they must fight each other to the death and the last person left alive will be set free with a new life and alot of money.
The cons are brought to the island with an ankle bracelet on that is a bomb. If they try to remove it they will blow up. If another con fights them and pulls a red tab on the side of their ankle they will blow up. It will be removed for the survivor only. The convicts are eight men and 2 women.
The main character is con Jack Austin (Steve Austin). He was left in a Central American prison by the U.S. Government after doing work for them and getting caught. His main focus after getting on the island is getting to the base he seen when they were arriving by helicopter. He fights to stay alive. He is the only "good" guy there.
The fights they have, the explosions of people can make a stomach turn..or at least it did mine, but the movie is exciting! I do not want to say to much more because I do not want to give away want happens with the "game" of survival and at the end.
Watch it! You'll love it!
