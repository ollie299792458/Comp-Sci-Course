If this movie had been released by a major studio, Anthony Hopkins would have received an Academy Award nomination.  It's like he crawled inside Burt Munro's skin and made the character his own.  Rather than a simpleton, as some reviewers have characterized Munro, you have to see the man in the context of the 60s.  He came from a relatively unsophisticated country where there are more sheep than people - and where people are supposed to care about their fellow man.  And it was that willingness to accept his fellow man (or transvestite as the case may be) and the expectation that his fellow man would extend the same courtesy to him that makes this movie work.

I found it completely plausible that the motorcyle gang that would want to test their mettle against Burt in one moment, would be the first in line to donate 'beer money' when they learned he was off to Bonneville to race his bike.

Similarly I could see that the well-financed commercial team members would look upon Burt as a pitiful figure, but also see in him a reminder of why they got involved in time trial racing at places like Bonneville in the first place.  There is a difference between innocence & naivete and being a simpleton, and IMO Hopkin's character never crosses that line.

The movie is as much a characer study than an action movie, so while it takes a bit to get moving, it's worth the wait.  And certainly I'll never be inclined to tell a neighbor to mow the lawn again.

This is a damned good movie, that even non-bikers will appreciate.
