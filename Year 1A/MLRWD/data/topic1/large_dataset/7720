That phrase replaces "Make my day" and "This is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world..." as the new one-liner in this solid final chapter to the classic Dirty Harry series. 
When one sees a sequel to a movie as great as DIRTY HARRY (1971), you can't expect it to be as good as the original. But you can expect it to further evolve Clint's classic character and provide good action and deadpan humor. THE DEAD POOL delivers on both counts.
In this movie (which SCREAM 3 seemed to borrow heavily from) a murderer obsessed with the films of Peter Swan (played convincingly by Liam Neeson of DARKMAN fame), a horror movie veteran, takes his identity and begins to commit murders similar to those in the movies. Like in THE ENFORCER, the third part in the series, Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is teamed up with a minority for a partner to "make the department's image look better. However, the partner chemistry here is far less forced than in ENFORCER and is very entertaining.
THE DEAD POOL is a movie that will make your... well, you know the rest.
