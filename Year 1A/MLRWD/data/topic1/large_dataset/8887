Brilliant.  Simply and completely a well thought out and well conceived film.  In the day and age of the big-budget shoot-em-up, or the film of actual quality that lasts for seven and a half days - Lock, Stock sets  itself apart by miles and miles.  The cast - largely unknown in the US  really is impeccable.  In a leather jacket, witty dialogue, guns, drugs and  thugs film, it is really easy to fall into a cliche when creating  characters, but Guy Ritchie tapdances all about the line and never trips  once.  In a film this short it really is amazing how so many characters  can be fleshed out so fully and so many plotlines interwoven.  The music is  fantastic and Ritchie's background in video direction is evident in the  most stylish of shots, even when the camera is stationary.  Though you may  recognize Sting in this film, it really is the main four (Ed, Bacon -  personal favorite, Soap (the amazing Dexter Fletcher) and Tom) who drive  this unusual and clever film to it's excruciatingly clever ending.  80's  film buffs will recognize a cameo from the one and only "Young  Sherlock Holmes," who has apparently put down the cocaine and violin  and opted for a joint and an air rifle.  Folks, you miss this one - you  miss out.  Period.
