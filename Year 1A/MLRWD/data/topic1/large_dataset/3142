Wall Street is truly a great film that accurately portrays attitudes of the 80's and unfortunately the 90's as well. The acting, directing, storyline, camera-work, is all superb. The film shows the attitudes concerning money and how important money was and is. More important than friends, more important than people, more important than life itself. One thing that suprised me was one reviewer's comment that they know many people that don't think Gekko,the greedy villian in the film, did anything wrong. That guy who wrote that really needs to get out of the Pat Buchanan Dinner Parties and start waking up to the real world! Not that using people to get money, breaking the law to get more money, have relationships with people that like you only for your money, greed is right philosophy is bad or anything, but the guy stated that "(making a great profit on a real estate investment) felt better than sex!" That alone should make the man worthy of ridicule!
Another comment I had issue with was that you had to be a "bleeding heart" to believe that capitalism is unfair and promotes greed. I mean, even honest people that are pro-capitalist will concede that capitalism is unfair and that it does tend to restrict wealth to narrow sectors of the population. I don't know you're definition of unfair is, but it sure seems like its unfair to me. Honest capitalists will only argue that " by gosh, its the best system we've got, Look at whats it did in Latin America for crying out loud, Socialism is a failure, look at Sweden for example!"(Recently voted by the UN as the best place to live in the world, US didn't make the top 5) etc.
