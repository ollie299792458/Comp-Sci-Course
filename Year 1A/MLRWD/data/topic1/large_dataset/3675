Having read a few negative reviews about the Revolutions, I wanted to drop in my five cents.  What this movie lacked in romance and dialogue, it more than made up in action and special effects.  Here are some comments:
1.  What's with Neo's child dialogues?  "I have decided to bla bla bla.."  Trinity asks: "why?" "Because I bla bla.."  "What?"... And it goes on.  The brothers need to work on the scripts.
2.  In the Revolutions, Morpheus was a follower rather than a leader.  He had lost all his charisma that we were used to in the Matrix and Reloaded.  Moreover, I was expecting more romance between Naobi and Morpheus, maybe in place of the lousy dialogue about change.
3.  Is the senate abnormally calm or what!  Just like the machines.. Such an irony.
4.  Cool story line.  I liked how it all linked to one another in the end.  However the end was expected, specifically from the speech that Senate member gave to Neo about how humans needed the machines and the humans needed machines (Reloaded).
Anyway, long story short, watch the movie.  It is worth the time and money.
