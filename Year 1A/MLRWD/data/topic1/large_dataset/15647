I just received this DVD last night and viewed the first disc (I haven't even gotten to the second one!) and I can tell that THIS is a keeper! This was once, way back in the early 1970s, my FAVORITE FILM, my personal "Star Wars" before there was a "Star Wars". I saw it at LEAST 5 times in the theater! However, until last night, I hadn't seen this film in its entirety in, I estimate, about 30 years! And it is GREAT!!! Beautiful widescreen image (I can only imagine how great it looks on a 16x9 TV screen), an audio commentary with director Ken Annakin, James Macarthur (Book 'em, Danno!), Tommy Kirk (Tommy Kirk!?!? Where has he been all these years?!?) and Kevin "Moochie" Corcoran, and a Donald Duck cartoon!
The film is impressive for a number of reasons -- special effects were either in-camera or so well done that you aren't aware of them, and the stunts! The stunt work was coordinated by the great movie stuntman Yakima Canutt (who worked for many years with John Wayne), and let me tell you -- the gag in the Endor battle in "Return of the Jedi" was taken directly from this film (I won't give it away, it's terrific when it happens).
One of Disney's best live-action films, and definitely fun for everyone (no matter how big your family is)!
