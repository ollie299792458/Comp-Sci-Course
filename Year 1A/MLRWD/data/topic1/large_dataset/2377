First, I want to make it clear that I'm reviewing the DVD here, not the original film.  I liked the original; it's a good movie.  Not as fantastic as it is hyped to be, but good enough to have on DVD for an occasional viewing.  I give the film 4 stars.
I have BIG problems with what's behind this DVD, and the "special edition" of ET that's on it.
The 2002 edition of ET is just absurd.  As others pointed out, CGI ET looks silly, and isn't consistent with the "old" scenes that include ET.  His stiffness was part of his physical character.  Making him more "jar-jar" just doesn't make sense.  It's an example of "lets do it because we can".  There are lots of thing we "can" do that we "should not" do, and this is one of them.
But much worse than this is the digital removal of the guns.  Not only was this poorly done (from a technical point of view), but it's an example of Political Correctness(tm) gone mad.  Guess what: government agents and cops carry guns, and they point them at people/things that they are trying to stop/apprehend.  Get over it.
I hate to see a work of art like ET defaced just to appease a loud, misguided minority of people who believe in political correctness.  Bowing to this minority was a cowardly act.
Finally, the packaging Universal has chosen is obnoxious.  The only way to get the original film is to buy a very expensive "gift boxed set", filled with things I do NOT want.  I'm willing to pay for a boxed set, but only if it contains the following items: Original movie with original 5.1 sound track, commentary track(s), deleted scenes, making of and/or retrospective featurettes. That's it.  This would probably fit on one disc, making a boxed set unnecessary. ...
