Brian Moore is one of my favorite novelists, with Black Robe being one of my favorite novels ever.  This film adaptation of his celebrated novel is true to the spirit of the novel.  I recently showed this movie to some prisoners at a state prison in Mississippi where I visit them each week.  They very much appreciated the film, especially how the title character struggles with his own demons, particularly with is feelings of lust.  Moore used the journals kept by the Jesuit priests as the source and inspiration for this book.  In an interview, he talked about how the zeal and conviction of these missionaries speak of a faith that is not commonly seen in our modern world.  Jean de Brebeuf, Isaac Jogues, and the North American Jesuit martyrs are the models of this amazing journey. And it was the famous English novelist Graham Greene who recommended to Moore to write this novel, believe it or not. Moore was a lapsed Catholic, but Catholicism and the spiritual quest are frequent themes in his writings.  See the movie, but also read the book.

I myself spent three years as a missionary in Canada.  Two years of that time was spent in the city of Winnipeg, serving in an inner-city soup kitchen.  Many of the people who came to us for bowls of soup were members of the First Nations tribes of Canada.  This story very much resonates with me, and inspired my own missionary work in Canada and South America, and currently in the Mississippi Delta where I serve as a Catholic priest.  John the Baptist was a voice crying out in the wilderness, preparing the way of the Lord.  The voice of these brave missionaries cries out to us as well.
