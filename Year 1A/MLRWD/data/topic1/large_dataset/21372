I am a student at Nagoya International School.  Japanese is my first language, but I have studied English in my International School.  And I was fortunate to see "Throne of Blood" in my English literature class.  After viewing the movie, I found Kurosawa's Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth was a spectacular masterpiece.  "Throne of Blood" altered the setting of the story, but still kept the atmosphere of the original Macbeth, which was set in Scotland.  I was afraid that the Japanese language in the movie would spoil the rich Shakespearian language included in the film.  But Kurosawa kept the theme of Macbeth alive in the film by modifying couple of characters and plots of the story.  For example, because witches aren't familiar to the Japanese in the 16th century, they replaced the witch by an evil spirit, Mononoke.  Also, Kurosawa excluded characters like Macduff.  So in the movie, the Mononoke didn't give the prophecy of "Beware of Macduff" and "Be afraid of no women born".  Other than that, virtually all of the plot and characters were the same as the original version of Macbeth.  This exhibits the fact that Kurosawa has successfully managed to keep the mood and the theme of Macbeth alive in the film.
