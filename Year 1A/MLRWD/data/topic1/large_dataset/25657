Steven Speilberg's Jurassic Park, is a classic example of the power of movie's to use special effects to generate money - real movie magic.  And the special effects are dazzlingly realist, the dinosaurs are alive and superb, and the action sequences are tense.  The story, by M. Crichton, was well thought out and impressive.  The plot is a good one mixed with many horror-movie type scenes as well as Speilberg's off the cuff sense of humor.  The only shortcomings of the film were the screenplay by Crichton and the un-satisfying ending by Speilberg.  The screenplay lacked many of the important issues brought up in the book such as the dinosaur's escape from the island and the international effect of the prehistoric creatures on the world.  And Speilberg's ending was too unrealistic.  No one spoke of the dinosaurs running wild or of the island's fate.  They just said, `park's closed.'  Both of the shortcomings in script and end leave the viewer wondering what for - it was such an interesting idea.  Will the dinosaurs migrate as they did in the book?  Will the island be destroyed?  I guess Steve Speilberg liked his new dinosaur buddies so much that he's decided to leave it wide open for a Jurassic Park II, only this time it will be called Lost Cash - the money that we missed the last time...
