First, as a movie watcher who rarely likes what hits the screen these days, I truly enjoyed this film.  True, it would have been better 15 minutes shorter, but it wasn't so long as to really bother me.  I think the love interest for Kutcher was unneccessary.  But the movie held my attention and interest and I left the theater thinking, "Man, that was good."

Now, as one of the lucky people that have one of those cool Coast Guard jobs, (a fact that does create some bias) I was suprised by just how close to reality the action stayed.  There were plenty of "hollywood" moments, but many of them were necessary.  I wont bother to explain them all, but the operations center of most air stations is a desk with a couple of phones.  There are video monitors in some of them, but they play movies and football games...no live video feeds from the scene...sorry.

The rescue scenes are very realistic, and the school scenes are not too out-of-line with the actual training.  (warning: punch an instructor in the face during an in water test and he will NOT hug you later.  Get thrown in jail for being drunk and disorderly and you WILL get kicked out) The story didn't show the sometimes months of boredom between rescues or the excitement of a six hour flare sighting search called in by a drunk on the fourth of july from a hotel room...but who would pay to see that?

All in all, I think many of us in the service are proud of the film and liked it very much.

The extras on the DVD are worth the price alone.  Again, I'm biased.
The Guardian is a film worth owning.
