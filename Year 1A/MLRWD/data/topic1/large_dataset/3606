This movie wasn't all that.  Jackie himself says he "didn't like" the movie.  So there you go.  Anyways here are some reasons it wasn't as good as rush hour 2...

 1 not any great fight scenes...  the best parts of it are verbal comedy when chris and jackie are questioning the asian who only speaks french
and when chris makes the cab driver sing the american anthem.
 2.  no story.  there was no story . so the black girl has the names of the triad leaders tatooed on her bald head.. so what??  how many chinese people have the same damn name?  it could be anyone.
 3.  jackie looks damn tired throughout the whole movie.  I was reading his diaries on his website .  he slept like at irregular hours throughout filming and that showed on screen
 4 . chris doesn't look cool anymore.  he's a fat face now.  not the cool slim guy.
 5.  where's  zhang zi yi when you need her.  We are settled with a girl who looks nothing like soo yung and can't speak english who plays soo yung.  And youki kudoh. Damn you spent 140 million and all you can get is her to play the female villain?  sorry youki, but you're old.  next time get some hot chick from asia.
