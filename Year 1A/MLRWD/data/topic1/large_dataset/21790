Absolutely beautiful film that only gets better with age, showcasing one of the great actor, James Stewart's very best performances.

The film tells the story of a close knit family led by patriarch Stewart who is determined to keep his family out of the Civil War and stay to work on there farm in Virginia. However, the war catches up to them eventually and with it comes tragedy,loss,death and finally, hope.
Director Mclagen was mainly known for directing films more of the Action variety, but embues the film with a great subtlety and warmth that connects and involves the viewer in the story.

Stewart's character is a noble character whom the audience can identify with. A good man who is a widower and truly loves and cares for his family and does not believe(rightfully) in the insanity of War. The rest of the cast are absolutely believable in there parts, but it's Stewart that anchors this film.

The film is often classified in the Western genre, but it's really more of a historical Drama and one of cinema's best interpretations of the American Civil War.
Both sides are handled with equally amounts of symapthy and neither are villiainized for the antagonist of this piece is rather war itself than the men involved therein.
Veteran actor George Kennedy has a classic bit as a world weary general who sympathesizes with Stewart's dstraught father who has just had his young son taken prisoner by the Union Army. It's a little scene but it adds alot of weight to the film.

Credit must be given to how unexpected the deaths are presented within this film, adding extra layers of tragedy that makes for a film destined to be labelled a tearjerker.

Easily one of the best films about this most written about topic in American history and one of the most neglected. Certainly worth a reappraisal by audiences seeking entertainment with genuine heart and feeling not dilluted by rampant cynicism.
