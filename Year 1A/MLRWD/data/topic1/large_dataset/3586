Do not heed those who mock Arnold's Schwarzenegger's acting. Acting is more than saying lines, and Arnold pulls \this off well, a very believable barbarian. Also, the understanding of ancient legend and its thematics here is masterful. Whoever made this film understood the dilemma of ancient man, so well portrayed here in so many ways. A mythopoeic synthesis of post-diluvian man involving the iron age cultic struggle against the heroic tradition is executed with monumental genius. The themes of spirit vs flesh are symbolized by the riddle of steel and are embodied in the heroic underworld journey in archetypal combat mythos without losing any background realism. One could almost step into this world. It truly represents the epic soul and has been grossly miscomprehended, on the one hand, by unlearned scoffers who cannot read the symbolic subtext, and on the otherhand by zealous followers of Conan comics who want Howard's version. This film version outstrips Howard's shallow character by far.

I gave only four stars because Conan the Destroyer truly sucks and should be avoided. It should not be watched because it will spoil the experience. Also, I was VERY UPSET about the inclusion of scenes that were cut in the original version. These scenes focus on minor dialogue and characters and weaken the story's climactic ending. If it is possible, try to obtain a version without the edited scenes re-introduced. There is a reason for what editors do. MORONS....
