I'm a Michael Moore fan and was recommended this movie by another Michael Moore fan.

During the first 20 minutes, I thought it was the same old unfocused nitpicking (that has all been debunked in my opinion), but as the movie went on, I started to gain a lot of respect for the filmmaker, especially in his moments of introspection and thoughts about the tricky grey areas of documentary making in general. It was those moments that I thought were the most insightful in regards to the controversy over Michael Moore's films.

My biggest complaint is that he needs to explain the credibility of his most heavily-relied upon interviewees. For example the "lawyer" who comes on trying to diagnose Moore with a Psychological disorder, and Penn Jillette, a very good magician which apparantly qualifies him to be a media critic (though I was surprisingly impressed with Jillette's comments).

There are a couple gripes I have, mostly there are several instances where he either distracts or clouds the issues but a lot of that may have been done trying to mimic Moore's own techniques.

All in all, I think Wilson is a good person with a fairly open mind. The quality of the movie was 3 stars, but I gave him an extra just for being a representative of what civil discourse COULD be like if it ever took hold in America.

I'm still very much a Michael Moore fan, but as I've said for a long time, I'm perfectly okay not calling Moore's movies documentaries but let's not keep calling Fox News "news," because  they're two signs of the same coin. But, I found this movie to be an unexpected step in the right direction.

I can't help but think that Moore would have gladly done an interview with Wilson if Wilson had had the opportunity to explain the true spirit of his film.
