I first saw this movie when it came out in 1975-76....and I thought it was an interesting concept but it just wasn't something that could ever happen....purely science fiction.  Now, 35 years later, with overpopulation and overconsumption of our natural resources and the earth being affected by all of this and crime and well, you begin to think that the author may have been onto something.  But, then again, if you really think about it, our society has always had their own form of population control since the beginning of time....war, and not just military ground wars. Some wars are not so evident as they are disguised as viruses and cancers that kill people before they can reach adulthood... and the ones who do make it to seniors well, they just experiment on them with pharmaceuticals which ends up killing them anyway.  Now that I am an adult and see how things really are in life it's not such a far cry from Logans Run...similar to what we do....just not with that unitard looking outfit...not yet anyway.  A good movie and right on target about how everyone today is obsessed with looks and malls...after all, we do live in a self promoting society, not so different from that prediction (thanks to the advertising media) So, is it just entertainment or an accurate forecast of our future?
...also with the new movie out starring Justin Timberlake this year (2011) called In Time ...there is some plot twist to the same effect....hmmmmm.....are they repeating movie history or are they trying to tell us something?
