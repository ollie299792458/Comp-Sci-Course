Matchstick Men has the aroma of a public rest room with none of the charm. This one's a stinker from beginning to end. A "matchstick man" is a con man. Don't get conned into wasting time or money on this.
A couple of matchstick men work their slimy craft in Los Angeles. We learn every detail of their cons. Too much detail. The characters all smoke, for no apparent reason. We learn the name of the cigarettes. Everyone drinks beer. Yes, we learn the name of the beer. A major plot point is that Roy (Nick Cage) has agoraphobia for which he takes illegally obtained meds. We never learn the name of the medication. In fact, not even Roy knows the name of the medication. He calls the meds "pygmies." How quaint.
Director Ridley Scott films at a strip club where dancers wear bikinis. You see, they were going for that PG-13 rating. Brilliant work! Why not film that scene at a beach and avoid any resemblence to a silly network sitcom?
Now throw in a 14-year-old daughter Roy knew nothing about. Deadbeat Dad warning ahead? I could go on, but you get the point.
