Am I the only one who is annoyed that DC is churning out these movies with just enough adult content that I can't show it to my Kid. I've been in love with superheroes since I first learned to read (way back in the Bronze Age) and although I understand why regular monthly books are targeted at a late 20's audience, I can't figure out why DC is doing this with thier direct to DVD films. The Batman/ Superman Adventures and the JLU cartoons followed a perfect formula...I could get my geek-on and my kid could fall in love with the same characters I grew up loving. So why add just enough boorish and childish "Adult" content that the cartoons only have the narrower appeal? Who needs to hear a hero say "damnit" or actually watch Sinestro torture someone? These qualities have ALWAYS been succesfully implied to older audience members without explicitly being portrayed in a manner that will chase most 5 or 6 year olds out of the room.

Yay for Wolverine and the X-Men, Yay for Spectacular Spider-Man, and BOO for DC direct! I've been a huge fan of Bruce Tim for two decades now, but he should be embarrassed to have his name on this stuff.
