Three problems with this film:

1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.

2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.

3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.

Don't waste your life.
