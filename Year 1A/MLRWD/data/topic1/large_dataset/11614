I thought this was going to be silly and stupid.  Instead, I found it to be wonderful.  I had scen the John Travolta pictures on TV and in magazines for months, and I feared his performance would be a huge disaster.  It is great.  He makes Edna seem so sweet and kind and good.  When she kicks up her heels and dances, it is a thrilling thing to see. There is true joy at work here.  Michelle Pfeiffer is even better.  Who knew she could be so mean?  Even when she's at her most villainous, you have to love her.  Usually Christopher Walken is just weird, but...like Edna...he is basically so good and sweet that you learn to love them as a couple.  Queen Latifah gets 3 big numbers, which I wasn't expecting.  And because I'm so old, I had no idea who Zac was; they have his hair slicked up and back instead of the fluffy Beatles cut I've seen in magazines.  And I was surprised by James Marsden singing and dancing away.  This is really a very good message movie about accepting people with darker skin and heavier body types.  I remember loving the original movie version, so I feared I might hate the musical, but I loved it.  Highly recommended!
