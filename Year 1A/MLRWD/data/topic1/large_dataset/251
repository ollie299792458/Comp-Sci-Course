I thought that was truly a great film. It may be hard for some people to why I think that. This film is about coping with reality by creating fanatasies and the relationship of an artist's life to his art and his art to his life. It's also about the problems Allen's character has dealing with others, problems that he creates. I think Allen accomplished all of these things brilliantly and gives us a picture of an immature artist that other's can relate to. Though the character may not be likable at all, all of us can understand at least a little of what he does.
  This is one of Woody's films heavily influenced by Bergman, specifically his "Wild Strawberries". It also reminded me alot of Fellini's "8 1/2". Allen uses the device of allowing us to see what the character is thinking through his daydreams and his rembrances, like Fellini and Bergman did. Allen also let's us see how Harry imagined the fiction he wrote, fiction which was based upon his own life.  And like Fellini Allen's character interacts with the characters he created in his mind. At the end of 8 1/2 there is a dance of life, where all the characters from the main character's fantasies, rembrances, and real life are all dancing around the completed movie set, celebrating life. At the end of Deconstructing Harry there is a celebration of neurosis where Harry accepts his award in front of his imagined characters and some people from his real life. While Fellini and Bergman may have celebrated life and death respectively, Allen celebrates neurosis.
  I don't think I've adequately explained what makes this movie great. I think you would have to see Wild Strawberries and 8 1/2 and then this movie to truly understand. I think this film spoke to me so much because I am also a writer, I don't know if a non-artist would respond to it the same way. But I know that this is a film masterpiece and I hope that it's not the last one Woody has for us.
