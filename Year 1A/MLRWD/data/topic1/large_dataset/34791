This is a touching, often funny, and sensitive story about relationships that is quite simply, human. Loneliness and the need for love and companionship are universal, regardless of sexual orientation or age. Promoting this film as a "gay interest" story does the work a great disservice.
This story is about a widowed father (Harry) and his adult son (Jeff). They have a strong, open relationship, and a friendship beyond the parent/child bond. Things get tangled when romance enters the picture, as each one is having a hard time finding his soul-mate, and molding a new sense of family. 
When Jeff meets someone special, Dad tries so hard to put his date at ease, that the evening falls apart before it gets started. I literally squirmed watching it happen, knowing that feeling of wanting to "make it all better" for my kid, and conversely having been the mortified kid who desperately did not want all the "help". 
As open and accepting as Harry is, he still struggles with his own feelings about his mother's choice of life partner, and he begins to see things differently in retrospect. His look back at decisions made for them near the ends of their lives brought me to tears. Both Harry and Jeff are portrayed sensitively and multi-dimensionally, and they are people I would like to know.
