The DVD is as carefully put together as the novella, and the people in it look just as you hope and expect they will.

Scott=Thomas, the best known of the actors in the movie, has what appears at first to be a minor role, but it doesn't stay that way. She is excellent in this non-glamorous role.  It is impossible to discuss some of the more important aspects of the story without giving too much away...perhaps it is enough to say: things are not what they seem (I think that's the name of one of Matty's ---Scott-Thomas's--stories). The young hero has a beautiul voice, gentle and caressing, and the villain is an excellent actor, with a perfect appearance for his role. The movie should be rated R; I imagine it is...
