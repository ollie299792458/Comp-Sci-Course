I first saw this film when it came out, in my local Arts centre. Being a big fan of French cinema in general, I had high hopes of a rewarding experience. However...
The first annoying thing was an irritating technique employed by Rohmer whereby characters moved around as if coming to life in a water-colour wash from the period in which the film was set. This was all right to start with, but rapidly became irksome. Then there was the sound of heavy-heeled shoes banging on wooden floorboards (a la "Chalcon the Painter" amd "The Draughtsman's Contract"), something else that was meant to convey period atmosphere but which began to grate on the nerves along with the animated water-colour business. Worst of all, however, was the story itself. It was (I assume) meant to be a take on the Scarlet Pimpernel idea - virtuous aristos and their sympathisers outwitting the dastardly revolutionaries. However, the revolutionaries were far more sympathetic as characters than the putative heroes. Before long I was hoping the revolutionaries would hurry up, decapitate the aristos, and let us all go home. The titular heroine was played by Lucy Russell, who struggled bravely with an impossibly unsympathetic and poorly-written role - my heart went out to her when she was supposed to emote horror at the sight of an aristo's head on the end of a pike being waved in front of her face, but was only able to look as if she'd just seen the price of organic vegetables at Sainsbury's.
I tried valiantly to stay and use the awful experience to brush up my French aural comprehension skills, but about 30 minutes into it my legs declared independence and took themselves and the rest of me out of the cinema - only the second time I've walked out of a film I've paid full-price to see (the first time was with Hugh Hudson's execrable "Revolution"). Avoid at all costs and "Sauve qui peut" if anyone comes near you with it.
