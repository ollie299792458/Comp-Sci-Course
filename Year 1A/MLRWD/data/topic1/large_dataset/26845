The first time i saw this on TCM i cried my ass of towards the end. I guess i am a sucker for movies with dogs in them. I like how the movie ends.(spolier alert) Umberto plans to kill himself but he wants to find a loving home for his beloved dog flag first. He first tries to give money to a man to take care of the dog but he already has a mean dog that flag seems scared of and it seems that umberto cant trust them to take care of him. Then he goes to the park and sees a little girl who he knows that always like the dog but and saids that the little girl  can have him but her parents say no. Then umberto leaves and hides but flag finds him so umberto desides to take the dog with him while he tries to kill himself by jumping in front of a train. But the dog freaks out and leaves him. Umberto then go's after him but flag feelings are hurt. Then he starts playing with flag and then flag forgives him. That is how the movie ends with a sort of happing ending. Of course Umberto still has problems but as long as he has his dog by him he would be fine. Another thing this is a great double feature with the bicycle theif why cant some company put these great movies together.
