'Nowhere Man' has finally arrived on DVD!  Now millions everywhere can experience the brilliance of a program that, sadly, was canceled after one season.

The subtle layering of darkness and paranoia as Thomas Veil worked to uncover the truth is an example of masterful writing, directing and acting.  Containing cryptic visual and auditory clues, each episode added to this patina of darkness ever-so-slightly.  Bruce Greenwood never overplays it; in fact, by underplaying the overwhelming stress and anxiety his character is feeling, Greenwood shows us a mounting intensity that evidences itself in his body language and intonation.  We feel for him, and want him to succeed; we want the outside forces to pay for what they've done ... yet we feel there's something just not right about Veil.  Perhaps a subconscious drive toward the shadowy, festering underside of life?

Measured character and story development would finally become popular a decade later, but now that programs like 'Lost,' '24' and 'Six Feet Under' exist, it seems television has perhaps reached an age in which subtlety and intelligence can, at least sometimes, illuminate our living rooms.

Take a long weekend.  Believe me, once you watch the first episode, you'll want to watch the second, and before you it, the sun will have crested the sky.  As the slow march of night overcomes your living room, you'll be too engrossed to realize all the lights are off.  As your mind races to understand all the visual and audio clues set before you and the protagonist, you might want to take a moment to confirm that you are who you believe to be.  Solidify the fragility of identity...  if only for a fleeting moment.
