There are only two possible complaints with season 2 of the hit program Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  First, due to budget limitations, the whole season was filmed with a 16mm camera, so the image quality is not a good as it could have been.  Second, there are only 22 episodes.
The whole season flows perfectly, from Buffy's return to Sunnydale after summer vacation in L.A. (still freaked out about dying in season 1), to her departure at season's end after destroying her whole life to save the world.  Season Two features what is still my favorite episode, "Passion."  While death comes suddenly and often to background characters in this series, they take it seriously when a main character is killed.  There are long term repercussions, and people don't recover from the emotional trauma of losing a loved one in just 1 week.  "Passion" was the first time we got to see how the Mutant Enemy production crew dealt with a major character's death, and it was quite powerful.  Other episodes that deal with the death of major characters are "Becoming (pts 1 & 2)," Season Five's outstanding "The Body," the first three and last four episodes of Season Six.  I guess we'll still have to wait awhile for those.
Seriously, I have gotten more people hooked on this show with select episodes from season 2, than any other season.  If you haven't seen it before, you're missing something special.
I also recommend the Season One DVD collection.
