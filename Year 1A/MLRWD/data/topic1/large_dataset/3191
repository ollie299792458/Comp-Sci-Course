I have to say I liked it. It didn't come off as a remake, instead it seemed to me it was a reinterpretation of the character. Of course I don't like that Freddy was a pedophile, but since they made it that way, I liked the back-story with Nancy and the other kids, and how they played up the "need" in Freddy for making the kids remember to give him a sort-of new life in their dreams.

The only think I didn't like is the fact that the glove itself was not really a major factor. There was no scene included of Freddy making his glove. They only showed a brief scene of him looking at a garden rake and suggesting the idea of a glove. In the same regard, since Freddy was not necessarily a child murderer, they really gave no explanation of why he even made a glove in the first place. There were the back flash scenes of some kids with scratch marks on them, conceivable from the glove, but no "why". I would really have liked to have seen more of the glove, after all it is a horror icon.

On the plus side, Freddy, after the burning, came off as a great character. They made him look like a genuine burn victim and not some monster. They left the voice alone too and he sounded rather human which I think made him more disturbing.

All in all I thought it was pretty good. I hope they continue the story.
