It is true that most of the information in this video is available anywhere, *BUT* this video talks about combining the techniques, and it shows how little nuances can make a big difference. This taught me how to practice with my daughter, and how little variances can refine the techniques. For instance, one approach after swaddling the baby is to put her on her side or on her stomach. The doctor points out that sometimes even turning the baby just a couple degrees more or less can trigger her calming reflex. Another part talks about techniques in swinging and how to rock a baby to get just the right "jiggle" going. With a little practice, I was able to figure out how to use these concepts in a way that worked for my daughter.
Also, I think the video might be more helpful than the book version because the visual examples seem to clarify things better than interpreting something that is written.
One thing about swaddling that the video does not mention: I'm not really very good at swaddling and my daughter really fights being swaddled. So I bought several SwaddleMe brand wraps that can bundle up your baby and fasten with Velcro. This works like a charm to get her into a tight bundle like they advise on this video.
I'm so glad I found this. All that common advise finally makes sense when someone shows you how to apply it.
