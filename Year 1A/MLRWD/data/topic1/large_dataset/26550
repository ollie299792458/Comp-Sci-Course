Despite containing more paradoxes than the moles in a Whack-a-Mole game "Looper" may well be the best time travel movie in years and it connected with me because it seemed to be a choice by the Director to not spend too much time wrapped up in the question of whether his time travel methodology was scientifically accurate and instead spend his time in the conflicts, motivations and stress factors that would affect this group of men causing them to use time travel not for the betterment of mankind, but instead in this heinous fashion.

From the previews you get all the facts you need, the mob has time travel and they use to disappear people into the past because it's too difficult to hide a body in their future. If you are one of these past time hit-men you are a Looper and your contract ends when you "close" your loop (Kill your future self). What makes "Looper" so interesting is that the main story line takes place between 10 and 30 years in the future, making it both a SciFi movie and a time travel movie.

I highly recommend you see this movie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is brilliance, in point of fact I think he may do Bruce Willis better even than Bruce Willis does and the action scenes, although sometimes "action movie" ridiculous (including one scene where Bruce Willis holds a body much larger than himself in front of himself as a human shield as he runs down a hall shooting), help keep this movie fast and well paced despite it being about why the characters are doing what they are doing.

For the ladies, there is also a nice sized subplot between Emily Blunt and Joseph Gordon-Levitt that is evokes such movies as "Witness" and "The Bodyguard", so guys don't forget your girls.
