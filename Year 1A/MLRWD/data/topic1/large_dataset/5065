For the past seven months I've been using the Ellen Barrett Crunch Pilates DVDs (cardio, weights, and slim & sleek) as well as bicycling, so I'm in fairly good shape.  I wanted another DVD to give my body some variety.  I bought this one based on the reviews.

My first impressions was that the warm-up is extremely complicated for someone as uncoordinated as myself, but it gets easier as I learn the moves.  I also felt this DVD wasn't strenuous enough, or that 30 minutes was just not enough time to get a decent workout.  The next morning changed my mind.  Surprisingly, I was definitely sore, particularly in my inner thighs, my shoulders, and even my abs, which I work pretty hard on a consistent basis.  Yeah! (Pain must mean it's working, at least that's what my parents used to say when they put iodine on my scraped knees).

This is a short, intense work-out. I have been pairing it with the abs section of Pick Your Spot Pilates, just because I'm a little obsessive about my mid-section. This is a great workout and I highly recommend it.  I also like that you can use from 3 to 10 pound weights, because I definitely see myself working up to the 10's.  I burn 160 calories during this DVD, and of course, there's supposedly the afterburn calories.

My only issue with this dvd: the other people in the video. They are annoying to the extreme.  Anytime the instructor mentions pushups or any other variation, they moan and groan (sometimes scream) dramatically. Ridiculous. I'm supposed to believe these obviously in shape people are being driven insane by this workout?  Do not insult my intelligence, please.  And that girl in the khaki shorts and blue top in the back needs a punch in the mouth.  Her stupid facial expressions are very annoying.

If you can get past the idiots in the back, this is a good, short, effective workout.
