Vigo's "L'atalante" is often placed among the published lists of the greatest films ever made and this status is fully deserved. The story of the film is simple, a young couple aboard a boat experience trouble in  thier young marriage before coming together at the end, yet it is Vigo's  style of narration and the way the film is told that makes it stand it.  Vigo catches the humanism of his story through an incredible dream like,  surreal and anarchic style of photgraphy and editing(featuring some of the  most beautiful images ever) to compel and move the viewer beyond belief, as  countless sublime moments truly capturing the essence of young love fill  our screens. The performances are of the highest standard, notably from the  beautiful Parlo (also to be seen in Renoir's "La grande  illusion") and the poetic quality of the images unlike anything  captured before or since. On the evidence of this, and his earlier  "Zero De Conduire", Vigo would surely have become the greatest  director of the sound age hads it been not for his death at the age of 29.
