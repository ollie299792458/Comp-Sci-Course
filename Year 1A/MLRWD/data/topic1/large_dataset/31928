The video follows the plot and major details of the novel well. I use the movie for reinforcement after my high school classes read the novel.  Some producers/directors take liberties with films, adding or augmenting the original literary work, but that is not the case in this particular production.  As with most movies, however, portions of the novel are not represented in the film.

Salma Hayek and Edward James Olmos do not overpower their roles with their own personalities.  In fact, Olmos' portrayal of Rafael Trujillo was surprisingly credible.

I do not recommend this film for students younger than 15 because of the violence in the movie.

I highly recommend both the novel and the movie, however, for high school classes and adults seeking relevant literature created by Latina writer Julia Alvarez.  The movie's protagonists (the Mirabal sisters) demonstrate their religious fervor, patriotism, and family values. The  historic context and setting (Dominican Republic, 1920s, to the U.S., 1950s) and the rebellion against dictator Rafael Trujillo, coupled with themes of honor and human rights, makes this a 4-star film.

My classes read the book together and listened to portions of the audio book.  Students had tons of questions; they researched, shared, talked about family values, and eventually viewed the movie.  It was a terrific unit!
