I'm not from Finland myself, but I have to say that this movie does not realistically describe Finnish society. Finland is probably the most "modern" country in the world when it comes to instrumentalities. Instead it is an exaggurated picture of a country that for 50 years has been balancing between East and West and landed on the West. It could easily been the other way around. And 99 minutes on a boat lies the grim reminder.
Everyone I have spoken to about this film disagree with me, but I think this film is playing with time or epochs from 1945 until now. Back and forth, back and forth, like a bottle of Kosken being passed among friends. 
On a deeper level, this is about Stalin and his refusal to let Finland accept any Marshall aid. This is history gone awry and dreams postponed. How can you keep your dignity when your neighbours are prospering while yourself is left outside the feast? How can you keep yourself sane between the birch and the wood? Give up! Be yourself and have the last word with style. Anyways, for me film is about entertainment, not for intricate BS analysis. This movie is highly entertaining.
