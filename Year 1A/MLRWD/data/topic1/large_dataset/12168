First, I must confess I really enjoy Conan's work.  I have since he took over for Letterman in the 90's.  As a college student and night owl I was often up late, and Conan's off kilter, format skewering show made me laugh... hard.  I loved that he was often the comic straight man on his own show.  I loved the characters.  I loved Andy. I loved Max. Above all I appreciated the apparent earnestness with which he engaged his audience and his guests.  I always suspected that I was witnessing some authentic part of him.  After seeing the film I see that I think I was right.

The film isn't a comedy, though it is very funny in parts.  It's a road log of the experience of dealing with disappointment, anger, compulsion, fear, and all the personal drivers that go into creating a "successful" entertainer.  I appreciate how vulnerable, real, and even petty the film portrays O'Brien.  I appreciate the love/hate relationship it portrays with those making demands of his time. I appreciate the portrayal of a business that demands your entire person, body and soul, and the difficulty of cordoning off some portion of both.  Overall I appreciated Flender's work here.  It is a bit austere.  No commentary, no voice overs.  Just Conan and his staff.  In the end it makes me appreciate Conan's work all the more.

And it sets up a wonderful sequel in 30 years when Conan is in the Beverly Hills Nursing home as he looks back on his career, and deals with bed sores and urinary tract infections... they can call it "Conan O'Brien Can't Go"
