As far as the movie itself goes, I personally cannot recommend it more highly.  The story itself is wonderful, the acting is great, and the music is absolutely beautiful.  The only caution I would give is that the story turns out to be quite emotional.  There are a lot of fun parts to this movie, but just beware that it delves deeper than your average Disney family film.  If you are concerned about younger viewers, you can do some more research, but I personally think that most people should be able to handle it without any ill-effect.  If anything, it makes you want to be a better person.

As far as the Blu-ray disc is concerned, this one is really top notch.  The picture quality is among the best I have seen on any high definition media, and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in that regard.  In addition, the uncompressed PCM audio is just about as good as it gets.

The combination of a great movie and a wonderful Blu-ray presentation makes this disc a definite recommend.
