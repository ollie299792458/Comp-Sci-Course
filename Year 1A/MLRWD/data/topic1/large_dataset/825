Having lived in Alexandria VA from 1962 to 1979, and graduated from GWHS, I had difficulty watching this movie as a true story.  In fact, it is very loosely based on fact.  Once I put that aside, I was able to enjoy a spirited story of the difficult process of overcoming superficial differences and finding the heart of another.  This movie works well to that end.  The interactions between Yoast and Boone and Bertier and Campbell are classic.  At times it waxes melodramatic, such as the scene where Lastic learns that he has gone from a failing status to college material in one football season!  
Just for the record, Alexandria was an "All American City" in 1971 and racial integration first took place in the mid 60's.  The tensions in the three schools merging had a lot more to do with the fact that three bitter rivals had just become one school. 
This is definitely a video worth owning and enjoying.  It is good clean fun and promotes the message that we need to talk with each other and not allow the outward appearances to keep us apart.  Enjoy the show.
