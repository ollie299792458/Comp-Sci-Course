The Undertaker has had a long and storied career, mostly good, some, well... not so good performances. If you're an Undertaker fan, you'll love this set regardless. If you're a wrestling fan in general and not necessarily a fan of The Undertaker, then you should pick this set up exclusively for the Bret "Hitman" Hart vs. Undertaker match from One Night Only.

Simply put, gimmick matches like the Hell In A Cell aside, this is unquestionably Undertakers best (WRESTLING) match. One Night Only was a UK PPV, and a rare find all together; there were very few copies distributed. The Bret vs. Taker match in particular was especially hard to find... until now. It was deleted from the US release of ONO, because Vince McMahon didn't want this match to be shown, because after the Montreal Screwjob, he didn't want to give Bret any more credibility since he was WCW. (Bret wanted to stay loyal to the company, signing a long term deal for far less money than what he was offered from WCW, but Vince wanted out if it because he couldn't afford it. Anyway... that's a story for another day, back to the review...) He wanted to bury this magnificent match because Bret looked so darn impressive, but thankfully, it's right here on this set.

Tombstone is a solid piece of production from top to bottom, but there are two major flaws that I have a problem with. One, is that The Undertaker isn't interviewed on the DVD to give his input on his matches. Secondly, the packaging is very poor. It looks to me like they knew this DVD would sell big regardless, and they wanted to save money by cramming 3 disks in a cheap standard DVD case.

Oh... and his matches with Hogan are an embarrassment.

Overall, I would give Tombstone: The History of the Undertaker a 4-Â½ star rating, but unfortunately, that option is not available, so I'll give it a ****.
