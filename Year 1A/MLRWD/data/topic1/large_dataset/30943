what happens when you mix charlie sheen, keefer sutherland, chris o'donell and tim curry together? one strange coctail party. But add swords and abunch of funny hats adorned with large feathers and you've got a film that has no depth to it at all and you can enjoy with the whole family.
The Three Musketeers staring charlie sheen may be one of the most rediculously corny/historically inacurate movies ever made. But that's not to say it was bad... okay maybe it was but it was one of those movies that you watch when you don't want to think to hard about plot line and still want to see a bit of action. i would have given this movie only three stars for the guy who says 'don't lose your head' when the d'artagnon is about to be beheaded BUT Tim Curry was in it, and he tries so hard so i had to give it four stars... hahaha... tim curry as a cardinal, still makes me laugh. all in all a good movie to watch with kids 8-11 beause there are some a parts that would be pretty scary... or by yourself when your feeling goofy...
