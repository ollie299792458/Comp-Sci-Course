My wife and I saw The Pirates! Band of Misfits in the theater while most everyone else was watching the Avengers film. We absolutely loved it, as we have nearly all Aardman work, but realized that there were so many jokes crammed in around the corners that we knew we had to get it on disc to watch at home, where we could pause, rewind and read the backgrounds.

The Blu-Ray disc is fine quality with excellent picture and sound. A huge number of (thankfully skippable) previews up front took some time to jump over. There's a "So You Want To Be a Pirate" short which, while fun, is not quite up to the level of the main film.  There's also a couple of "making of" documentaries that I have not watched yet.

We had finished viewing the movie when my wife asked that we go through the credits slowly, as she thought the actor who voiced "Number Two" (aka "The Pirate with the Scarf") sounded a lot like the John Watson character on the PBS "Sherlock" series (which we had just watched an episode of before.)  Sure enough - both were Martin Freeman.

One of the many things I like about The Pirates! and other Aardman films is that they are enjoyable on so many levels. Kids will laugh and be thrilled, and adults will laugh at jokes and situations the kids might miss. (For example, "The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate", who is a minor character but good for a couple of jokes along he way.)

This packaging includes Blu-Ray and DVD discs and also a code for UltraViolet, allowing some limited online streaming of the movie.  The process for signing up for this was not only cumbersome, but the UltraViolet web site was dead for several days. Doesn't bode well....  While we saw the movie in 3D in the theater, I don't see that it really benefits from the 3D treatment at home. Curiously, if you do buy the 3D version, you don't get UltraViolet!
