Poor Antonioni.  He learned - the hard way - that the nature of Film derives from its strange popular basis.  How else did MGM get in on the backing of 'Blow Up?'  The film's success probably had less to to do with Antonioni's oblique look at swinging London than with the whole Mod scene it coincidentally highlights - the frenetic life of a fashion photographer, the scantily-clad models, the rock-and-roll bands, the impromptu orgies (the best are always impromptu), the (real or imagined) murders, the attempted blackmail. Antonioni's mistake was that we could never pin down his attitude toward such subject matter.  Surely the man who created 'L'avventura' was only interested in the surfaces of his subject (it had no depths to speak of)?  Surely he was cleverly disparaging the lifestyle of this idiot photographer?  Fact is, Antonioni was secretly in love with it.  Just as he would be duped by the stupidities enacted in 'Zabriskie Point.'  He wasn't as objective as his better admirers believed.  He was middle-aged.  He was Italian.  And he was getting over Monica Vitti.  'Blow Up' is fascinating, all the same.  And it certainly doesn't deserve some of the comments of the uninitiated - outcasts of the "Film Generation," who wouldn't know an art film if it fell on them....
