The movie was excellent, all around.  I won't reiterate that point since it's been said here at Amazon in many different ways, so I'll let that be.
Listen instead to this: It seems that many viewers (and the writers of the Voyager series as well) seem to have missed a rather important fact from the film.  Someone else here mentions that the Borg Queen "rules" the Borg, making all of the decisions, and all of the drones are merely slaves to her.  This is actually brought up in the movie, when she first appears, during her conversation with Commander Data.  Several times, she was forced to correct him.. "you imply disparity where none exists" and "I am the collective".  The queen does not "rule" the Borg.  In fact, she's not a "queen" in the true sense of the word.  She IS the Borg.  The same way ANY of them are.  She is the new Locutus, a single drone picked out to give a singular voice to the collective mind.  Her death at the end is irrelevant, as she's no different from any other drone.  This also explains her reappearance on the TV series.  She's easily replacable by any other member of her species.
Once I figured this out, I actually found the movie to be even more enjoyable, and adds a great deal of depth to the Borg as an "entity".  I hope you'll find the same.
