I am going to just briefly review the movies. For the most part they are great. The first movie was one of the best Superhero origin stories ever and a great mix of comedy and action. The only issue was with that goofy Green Goblin costume. You would think for the millions they spent on that movie, someone could have come up with a better costume. The second movie is one of the greatest films of the last decade. The acting, the direction, the story, everything hit the right notes and made for a thrilling, unbelievable experience. And finally, the third film. It was ok. It had some good points, but also some bad. Too many villains and a story that did not stay focused. It was a shame the series had to end on such a mediocre point.

The thing that is really important to take away from this review is how awesome it is to watch Spidey swing around in High Def. The Blu-Ray format was invented for movies like this. Even if you own these films in another format, you owe it to yourself to upgrade to these versions. Your eyes will thank you.
