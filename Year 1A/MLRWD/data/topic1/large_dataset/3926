I read the script (published by Vintage; you can find it here on Amazon) and thought it was awful, but still decided to give the movie a chance. I'm glad I did - the actors gave 110%, and the movie was certainly better due to certain parts of the original script being cut. However--it still seems like the characters are never fully developed, with the exception of Verona--facing the ghosts of her past helps her become a more three-dimensional character. But by the end, I still didn't know Burt. The last 30 min of the movie, where he's angry that his sister-in-law has abandoned his brother and their child, seemed to only scratch the surface. I feel somewhat cheated. I saw someone post on IMDb somewhere that Burt's brother's story, in fact, would have been a better story to explore. Having seen the movie, I agree. Burt asks the question: What kind of mother would leave her child? Now that's an idea worth exploring. The actors who played Burt and Verona had nice chemistry, but the characters didn't seem to move past the whole lovey-dovey mushiness. Which can be fine, sure, but I feel that in order for me to care about this couple, they need to earn my attention--why should I care that they're together? The problem with mushiness is that it doesn't allow for any development on that end.
