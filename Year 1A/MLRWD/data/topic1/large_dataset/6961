I am sitting in front of this screen failing to get a purchase on what it is I want to say about this film - my flimsy adjectives and superlatives are hopelessly inadequate. If it was just the artistic quality of the filmaking I would be fine; able to use words like, luminous, exquisite, perfect, genius. But it's the fact that all of this is in the service of something infinitely more overwhelming that leaves me speechless. For Catholics amongst you all I can say is that it is a little bit like a cinematic equivalent of the life of St Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux: small and hidden things, done with great love.

Most all of the time I agree with Hitchcock's wonderfully affirming and unpretentious, "Some film makers make movies that are like a slice of life - I make movies that are like a slice of cake." Afterall, an awful lot of cinema, (hell, an awful lot of everything!) is dismally self-important and self-satisfied. However, there are few works of art that bear witness to the transfiguration of our small lives by love with as much truthful beauty as Ozu's Tokyo Story. The actress who plays the daughter-in-law in the film, Setsuko Hara, gave up acting a few years later and went into solitude and prayer in the buddhist town of Kamakura. She is still there today. As the dear mother says at one moment in the film, giving thanks quite simply for the day's good weather, "it is a blessing." And so it is.
