I viewed this movie as a requirement in my "world studies" class during our unit on British Imperialism. The on-screen representation of Gandhi's personality gave me a finer insight into his motivations and background. One particular element to the story I found fulfilling was the display of younger Gandhi as an educated "British" lawyer. His change in identity was very well portrayed as he grew closer to his people. This video was an absolutely excellent supplement to my studies on Gandhi and imperialism. Gandhi's political success was an awesome sight to see portrayed. The manner in which such a frail old man as Gandhi overpowers an entire empire is nearly miraculous, and his attempts at unifying a very religiously diverse India are noble. Gandhi proved to the world that violence is an unnecessary element to "fighting" for change, and that non-violence can be even more effective. It is not hard to tell why people such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez, both leaders in civil rights movements, were inspired by the achievements of Gandhi, and modeled their political activism after his non-violent model. I felt that this movie exquisitely portrayed Gandhi's persona, his aspirations, and his accomplishments. I very strongly recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Gandhi, and anyone who would like to vicariously witness the spectacular accomplishments of one of the greatest persons in history.
