Just played the blu-ray version on master audio via my oppo, wow what a step backwards from the much more dynamic Snakes & Arrow blu-ray. Not shure what happed as most of the same people who did S&A did this recording, except that Alex was Not involved in the mix of Time Machine. The recording lacks dynamics, air, and the detail.  If S&A was the 2nd row vantage point sonically, Time Machine is row 57. Neil makes sounds w/o impact or dynamics, his set sounds glazed over, processed & compresed & distant.  However Alex guitiars sounds good and retains dynmaics & edge.

Cant recommend given the much better sounding S&A  made just a few yr ago, it also has better non moving picture song selection than time machine.

What happeded from a audio production standpoint?. Does anyone know? . video ,who cares rush was never a visual band & I would trade off a bad video production for better sound quality any day.

Rush time machine tour was highlighted by playing the entire Moving pictures record, which was the main draw for many of  the die hard fans who finally had a chance hear the camera eye & vital signs, which are some of rush's best songs but rarely played since 1982 live.

Unfortunately inorder to get to the best part of the show fans had to endure awful songs like bu2b & faithless, leave that thing alone, stick it out & other questionable selections. At the same time no songs were played from P/G and one song from power windows.

However the torture will not need to be repeated on the blu-ray as fans can now FF over the dreck to the good parts of the show, and since they just released S&A blu-ray a few ys ago one can combine the two into one real best of show.
