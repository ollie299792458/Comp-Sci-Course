I was really excited to watch this film because it gave me everything i loved about comic books and everything I love about movies and successfully combines them in an exciting new way. I loved the use of a moving camera with the ability to rack focus between the layers of images as if it were a real 3 dimensional space. The way they animated the characters faces giving them expressions that build rather than being presented in a snapshot. It gave a whole new life to the static images from the page. I really like the word bubbles so you could read it as it was being spoken, by no means did it obstruct the image. I would say that next time i hope they involve an entire cast of voice actors rather than have one guy speaking as all of them. Kudos to him of course for still pulling it off and not hindering a fantastic production. I feel like the problem with a lot of the hollywood films is that they are adapating the comic story into the film world, appreciating a hollywood treatment that is other than the comic which, as a comic fan, has always frustrated me. In this case i feel like these motion comics adapt film into the comic world catering well to the fanboy and animation audiences. I would love to see more of these films made from some of the bigger comic stories of the past such as DARK KNIGHT RETURNS or PREACHER. Anyways 5 stars - highly suggested.
