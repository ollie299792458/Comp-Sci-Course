By this point many people have either stuck with the franchise or have been worn out by the plot. However, it's important to understand that when the franchise began, it was purposely done to  make the plot last for a few sequels. When Saw V began, the plot was made to last till Saw VIII, if and only if, the previous film had made a decent amount of money. After Saw VI, it has become apparent that the fan base for the franchise has diminished due to low ticket sales. So at this point, with Saw VII opening in theatres in October 2010, if the movie has a low turnout then the series may inevitably end but the studio will be prepared to end it as if it is the last. Saw VI was to many a great improvement over it's predicessors (IV and V). Saw VI tied in lose ends and really looked in depth to Hoffman's and Jill Tucks psyches. At the same time, John's life and how he had been successful prior to being diagnosed with cancer is revealed. A little politics was thrown in with the healthcare issues that plagues America today, but maybe not to the same extent as how Saw VI portrays it as. Twists and turns throughout the film will keep you in focus and in the end will be making you want to see more. Kevin Greutart did a great job in his first directorial debut after editing the franchise since day one. Don't get me wrong, the Saw series may not be for everyone and not because of the gore and violence. Primarily it is the plot and characters that many seem to forget and having to sort out the present and flashbacks throughout the films that can push away a viewer.
