I love this movie...I read the book after I saw the movie and I don't give a darn about incongruities. The book is great...so is the movie and by now I don't expect the twain to meet very often...They are different and each has their own qualities.
For me though, the movie turns the heat way up...I have had that love that Janey talks about and expresses...especially in the harmonica kiss scene...the look on Tea Cakes face...yep...that's what it's all about.Some never have that, never know what it is...
In many ways the final sentiments of the story remind me of the movie Kama Sutra..in which the heroines lover also dies...having touched that kind of incredible passionate love and lost it was heartbreaking for sure...but to let the loss negate the message of the love, by becoming devastated by the loss, would have been much worse...The gift that the male lovers in both movies gave the women cannot be killed. In Kama Sutra the woman walks into the evening sky saying something like "my heart is as vast as the sky"...Janey's sentiments are similar...and she reminds us to keep watching God.
