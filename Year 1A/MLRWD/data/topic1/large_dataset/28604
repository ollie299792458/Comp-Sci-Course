Definitely a 'Johnny come lately' here...I read the previous reviews regarding this film, and I'll admit my expectations were less than high.  However, I simply cannot understand the criticisms made.  I am drawn toward "difficult to watch" films.  And this certainly makes that grade.  But so much more.  It was original, very well done, and actually got better as it went forward. It had a true independent spirit. I was totally taken in, which is what I would think a film like this would want to provide.  I will say that I actually liked the alternate ending on the DVD.  Maybe the "american" film viewer in me, maybe because I really liked Jack Thompson having the last word.  Just because I'm crazy about him as an actor.  But I would be remiss in this review to not give extreme credit to Alex O'Loughlin,Patrick Thompson and Gabby Millgate as top notch in their roles. Such an exhausting film. It's a big world out there, and Australia has given us wonderful films, and wonderful actors.  This will become a part of our university library collection, and also part of my personal collection...and I buy very few films for my personal library.
