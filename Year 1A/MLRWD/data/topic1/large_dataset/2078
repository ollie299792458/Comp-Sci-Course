Rocky horror became one of my favorite movies in 1995 when i have heard about it from a friend and i decided to rent it. i was expecting a horror movie(espically by the video box) and instead i got a wonderfully bizzar good time that had me singing the time warp untill i went to bed that night. it was just something about this movie that really clicked with me and it really became my favorite movie untill scream came along then it was tied. Anyway incase people dont know by now this movie has been playing for over 25 years in theaters ever friday and saturday night at midnight and has become a nation wide cult phenomena. It has comedy, horror, sex, music, sci fi and rock and roll. what else could you ask for in one night?
