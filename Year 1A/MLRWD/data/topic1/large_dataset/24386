When an acquaintence first enlightened me about this film, I was about seven years old and already quite disturbed. The purveyor of this information was a girl about two years older than I was (who would attempt to rape me in later years, but I digress), and she was completely sickened by both its concept and copious gore. I cannot describe how intrigued I was. I rented the film three years later, and viewed a sick little piece of cult/horror brilliance that has remained one of my two favorite movies to this day.  The plot concerns the misadventures of two separated siamese twins who are ultimately destroyed by the "Normal" brother's lust for a woman, in their journey to exterminate the inept doctors who performed their fateful surgery. To say any more is to deprive the reader of the multitude of sickening surprises that await one brave enough to purchase this DVD. And you should purchase it. Right now. Go ahead. Purely on my reccommendation, PURCHASE IT RIGHT NOW!!!  If you are interested in the longevity of your purchase, buy the DVD. If you do not particularly care, would like a bevy of extras, and want to see the film in its original, grainy format, buy the video.  Anticlimatic ending to this review. I apologize.
