Set in the American South during the prohibition of the early 1900's, "Idlewild" produces a fairly refreshing look at the era by utilizing talented young musicians and actors to produce a musical that can appeal to a younger generation.

The cinematography was imaginative and innovative. The big shoot-out scene at the end was astounding, and well worth an award of some kind. The music and choreography are incredible, and illustrate the film's tone and mood beautifully.

A negative to this film would be it's inherent predictability, and it's tendency to rely too heavily on cliche characters and storylines. This film tells the tale of two brothers/friends, one is a quiet and straight-laced musician, and the other a speakeasy nightclub owner who is more prone to bad boy tendencies and drawn to the darker side of the human nature. Together they run into all kinds of trouble, inlcuding murder and the mob. The ending is predictable, and can be seen a mile away. However, there's no reason not to watch this film simply to enjoy the music and stylistic nature of it.

This film has pizzaz and style, there's no question about that. Not everyone is going to enjoy it, but the same can be said of just about every movie.

Bottom line: If you enjoy musicals and dancing, then give this movie a try...it might drive you wild!
