This is a thought provoking movie...If you don't think, don't go see it! For the person who selects this movie for a weekend viewing they will either be turned on or off. There is no in between view of Solaris! Steven Soderbergh delivers for his audience and permits the audience member an emotional buy in with reward if one choses it. Otherwise be prepared to be bored because there is no blood and gore; and, tenderness in place of action. There are the obligatory bloody hand prints, bodies in bags, and George Cloney bare back sides; but, tastfully done. 
Fantastic photography, exquisite modeling, and a riviting plot seduce the viewer into the picture and provoke you into making your own choices, good or bad. The line "my mistake was in how I remembered you.." illustrates how some of these choices lead to tradegy for the ones we love. Then, the movie gives us a second chance; or, another choice once we leave.
This movie is therapeutic for relationships, but probably not useful to anyone in the audience less than 25. Go and see it if you are in the mind to be introspecive or if you just like rain and pretty colors. For the rest go to your shoot'em up stuff.
