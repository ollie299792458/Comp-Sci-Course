At first I thought, "what a depressing waste" - another movie where everyone is either miserable, hopeless, or both.  I guess I wanted something lighter.

Months passed and I still thought about some scenes in the film.  Long after I forgot the title, I couldn't shake the images and feelings.

Now I look forward to watching it again.  If anything I wish it had gone into more depth.

Without spoiling anything, I think Rockwell's character depicts that kind of desperate, joyless, religion - all form and no substance - that comes out of court-ordered conversions.  It's the form of Christianity and not the substance, not the change of heart and rebirth in the spirit that comes with true conversions.  The way some people have to attend several AA meetings a week, have to fill the emptiness, as though it's a chore.

The film further illustrates the deep pain and dysfunction of a broken home.  I thought Rockwell's brief and awkward visits with his daughter were spot on.  His parents, especially the mother, also nailed the heartache of having their grown son move in with them, straining to hope for the best in a bleak situation.

I'm not sure whether this is an endorsement or a warning.
