This film is one of the best war-scene movies set in the UK.  The gorgeous, but cold landscape of Scotland adds much to the dark but optimistic story.  While Liam Neeson plays his role as the leader of the average people to the T, both Jessican Lange and Tim Roth steal the show.  Roth is at his best here, playing a highly effeminate, highly skilled fencer who happens to be the nephew of a powerful official.  While he is a one dimensional villain, if you have a fetish for well-played villains...you'll love this!  He is absurdly pompous and his acting pays tribute to the art of being self-assuredly odd.  Lange, as in everything, does an amazing job of bringing her flavour of weak strength...her resolve and nobility are also one dimensional, but the part manages to provide her with enough to make her very interesting in her choices and her acting will stun you.
Great film.  You won't be bored.  It's not as exhausting as Braveheart, and has an enjoyable fencing-type fight scene which keeps you in suspense till the end!
