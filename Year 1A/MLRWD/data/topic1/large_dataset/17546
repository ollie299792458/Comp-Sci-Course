campy thriller, brilliantly acted by its main protagonists. The fantastic  Geraldine Page stars as a psychotic widow with a penchant for growing  the very sturdiest and handsome of Pine trees - her  secret is human  fertiliser in the form of a series of  butchered companions. Slowly  suspicion rises and a friend of  one of the deceased, now fertiliser  fodder, begins to catch on  to Page's dastardly deeds.  Geraldine Page delivers a tour de force  performance as Claire Marrable  - oozing a charming menace and  evil with every breath. Yet there are  severe undertones of  humour and one senses that the actors involved  would have a  good cackle after every take. Page's performance rates  with  the most vintage camp EVER. She obviously relished and thoroughly  enjoyed the role.  Ruth Gordon, best remembered from the wonderful  Harold and Maude,  delivers a typically feisty and spunky  performance as the Aunt Alice  of the title. It is vintage  stuff and works equally successfully as  a taut thriller but  best of all as the blackest and most wicked of  comedies.  Please also appreciate the totally schizo music score that is so  appropriate  for the film. A gem from director Robert Aldrich  who gave us another  cult favourite, Whatever Happened to Baby  Jane
