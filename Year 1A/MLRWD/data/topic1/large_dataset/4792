The grand performance of Julia Jentsch, Alexander Held and Johanna Gastdorf is to be underlined.

The feature film "Sophie Scholl. The final days" draws meticulously the days between the 17. and the 22. February 1943, from the eve of her arrest until Sophie Scholl's execution together with her brother Hans and their friend Christoph Probst. All of them were members of the anti-Nazi university resistance group "The white Rose" based in Munich. Starting with the presentation of some members of the group, most of them medical students, the film shows their last anti-Nazi action, ending with Sophie and Hans Scholl arrest. Immediately the plot focuses on Gestapo interrogations to Sophie, a gifted student of Biology and Philosophy, and on her conversations with cell-comrade Else Gebel.

Sophia Scholl was not primarily worried with political matters but rather with ideological questions. After her arrival in Munich in May 1942 she had contacts with some catholic intellectuals like Professor Huber, the author Theodor Haecker and the editor of the Catholic monthly magazine Hochland", Carl Muth.

The film production avoids distractions and lets us to penetrate deeply into the rich inner world of this high-educated young woman, who rather goes to death than betraying her moral convictions. Getting her strength from the prayer and being the Christian faith her last source of resistance to the atheistic state-system, Sophia Scholl is a very near model for present day people, especially teenagers, frequently coerced by some present forms of totalitarianism like the fashion dictatorship and the political correctness.
