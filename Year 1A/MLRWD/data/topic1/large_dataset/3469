We all know what this movie is about...so my review is if you should own it or not.

I have been a fan of Halloween for as long back as I could remember. I've had every movie for years except this one. I was like most people that felt if Micheal Myers is not in it then it does not count. I would see it on TV and would never watch it.

 One day I was at the movie store and I saw it sitting there so I rented it and watched it and although it has nothing to do with the rest of the films it still has a feel to it that goes along with the time of the year it is. Which is Halloween (and my Bday!!)  So now I own it and its part of my collection and I actually kinda got a little satisfaction seeing it there.

Soooooo personally for me (and this is just my opionion) if you are a fan of Halloween you might as well own this movie. Because like it or not it IS part of the franchise. Its got the Carpenter feel to it and that Halloween jinle is catchy. Not to mention it looks nice when you line up your movies and theres actually a 3 between 2 and 4.

Now lets see how Rob Zombie does with the remake....
