I have always been one who hates it when someone tells me I have to read the book for a film to get the full understanding of all that transpires but in this case it is absolutely true. Having read the novel a few weeks before I had many expectations of what I was going to see in the movie and they never came about. 
This brings me to my next issues with this potentially great film. This is by far the worst edited movie I've ever encountered (and I've seen some VERY poorly edited ones) (Come to think of it, the director wasn't all that good either). You can actually see points where a dialogue you didn't see just ended or one is about to begin but not shown. And I understand this movie is already 2:06 long but would another 30 minutes have bothered anyone if giant plot holes were filled in? (Just one example: in the novel, Frank's old FBI pal Jimmy Street has a gambling and alcohol problem and this is what's used as leverage by Howard Saint to gain classified information and ultimately lead to the slaughter of Frank's family.)
Overall, the acting, story and action sequences were quite good but the lower budget shows its ugly head (unlike Spider-Man, Hulk, etc... with the unbelievably large budgets) in the direction, editing and quality of the film.
As far as fans of the comic are concerned, other than the location and how the family was killed (and who) the character portrayal was dead on. They even used my favorite all-time scene (from "Punisher: War Journal" #1, I think) where he tortures a captive with a blowtorch. I won't ruin the surprise but it was awesome in the comic and well done in the film.
Bottom line: read the novel as a script companion and your appreciation of this film will certainly grow.
