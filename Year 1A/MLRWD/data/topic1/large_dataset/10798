Finally after waiting many countless years, Mr. Lucas decides to release the Original Theatrical Star Wars edition. The first disc is basically the CGI enhanced effects. The final of the original trilogy and the fall of the empire. This was considered one of the weakest in the series but its my personal favourite out of the series. The emperor makes a trap to finish of the rebellion. Luke heads back home to rescue his friend Han Solo. Luke finds out he kissed his sister and a great and i mean great Climax between Vader and the Emperor. Anyway most people bought this DVD for the 2nd disc which is the Theatrical version. Many people will ask why is Lucas after shunning the fans for so long now decided to release the theatrical versions? The reason was piracy. People were making money of the theatrical versions but coping them and posting them on-line and burning DVD copies to sell them. Most of copies that were being sold were the 1993 Definitive Editions. And the mastermind of all Star Wars decided it was time to release them on DVD. Lucas didn't want to do anything special for the Theatrical versions so he went to his personal collections of his Star Wars Home Media materials and chose to copy his own copy of the 1993 Star Wars Definitive Edition on LaserDisc.  Its nothing but a simple LaserDisc transfer. So Basically he did this to cash on the Piracy sellers while selling it for a higher price. Most people will complain that the movie is on LetterBox format which is a big thumbs down. But it didnt make a difference to me or my tv. Anyway Image quality is not bad compared to my own transfers to DVD. Image Quality i would rate 9 out of 10. Sound quality is 10 out of 10 even though its only 2.0 Digital Audio. Its not bad but its not great.
