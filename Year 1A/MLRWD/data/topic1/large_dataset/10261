I have a professional interest in the development of religious and spiritual traditions and in particular the genesis of a new religious movement and how this can assist in the understanding of how all religious movements have developed through economic, political and social factors.

The documentary the Mormons was very well produced and in particular I found that the abscence of identification vis a vis religious persuasion of participants assisted in the overall homogenity of the production.

I would have valued one section that was critical of the content of the written revelation and in particular the controversies over the Spaulding manuscript thesis and the controversies regarding the Book of Abraham etc.  However, it was an absorbing contribution to the study of new religious movements without being too technical.

I would recommend this documentary to any persons who have an interest in this field or who are researching the The Mormon faith.
