First off, I thought the unsteady camerawork was great. It perfectly matched the unbalanced state of Bourne's mind. The action was terrific and the plot was tight. I enjoyed Supremacy more than Identity, though the latter followed Ludlum's book more closely.

Must admit that one of the biggest pluses to me was killing off Marie at the very beginning. She was annoying in the extreme and nothing but an encumbrance because her character had nowhere to go.

On the bad side, I couldn't help but wonder why JB kept using his own passport. Since Identity established that he had lots of passports with different names on them, it was surprising that they weren't utilized. Secondly, I really felt that they could have played up the instability in Bourne's mind even more. Having him more unbalanced would have made a more sympathetic figure and made the viewer pull for him all the more.

I thought the ending was a bit hackish, but I guess the scene is being set for the final installment.
