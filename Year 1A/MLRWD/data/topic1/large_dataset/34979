This film has in it some of the most beautiful cinematagrophy I have ever seen.  If reviews where it is criticised as being slow or arrested worry you as to whether you should rent or buy it I would judge it like this: if the thought of  walking through an art gallery and taking several minutes to sit or stand in front of some pictures to fully study and appreciate their beauty seems "slow" or "arrested" to you then you might not like it, if you can imagine yourself enjoying watching an expresionist/art noveau/surrealist set of  pictures come to life on your tv screen then you might like it.  I am dissapointed in those critics who can't imagine the medium of movies having value unless they are built around a fast paced linear plot line.  These are the same people who probably think poetry is a bunch of rubbish and "Finnegan's Wake" is an unreadable waste of time.  I hope and pray and fantasize that the studio that owns the rights to this movie will release it in greater numbers, drop the price, and (glory of all glorys) release it on dvd.  It is one of the greatest movies of one of the greatest directors of all time and should be more accesible.
