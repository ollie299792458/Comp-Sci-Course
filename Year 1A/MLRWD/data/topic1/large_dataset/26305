well... i love the arcane, horrifying, supernatural, blah blah blah... my biggest problem with this movie is that the characters are just so darm 2-dimensional i can't even be bothered what happens to them. that's bad when it's supposed to be a character driven movie.
well, heath ledger did a pretty good job as alex, and his fellow priest dude was alright too. the thing is the movie loses its steam like, about 1/2 hour into the movie... and that's sad.
i think the premise of the movie was pretty interesting, but sadly, the movie just plods along... like they don't really know where it's supposed to go. and sheesh, the character of alex's girlfriend is so ridiculous she looks half stoned for most of the part, like she's even wondering what the heck she's doing in it.
so disturbingly dismal that i don't even know why they bothered showing it. and people, whatever they had on the trailer was the only interesting part of the movie. oh, and they forgot to tell you that you had to go through like 3 hours before the stupid ending. i just wished that everybody was killed at least an hour before that. then i could've gone out of the theater earlier.
2 stars because of the idea of the movie, and some solid performance.
