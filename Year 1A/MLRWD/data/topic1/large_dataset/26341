Well, I popped this into my DVD player and in less than 5 minutes I wondered "what the heck am I watching?"  But I decided to go with it and found it was a fun, Camp movie as long as you didn't want any bit of political correctness.

It is sort of Transformers meets Monty Python meets Benny Hill.  And it had so many things that were just wrong.  Female goblins that claimed to have been given male members. Machine guns installed in female chests.  Brest milk from Hell that will eat through anything.  Shuriken that only fire from under Japanese School Girl skirts.  Building spraying blood when hit by Robo Castle, and the climatic A$$ sword fight that embarass the geishas that fight it.

It has a coheisive, if comic book, story line.  But is fun if you are willing to go with it and laugh at its outrageous premise.  Bring friends over to laugh at the move with you. Try to guess which body part a sword will pop out of next.

The extras have a day in the life of the facade of the business these meglomaniacs claim to have while building robo geishas, goblins and weapons to take over or destroy the world.

If you enjoy anime in a live action Monty Python world, get this DVD.
