I asked my three-year-old daughter the other day what she wanted to be when she was older. She answered simply, "A princess." Certainly, that is the fantasy of many girls, and it's one which Mia Thermopolis (played wonderfully by Anne Hathaway) gets to live out in "The Princess Diaries." Young Mia, awkwardly struggling through her teen years, learns from her estranged grandmother that she is the heir to the throne of Genovia. What ensues is a delightful tale about a young woman who is seeking her true identity -- both as a simple teenager and as a potential royal. Hathaway's is perfect, both as a clumsy high-schooler with frizzy hair, and as a "belle of the ball." Her transformation is one of the treats of the film, as are performances by Julie Andrews (as Mia's queenly grandmother) and by Hector Elizondo (as Genovia's head of security). More than a basic, one-dimensional story, "The Princess Diaries" entertains on several levels, and manages to do so while maintaining a "G" rating. Simply put, it's a delight for the entire family.
