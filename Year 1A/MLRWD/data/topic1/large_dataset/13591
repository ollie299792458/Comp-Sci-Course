While Gunner Palace is a good documentary of the 1st Armored Division's "Gunners", it ignores nearly all of the negative aspects of their deployment. For instance, the "gunners" did not capture that sector of Aadhamiya they patrolled: the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force did, and then turned it over to 101st Airborne, and then to the Florida Army National Guard's Warrior battalion (who can be heard on the radio throughout the movie).

I was stationed less than 500 meters away from Gunner Main, as we called it. They were by far the most screwed up unit in the entire first armored division. The documentary fails to mention the 25 minute long firefight that 1-36 IN, also stationed at Gunner Main, had.........with themselves. It was all friendly fire.

It also fails to mention that the Gunner's on guard duty, shot up our sniper teams from Warrior Battalion, nearly every day, because the gunner's were untrained and unskilled in their professions. They were engineers, and should have stuck doing engineer jobs.

The documentary fails to mention any of this. What it DOES do though, is give a great sense of what Aadhamiya was like. You graphically see the discrepancies between Uday and Qusay's palaces, and the slums around the soccer stadium and on River Road. You get a great idea of what the streets were like, how the people reacted, and such. I saw many familiar faces from the streets of Maghrib and Aadhamiya, in Baghdad. So yes, while it's overly preachy towards the troops, and covers their blemishes, it's definately a good documentary....for what it's worth.
