More than any movie from the 1930s, this Frank Capra film has not dated at all. In spite of 60 plus years of "romantic comedies" which have followed "It Happened One Night," it remains fresh and  laugh-out-loud funny. Clark  Gable is at his most charming as the scheming newspaper reporter who hopes  to get the inside scoop on the "brat," played beautifully by Claudette  Colbert, who is on the run from her millionaire father. This Frank Capra  films still makes us laugh because he so humorously shows us that while men  and women are different, for some reason they can't live without one  another even though they can, as here, drive each other crazy. The  hitchhiking scene and the scene where Gable and Colbert pretend they are  married are timeless classics.  Columbia Classics has done a wonderful job  of presenting the best print we can probably expect 60 years on.  The disc  also contains a commentary from Capra's son, Frank Capra, Jr. and a  "remembrance" of the film. I cannot recommend this movie enough.
