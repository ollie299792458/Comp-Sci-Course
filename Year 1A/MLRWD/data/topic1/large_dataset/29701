Primarily an aesthetic experience.  Beyond the Black Rainbow pays homage to late 70s and early 80s science fiction.  There isn't much else to say; you may either love it or hate it.  I wanted to write this review to remove some misconceptions.
First a lot of people complain about the violent last ten or so minutes.  There's nothing in that period that really differs from the rest of the movie.  The direction emphasizes the "heshers" using alcohol, nicotine and heavy metal the way drugs and New Age mumbo jumbo were used at Arboria.
Second Barry doesn't become violent when he gets there.  He's killed every single character except Helena by that time, starting after a phone call he gets from an unplugged telephone, ie he's been cracking up.
Third I can't deny the Sentionaut looks like astronaut Bowman in 2001 does when he shuts down HAL's brain but this movie does not make any other significant reference to Kubrick, such as with visuals or framing.
Fourth and finally don't so much "open your mind" as unplug your brain.  This is obviously skillful genre mining if you've seen movies like Silent Running and Scanners, even down to its excellent soundtrack; and it's astounding if you think it's original.
