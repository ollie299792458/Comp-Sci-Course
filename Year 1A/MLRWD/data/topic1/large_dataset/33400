The first time I watched this movie, I had no Idea what I was going to see. It just happend to be the only movie in the theater that I hadn't seen.  I was blown away! On the edge of my seat for three hours that seemed like only one. 
A Trident missle submarine is sunk is deep water by an unknown craft. A hurricane is on the surface so rescue teams cannot reach it. There is an experimental underwater drilling rig within reach. a navy seal team is sent down to take charge, but the drilling team does not like to take orders.  the Sub sits on the edge of an abyss that goes 3 miles strait down. While searching the sub for survivors, another craft is spotted. The navy guys go crazy because they think it must be the Russians. But the Drilling crew disagree. Needless to say, it is not the Russians. I don't want to give away the ending, but this movies just gets more and more intense all the way though.  I didn't really care for the added scenes in the Special Eddition. if you get this movie watch the movie version first.
