I've always been a big fan of Sam Peckinpah and a bigger fan of Strother Martin so when I ran across this film some years ago on late night television I was hooked. Recently I bought a copy of the DVD and watched it again and I think it is better than I remembered it being, which is always a nice surprise.
Peckinpah's noted fixation on extreme violence isn't really present here, to any notable degree; in fact this film is rather sweet, or at least bitter-sweet.  There is the obligatory killing or two but they're rather incidental.
Robard's performance is excellent as to be expected, but then so is everyone else's. One thing about Sam was that he had an eye for characters.
Unfortunately he didn't have much of an ear for music. I've long noted that in nearly all of his films the soundtracks are awful and this one is no exception. The tunes are intended to be mellow and invocative but in reality are maudlin and syrupy. In the end they don't do much damage and I'm sure that there are folks out there who feel quite differently about the music than I do.
Still it is an interesting film and it does have "staying power". In the final analysis it may be one of Peckinpah's finer efforts.
