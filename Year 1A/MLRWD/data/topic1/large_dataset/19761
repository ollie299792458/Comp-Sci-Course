I remember being intrigued by this movie when it first came out (when I was young and had not seen it yet).  So I bought the DVD, saw it a few times and my verdict is in.  I'm impressed with the effort put into it, such as the cartoon-like cinematography, art direction, legendary music by Sondheim, and all those cool cameos in the film (check the cast listing).  Al Pacino did a good job as Big Boy Caprice and his Oscar nomination for supporting actor is well deserved.  Although Beatty's performance as Dick Tracy is a bit dry, I believe the part called for it, the same goes for most of the characters.  There is not much character development here with only one exception.  This exception being the Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who starts out as a homeless-orphan-street-thief, but ends up being taken under Tracy's wing and becoming Tracy's sidekick.  Korsmo acting seemed authentic, and some of the most emotional scenes in the movie are between him and Tracy.  Such as when the Kid receives an honorary badge for saving Tracy's life, and when he chooses Dick Tracy Jr. for a name.  Madonna looks really beautiful (perhaps the best she has ever looked on film) and does a decent job as Breathless, but her best parts are when she sings or her one-liners (but again I think the part called for it).  Also I was pleasantly surprised that Madonna actually has two roles in the film (you would have to see to find out).  Overall, though I was intrigued by the movie as a youngster, I must say that despite the considerable effort put into the film, I feel that it lacks charm and intrigue. But again for the third time think the comic strip origins of the movie called for it, and because of this it may leave viewers without any afterthoughts, and what adds to this is the fact that there is no special features at all on the DVD!
