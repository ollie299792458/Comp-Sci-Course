This series surprised me with its success and also pleased me with the acting, plots, etc.

The issues I have are with the Blu Ray disks. Disk two of the set contained two episodes that had spots that would "stick" and stop playing. Disk five had the same trouble. I returned them to Amazon for a replacement, and the new disks had the same problem with disk two. I've never had this much trouble with Blu Rays before. I'm not sure whether I'll keep the replacement set or return and buy the regular DVD. The Blu Ray disks are great visually. Sharp, clear, wonderful pictures. I was excited when I saw how great the scenes were until some of the disks would not play properly. After reading other reviews, this playback problem is obviously an issue of the manufacturer's.
The packaging is also the most ridiculous I've seen with any DVDs. They're contained in a cardboard, folding sleeve. Each DVD has its own pocket. To remove them, you have to TRY to slide them out of their pockets without using your fingers - next to impossible. Not only does this packaging encourage scratching but also fingerprints on the DVDs. There are no plastic covers, nor any of the "buttons" to hold them in place. Someone really missed the boat on this deal. It's too bad there are so many negative issues with the DVDs and packaging. The series deserves better.
