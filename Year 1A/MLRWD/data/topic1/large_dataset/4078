Hello there!!! Drink with Woody. Drink with Woody 'Harry "Barfly" Block' Allen. Woody tries to out "Barfly" the real "Barfly". And he comes very close. So, drink with Woody. On some lonely night, slap this video in, and get out a bottle, and see how you do. But seriously, this is one of Woody Allens most crudest and crass films. I have been watching Woody Allen movies for decades, and was surprised at some of the language. But, I still like this movie. In fact, it probably ranks with his best.

  Moreover, I like how it subtly, or perhaps not so subtly, alludes to some of his other classic films, like: "Annie Hall" and "Hannah and Her Sisters". I want to talk about "Annie Hall" a bit. Many people say how Quentin Tarentino revolutionized or played with, I do not know quite how to say it, traditional narrative. But I feel Woody Allen did it before him, in a movie like "Annie Hall". So, what does this have to do with "Deconstructing Harry"? I think that DH alludes to AH. Especially with those "literary flashbacks", and how, which I found very intriguing, these "literary flashbacks" blended into actual flashbacks.
