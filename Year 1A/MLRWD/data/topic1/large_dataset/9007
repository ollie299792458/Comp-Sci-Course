Apocalypse Now is loosely based on the book `Hear of Darkness by Joseph Conrad; the film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and set in the Vietnam War; Martin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard who is picked from a `Special forces' group to hunt down and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has supposed to have gone insane. Kurtz is played only shortly by Marlon Brando but he gives off the impression that the madness of war he has witnessed in this "new war" Vietnam, has pushed him over the edge. Dennis Hopper plays a brilliant bit part as the photojournalist; he reviles Kurtz like a poetic God, the parts played by the crew of the small boat are played well by Frederic Forrest as the `Chef', Laurence Fishburne as `Mr. Clean' (A young colored boy who thinks the war is one big adventure). There are other parts played by Robert Duvall who plays Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who tries to act like one of the boys and likes to surf. Harrison Ford plays a bit part early on in the film as an up and coming gopher for the generals.

Along with Coppola, John Milius has written a brilliant a subtle screenplay about the horror of war, the whole film works well although it is renowned for the multitude of problems while filming. The film was filmed in the Philippines and on numerous occasions the President of the country had to take the helicopters that he had rented to Coppola away to fight the real `Revolution' on the opposite side of the film. The film was also to run into numerous financial difficulties that literally bankrupted the Coppola family, but on its release in 1979, the film was rewarded with two Oscars, which in my eyes is a little disappointing.
