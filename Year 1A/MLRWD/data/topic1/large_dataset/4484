I don't really know why people insist that the film is about drug trade! I think the film is about humans and their hopes and defects: A very powerful man with no weapon to protect his daughter, a nouveau-rich hot shot who is suddenly in jail, a spoon fed beauty running for money and a superb policeman hoping to provide something for the childhood.
The way the film has been "woven" is pretty rare in the new films (it looks like the well-made movies we use to see in the 60's and 70s), and the hazy impression of a fine movie by its humanity (and not graphic) may remind us that Hollywood is still in good shape.
A salute to Michael Douglas for taking one step back offering the axial role for Benicio Del Toro: I don't think that anyone else could represent the 3rd world pure and simple man, looking for fairness, as he did.
The characters and the stories of the movie could make at least 3 successful movies; this is in case you would not consider the amazing shooting on Mexico, who could be considered as a masterpiece on its own, as a fourth successful movie. 
It doesn't really matter what is your interest in movies, whether it is the gender, the directors, the stars or simply the entertainment; you should see the movie and considered as a reference (it will make you very picky).
