CHRISTMAS EVIL is a surprisingly chilling, effective and well-made horror film that rubs off as more of a character study than a true slasher film. As a boy, Harry saw his mother making love with Santa Claus, and in his adulthood, he owns a toy store called 'Jolly Dream'. Little do the townspeople and the employees know that Harry is now a crazed killer - Santa's number one fan - and he'll do anything to keep the tradition going by keeping track of who has been naughty and who has been nice. Brandon Maggart is exceptional as the psycho Santa in this atmospheric and frightening tale that mixes in some humour as well. The music and sound is equally great, combining the superb effects of orchestral pieces to synth to make the ultimate in terror soundtrack. This horror movie, though a little slow-moving at times, is a little gem that has finally been rewarded with a DVD release, and rightfully so. This could obviously be the (ahem) second best Christmas horror film, falling right under the place of BLACK CHRISTMAS. 
CHRISTMAS EVIL was released under two alternate titles - TERROR IN TOYLAND, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.
