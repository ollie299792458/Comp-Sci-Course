having had the oppurtunity to work on this masterpiece i can only say that terrence malick and john toll are both geniuses.to work with them was both a pleasure and honour.i have worked with both good and bad directors  including john frankenheimer,bruce beresford,peter jackson,john woo and  others and can only sat that terrence is amazing. as for the film itself i  think that you can only make up your own mind.you either love it or hate it  depending on your preferences but for all those who hate it all i can say  is go back to your mass produced american crap.this might be an arty farty  movie but it is among the best.how it did not win best cinematography and  best soundtrack(losing both to SPR) just shows the mentality of the academy  and how you have to spend money and suck up to people to win oscars.anyway  it won most of the awards that matter.i just hope that terrence malick does  another movie soom and that i have the priviledge of working with such a  visionary director again.
