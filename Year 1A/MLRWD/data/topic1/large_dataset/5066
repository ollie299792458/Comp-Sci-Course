I confess, I got this DVD with great reservation and prejudice. I was/am a big DP fan....but from their original glory days. As some rock groups grow old, change members, their name may remain, but the music will be different, and it is seldom comes near to their fame-making days. Not so this group and this DVD. A very pleasent surprise. This is THE real Deep Purple (MK II).
I was glued to the screen from the first to the last minute and the music "took me away", just like in their glory days. That is my overall opinion. 
Some details:
Blackmore, incredible technique, but one can tell that his heart is not in it.
Gillan, real DP fans may not agree with me, but his singing matured (his voice is not as flexible as used to be, but the overall effect is better).
Glover is Glover. He even looks the same.
Paice, still a fantastic drummer, his highly spirited play greatly helps the overall atmosphere.
Lord, while misses some of his old incredible improvisational style, still a very unique sounding musician.
Highly recommended album.
