I didn't even know there was a live action version of Street Fighter until I purchased Street Fighter 2 for PC, and this movie along with a computer gamepad was included "free" with the game. The gamepad was worth it, but the movie..well... free is still a little stiff.I give it two stars, and that's being generous. I admire the producers drive to want to make Street Fighter into a live action movie. I really do, but there were so many things wrong it with that I don't know where to even start.
Well first of all (a bit of repetition ahead), everything was backwards. I can't even say backwards; they just stuck people in roles the producer wanted them. Ryu a hustler? Not hardly. And Vega hispanic instead of Spanish? Don't think so. They had a cast full of notable actors, but 1.) many of them were not suited for the role (first thought that comes to mind is Wes Studi -most notable for playing Geronimo- playing Sagat), and/or 2.) their true talent was suppressed (such as Ming-Na who played Chun Li).
I don't want to continue with this rant because I know I'll end up spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it (as if I hadn't already). So to sum it all up, they had the potential and the actors (for some of the roles), but everything went downhill from there. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie, but if you're looking for something to humor you then this is it.
