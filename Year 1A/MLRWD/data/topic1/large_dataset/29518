I happened to catch this movie last weekend.

It was Mother's Day, and pretty cool with overcast skies and local showers, so Mum looked at me a little askance when I suggested that we go to a movie, instead of a long drive in the country. (With fuel here in OZ at AU$1-45 per litre (approx AU$6-60 per imperial gallon!!) the admission price was a lot cheaper than filling up the tank.........

I had no real idea of what it was about, except for the reviews in the paper, that told me that it was about an Indian motorcycle, and starred Anthony Hopkins, so I decided to try it out.

Being both a keen motorcyclist and a devoted Hopkinsphile, I had a bit of trouble convincing Mum that it was not just another "bike movie", but in the cinema, it didn't take her long to fall under the spell that I also felt.

The story of "little bloke makes good against overwhelming odds" has always been a favourite of moviemakers since the days of Charlie Chaplin, and this gem is no exception.

There is no need for me to go into reviewing the plot, which is summarised quite well by other reviwers on these pages, but suffice it to say that it IS one of the best movies I have seen in years!

Lacking any other reviews from 'down under' (Come on, all you Kiwis!) I just had to let everyone know that "The World's Fastest Indian" is the feel-good movie of the decade!

Mum enjoyed it, and I was walking on air for a couple of hours after leaving the cinema, and that doesn't happen very much these days.

I have pre-ordered the DVD from my friends at Amazon this morning.

Time to pull the helmet on, and fire up the "motor-sickle" for a bit of a run, showers, or no showers....

Do yourself a favour, and SEE IT!
