I loved 'Casino' for what it was supposed to be-a movie that depicted the mob's role in the rise of Las Vegas. Historically, the movie is not 100% accurate, but I will not pick on it for historical accuracy.

 I would have given the movie 5 stars had it not been for the cornfield scene at the end. It's the sole reason I cannot sit through this movie more than once in a great while. The level of violence throughout the movie is pretty high, and it's graphic, but the end is literally sickening. What happened could have been worked in many other ways, it didn't have to be as graphic. It is also historically unnecessary. In real life, Joe Pesci's character was named Tony 'The Ant' Spilotro, and Spilotro was found pistol-whipped and strangled. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I will warn you: it's really like watching someone being murdered. Most of the time you can disengage your emotions and accept that you are only watching a movie, but this scene is psychologically very damaging. If you are easily upset or have children in the house don't let them see it.

 When growing up I was no stranger to violence, believe me, and I can tolerate the violence I see in most movies today, but I had to include these criticisms of that particular scene in this review because I felt so strongly about it.

 Watch it, enjoy it, but if you have children in the house or are sensitive to violence be prepared.

 The book, by the way, is also very good and historically it is much more accurate.
