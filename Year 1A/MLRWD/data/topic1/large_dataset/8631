If I get bored and cannot choose a movie to watch...I will always find myself reaching for this one. It is watchable anytime of day, over and over...rotate between evil dead and this one and you can't go wrong. It starts out with Ash and his girlfriend traveling to the old house in the woods. The film doesn't hesitate to jump into the good stuff. I mean it almost starts out like the cheesiest camp-fest with the two lovey dovey people exchanging rotten lines, but Sam Raimi takes care of that garbage with a quickness. All hell breaks loose within 3 minutes of the film's beginning and then the laughs...Never have I seen comedy and horror mix so well as I have in this film. You have your serious horror directors like Lucio Fulci delivering scares in the brilliant "The Beyond" and Argento's "Suspiria", but those films could never evoke a laugh or else it would ruin the movie. Raimi does this seemlessly without ruining a thing. Brilliant possessions, demons, chainsaws, hands, etc... I just can't say enough...go watch it if you haven't yet and if you are sifting through your dvd's or vhs's trying to find something good to watch...just go for what you know! It's a winner everytime!!!  Trust me or I'll swallow your soul!!!!!!!!!!!!
