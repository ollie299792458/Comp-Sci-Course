I LOVE this movie and could go on about it forever but don't worry I won't. When this first came out I din't think it would be all that hot, and also I wasn't a big fan of horror films apart from Halloween but I was  eventually persuaded by my friends. And I'm happy they did I love this  film. The plot is quite simple. It starts off with Casey Becker (Drew  Barrymore) being horribly killed. We then go straight to the aftermath. At  the school she went to the press are having a field day and Sidney Prescott  (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with this and it also being the year  long anniversary of her mother's murder. Then the murders start up again,  first with the high school headteacher, then Sidney's best friend Tatum  (Rose McKowan) A tfirst Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is suspected but he is  then released. Itr's then a free for all with everyone suspecting everyone  else. I won't give away who does it but I must say I was suprised. Neve  Campbell is fantastic as tortured Sidney, Skeet Ulrich is great as the  suspicious boyfriend Billy, Courteney Cox is excellent as the bitchy  journilist Gale Weathers (in a refreshing break away from Friends) Jamie  Kennedy is cool as the film-buff Randy and David Arquette is sweet as the  quirky nerdy Deputy Duey. This is a great film, but the first 10 minutes  where Drew Barrymore is killed is of course the most thrilling and scary.  This is a great film. If you haven't seen it yet where have you been the  last 2 years? Get your head out of the sand and rent it now!
