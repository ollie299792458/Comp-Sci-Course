the story is typical sailor moon:  evil villain wants to destroy the world for personal benefit.  sailor moon &amp; co. stop evil villain in a great action scene with terrific music.  love triumphs over all in the end.  sailor moon fans have seen it before. 
the Sailor Moon S movie is a  must-see for sailor moon fans, not because of english dub weaknesses (of  which there are many; but the dub has its strengths too), or because it's  sailor moon, or because it's better than the other two movies (which it is  not, in my opinion) but because it contains that great jewel of the sailor  moon series: character depth.  the whole thing that makes the sailor moon  series enjoyable is the fact that the characters are capable of so much  emotion that they feel real, despite the fact that they are animated.  luna's love for kakeru is poignant, usagi's love for mamoru is heartfelt,  the outer senshi make a great addition to the movie, and the music is  terrific as usual.  
the R movie has a better plot, and the SS movie has  a weaker climactic scene, leaving the S movie comfortably ranked among the  movies.  definitely one for the video (or DVD) collection.
