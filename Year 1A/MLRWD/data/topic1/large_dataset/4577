I didn't expect to love this movie as much as I did, so I was very pleased to have a new favorite.  I saw clips of it on tv but never had the opportunity to watch the whole thing, so I purchased it and was enthralled.  The dancing is so much fun to watch and the actors are very likeable (even though the high school kids start off kind of rough).  I wouldn't call this a family friendly movie because there are some serious subjects touched upon (alcoholism, prostitution, illegal substances) but I must say I was very impressed that the profanities were kept to a minimum and there was no sex (only implied that the mother of one teen was a prostitute).  It was a touching story about how a teacher reached a group of high school trouble-makers by teaching them to ballroom dance.

I LOVED the dancing.  I didn't read other reviews enough to see what everyone else thought, but it was incredible and enjoyable to watch (I wouldn't call the actors professionals as there seemed to be some disjointed spots, but the characters they played were supposed to be amateurs anyway).

The music was also fantastic.  I don't like alternative or rap music, but they did some mixes with some rap and some Gershwin classics, and the mixes were amazing.  It made me want to get up and dance too.  :-) I'll be buying the soundtrack soon!
