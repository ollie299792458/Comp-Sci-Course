The more I watched this this movie the more annoyed I became.  You could see the tragedy unfolding and the fathers attitude to his just out of High School son's envolvement with an older women with a troubled marriage and two children was idiotic.  The mothers concern about the relationship was correct. The way in which the father places the blame on his wife for the loss of there son because she had always been so cold and distant(may he should of spoke up earlier) was comical.
  The scene on the lobster boat where first a male with a claw that has  been lost in battle is shown and then a female with young is described as easily being able to take out two males is pivotal. The part of the trap where the loberters are held is known as the bedroom.
  After he has comitted his act of revenge the father seems bewildered over a picture he saw in his victims apartment in which Marissa and her children seemed so happy in there former life, a look he had seen when Marissa was with his own son. All the while he is rubbing a finger that was clawed by a lobster.  Had he just gotten rid of a big problem for Marissa? Was this her intention all along? Why was she in a relationship with his son?
