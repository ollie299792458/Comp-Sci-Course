I watched this movie because somebody gave it 5 stars and I love English who dunnits.  But this is not the England of Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle or Dorothy Sayers. This plot is just pathetic.
The Americans and the Israelis are the bad guys. The Americans apparently have secret detention centers where they are torturing prisoners night and day and the Israelis apparently killed a poor peace activist waving a white flag. Our hero is on to the fact that the Prime Minister knows about this but is covering everything up. So does the truth come out or do the British bow down and kiss American and Israeli butts? That's what the dramatic tension of the movie comes down to.  It might resonate with English audiences but I found it completely uninteresting.
The acting is good. Some of the interactions between the characters are interesting and the political infighting is well done. This is a good movie to watch if you've had a stressful day and would just like to unwind and watch our hero struggle with issues of no consequence whatever.
