This is a very typical old style Kung Fu movie (made in 1978), which is made purely for entertainment. If you won't be so critical and just judge it with the old day standard, it is still a well-made movie. There is not much plot. The acting is just so-so, sometimes a little silly. But in 70's, most of the Kung Fu movies are of this style. The difference is that this movie is extremely well choreographed. The fighting is not violent and is blended with plenty of fun and creativity. The part that the beggar plays with Jackie Chan in the wood is one of my favourite scene of the movie. It is amazing that the beggar can play with Jackie's body in so many ways you can hardly fancy.
It is one of Yuan Wooping's early works. The fighting has changed so much over the years (Drunken Master II (Jackie Chan's 1994 work) is a modern Kung Fu movie, watch that for to see the difference). But there is no wire work, no special effects. The actors actually did everything you see. If you can think of how much effort it takes to design and practise so many fighting scenes before they are ready to be shot, yet every scene is still so full of imagination, you will truly appreciate this movie as a classic.
