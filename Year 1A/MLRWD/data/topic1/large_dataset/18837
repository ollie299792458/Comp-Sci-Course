This really isn't a movie worth watching.  Things happen - but that is a poor substitute for a plot.  There is no character development - and no particular reason to care about any of the characters other than the fact they happen to be moving across the screen.

We are all familiar with dark and moody Westerns.  This is a light and moody "Western" (actually, since it takes place in Bolivia, I would say it is a "Southern").  The photography and scenery are beautiful.  Another reviewer complained about the color and I don't understand that because the colors are lush and bright.

So, if you want to watch a travel movie about Bolivia, this is the one for you.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE LACK OF PLOT.  These can't be a plot spoiler because there isn't any plot.  And I strongly suggest you not bother watching it.  But, there are some commments here about things that happen during the movie.

The main character just drifts through the movie.  He causes innocent people to get killed - and he does some of that killing himself - but nothing happens to him.  What's the whole point?  He's the same person at the end of the movie as he was at the start.  It really isn't even a story - it's a series of events.

Butch Cassidy does not act consistently through the movie.  At the end, based on the entire movie, he would have taken the Spainard's horse, not just let it loose. He doesn't.  Butch survives a point-blank gunshot wound.  That's not reasonable.

The flashbacks are randomly inserted and fail to make any sense or really develop the plot that isn't there (how did Butch and Sundance escape the gunfight?  Who died in their place?).

Bottom Line:  Beautiful photography, complete lack of plot and character development and reason to care about any of the characters.  There are many great Westerns out there.  There's simply no reason to waste your time and money watching this one.
