Let me start off by saying that I am a Zach Braff fan, so my opinion may be slightly affected. However, I thought that overall, this was a very good movie. It's like a slightly more adult Garden State. I think this movie embodies what people are beginning to call the "quarter life crisis" - that is, the realization that you're not in your early twenties anymore and it's time to grow up. This is what Zach Braff's character is struggling with in this movie. It is basically the story of a man unsure whether or not he's ready to settle down, and when his girlfriend becomes pregnant, he feels like he's forced to make that choice. Unfortunately, he makes a few mistakes on the path of finding his answer.

The music was wonderful in this movie and I highly recommend the soundtrack. I also thought that the acting was exceptional all around as was the film style. My only complaint is that it somewhat says that "cheating is o.k." Not quite as bad as Closer (that was my main complaint with that movie) but the hint of that idea is there.

Either way, it's a great movie and definitely worth seeing.
