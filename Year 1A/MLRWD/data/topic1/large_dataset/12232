"The heart wants what the heart wants.  Even if that heart is no longer beating," might be the theme of this very funny film by Tim Burton.

I used to watch the original series on TV when I was a kid.  And I was hooked, especially when the Barnabas Collins character was introduced.  I tried to watch this series again recently when streaming for it became available, and realized that in reality, the series itself wasn't all that great.  It wasn't really scary enough, and it wasn't really campy enough.  The mistake that they made with the series:  they needed to go one way or the other and they tried to have it both ways, and I believe that it succeeded ultimately at neither.

But Mr. Burton didn't make that mistake.  He decided to mostly take the campy route, and in my opinion, it works.  The spirit of the early 70s was recreated here as well, so that worked.  And the overall acting was very good as well, particularly by Johnny Depp and his nemesis.  But I believe that the writing was the strongest point in this film, since movies such as "Dark Shadows" either succeed or fail based upon writing.  Comedic timing by the actors is also important, and I believe that the actors succeeded in that regard.  In particular, there is a scene where an entire Carpenters song is played that is very clever and funny, especially if you're a fan of that excellent group that disbanded too young.

One other item that worked as well:  the special effects.  There is a lot of CGI here, and in a lot of films, the CGI just isn't quite believable.  In "Shadows," differentiating between what is fantasy and what is real is difficult, which is quite a feat.

Pretty big recommendation by me for a film that the critics panned, for some odd reason.  Maybe too many of those critics were too young to have seen the original series, and therefore don't realize that the film is actually better?
