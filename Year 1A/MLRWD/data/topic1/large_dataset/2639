I gave this DVD 4 stars only because I would have like to have had 'behind the scenes features' and audio commentaries by those who worked on the film. I realize ,of course, that George C. Scott has passed away but some of the other leads are still active and I love hearing about the work involved in producing such a fine piece of movie making.
  For years, I felt that the Alastair Sim feature was the best, but when I saw Scott's version, I was blown away!  Scott IS Scrooge!  At no time do you catch him acting. And this is true of all the actors, even those in bit parts. And Tiny Tim .... he truly appears fragile.
All three spirits who visit Scrooge are fabulous but when the ghastly 3rd one makes his appearance, my toes curl! It's so creepy.
  Set designs and costumes are terrific.
  I could go on and on but what really makes or breaks a movie is always the writing.
And no one can't beat Charles Dickens' story telling ability.
  I don't think "A Christmas Carol" is specifically about Christmas; I think its about how we can mess up our lives yet still find redemption.
