I just finished watching The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) on Blu-ray which I ordered from Amazon.  It's one of my favorite films and still holds up today, largely thanks to its wonderful direction and quality attention to realistic detail.  Likened to westerns and samurai films, it should be at the top of anyones list that is a fan of action, cars, post apocalyptic futures and stories about a lone wolf type hero.  The quality of the picture is great and the sound is good too thanks to being on Blu-ray.  And if you are worried about getting this because you haven't seen the first Mad Max, fear not, the film is done in such a way you don't really need to.  There is a short recap at the start of the film which will help tie things together.  Also a new feature exclusive to the high-def version not found on regular DVD is a new audio commentary with the director.  I haven't listened to it yet so I'm hoping it sheds insight onto the production of this wonderful film.
See Mel Gibson at his best as... The Road Warrior.
