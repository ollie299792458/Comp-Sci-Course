I have been purchasing anime for a long time.  When I was still uneducated, and new to the genre I would use ... reviews to help me decide which series to buy and watch.  I realized a flaw with that system quickly, after it lead me to several bad decisions.  The flaw is this:  only FANS generally take the trouble to write "reviews" on here.  So unless they already like the series, they're not going to bother themselves -- that, or they REALLY hate the series.  I, contrary to my rating, do not "HATE" Fruits Basket.  I merely wanted to lower that ridiculous five star average.  Five stars should be reserved the cream of the crop, the best stuff you've ever feasted your eyes on.  But you can't convince these rabid fans of that.

So here's the deal.  Fruits Basket is...decent.  The animation is pretty dern good.  The plot is, interesting at first, but quickly becomes monotonous and repetitive (with occasional high points).  The main character couldn't grow or change in any meaningful way if you pumped her full of steroids and buried her in fertilizer.  I think I laughed, genuinely laughed, twice..?  The rest of the time I was either faintly smiling, or faintly bored.  The music is very synthesized (what isn't these days?) and like the plot, good at first, but quickly repetitive and occasionally abbrasively obnoxious.

Also, you need to know that this is a "Shoujo" series.  In otherwords, it's aimed at girls.  This means that it is chalk full of GORGEOUS He/Shes.  Are they male?  Are they female?  Are they gay?  Are they straight?  Are they bi?  If you want a series that'll keep you on your toes and is on the cutting edge of redifining gender roles and challeging traditional sterotypes, the aptly named "FRUITS Basket" is it.  Toward this end, the main character's love interest (a guy) is voiced by a woman in the Japanese version which was the one thing I truly was not able to forgive or forget about the series.
