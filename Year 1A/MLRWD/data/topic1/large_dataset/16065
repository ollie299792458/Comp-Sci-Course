I am a former Aerobics Instructor of 25 years.  I love the feeling of a good cardio.  I recently, over the past 2 years, have packed on the wieght dure to knee surgery and a bit of laziness.  I have all the Reebok step tapes, Tae-Bo and various exercise videos & DVDs.  This is a really fun, get your heart rate up, complete workout!  I had to modify some of the moves for the knee/weight issue but plan to be on top of this workout in a matter of weeks.  Denise is, as always, upbeat, easy to understand and straight to the point.  The music is generic so it doesn't take away from her instruction.

What I like about this DVD is that there are different segments.  There is the cardio, strength and flexibility.  Today I did the cardio with flexibility.  It was a quick, 30-40 minutes and just right for starting out.  This is the type of DVD you can modify for your level, as I did, stepping side instead of jacking and knee lifts instead of jogging, etc.  This will be a long term DVD to grow with you.  I have too many I grew out of and bored with.  This doesn't even require a lot of floor room, just about a 5' x 5' square.

Way to go Denise.  After 2 kids, I can see from her there is still hope! LOL
