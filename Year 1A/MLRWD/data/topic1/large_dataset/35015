As the search for the fountain of youth is carried out by Barnes, and the search for grown up adulthood is forced upon the rest of the Groovers by Phillip, we are taken on a magical journey. As we realize the Groovers are attempting to sidestep real responsibility for as long as possible, we realize too late the one thread which would keep Gardner as member of our society is snipped at the end of the wonderful Fandango dance with unnamed Suzy Amis. The Pat Metheny song for this dance remains a favorite of mine, and I hope to use it as a wedding song of my own. The symbolism of the luminarias blowing out as the friends say a last goodbye will tug at the heart of any man who has loved deeply and lost, or shared truly memorable experiences with close friends. The cold and unfeeling Lester the accountant goes his way with a wave, the conscientious objector Doorman heads out to become minister of a small town, Wagner tears off for an abbreviated honeymoon before shipping out to Viet Nam. Poor Phillip is left to become an adult too quickly as a Lieutenant in an unpopular war, (without his old Caddilac he delivered hundreds of pizzas to aford) and Gardner is last seen toasting them all from a rocky mountain ridge at the Texas - Mexico border. We can only hope the idealism of staying young and putting off growing up as long as possible is not left only to college kids, but is in the hearts of all of us. What started out as a rollicking road trip romp turns into a very symbolic representation of 5 of the very different sides of us all. Let's hope this picture reminds us to stay young.
Have fun with this one, enjoy the end!
