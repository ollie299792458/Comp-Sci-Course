This may not rate as one of Clint's all-time greats, but it still has enough going on to make most Clint Eastwood fans very happy. For me it was a good mix of themes of redemption, reconciliation, coming to terms with retirement, old ways vs. new, duty and perseverance mixed with generous helpings of comedy and classic Clint one-liners.

Coming towards the end of his career as a Marine, Tom Highway finds himself taking on the task of whipping into shape a rather hilariously pathetic collection of new Marine recruits. After numerous attempts to drive him off initially, he perseveres and gets them to a point where they can handle themselves in the Grenada invasion that serves as the movies' backdrop.

Tom also finds himself trying to reconcile and revive the relationship his ex-wife (Marsha Mason), and also trying to come to terms with a military full of young know-it-alls who have no concept of real-world experience (prompting the line "Does his mother know he's out running around playing Army?").

Some of the best comic moments are found in Highway's interactions with "Stitch" Jones (Mario Van Peoples), especially where  "Stitch" gets his comeuppance after hustling Highway out of a meal and then leaving him stranded (havng to hitchike the rest of the way to his base).

One caution, the language in this film is pretty brutal, but if you can look past that , you do get a good solid Clint Eastwood outing here. Definitely worth having.
