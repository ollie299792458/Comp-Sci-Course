The producers of this fine mini-series have done a remarkable job in turning Dickens's 989-page (in my Penquin edition) novel into a visual and historical treat.  The characters come alive, dressed and coifed and speaking in the style of Dickens's day; and one feels he/she is watching a period of old England first hand.  The entire cast performs brilliantly; there is not a false note to be seen.

Dickens touches on many of the social problems of the time-poverty, child labor, predatory lawyers, indifferent courts, an almost unbreakable caste system.  It is to the credit of the producers that they were able to blend so many of these facets into their story-telling.  Some are only touched on, but they make the production whole.

There are three discs, covering 7+ hours, but they are broken up into the form of the mini-series, so that they can be viewed over a period of time.

This is a most worthwhile choice for watching, and if it makes the viewer want to read the book, all the better!
