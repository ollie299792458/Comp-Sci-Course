After reading some of the other reviews. Gee I guess I better go watch this movie for the oh 30th time!Anybody who did not Love this flick, Must have just gotten Payed back. The storyline is fantastic, The writing is  awsome,And the actors chosen for each part(right down to the drug delivery  boy) were PERFECT.I am still Quoting lines from this movie.It may very well  be my favorite of all time.Coburn,and Bill Devane are priceless.My only  regret is missing it at the theaters.I must of been Sh..t nuts.Naa to much  moxy.The movie grabs you into the story right from the start.Forget  bathroom breaks,who wants em.All the way through I was hoping that it was  going to be a longer movie than it was.Because the way he pays back,Well we  all wish we could be so cold and cool at the same time and to top that,  funny also. No reader of this review,Pay no attention to the negative  reviews of this film and do like I titled this, Get two copies,Your gonna  need em And stay away from any guys named Val. They tend to be trouble.  B.R. B.A.Ok
