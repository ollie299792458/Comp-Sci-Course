Disney/Pixar has created a homerun with their latest animated film. They turn the world of monsters on its head, with hilarious results.
Monsters James P. Sullivan, "Sulley" (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) work for Monsters, Inc. - a company that collects children's screams and turns them into electricity.
All is well until a child makes it through the closet door into the monster world. Then it's up to Sulley and Wazowski to try to get her back, and save her from the evil plans of Randall, the lizard.
The wise-cracks are almost constant in the film, making it enjoyable for both children and adults.
Parents do not need to worry about the monsters in the film. They are, almost entirely, humorous and non-threatening. There is little to be frightened by. However, I would caution parents that the characters frequently use the words: "stupid", "idiot", and "shut up".
The collector's edition 2-disc DVD contains a plethora of never-before seen footage on a separate 207-minute bonus CD.
It includes the animated shorts of "Mike's New Car," and "For the Birds", the filmmaker's audio commentary, a sneak peak at Disney/Pixar's summer 2003 film, "Finding Nemo," the Outtakes from Monster's Inc. and much, much more.
The amount of material on the bonus CD is unimaginable. It includes a tour of Pixar's animation studies, never-before-seen deleted scenes, a 3D location flyaround, hundreds of images from the Monstropolis Art Gallery, animation gags and a guide to "in" jokes from the film, an interactive game, and material about being an employee at Monsters, Inc.
If you're debating between the video and the DVD, definitely purchase the DVD. The picture and sound quality is superb, and the additional footage is worth the price.
