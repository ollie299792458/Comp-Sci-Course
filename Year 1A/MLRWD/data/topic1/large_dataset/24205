When I first read a synopsis for the movie, I was leery of seeing Tom Hanks (or Michael Sullivan, his character in "Road To Perdition) play a hit man.  Here is an actor who earns his bread and butter playing nice guys (as in "Forrest Gump," "Saving Private Ryan," etc.) However, he brings redemption to the character of Michael Sullivan.  Michael Sullivan is more than a hit man or a goon; he is also a father and a husband.
Well, not to give too much of the movie away, but Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hit man for a crime boss John Rooney (the great Paul Newman).  When young Michael Sullivan Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin, on his way) accidentally witnesses one of his father's hits, their family life is out the door.  Jude Law also puts in a great performance Maguire, a sadistic photographer/hit man who is on the trail of Michael Sullivan and his son.  McGuire has to be one of the best movie villains I have seen this year; it gave me chill bumps to listen to him describe taking photographs of corpses.  Stanley Tucci also has a nice small part in the film, as does Daniel Craig, who plays Connor Rooney, the weasly blood son of John Rooney, who envies Michael Sullivan because of his father's love for him.
The scenery and sets in the movie are great also.  Mendes uses odd camera angles and shots in some scenes, and the rain and snow really add to the overall mood of the movie.
I was a great fan of "American Beauty," but Sam Mendes has outdone himself.  I think I smell Academy Awards (sniff, sniff).
