This was a favorite series of mine because it caught the essence of an active life combined with peace of mind. Although I had taken lessons in martial arts since age 15, and had watched the series like "Green Hornet" with the legendary Bruce Lee, the way that "Kung Fu" presented the full measure of life was very important. It also inspired me to pursue a more rigorous study of the martial arts when I was in grad school. The effects of this series were profound in my life, not as mere emulation but as an example of an optional approach to life that worked.

The lives that our parents lived were rewarding but didn't allow enough space to breathe (and they would agree.) The richness and complexity of human life has to be pursued experientially and experimentally to be full appreciated, and this series was part of that process for me.

Of course, others in the same vein would be Richard Feynman who wrote several books, two general titles of merit: "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?" and "What Do You Care What Other People Think?" Strong mind, strong body, to vary the phrasing a bit.

I have probably 40 videotapes with one or two episodes on them, but to have the episodes available without commercials is a great advantage. Besides, the tapings were all done after 1980, when "Kung Fu" was shown in syndication and therefore probably missing minutes of scenes.
