As a longtime fan of the Hitchhiker Guide book series, I was very excited that they were finally making a big-budget treatment of the original classic. After seeing it in the theater on opening day, I thought the movie was well-cast, well-acted and well-produced. The visual effects were great (and I even like how they reinterpreted Zaphod's two-headed aspect using minimal, yet non-cheesy looking effects). And Zooey Deschanel is hot.

But as the movie came to a close, it became achingly clear that there is no possible way a normal two-hour movie could really do the book justice, despite all the great things about it. Even though it has been years since I last read the book, I realized as I was watching this movie that so many things that made the book great were edited out of the movie. This movie was hacked to pieces! If everything had been included in this movie, it would have doubled or tripled the run-time, which would just not have been commercial and therefore would have made this movie's release inconceivable.

I left the theater wishing that I had recently re-read the book to fill in the many blanks I felt from watching this movie. So I plan to re-read the book immediately before renting the movie for one final viewing. And hopefully the deleted scenes will fill in a few more gaps.

If you're reading this and haven't yet read the book, my suggestion is to read the book before watching the movie, just to see how other imaginations have interpreted parts of the book. I am sad to report that this movie simply doesn't (and can't) stand on it's own.
