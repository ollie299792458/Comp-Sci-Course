I am so glad that someone decided to put this together and put this out. THIS BAND DESERVES THIS TREATMENT. They are the PFunk of their time. Black radio stations did not want to play their music, and the white people loved them. Unfortunately, they did not generate the sales that they should have, so they were dropped by Columbia/Sony. The situation with Kendall Jones is heartbreaking, but, it needed to be told. The only downside to this masterpiece is why was not the Fishkeeper interviewed. Fish Fisher is one of the most underrated drummers of our time. He did some amazing things on the drumkit (Servitude from Give A Monkey A Brain, f.e.), and he made it look so easy. His brother, Norwood, underrated...hell all of the bandmembers are underrated. I wish that they could get back together, and do some serious damage to the plastic boring music scene right now. If you watch any documentary this year....PLEASE watch this one. You will not be disappointed. Fishbone soilders onward to Nuttsactor 5!!!
