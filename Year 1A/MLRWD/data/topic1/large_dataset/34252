For those who have nothing better to do with time, some of the advantages of a DVD ...

Pause in the scene where a Stuka is about to crash into a radar building, and single step, one frame at a time...You will be able to clearly see the nylon strings, and even the supporting stick that was used to propel the plastic model plane.

Pause in the scene where a person runs to take cover in a radar shelter, just as it is bombed.  By looking for an abrupt change in the pattern of the billowing smoke in the background you can identify the frame where the camera was stopped so that he could make his exit before the explosives went off...

And with singles frames you can also catch the ejected shell casings flying through the air inside the gunner's turrent of the German bombers.

Turn on English subtitles.  The people who wrote them knew nothing about the RAF and did not bother to have them reviewed by an expert, because in the subtitles RAF "Biggin" Hill is transcribed as Bacon as well as Big Wind, and RAF "Tangmere" is transcribed as Tang Bear!!!

What I want to know is where they got the minature Buckingham Palace???
