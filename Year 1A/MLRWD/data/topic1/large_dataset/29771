A brillant drama that is both moving and thought provoking.  This movie raises more questions than it answers, but deserves applause for showing all sides.  From Denzel Washington's hysterical comic mocking of the homosexual culture to Tom Hank's brilliant acting, this is a movie that dares to show that there are good people that believe in homosexuality and good people that don't.
This is a good movie to watch regardless of your views on homosexuality.  It didn't change my mind and I doubt it will change yours, but it did renew in my mind the idea that more compassion toward the other fellow is never a bad idea.
Even the "villians" of the film, the lawyers of Hank's firm, are hardly one dimensional.  For example, a lawyer that runs homosexuality down using Scripture is still concerned with Hank's health.
Bruce Springsteen's award winning song is eclipsed by the opera music in the scene after Hank's party.  One of the most moving scenes in any movie anywhere.
Highly recommended for amyone mature enough to see your beliefs challenged.
