This is a great movie to watch with a great truth about love. If you take it to a higher level there are some truths and principles presented in the lives of these pinguins that can nice well be applied to marriage. This movie was shown in a marriage conference in a Carribean country where it produced a great impact among the participants. The truth is that we are always taught to think that happiness is at the end of the road and this movie shows that true happines for the most part takes place while you are on the road. For those who are Christians, there are aspects of this movie that ressemble the sacramental face of marriage. It is a myth to think that marriage is all about happiness, joy and laughs and that you are not suppose to have tribulations and trials in it. The truth is that whoesover gets married is going to experience sufferring in their marriage whether they like it or not.  It is through suffering and trials that your marriage growths and becomes stronger or could also be weaken and destroyed.What a paradox!
