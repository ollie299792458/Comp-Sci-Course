Let me tell you two or even three words on this one, dude. I was a big fan of both MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, coming back in the early '80ies. When I heard Miller was aimed at doing a third, unnecessary installment, despite Byron Kennedy's death (the producer and film-making genius) I was highly disappointed. My expectations were high, and I was almost sure they would have messed up with it.
Oh man, I was wrong.
BEYOND THUNDERDOME is a brilliant, refreshing, provoking movie which successfully mixed-up violence and irony, well-crafted production and rawness, a solid and philosophical plot and the most stunning stunts ever seen at that given time. It's a "millennary" visionary epic all packed into a '90 minutes movie. One unique flick where the whole is far BIGGER then the sum of its parts, despite an uneven structure. That's fantastic!
Everything is great here. From the mystical and weird children/kids bearing their culture to the unforgettable centerpiece of the movie, Bartertown. From Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, who delivers the good in what could be pointed as an "outstanding performance" to the final chase scene, an energetic, creative and wonderful homage to the gianteous car sequence we saw in THE ROAD WARRIOR.
At last, but not the least, this is MEL GIBSON's finest performance in the action/adventure genre. He had the golden chance to push his legendary character towards new horizons, and he actually did it! MAD MAX rules.
Do a favour to yourself. This movie is truly a cinematic experience, something so impossible to replicate nowdays. I suggested BT to a lot of people, and everyone enjoyed and loved the movie to death too. Don't miss it. 6 stars out of five.
