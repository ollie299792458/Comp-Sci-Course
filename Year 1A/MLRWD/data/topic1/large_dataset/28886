First saw it in the theater and thought to myself "What a mess of a movie".  It is all over the place.  Saw the director's cut on dvd and thought to myself, much better.  Character development was apparently stripped from the theatrical release.  Now I see the same Director's Cut in BLU-RAY......WOW!!!  Seeing it again on a big screen TV in high definition is the way to go with this movie.  It seems the more I watch it, the more I fall in love with it.  The video looks absolutely stunning.  This is now one of my favorite show-off films in blu-ray.  Friends and family come over and want to watch something on my setup, Hellboy is now my film of choice.  As an action flick, the sound is just to die for.  Special effects and fight scene audio take the movie to another level.  I show it off with the 5.1 PCM and it never lets me down.  A friend of mine came over and said he didn't like the movie before, but after watching it again on my ps3 with big screen and surround sound, even he said it's great.
