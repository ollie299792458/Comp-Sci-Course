This film version of The Tempest worked for me.  It was well acted throughout, with a memorable performance from Helen Mirren.  While I am usually something of a Shakespeare purist, I thought the transformation of Prospero into Prospera was inspired, linking Prospero/Prospera's exile to false accusations of witchcraft and introducing a mother-daughter relationship into the story.  The magical elements on which Shakespeare depends to advance his plot are brilliantly imagined and presented by Julie Taymor, with a translucent and shape-changing Ariel.  Shakespeare's language (some of his best) comes across beautifully, and with an intimacy that can be difficult to achieve on stage.  There is wonderful chemistry between the characters (Prospera-Ariel, Miranda-Ferdinand, etc), and most of the scenes draw added power from the dramatic Hawaiian landscapes on which they are filmed.  The action is well paced, with the film lasting an hour and fifty minutes (short for Shakespeare).  We are lucky to have such an engaging and imaginative film of The Tempest.  I sincerely hope that Julie Taymor will have the opportunity to film more of Shakespeare's plays.  After watching The Tempest, I would dearly love to see what she would do with A Midsummer Night's Dream.
