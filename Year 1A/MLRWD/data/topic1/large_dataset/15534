Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is a very interesting anime, one that can keep you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the torcher! The case itself is incredibly small, unlike I expected. About the size of a normal DVD case, even though it features 6 discs. So if you like large fancy boxsets I suppose this isn't for you. Simply put, it is rather shocking to open the case and see all of the discs!

Anyway, Higurashi itself is a series I would suggest to any horror or suspense fan. As long as you don't mind the constant retelling of a few things, but it really isn't that bad. This is because every few episodes the series is completely started over in a new "arc". Featuring a different set of psycho's and murders. Varying storylines, since it follows different main characters, and such. So like I said, the repetition of the main storyline doesn't get too bothersome.

If you want to try something new or just want to see what all the Higurashi fuss is about, please purchase this set! I really hope you enjoy it!
