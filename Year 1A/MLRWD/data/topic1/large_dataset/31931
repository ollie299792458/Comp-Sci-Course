Stagecoach is known to be the milestone of western genre as it started the era of modern western movies. It is very impressive in terms of directing and acting as well as its influencial style of story telling.
The movie is about a group of passengers that travel by a stagecoach under the threat of a possible apachi attack. The final shootout scene is very short but quite exciting.
The director John Ford proves his extraordinary talent by creating such a great movie under the limited technical and technological circumstances of the 1930s. He deserves the highest praise not only for his directing skills but also, for his decisiveness in giving the role of Ringo Kid to the young John Wayne although the big Hollywood studios turned him down because of this insistence.
John Wayne shines like a star throughtout the movie. In fact, he has reached the star status through this movie and has become a legendary actor through his future works.
On the other hand, Thomas Mitchell garnered an Oscar at the Best Supporting Actor category for his bright performance in Stagecoach. Actually, I have a very special note for Turkish cartoon lovers: The famous "Dr. Salasso" character of Tommiks ( Known as Capitan Miki in Italy ) was created by the inspiration of the drunken doctor character played by Thomas Mitchell.
Stagecoach is a must-have for all the western lovers. It is a masterpiece of its genre. I highly recommend this movie.
