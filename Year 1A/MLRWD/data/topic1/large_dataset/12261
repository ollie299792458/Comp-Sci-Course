I saw "IT" for the first time yesterday and I still feel strange.
There is only one thing floating in my head, I want to see this movie again now! To see for the second time Pennywise saying "You all taste sooooooo much better when you're afraid!", this frightened me so much that I couldn't sleep at night and now I feel this need of seeing all the movie again but I rented it so I won't have this chance...too bad. But I recommand to everybody to read the book first, if you see the movie before reading the book, you will know the punch of the end(even if the end of the book is far much better, the monster is the same). This movie takes almost all the best parts of the book and add news too, the biggest difference is that Pennywise appears a lot more in the movie(and this is not bad at all, he's so scary when he shows his sharp teeth). I was also happy to see that there wasn't so much blood(I hate bloody movies). The only poor thing is the end but the rest is great(particulary the first part).
So if you're a Stephen King fan, rent or buy "IT" fast!
