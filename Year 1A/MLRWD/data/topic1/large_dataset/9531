This is a beautifully written script. This 1957 movie is all about holding to principles, articulating what you believe and the power of reason and communication. Fonda's "He can't hear you, he never will. Sit down." was a powerful example of how ...(read more)one can treat unreceptive people and retain personal dignity. The jurors aren't bad people; most of them have paid attention to the six-day trial and are familiar with the evidence, which is fairly compelling. They are able to discuss it intelligently. The writing is showcased by Sydney Lumet's excellent direction and the glorious, gray cinematography.

A crusty old Anglo-American juror complains of the young defendant, "He's a common ignorant slob. He don't even speak good English."

"He *doesn't* even speak good English," gently corrects an immigrant juror.

When the juror (played powerfully by Lee J. Cobb) most vocal in support of finding the defendant guilty accidentally, in a pique of passion undermines one of the primary witnesses, it's one of the many sterling moments in the film. Lumet masterfully directs the subsequent silence and reaction among the other jurors.

"You think too much, you get mixed up." Well, this movie does a fine job of simutaneously ordering and confusing very important matters. It's also respectful of "the other side"; E.G. Marshall is Fonda's well-spoken opponent who has the good sense to know that not everyone on "his" side is on his side.
