I have now watched the DVD movie GOTHAM KNIGHTS twice and I have to say that not only does it bear watching more than once, I think it needs more than one viewing to really appreciate all that it holds.  The 6 chapters DO hold together much better than some of the reviewers have said and yet each episode or chapter also can stand by itself.  It also builds a bridge from the film BATMAN BEGINS to the new one, THE DARK KNIGHT, but again, it is a subtle bridge and can be enjoyed all on its own.  It also builds a bridge of sorts between the comic book Batman and the film version.

The animation is breathtaking in parts and works well throughout to tell the story (stories).

It is very interesting and a great device to have the great Kevin Conroy voicing Batman (and of course, Bruce Wayne) throught all 6 chapters. It brings continuity since the animation style changes from episode to episode. And all the voice acting throughout was wondeful. It was cool having David McCallum (of MAN FROM UNCLE fame), playing Alfred the Butler, and he did a superb job.  And it is always nice to hear actors like Corey Burton and George Newburn, regulars in DCU animation doing various characters throughout.

 I liked all 6 chapters, but my favorite was "Working Through Pain".  This one had a lot of resonance for me beyond the story.  For lack of a better way of saying it, it was the most "spiritual" of the stories (and not only because of the setting in India!)

I highly recommend this for true Batman fans (and IMHO, those the ones who are flexible and understand how flexible and diverse the character can be).

I also think many anime fans will like this.
