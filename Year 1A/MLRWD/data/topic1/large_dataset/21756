With the reoccurring song lyric of "hey nonny, nonny," Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing have audiences humming to the tune along from beginning to end.  Even the sappy, overexaggerated  happiness of the characters make one desire to get up and frolic around with them  in their times of dance and play.  There is a lot of singing, dancing, and people  walking around doing virtually.  There is no wonder that all the twists of events  spin from their deception and miscommunication.  The performances of each character  are excellent in expression and language.  Branagh and Thompson take over with  their (at one time) real life love affair and reflect into their characters on to  screen.  Although the English and American accents vary among characters, the  inconsistency is not recognizable at first.  Branagh's vibrant cinematography,  setting of lavish gardens, costuming, and editing leaves no room to regard it.  Branagh proves himself once again as a true Shakespearean prodigy.
