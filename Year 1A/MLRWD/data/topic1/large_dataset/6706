Are you a fan of Supernatural? Do you think Sam and Dean's personal mythos is amazing and can only be enhanced by smooth professional animation? I was of the same opinion, which is why I was stoked to finally get my hands on a copy of this.

Friends...it was the worst ten dollars I ever spent.

The only thing the anime has in common with the show is Jared as Sam. Well crafted story lines take tragic, painful, avoidable blows in a well meant but poorly executed attempt to make this its own creature. The art is fine, nothing distinctive or memorable, but as long as you focus your eyes off to the left of the impala and never look directly at it or the constant blank idiot expression on Dean's face you'll enjoy it for a couple of episodes before it just blurs into mediocrity. The other voice actors are stilted and Jared is just so *huge* that his voice coming from anime!Sam just kind of sounds like Sam is pretending to be Batman. John Winchester looks like actor Reg E. Cathey dressed as the Gordon fisherman, I'm not sure why Bobby looks the way he does (really, it's sad) and if someone could tell me why Bobby Singer owns a helicopter I'd be thrilled. Also, Jensen only does the voice of Dean for the last two episodes, which covers the Cold Creek story arc that ends S2.

I sat down to watch it expecting familiar characters, a neat re-imagining of a story I knew, and some crazy anime-style blood and guts and scary demons. Instead I got a tamer, less cohesive tragically disappointing version of one of my favorite shows. I don't recommend it to Supernatural fans who are hoping for a codas and fill-ins between those Season 1 and 2 cases. I do however, recommend it to Supernatural fans with a great sense of humor and 10-15 dollars of disposable income who need a new Supernatural drinking game to pass the time until the premiere of Season 8.
