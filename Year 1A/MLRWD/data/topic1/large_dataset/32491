Osmosis Jones is a really good movie, if a bit... well... disgusting at times.
The plot revolves around a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) who serves as a police officer in the body of a guy named Frank (Bill Murray).
When a dastardly virus named Thrax (voiced by Laurence Fishburne) invades Frank's body, it's up to the immunity force to stop him, and Ozzy is teamed up with a cold tablet named Drixobensomedaphedramine, or Drix for short (voiced by the always-wonderful David Hyde Pierce).
Meanwhile, the pompous blood cell politician in charge of Frank's body, Mayor Phlegmming (voiced by William Shatner), is desperate to win the next election, but he is obviously doing a sub-par job of running Frank's body.  His aide (and Ozzy's love interest), Leah, is voiced by Brandy Norwood.

This movie is very amusing in some places, but I had to deduct one star because it is, on occasion, REALLY DARN GROSS.  I had to turn my head away from the screen in some places.  However, this is by no means a bad movie.  I personally consider David Hyde Pierce's portrayal of Drix to be one of the best things in the film (if not the very best), especially when Drix busts a secret mob meeting at a disco and utters the following line, doing some dance steps as he speaks:
"Attention, germs, you are surrounded.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, SURROUNDED!".  Trust me, it's worth seeing just for that part.

Overall, Osmosis Jones is definitely worth seeing, and it could also be used to teach an anatomy lesson, because it's very accurate.  Just watch out for the gross bits.
