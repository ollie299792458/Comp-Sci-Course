The movie is like one big crazy dream: its characters, its storyline, its settings, its props. It is this very quality of the movie, which makes it too overbearingly sickening, and at the same time, a really good one, and worth pondering on. 
The whole movie revolves around time-travel. This itself sounds a bit insane. If this is not enough, the muddled characters, and the disturbingly unimaginable path the movie goes through, only to reach a seemingly absurd end, could prove to be too much on the senses; and if one is looking for even a teensy weensy bit of reality, then this movie has all the essential elements to render it as one of the worst sci-fi ever. 
On the flipside, the movie also has all the sine qua non of a very well-made science-fiction flick, only if taken in the right sense. The movie is actually meant to be a crazy dream. Considering the concept of the movie, it is best made, like a crazy dream. The acting is extraordinary. With `insanity' being the cool word binding the movie, both the lead actors, Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, do justice to the nutty parts, assigned to them. Complementing the acting, are the symbolic backdrops: the subterranean world immersed in red metallic shades (hell), and the sublunary world, bitten with the bitterest icy cold (living hell.) 
This flick is best enjoyed, if one empathizes with the underlying messages behind the whole inanity of the movie and its characters: what will result the apocalypse? Is it man who will be solely responsible for apocalypse? Or, what on earth, are we humans doing with this planet? Is science too dangerous to handle? With a little pondering, forced or naturally invoked, one can actually identify with all the craziness of this movie. This flick represents our mad world, in which the end is really not that far away.
