I saw the theatrically-released version of "Testament" in Berkeley California in the early 1980s.  This was the era of the Nuclear Freeze and huge mass demonstrations against the Reagan government's unprecedented nuclear arms build-up.  In the midst of all this landed "Testament", which is by leaps and bounds the most harrowing (and depressing) of any film dealing with nuclear war.  After the movie, groups of people just huddled together outside, many weeping.  This is strong medicine.
The movie is so sad it is almost unwatchable.  The film follows one family's experience in a small Northern California town.  Jane Alexander, future head and defender of the National Endowment for the Arts, plays the mother, alone with three school-age children,  There are no fancy special effects; the bomb is a bright light through the window.  
Somehow everyone has to keep going.  One by one, people begin to miss work, students stop showing up at school.  When a banana appears, you know its the last one, ever.  The film's effectiveness is that we get to know the family and town, they are  just ordinary people, and Alexander is a terrific Everymom.  The school play scene is just about the saddist thing you will ever see on film.
The movie came out about the same time as the made-for TV, much hearalded ABC's "The Day After" which wowed with special effects and big-name stars, but suffered from poor character development.  This movie is the opposite - we care too much about these people.
My friend (an anti-nuclear activist)who was with me at the theater surprised me by saying she thought the movie was calculating and manipulative.  I have not made up my mind.  Also, with the immediacy of nuclear war somewhat dimmed since the early 1980s, I'm not sure the movie will have the same impact.  
Also in the same serious genre:  "The War Game" and "Threads", which are British productions.  "Testmanet" is the better of the three.
