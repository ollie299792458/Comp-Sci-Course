A PA at work and i have had a raging battle over the last 12 years about our favourite books and films - whilst we tend to agree on books, we disagree on films.  And in one of my first film discussions with Jillian 12 years ago i told her this is my favourite film.

She hadn't seen it, asked who was in the cast and when i told her Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo she rolled her eyes in mortification.  And vowed never to watch it. ha ha
So when I moved offices a few years ago, I gave her a copy in spite.

She has since seen it and likes it, thought probably not as much as me.

It was made before Leonardo was recognisable by a single name, and at the time, I believed that Arnie was irrefutably autistic.  I don't know if it is a deliberate ploy, but Leonardo seems to focus on the way a charater would use their nose, touch it, lead with it, smell people for reassurance which is so authentic to someone with autism.

The frailties, humanity, and humour of the charactres are what keeps this film special, the recurring themes of escape, change and death well handled.

And a final special mention to the mother - as someone just plucked off the street - she is amazing.
