I wasn't expecting much when I rented Doomsday given all the mediocre reviews in comparison to Marshall's previous efforts, and my preconceived notions proved entirely correct. Every other reviewer hit the nail on the head in stating that this movie borrows from a slew of other post-apocalyptic films that did a much better job in contributing to the genre. There are no memorable characters nor are there any exceptionally cool scenes, which are the two main characteristics that draw me to these types of films. The action sequences are only so-so, and the concept of knights versus punks was poorly executed.
