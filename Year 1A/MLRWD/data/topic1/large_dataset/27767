After renting this on Netflix I was convinced that I needed this in my collection to lift my spirits when I feel blue.  Is it porn? I'm not sure anyone can define porn anymore.  It depicts the human condition as only the Italians can do.  The actresses are beautiful to look at and I couldn't detect the sordidness that pervades much of todays porn output.  Perhaps it's because there isn't a screenwriter involved who tries to weave in a meaningful plot. (It does have a bit of a plot, but it's so unobtrusive that it's almost unnoticable). This film doesn't really need a plot because it is so joyful. I know that I'm glad I have it now and I wish I could find women like the ones in this film here in the beanfields of Indiana to pose for me. Of course, they would have to have the same mind set so I think I'm asking too much of our local femmes. Don't have the kids watch this with you unless you want to answer a lot of questions afterwards. Things get very "hairy" right from the start, if you know what I mean. (Pun is intentional even if inexcusable). Lighten up, buy this!
