I saw the "freeview" of this show on DirectTV, and ordered the DVD based on my enjoyment of that. I did not look closely at the DVD spec.'s when I ordered it, and was rather disappointed upon playing it that it is only viewable in 4:3 screen size (even though it was obviously shot in 16:9) and that the only sound option is Dolby Surround (no 5.1 or DTS digital sound). There are 3 bonus tracks on the flip side in 5.1 sound, but I just find it hard to imagine why anyone would produce a new DVD these days that does not support HDTV presentation and 5.1 or better digital sound.
Other than that, I still really enjoyed the show and feel it's a worthwhile purchase for anyone who enjoys the BMG's creativity, fun, and sense of parody/satire. It is an entertaining show, and some of the music is quite good on its own (i.e.: I can enjoy it without the theatrical elements). Perhaps, if we're lucky, the 3 "bonus" 5.1 audio tracks on the flipside are a precursor to a full-fledged 16:9 video and digital audio "enhanced" DVD-to-come?
