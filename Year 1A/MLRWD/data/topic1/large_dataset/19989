Yes, let's just admit it finally, Torque is the first and probably will have the distinction of being the absolute worst film of 2004. The only movie that will rival Torque for that honor will be Cody Banks 2. Torque is basically about 3 rival biker factions with really bad attitudes and even lower IQ levels. It's also about how much special... excuse me, "Not-so-special" effects can be crammed into a film before the budget is totally blown. There is obnoxious viewpoints through the engines, carbeurators and pistons of various vehicles, none of which you should find fascinating unless you have a weird fetish for that sort of thing. And apparantly the "Hero" of this film played less than aptly by Martin Henderson has to have a straight up BAMF attitude as well. Since the 3 rival gangs have the same attitude, as well as the same rock bottom SAT scores, the only solution they have is to kill each other and or implicate the others in murder investigations. Torque is really bad, don't get me wrong. It might remind you of the Cannonball Run parts I or II, the scary thing is Cannonball Run parts I and II are EASILY superior to the piece of trash that is Torque. This movie is chock full of the scummiest, most horrible human beings imaginable, I cannot imagine you or anyone else wanting to hang out with them unless you are rock stupid and need an example of how to just be "Stupid". Please, avoid at ALL costs!
