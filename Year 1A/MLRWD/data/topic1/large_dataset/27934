This is one of my favorite movies of all time. First of all, it's very well thought out in regards to the relationships between the characters (Mitch and Nicole, Mitch and Darcie, Bernard and Lara). The most overlooked, but important detail is the connection between Mitch (Luke Wilson), Bernard (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) and Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven). If the four hadn't had a history going back to their school days, Dean Pritchard's relentless fight to end the fraternity would've been lost in the mix.

Basically, the story revolves around three men who appear to be lost in their post-college years and decide to form a fraternity in the midst of Mitch's failed marriage and Frank's inability to grow into married life. Living in a campus house and overcoming glitches within the system, the fraternity becomes the most popular group on campus to hang out with despite their unusual and questionable personalities. As the film unravels, the fraternity is forced to face real life challenges that test their friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and heart.
The chemistry between Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson is fantastic and demonstrates the true bonds of friendship. The casting in this movie was brilliant and made it that much more hilarious. It includes some of the best one-liners you'll hear come out of Hollywood. It ranks alongside, if not above the American Pie trilogy and is a modern day 'Animal House', an absolute must for any college student.
The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Some of the deleted scenes were not only hilarious, but essential to the plot and should've been used in the final cut. However, that's a minor detail in the final outcome.

In addition, if you're a fan of Whitesnake or Kansas, this movie is a living homage to your music.
