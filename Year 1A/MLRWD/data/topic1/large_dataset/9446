I spent my teenage yrs. in the middle&late 1950's.  quiet innocent and rock and roll time. Carefree and fun.
But, then came the 1960's.:  for the first time i saw a beautiful first lady who had dark hair was not white: A young and handsome president with cute small children.  So refreshing to the 20 somethings.
Then came the horrific assasssination of president  kennedy, it was so frightening. I thought,  what will happen to our country now.?  The only thing the american people  knew about the assasination is  what the news reported; most info  never made any sense, the majority of americans knew we were not being told the whole truth, but then the Vietnam war is taking lots of southern/north white and black boys, people protesting vietnam war(that majority of americans did not even understand why we were in vietnam), students being shot at kent state, blacks marching for equality, martin luther assassinated, then bobby kennedy assassinated.  To go from the peaceful 50's to all this death and devastation was mind boggling. (Nothing to say of all the body bags being brought home from Vietnam)
Most americans in 1960's did not trust us gov.  we knew we were told what they wanted us to hear.  Pres. Nixon promised to bring our boys home from Vietnam, I voted for him, it took 3yrs before he brought them home. You cannot trust anyone. Today my grandchildrens generation  are fighting Iraq and Afghanistan war, if anyone dare spit on them, would not be a good idea.  Husbands(vietnam) are one thing, my grandchildern are a entirley different ballgame, i am like a ferocious lion when it comes to my grands.  I am now 69yrs. and the JFK movie tells just how corrupt the American Gov. can be and get away with it.
IT SHOULD MAKE ANY AMERICAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT INFORMATION US GOV. AND NEWS MEDIA FEEDS US....THANK GOD FOR COMPUTERS and OUR CYBER WORLD.
