Like many of my contemporaries (age deleted!) I watched this series when it was first released in the early 1950's. At the time many of us saw this series on small, snowy TV screens in black and white.  It was outstanding then and has held its value over time.  Combining both US, Japanese and Germany photography each installment brings back the era and now with a much greater clarity of picture.  Black and white in many ways enhances the film although some color from WWII is available now.  One reviewer mentioned this as an abridged copy but that was not the case with the ones I bought!  The Mill Creek version was not abridged.  One seller did send me a set that was NOT from Mill Creek and had only 6 installments.  They were quick to remedy.  So you will want to check the copy that you receive and be sure it contains all 26 half hour episodes.  Mill Creek shows running time of 676 minutes or 26 minutes per episode.  So not much ad time deleted and not abridged as each episode was half hour in length.
