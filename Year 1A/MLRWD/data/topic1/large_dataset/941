H.G. Wells' history of the future (from the past, no less!) was immortalized in this World War II-era British production, and was a bold prediction of the path that lay before mankind.

As global war decimates the citizens of "Everytown" (a not-so artfully disguised London) the world as we know it is transformed into a dystopian, medieval abyss where the bi-plane is an marvelous warfighter and cars are quite literally operating on "horse power."  Things to Come chronicles mankind's decline and subsequent rise as a group of scientists from the Cradle of Civilization remake society in their shining image.

As with all Legend Films releases, this DVD contains the original black and white film (in its best available quality) and the newly colorized production.  Both are worth considering as independent viewing experiences, since the different palates carry such a different flavor.

Notable at the time (and even today) for its fantastic special effects and visual design, this new DVD production of Things to Come is notable for its consultation with legendary special effects guru and Oscar winner, Ray Harryhausen.  Before he became a household name, Ray worked as a cameraman on the original production of Things to Come.  Here, Ray puts that firsthand knowledge to use, providing Legend Films with the best possible reference for its colorization process.  What you see is what Ray's camera saw, and truly what the Director originally intended.  Extensive interviews with Ray about his career and the process of colorizing older movies round out a package fit for any DVD enthusiast.
