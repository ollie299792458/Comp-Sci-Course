This movie is truly the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen.  The landscapes and cities are breathtaking in their beauty.  Along with the cinematography, there is an action-packed martial arts film with a romantic film hidden inside, truly something for everyone.  The story is based on Chinese legends-2 "old" (in their 40s) warriors become enmeshed in what may be their final adventure when a thief steals a legendary sword.  Although the thief seems to be young, her methods are those of an old enemy of the warriors.  In addition, they are faced with a princess who is about to be forced into an arranged marriage, but who harbors a secret affair with a bandit chieftain.  For those unfamiliar with Hong Kong action or The Matrix, there are plenty of stunts done with concealed wires, allowing the characters to run across water,  leap from rooftop to rooftop, and setting up a beautifully choreographed battle among the treetops of the countryside. Unbelievable?  No more unbelievable than the the Clint Eastwood characters who never miss with guns that never run out of ammo.  No more unbelievable than Bruce Willis outrunning fireballs from bomb blasts. For those who hate subtitles, on DVD with the English language option, this is the best dubbed Chinese language film I've ever seen.  No bad actors with funny voices here, the dubbing does not detract from the film's quality.  I've now seen it with subtitles, dubbed and, although I don't speak or understand Chinese, plan to watch it in Chinese with no subtitles just to listen to the actors' voices.  This film should have beat Gladiator for best film of the year.  No matter how  you feel about foreign films, you owe it to yourself to see this film.
