Al Pacino the great! I saw Scarface when it hit the theatres in 1983! I was a Pacino fan ever sense! After renting dozens of Pacino movies I stumbled on to Serpico which has got to be the best Pacino film to date! Filmed on location all around the New York city area with all kinds of great actors such as Tony Roberts who was Woody Allens sidekick in the Woody movies! And a small scene with F.Murrey Abraham You know the guy in scarface known as OMAR! This is 12 years before Scarface! Pacino is basically mellow in this film but you get a taste of Tony Montana every now & then but its this true story that's going to make you melt into the film! You will see the bronx & brooklyn areas as well as Manhatten skylines such as World trade center etc. This Movie is a must have for any real collector of top notch Pictures! Pacinos first partner in narcotics division Jack Kehoe was excellent! A great coffee movie and if you like movies shot in New York with real location filming u gotta pick this movie up now!
This true story picture could not have been done without Pacino & the excellent directing Sidney Lumet/Dino DeLaurentiis! Great music! Thank God we have excellent movies like this that came out of that time period!
