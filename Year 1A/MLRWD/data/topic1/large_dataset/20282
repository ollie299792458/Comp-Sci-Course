Okay before I get started I want to make the following very clear:
1. I am a big fan of both Bette Midler and Nathan Lane.
2. I am a bigger, and not to mention well read, fan of dear Jackie Susann.
I just finished watching this movie, and disappointed is not even the word that describes how I feel right now.  The movie was so inaccurate it is disturbing. Yes Jackie was a climber, at best when it came to her show business career, and yes Guy was/is autistic and unfortuantely they could not have him live with them. And yes, Valley, Love Machine and Once were more than successful. But, what hapened to "Every Night", what happened to Jackie's relationship with her father, mother, Ethel Merman and countless others.
Let me add this : Jackie asked Irving to marry her, when she called him at his parent's house in Brooklyn.  Irving  did not know who Jackie was until that fateful day by the pay phone in the theater distrct only one year before she proposed when she caught his eye. After Jackie's first bout with cancer and the mastectomy, her and Irving were like bacon and eggs. Now I know the first years of their marriage were probably not cemented in stone like the later were, she was a child brde for all intensive purposes, not to mention a bit of a free spirit. and let me add this, if you read Irving's biography of Jackie, he even acknowledged that his feelings towards their union were confused at best, they truly fell in love with each other along the way.
The movie did improve once Jackie sold Valley, and Bette and David Hyde Pierce's relationship was superb  , but wasted on the falacies wrtten in the script.
If you want an accurate bio of the Queen of camp this is not the way to go despie the extraordinary talents of Bette, Nathan, Stockard and David.
