This was a very disappointing movie.  Barry Levinson's record on Baltimore-based movies has been excellent:  "Avalon" and "Diner" are films to be seen over and over.  "...And Justice  for All" [as co-writer, not director] is a memorable black comedy.  And "Tin Men" is OK.  "Liberty Heights" just does not  come together; it's all over the place.  The segments featuring Ben Foster  as the younger son almost work, thanks to the actor.  Joe Mantegna shows  what a great professional actor can do with weak material.  Adrien Brody as  the older son spends much of the film [this is definitely a movie, not a  film] looking confused; probably more as the result of not receiving help  from the director as to what his segments are all about.  The confusion and  the stereotyping in these segments [about the supposed lifestyles of  wealthy English-Americans] are embarrassing.  Even more distressing are the  scenes involving a black drug dealer.  This is one of those cases where one  wishes a talented filmmaker had a good friend who could look at the filmed  bits and ask, "Are you sure you want to do this?"  With this kind  of semi-autobiographical movie, one is tempted to cut the director some  slack because of the overlap between hazy nostalgia and an ostensibly  accurate depiction of past events. However, in this case the result is not  worth the ambiguity.  This is the kind of movie people want to like.  It is  supposed to be personal and it is dealing with socially important issues.  Fine.  But, it has to be evaluated as a MOVIE and, as such, it fails.
