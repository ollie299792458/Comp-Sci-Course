It seems like after decades, T7S is finally on DVD! Great move Fox! This release is AMAZING! The packaging and menus are great! All 25 episodes from the first season are included as they were originally aired with a crisp look and great sound. A+ quality stuff you get here. This is the premiere season that kicks off the funniest show of all time and it's one of the funniest, if not THE funniest, seasons of the series.

There's only three bonus materials but they're worth it. A good yet short quiz, a great promo-palooza, which is very worth the watch, and the featurette. Bloopers are the only thing missing on this DVD and maybe some more interviews. But the DVD is AWESOME! I got it on the 23rd and I've been watching NONSTOP!

Not only is this a must-own for fans of the show but ANYONE will enjoy this show and love it to death. I don't know one person who doesn't like the show, from my 6-year-old cousin to my 50-year-old dad. It's perfect all around fun for all generations!

Can't wait for the next seasons to be released!
