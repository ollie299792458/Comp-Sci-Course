I must begin by letting the public know that the Harry Potter series is one of my favorite book series EVER.  Interesting story line, lovable (and terrible) characters... Mrs. Rowling has everything.  Most movies never live up to their book counterparts, but this is a movie that is surely close to doing so.
First off, the acting of the kids have improved.  Dan Radcliffe has gotten quite good at being a sweet-looking hero with a tragic past, and the already superb skills of Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have only gotten better.  Hermione, who seemed overly know-it-all-like in the first movie, has become more like the book character, who is an insufferable know-it-all with good intentions.  One major nitpick for me was how minor a character Ginny Weasley (Ron's sister) was.  It seemed that she would have been cut out, but she was needed for the later plot.  And the Valentine sequence was cut out.  Maybe I'm the only one who felt that Ginny needed more screen time.
The CG-ed scenes were a lot better than before.  Quidditch scenes were amazing.  They were a lot faster and more realistic (if flying on a broom can be realistic) than the last time around.  Dobby didn't look quite like I imagined, but it seemed as though he was really in there, not as if he was placed in the picture afterward.  The Spider (Aragog) scenes... that was scary, but watching Rupert be adorably frightened?  Priceless.  And the final battle... well, you'll have to see for yourself.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was certainly a big improvment on its preceedor, and it certainly has not torn Mrs. Rowling's magic apart, but it isn't the book.  I recommend that you see it, but try to read the books, also.  They are two seperate things, but I feel that it will be a more rewarding experience with the combination of canon and the movie.
