Kurosawa's most well-known film is "The Seven Samurai" from the early 50s.  Of course it's a classic, yet my favorite has gotten to be "Ran".  It is one of his retelling of a Shakespeare work, this being "King Lear".  Instead of the kingdom being divided among three daughters as in "King Lear", the samurai lord divides his among his three sons.

  Kurosawa gave the most dramatic touch for one of the battle scenes in their castle.  Here it was shown without any sound of the visual action, only somber music in the background.  Strange for a modern film, where it's usual to increase the volume during such a scene.  But here, the attack on the castle showed all the fire flashes from the muzzles of the black powder rifles, the volleys of arrows, the castle being engulfed in fire, with all the pandemonium.  But all was silent-- only the somber music.  The silence was finally broken with the sound of a loud gunshot, when one of the sons was killed.  Truly a powerful scene.

  Toward the end, when the samurai lord gets reunited with his son, is something that has to be seen for its pathos.  Some parts may have too much of a melodramatic touch, perhaps even over-acting.  But that's OK.  And the reprisal against the scheming wife of one of his other sons almost brings on applause.  A just retribution.

  Hopefully these thoughts will prepare for some of the scenes.  It's a lot more than so many current films, which just show a lot of killing.  --  George Skoblin
