Scary but so true political thriller that will grab you and shake you to your core with two very powerful performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes with an equally powerful direction by the greatFernando Meirelles. Rachel Weisz solidifies herself as one of the best actresses working today with a powerful performance that is not only mysterious but strong and compelling as well. Her performance is the highlight of the whole film and that quite a feat considering the fact that Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance of his career with a tight rounded character who is the anchor for the audience to go on this emotional and terrifying journey into the heart of real evil. He's a perfect acting partner with Weisz in every way and their love story is compelling and heartbreaking as well.
Fernando Meirelles gives the film an emotional edged that is equally satisfying and scary as well because he treats this story as kind of a documentary and by doing that, you are put into kind of a real life drama that is real to the point of feeling the emotions and the horror of what is going on.

This is the best movie of the year in my opinion, and I seriously doubt there will be a movie coming out that will mach the drama, the acting or the terrifying truth that this movie gives.
