This isn't as perfect or as bad as the other reviews will lead you to think.

The way the film within a film plot is desperately brought into contact with the main plot is brilliantly odd and memorable.  The whole thing is beautifully shot.  The jokes are odd enough to forget and rewatch.  You will remember what it's like to be a tire coming alive in the desert as if you dreamed it, and can you say that about anything else?

Weak points: the worst is that the ending is like a montage of montages and you might get impatient and forget everything you liked by the time it's over.  And I'd agree that some of the audience characters get annoying and feel unrealistic - beyond what you'd expect for a movie audience in a movie where a movie audience gets involved in a movie.

Overall: I'm a fan, I'll watch it again sometime.  If you have no attention span, watch Dupieux's music video for "Analog Worms Attack" instead.  If you want a slightly better constructed film, try Steak.  But if you want to watch this, just do it; movies like this are fun but flawed because so few people have the guts to make them.
