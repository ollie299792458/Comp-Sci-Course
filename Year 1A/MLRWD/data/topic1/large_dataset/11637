I first saw this in the theatre in 1991...almost twenty-one years ago...and the ideas/motif/portrayal of this metaphorical (I hope) flick have<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301930789">Handmaid's Tale [VHS</a>] periodically returned to my memory.  The ideas are drawn from the the possibilities of a future culture/government that turns the Bible on its head for purposes of planned procreation in a world where the elite women are sterile (as is the leading man), and sex is performed by 'handmaidens' for the State...and its married men...whose wives want children...but can not become pregnant. These 'religious' performances of impregnation are done without showing the body parts involved (cautiously discreet), and in the extra-marital copulation some quiet finesase.  It does not flaunt sex, as in multitudes of other R-Rated films...and keeps to the theme of trying to exist in artificial 'families' in a society based on the 'handmaidens' of the Old Testament...in s stark, hard, sur-religious way.
This is not a family movie at all!
It IS a movie for the metaphorical comparisons it makes...which will leave thinking people with a lot to ponder.  If you do not care for such harsh metaphors and haunting ideas, this movie is not for you.
