'Vamp' was one of those first R-rated movies I first caught as a teenager after midnight on Cinemax (before the schedule turned into soft-core porn). Thus, if you are under 21 years old, you've never heard of this flick.

Made in 1986, 'Vamp' reeks of the cheesy images one has come to recognize from movies during that decade.  Overabundance of neon lights in bars/strip clubs, needlessly flowing curtains from oversized open windows, wafer thin plot, obligatory nudity ... ah, such was the decade of decadence.

Aside from Grace Jones (whom you think was literally BORN for her title role), Vamp has actors whom you reccognize, but you can't place their names - but it doesn't matter.  If you're in your late 20s or early 30s, Vamp is a nice trip down memory lane.  Especially for those ridiculously lame Halloween parties in high school to which the host/hostess thought a rented scary movie was a better alternative to spin the bottle.  No - this ain't 'Citizen Kane' (there's a reason it doesn't exist on DVD), BUT at least you won't think you lost 90 minutes of your life if you see it.
