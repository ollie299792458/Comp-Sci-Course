I must admit I was scared when the opening scene was a dialogue by Will Smith directly into the camera.  I thought this was going to be another narrator movie and thoughts of regret started to pass through my mind.  Luckily it didn't last but a few minutes.

The movie can be summed up as a movie about the not so perfect guy getting a shot at the unapproachable woman thanks to the help of professional dating consultant.  (I see an opportunity for a new professional industry.)  I found myself laughing outloud in the theater at several times and left the theater really happy and upbeat.

There are definitely some silly scenes, scenes that aren't realistic, and some scenes that are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes.  This is a story that is meant to be comical.  Meant to be outrageous and meant to be a little bit of wishful thinking--wishing a society good truly be accepting, open, good-willed, and open to love.

While the ending is a little bit of an after school special (the message that 'Hitch' did nothing) it stays with the comedy and style of the movie without being corny.

One of the best movies I have scene since 50 First Dates.
