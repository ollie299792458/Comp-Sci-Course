I am so happy I got this DVD set. I started doing them in my second trimester and am still doing them close to the end here (though heartburn doesn't allow for too much downward dog). My strength, stamina and flexibility improved noticably just from these DVDs. I was encouraged by the strength and flexibility of the models to push myself a little further each time. And this sounds cheezy but Jennifer Wolfe is so warm and gentle that it feels like you are doing the yoga with a friend rather than an instructor.

I really enjoyed being able to choose between 30, 45 or 75min practices (I rarely did the 15min one because I wanted something longer, but it's good too) - and I like that the practices are different from one another. There are ample modifications for different stages of pregnancy.

I guess the only warning about these DVDs is be prepared to do a lot of lunges and downward dogs (part of vinyasa yoga) - I made the mistake of doing the 75 min practice on hardwood with only my yoga mat and my knees were sore from touching the ground so much. Then I moved to carpet, with a folded towel to place my knees on and it was much better.

I wish Jennifer Wolfe did more regular yoga DVDs, but I will certainly keep this prenatal DVD to use after the baby is born as well..
