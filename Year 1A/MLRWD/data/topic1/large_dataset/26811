First of all, don't listen to me. In fact, don't listen to anyone when it comes to this movie. It's one of those that you will either love or hate, there is no in-between. The best thing to do is just see it for yourself and develop your own opinion on it.
Now, if you decide to listen to me after all, here is my review.
I'll be honest, when it came out on video, I had never heard of it. When it was mentioned to me by a friend, I thought it sounded like some cheesy, Steven Segal movie, so I was hesitant to rent it, but I went ahead and got. 
The opening scene is very misleading. It starts out with John Travolta's character talking about movies. It's kind of slow and if you've seen Get Shorty, you start to wonder if this is what it's going to be like. This theory is proven wrong not one minute later. It catches your attention from the beginning and holds it until the very end. To say you saw what was coming is very misleading but that's exactly what this movie is. Misleading. It leads the viewer in one direction, then does a 180, curses along for a while at 75 MPH, then reverses 10 feet and goes left. The ending is a classic, ending in an unconventional chase sequence that will leave you breathless. All in all, I would say it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. One of Mr. Travolta's best. And Halle Berry wasn't too bad herself. ;)
But, as I said, don't listen to me. Go out and see it for yourself.
