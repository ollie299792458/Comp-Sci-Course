Ever get the feeling that someone wants to kill you? If you have, you're sharing your paranoia (or maybe not, he he he), with dentist Nick Oseransky  (played by the bumbling and adorably clumsy Matthew Perry). He has an awful  wife (played by Roseanna Arquette) who chain smokes and plans absurd ways  to make money. Suddenly, who moves in next door then Timmy 'the Tulip'  Tedeski (played by the anyman actor Bruce Willis). Timmy used to be a  contract killer for a Hungarian crime mob and this, as you can imagine,  makes Nick a little nervous. But there's more, a lot more! I don't want to  give any more away, I'll just say that there are great performances by  Amanda Peet as a wanna-be contract killer, Micheal Clark Duncan as Freddie  Friggs, one scary big guy, and Kevin Pollack as Vinny, another one of the  guys invovled with getting 'the whole nine yards'.  The thing that makes  this movie great is great performances. I've never seen Matthew Perry  better then here(except maybe on 'Friends, but that's another story)and as  one of Amanda Peet's first movie roles, I thought she was pretty funny too.  But still I say again that the stand-out was Matthew Perry. He's really a  guy to watch. He reminded me a little of Kramer from 'Seinfeld'. Rent this  movie and try it out. Keep in mind, it's not 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'.  But it's definately a fun movie!
