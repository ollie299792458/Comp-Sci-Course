I wouldn't consider myself to be a comic book nerd or have all of the stories, sub stories, pre stories, etc info for this story line but there was so much more to this movie that should have been.  First of all, this was such a monumental storyline when the comic book came out b/c this is an iconic figure we thought we would never see die.  Just like a few of the other reviews said, all of the side stories were left out and the way Superman came back seemed rather 'cheap and easy'.

I understand that this is a straight to DVD animated movie but the battle of Superman and Doomsday alone was a 3 to 4 hr movie in itself.  This would include how Doomsday dismantled every superhero that even made an attempt to stop him.  The final fight between Doomsday and Superman deserved a lot more detail and length than what this DVD provided.  This should have been part 1 to this series, left with the title that it already has.

Part II was a huge story line as well w/ the new Supermen that came about to take the place of the original, all having extremely significant character flaws that proved them to not even come close to governing Metropolis the way Kal El had.  This movie should have gone through some of their confrontations as a set up for the real Superman's return..and this would need to be explained as closely to the comic as possible to give it authenticity and credibility.

This movie was somewhat intertaining b/c of the fight between Superman and Doomsday but the movie just deserved so much better.
