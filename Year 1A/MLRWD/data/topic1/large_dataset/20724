I am a Brit living in the US and where I live they never showed Shaun of the Dead at the cinema.  Thankfully HOT FUZZ did show here.  It was literally a laugh a minute and I probably laughed more because I "get" the humour.  I know people who have seen this and Shaun of the Dead and didn't find them funny at all.  I am not knocking them, but not everyone "gets" British humour.  I thought this was funnier than "Shaun", but that still cracks me up after numerous viewings. In reality of course, there is no Sandford in Gloucestershire (where I used to live).  This was all filmed around the Wells, in Somerset, about 70 miles south.  Timothy Dalton was great as the villain (and Somefield is a real Supermarket chain over there by the way). The ending or should I say endings, was brilliant.  It seemed like the movie would end then something else would happen.  This is not just the funniest film of the year, but the funniest ever, with great comic timing, great stars and cameos (yes it is Cate Blanchett), and the hilarious Bill Bailey (who I'd like to see crop up in more movies).  Can't wait to see what they will take on next.
