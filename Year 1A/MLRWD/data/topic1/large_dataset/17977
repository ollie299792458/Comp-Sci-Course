I personally didn't like the orgiginal 1974 TCM.  However I LOVED the 2003 remake and when they did a prequel, rather than a sequel, I knew it was something I just HAD to see.

Leatherface (aka Tommy Hewitt) is born to an obese unwed mother working in a Texas slaughterhouse.  His mother dies in childbirth and the baby (born with a facial deformity) is discarded in a dumpster by the slaughterhouse manager.  Shortly after, he's discovered by a young Luda Mae Hewitt, digging through the trash for food.  She takes the child home and raises him as her own.

The opening credits feature a montage of rapidly accumulating psychological evaluations regarding Tommy, with a tendency towards anti-social behavior and self-mutilation.

When the slaughterhouse closes and the town goes bankrupt, the Hewitts are the only ones who refuse to leave.

One thing leads to another, and soon Charlie Hewitt takes the identity of Sheriff Hoyt, and becomes the town's judge, jury and executioner.

A non-stop, blood-drenched thrill ride that will leave you both recoiling in disgust, and eagerly wanting more.
