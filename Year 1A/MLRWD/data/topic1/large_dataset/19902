Finally a big movie shows cops doing what cops do most gleefully: taking citizens' stuff.  I do not mean to suggest that Training Day is some sort of mockumentary -- far from it -- but it shows why forfeiture is one of the meanest, most corrupting weapons in cops' arsenal, subject exclusively to their rarely questioned discretion.  Next time there's a big bust you'll ponder for a microsecond what else the cops took besides drugs and, if we still believe in "innocent until proven guilty," why they should have it.  As insidious as this practice is, Training Day is not simply a good cop/bad cop story.  Where both characters' external motivations end and their individual ethics begin is a tasty question for the viewer to chew on.
Denzel, as always, delivers a thrilling performance, and imbues with credulity a role that might have been as laughable as Bulworth in the hands of a less capable actor.  Ethan Hawke plays his role better than expected, standing up admirably to his co-star's presence.
For a "day in the life" story, the film is very cohesive, though it cannot escape that style's inevitable paucity of layered meaning.  Nevertheless, this movie gives more incisive insight into the failed war on drugs than, say, Traffic, and it packs far more entertainment punch.  Highly recommended.
