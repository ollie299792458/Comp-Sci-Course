I was actually looking forward to Hatchet. After seeing the trailer and reading all the rave blurbs, I thought I'd love it. I mean, I love the old horror classics, and one blurb that caught my attention was the "best slasher film since Nightmare on Elm Street". That sold it for me.

Well, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, even for a slasher film. I didn't expect it to be as quirky. I wanted it to be darker. I didn't mind the poor story and acting. You expect those with any slasher film.

One thing I loved was the effects. No CGI involved. This was a true classic slasher if for no other reason. One scene in particular I'm certain any slasher fanatic will love (and they even have a special feature that's shown how it's down, without CGI).

If you're in the mood for some fun, badly acted horror with really good death scenes, go out and grab a copy of Hatchet. Look at it like eating fast food, it's good while you eat it, then you regret it when you're done.
