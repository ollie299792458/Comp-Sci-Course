Richard Jenkins plays a man who isn't really living his life.  Then he meets an couple who have sublet his NY City apartment from someone he doesn't know.  He is a visitor in his own home.  He lets them stay and they start to form a bond and he finds joy in learning the drums and the friendship with Tarek.

When Tarek is arrested, he finds out that the couple is illegal. He helps get an immigration lawyer for Tarek and then Tarek's mother shows up. Jenkins abruptly takes a sabbatical from the University in Connecticut where he teaches to help and to spend more time in NY with these people who have become more than visitors in his life.  When he takes a ferry ride with Tarek's fiance and mother, Jenkins even admits he has never been up in the Statue of Liberty.  He also admits he hasn't been to see Phantom of the Opera to Tarek's mother.

These visitors to his apartment and to this country have made him more fully involved in life.  He is no longer just a visitor--he is fully involved.

It is a quiet, slow but thoughtful movie that touches on the issue of illegal immigrants who have made good lives for themselves in this country.  It is a microcosm of the "melting pot" that this country has always been.  It is about how, no matter our nationality, our religion, our station in life, we have much we can give and learn from each other.

It is a joyful yet sad and moving film.  I loved "The Station Agent" also and look forward to more films from this filmmaker.
