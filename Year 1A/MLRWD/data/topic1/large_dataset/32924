Maybe you haven't seen this movie, but you sure have heard some parts of its magnificent soundtrack (it was used by a cigarrette company on its TV ads until they got banned). The music in this film is as recognizable as the main theme from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Anyway, this is a must have if you like classical cinema.

Its a remake of Seven Samurai, from Akira Kurosawa and tells a story about a mexican village that was being blackmailed by a band of forajidos (you will recognize their leader immediately). The villagers go to the US-Mexican border seeking for guns but insted of buying them they decide to hire a gunman to help them get rid of the bandits. This gunman recruits six guys with unique skills. Of the magnificent seven (MS), six were on for pride and honor, and only one was for the money.

From there on, the MS helped the villagers by training them for the final combat against the bandidos. This is not the standard western movie with nothing to offer other than gun fights: you can see a lot of ethical issues and deep thoughts that are not usual in this genre.

The video quality is good, as well as the sound. The documentaries included are pretty interesting and enjoyable, with lots of anecdotes regarding issues such as problems with the mexican government that forced the movie producers to make a change in the plot, the Hollywood strike that almost prevented the movie from being filmed and other facts like that. It also includes the original trailers with that funny song "Seven, Seven, Seven, the magnificent seven, they were only seven but they fought like Seven hundred".
