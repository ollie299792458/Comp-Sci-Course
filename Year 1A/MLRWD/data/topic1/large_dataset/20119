This is one of the best DC animated releases yet, and shows the Green Lantern Corps in its best light. Most of them are adapted from well-regarded comic book stories. The individual stories are very well done, and they show the Lanterns as they should be, as very formidable knights-errant protecting their sectors on their own, not mobs of cannon fodder getting mowed down to make Hal Jordan look good. These stories show the varied personalities and fighting styles that keep the Green Lanterns from being identical cookie cutter characters when portrayed correctly. It also shows that some Lanterns are simply more effective than others.

Nathan Fillion voices a Hal Jordan who is different than the one we usually see. This one is calmer, more thoughtful, more eloquent, and dare I say, more intelligent than some versions I could point out.

The worst part is the climactic battle against Mute Solar Anti-Matter Krona. It shouldn't take a teenage newbie like Arisia to realize that if Krona is made of anti-matter, then hitting him with some matter might hurt him. That doesn't make her clever, it makes the other green-clad halfwits who are standing around morons. It's as if there was a fire, and Arisia pipes up to say "Hey, why don't we pour water on it?" and everyone congratulates her. And what about Oa's sun, that thing Krona was just wallowing around in? Any matter there, perchance? Then, when the GLs punch him with Oa, Krona just sort of sticks to it and dissolves, rather than going up in a titanic explosion of mutual annihilation. Really stupid writing there. It's a cheap trick to make the newcomer seem valuable by having him or her save the day by doing something blindingly obvious. Maybe the other GLs were all holding their breaths waiting for her to catch on and speak up so she'd feel more confident about herself.
