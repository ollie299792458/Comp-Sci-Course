I'll just say right off, Lolita is my favorite book, and what I love most about it are the parts that could not in any way be translated into movie form, so I went into this movie with reservations.
I could never imagine liking the book and this movie; you'd have to be able to completely separate them in your mind. Kubrick, using Nabokov's screenplay, does a great job with the humor of the book; unfortunately, he feels the need to amplify it, maybe because so much of the book has to be left out. The best thing, in my opinion, about the book is its use of language; it uses such beautiful, intricate, poetic language to describe such deplorable things, and makes it all funny, too. The language, symbolism, allusions and puns Nabokov uses could never be brought to the screen, and if you've lost that, you've lost half the book. You're left with a fascinating, sensational plot that in the novel is just the starting point; you can read it just for the story, but you'll have missed a lot.
Another problem is the casting. Sue Lyon is too old, too movie-ish, and too obviously attractive. James Mason is too...James Mason-y. Peter Sellers gives an excellent performance; unfortunately, his Quilty is not in any way related to the Quilty of the book. The one exception is Shelley Winters, who is funny, pathetic, annoying, and ultimately tragic as Charlotte Haze- dead on.
If you want to see an interesting, well done, well-acted movie, then by all means see Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita. If you want all that scandal and story mixed with unbelieveable mastery of language and humor, then buy a copy of the book.
