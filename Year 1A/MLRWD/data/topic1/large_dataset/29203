I like to escape the real world when I go to the movies, so this brutally honest, microscopic, warts and all view of two drunks living together was simply the last thing I wanted to experience. The acting is excellent, and it was clearly well directed and produced. However, the actual storyline was extremely depressing with a sense of hopelessness that left me feeling upset and sad - it's a voyage into the dark side of living - not that I want sickening Doris Day type movies.

It's difficult to give a movie that is well acted and produced a bad review, but in this case I can't help it. These two drunks interacting just seems amazingly joyless and crazy. I do have a lot of sympathy for people caught up in alcoholism, but for certain I prefer to not live it.

After reading glowingly positive reviews, I plan to view it again. I loved Rourk in "9 1/2 Weeks", but then the storyline was intriguing whereas this movie made me wish I had a barf bag. If I change my opinion, I'll let you know.
