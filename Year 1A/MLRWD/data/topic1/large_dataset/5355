Benjamin invites us into the experience of being an outcast in the age of youth oriented worship.  In this outer limits like film, Brad Pitt brings to life a character by the name of Benjamin who has so little identity that he floats across the screen innocently recreating that invisible person that every one of us has been made to feel like at some point in our lives.  Creatively, Benjamin carves out a unique and fascinating life for himself.  From undesirable beginnings to being an uncontrollably desired object of affection Brad Pitt delivers a knock out performance bolstered by his ability to use non-verbal facial expressions and body language to render you helplessly compassionate to his fate.  To compliment this cinematic dive into the digital special effects canvas is perhaps today's prima movie star, the Goddess herself, Cate Blanchett.  Ms. Blanchett delivers a performance that leads the story line into a realm that only the actors of decades past could create.  This motion picture delivers it's message to the viewer in such a way that heart strings are played sensuously like a Spanish guitar.  With lighting reminiscent of silent film, Tilda Swinton plays the glow of 2 a.m. encounters of lustful passion as if it were her only sustenance.  Yes, we root for Benjamin.  We root for love, in a way that could only be conjured by past masters of the screen.  For todays younger audience this is a romp into an unknown secretive world of passion. BRAVO!
