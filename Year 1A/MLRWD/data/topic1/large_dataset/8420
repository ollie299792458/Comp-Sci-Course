So recently was my 17 year old stepson's birthday. I asked him if he wanted me to rent him a game or movie or something like that until cake & presents arrives later tonight. He said if I'd take him to the rental store, all he'd want is to see is "Meet The Spartans".

I should have just bought him an XBox360.

This is an ammmmmmazingly bad parody movie. Painfully bad. The kind of bad that embarrasses yourself for being in the same room as it. And he was laughing all the way. I guess I'm too mature (aka:old) to find spot-on impersonations funny by themselves without any humorous dialogue behind it. And seeing Kevin Sorbo and Diedrich Bader wallow their way through it, you could actually hear their little-enough-already careers falling down that overplayed "pit of death" too. Sort of reminded me how painful it was to see last years tankfest "Epic Movie", but much, much worse. And honestly, if you found 300 a bit on the "lightish", Spartans puts the "Hey!" in "ghey".

Gets two and a half points for Nicole "MadTV" Parker, who's Britney Spears was the only thing that got the slightest chuckle outta me, but if you're old enough to remember Airplane! or the first Scary Movie when they first came out, do yourself a favor and skip this...even on cable. Blah.
