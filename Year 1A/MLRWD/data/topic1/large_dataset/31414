A very honest and searing look at marriages, how delicate they are and the secrets that threaten to destroy them. Tyler Perry has created four couples Terry & Diane, Marcus & Angela, Sheila & Mike, and Patricia & Gavin.  They have all known each other since college.  All of them are long time wed couples who meet every year to vacation together.  It is a kind of retreat to explore why they got married and what they are willing to do to stay married and make it work.

Of all the couples Marcus & Angela have the most volatile relationship. Angela has an extreme need to be in control of Marcus' every move. What she finds out is that they both have some growing up to do. Sheila is a wife on the verge of losing herself or her marriage. She makes great choices in the end. Patricia a doctor of psychiatry seems to have all the answers, a great marriage and great partner in Gavin. But there is one thing standing in their way. It is a tragic loss the any parent would fear. Terry and Diane have issues of their own and will have to decide if they want to stay together. Diane has to learn to compromise, but will she?

On this trip some secrets are revealed and it is up to these 8 friends to help each other through them and get over some really tough times. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by any adult mature audience and is a great conversation piece.

Makes you wonder, how many times have you asked yourself (if you are) "Why Did I Get Married?"
