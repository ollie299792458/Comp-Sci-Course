I have come to appreciate this movie after having watched it several times and being a fan of the original series since 1971.  I believe this movie was more in tune with some of the more light hearted episodes of the original series(i.e. Trouble with Tribbles).  There was a certain amount of episodic content to this movie that reminded me of the original 79 episodes(unlike a lot of modern Star Trek fiction which is far from the original concepts).  The movie was a little top heavy with typical Shatner-esque self-indulgence(he directed of course).  However, I was really impressed with the return to the triumvirate of the original series with McCoy's comical involvement with Spock which I feel was missing from a lot of the movies.  As a pure intellectual adventure this was a rather fun movie albeit it suffered from poor financial support from Paramount.  I think Shatner tried to preserve a little of the flavor of the original series although it was a bit jaded with his now infamous megalomania.  From what I understand the plot of this movie had been floating around for years between Roddenberry and Shatner and their somewhat audacious and presumptuous views of the universe and religion.  I would recommend this movie over Star Trek 1, 3, and even 4(this one was way to contrived and any sci-fi movie that brings you to the present or has aliens impersonate normal people is just an obvious attempt at saving money).  In conclusion, I did enjoy this movie and I felt it is a good entry in the series and I feel it was more like the original series than a lot of the other movies.
