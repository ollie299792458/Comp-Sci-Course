It "could" have been fun, but they didn't manage to quite get there.

For one, it falls victim to a trend I have noted a lot in recent films: darkness or very low lighting.  I don't know if this is a trend for some artistic reason or they are just keeping the lights low because they were too cheap to put in details so you they don't want you to see.  Remember Alien? It was dark for a reason, the budget was low, but they made it work, Pathfinder really doesn't.

Secondly, they don't really develop the main character or his story.  IMHO a few minutes spent here would have greatly increased one's involvement in the film.  A little more background, a little more development, would have been so nice.

Now we get to the vikings.  Ok, I understand they are the bad guys and all viking movies tell us they really like to fight, plunder, etc.  But seriously, do we really think they sailed all that way to do nothing but kill everyone they meet?  These guys land and wipe out the first villiage they come across, only keeping alive someone to tell them where the next villiage is so they can go there and kill them!  Did someone wake up on the wrong side of the fjord?
The indians, however, seem totally unfamilar with combat. It's almost like the vikings stumbled across a commune of red skinned hippies. Except for our hero who somehow seems to have mastered all sorts of martial skills even though he's been living with the indians since childhood.
There is a lot of action, but for the most part its the ill-tempered vikings slashing up the indians.  Where is Geronimo when you need him!

And then there are the viking horses. Horses? I'm trying to remember any movie with vikings on horses.  They sailed all that way with horses on their tiny boats?  No wonder they were so grouchy when they arrived!  I'm not sure of the history, but I think the spanish brought horses the americas.
