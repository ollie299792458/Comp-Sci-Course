First, and foremost I would like to address Orton Believer. Calling someone a "buffoon" because he has an opinion that differs from yours only shows how much growing up you need to do. By all means voice your opinion, but try to be more constructive about it.

And by the way, HBK beat Benoit because of a distraction from HHH, at Backlash Benoit made HBK tap clean.

Onto the pay per view.

Benoit & Regal vs. Batista & Flair ~ **1/4

I enjoyed this for what it was but a lot of it was just punching and kicking. I would have rather seen Batista vs. Benoit instead, but it seems like the WWE is reluctant to give Batista a big singles match on pay per view.

Trish Stratus vs. Victoria (WWE Women's Title) ~ *

It was nice to see the women get a little bit more time but there just wasn't enough here to fill the 8 or so minutes it was given.

Steven Richards vs. Tyson Tomko ~ 0

Whichever WWE writer came up with this bright idea should be forced to wrestle Tomko for a year as punishment. Richards is a pretty underrated talent, he definitely deserves better than this.

Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Ladder Match, WWE Intercontinental Title) ~ **1/2

The bumps here were pretty impressive but there was nothing to sustain my interest in-between them. The match felt slow and plodding at times and the 'rest, bump, rest, bump' flow near the end didn't really help matters.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kane ~ ***1/4

The beginning of the match seemed to drag a bit but it certainly picked up at the end. Nice return for Michaels.

Tajiri & Rhyno vs. La Resistance (WWE Tag Titles) ~ *1/2

The match seemed to serve it's purpose but it was still disappointing. I wish the WWE would do something better with Tajiri, he's seriously the most underrated guy on the roster.

Randy Orton vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight Title) ~ *

Typical Triple H main event, a whole lot of nothing happens then a ref bump, interference etc. I'm able to tolerate this type of match more when Trip has a better opponent (i.e. Benoit, Michaels) but Orton is the cure for insomnia wrestling wise. Oh well, at least I don't have to see him with the title until Wrestlemania 21.

Another lackluster pay per view, but I can't say I was too enthusiastic going into it.
