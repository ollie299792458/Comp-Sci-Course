Here is an excellent movie for those who have stomach.  A movie for Real Men.  
There is no need to reinforce what you must already know of the stunning performances and riveting portraits drawn by the team behind this  film.  One reading this review is probably wondering whether they need to  own it on video, whether it will be worth it.  
In my experience, I have  viewed this movie multiple times, and it hasn't lost much by way of its  impact on me.  I believe it would be worthwhile to own, to study the  performance, filming, and dialogue.  To learn its lessons and never  forget.
As an aside, I must disagree with a previous reviewer.  I believe  the depictions of the born-again sister are particularly accurate.  I say  this as someone with some sympathy for religion and the religious.  This  has made me especially sensetive to such persons and their prevalence in  the world.  I am sure this reviewer wanted the sister to be a strong  religious character who would step in and save this family, and show her  strength through God and amazing moral sense.  Well, guess what.  That  would have been an amazing stretch given what we know about the family she  came from and would have been an incredibly dubious turn for the movie to  make.  I am afraid that the scene she is in is quite perfect as it is, and  is in fact one of the best in the movie.
