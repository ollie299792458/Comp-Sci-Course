Return to House On Haunted Hill:  I guess with a title like that, there probably was no possible way you could end up with a GREAT movie, but considering the filmmakers apparently had access to some pretty cool sets, a decent cinematographer, a reasonably good special effects budget for a direct to DVD release, and an attractive, competent cast, they might've ended up with an okay movie at least.  But no, this movie is just plain bad.  It is, however, mercifully short, with the actual running time minus the credits clocking in at 75 minutes or so (though if you must know, there is a post-credits sequence, which will either elate you or depress you dependent on what you thought of the movie).  The filmmakers just seem to give up at the hour mark, which results in the least suspenseful conclusion I think I've seen in any movie like this.  The only cast member to return is Jeffrey Combs and all he really does is  appear and smirk menacingly every now and then before someone gets killed.  The plot revolves around the search for an evil statue that's supposed to be in the heart of the house, the location of which is hilariously literal, and therein lies the real problem:  Incredibly bad, unbelievably lazy script.  It includes all the kinds of cliches of the horror genre the Scream movies delighted in mocking:  Minorities die first (including an offensive death by...lesbianism?), people separate from the group and go off by themselves, somebody trips while being chased, etc., etc.  Oh, I won't even go on about this movie.  It's lame. Don't watch it.  Only the least demanding of horror fans will find something to like here.
