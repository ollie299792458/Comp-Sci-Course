My 7 year old daughter and I absolutely loved the movie. Never mind the 1960's stiff acting and fairly poor picture quality by todays standards. This movie will steal your heart! The loving relationship between husband and wife, the wonderful shots of nature and the tight bond between a wild animal and his human mother...it's simply a heartwarming movie! Note: There are a few "intense moments". The movie starts with a lion eating a human (we only see bloody river and floating clothing, but still, it might scare little ones who actually "get it". There are scenes of lions fighting, and Elsa does get hurt by other lions a few times. But if you can narrate it as you watch it, the kids should be fine. I wouldn't let anyone under 5 watch it however.

*** spoiler alert****
I was afraid that Elsa would become wild and forget her human parents (which would have broken my daughter's heart), but that doesn't happen. Although Elsa learned to live free in the wild, and had her own lion family, she remained loving towards her human parents and they made it clear that they saw her many more times. We were thrilled with this ending. My daughter said she'd give it hundred stars if she could.
