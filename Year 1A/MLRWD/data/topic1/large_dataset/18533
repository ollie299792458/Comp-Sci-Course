It's not always easy to take an extremely well written story and turn it into a screen adaptation that carries its own weight. However, White Oleander does just that.  
For those who have not read the book, you'll find this an engrossing, well-acted, directed and produced film.  For those of us who read the book when it first came out, and then waited relentlessly for the movie, you'll not be disappointed.  Kominsky, Pfeiffer, and Lowman do a fantastic believable job without pandering.  
There are many of the book's renderings that have been left out or touched upon only lightly.  In many cases, this would ruin the movie for me.  However, in this instance, I believe Kominsky took the right path in bringing this to the screen.  Many of the trials that Astrid suffered/lived through in the book would not have transferred over well into film had Kominsy tried to capture every nuance.  For those who want their movies to be exactly like the books (usually I'm in this category), I would recommend that they not see the movie/video until many months have passed since reading the book.  The movie touched me deeply and made me cry.  Of course, it cannot and should not be expected to plumb the depths of one's soul as deeply and thoroughly as the book.  I have yet to find an excellent book better rendered in film.  If anyone know of one, please advise.
So, in closing, I'd forwarn the "readers" not to be too hard on a book that cannot reach the same level of purity in film, as few can.  So, enjoy each for what it brings.  The movie is outstanding and certainly not just a "chick flick" but a plucky story of survival.  I highly recommend the film--then by all means read the book!!!!!!
