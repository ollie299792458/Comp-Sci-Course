'Super Hero Movie' is a much more even entry in the spoof movie genre, but I didn't think there were many really funny moments. Even though many of these spoof films lately have been really bad, they may have had a few scenes that were way funnier than anything in this film. I found this film very watch-able, but there are some really stupid gags in this film too.

One joke in particular seemed really dumb involving Dragon Fly and The Human Torch on top of a building with both super heroes wanting to perch on a gargoyle statue. First off I have read many comic books in my life and I don't remember Johnny Storm ever perching anywhere! I only mention this  because the joke involving him is really lame, so putting him in this situation for a laugh doesn't even work. I would have thought Daredevil would have been a better choice and the character's blindness would have been easy to get a quick laugh from.

About 98 percent of this film is a spoof on the Spider-Man films. There are a few (very few) gags involving other super heroes including X-Men, Fantastic Four and Batman, which is a shame because there are so many films in this genre to make fun of and it might have helped this film be funnier. I enjoyed this film because I love super hero films and this film has a better cast than most in this genre.
