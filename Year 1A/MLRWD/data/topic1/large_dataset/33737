This movie had a big impact on me when I was a kid, enough so that I remembered it and sought it out all these years later. At the time, I'm sure I loved the mystery and the time travel aspect of the love story. Watching it again, I felt the story of the struggling artist and his friends really held up (in spite of the clumsy B movie intro), and I liked the idea of the romance being the fuel that inspired his best work. The time travel device worked, too, I thought, as a metaphor for the power of art to bring the past alive. (Many of the scenes are consciously framed as though they themselves are paintings.) The movie has a deep reverence for the artistic calling that we don't see much any more. And it's dated in many other respects. Viewing this many years later, the ending seems pointlessly hokey and tragic (just go to the lighthouse for God's sake!). Even if you buy into the soul mates trascending time in death point the movie jams down your throat so hard in the end, it seems idiotic not to at least make a small effort to stay together in life. Still, I'm glad to see the movie again and am happy to include it as a part of my movie library.
