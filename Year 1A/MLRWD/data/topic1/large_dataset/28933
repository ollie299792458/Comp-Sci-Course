I was sorely disappointed by this movie.  While Zorba himself is charming (enough to almost gain this review a 3-star rating on his own merits), the rest of the movie presents a blatantly racist, sexist and classist world view.

1)Racist:  Except for Zorba himself, the Greeks in the movie are cruel, heartless, murderous, plundering fools with no human compassion.  Additionally, Basil is a personification of the negative British stereotype: physically weak, weak-willed, uptight, and emotionally crippled.

2)Sexist: Women in this movie have three options.  They can be a prostitute, a crone, or a murder victim.  In each of these cases, they'll have their heart toyed with, be subjected to ridicule or worse for seeking joy and freedom in their life, and will likely meet a grizzly death.

3) Classist.  The cruel, heartless, plunderous, murderous fools aren't just Greek, they're *poor* Greeks.  With the exception of Zorba, the amount of compassion characters show is directly proportional to the amount of money they have.  The penniless peasant women clean their newly deceased neighbors' house of all possessions in a matter of moments.  The poor suitors play cruel tricks on the widow, drive a better-off suitor to his death with rumors, and then brutally murder a helpless woman.  On the other hand, the widow who owns her own farm feeds and supports a local insane beggar, and Basil himself shows unexpected kindness to his workers and those around him.

Zorba himself is charming, despite his rather human character character flaws.  His zest for life, his sometimes crazy schemes, his insistance on seeing everyone as an individual, all are endearing.  In any other movie I would have adored him, but he just wasn't enough to save this one.
