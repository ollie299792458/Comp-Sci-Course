As always, I must start off by saying that although the plot concerns a portal that leads into John Malkovich's mind, to say that this is the only idea contained in the movie would be to short change it.  The movie is much more than a clever premise, it is an evaluation of the modern world.  The  film deals with fame, transcendence, sexuality, marriage and psychology,  but never does the movie seem to lose its focus.  No movie in recent times  has quite been able to display the emptiness of the postmodern world in the  way "Malkovich" does, and while all the characters are pathetic  in their own way, neither the script nor Jonze becomes sentimental.  There  are some who will say the film is too weird, but in this case weird is  good.  The modern world is confused and jumbled, to present it without some  form of satire would make it seem bland and banal.  "Malkovich",  like "Three Kings", presents reality in the way the  Expressionists and Surrealists presented reality.  It is not reality per  se, but a hightened emotional presentation, a non-reality that leads to  reality. The performances are great, especially that of John Malkovich,  who's role required the most bravery.  He had to satirize himself.  Not  many Hollywood actors are willing to do that. The best film of the decade,  even greater than Pulp Fiction.
