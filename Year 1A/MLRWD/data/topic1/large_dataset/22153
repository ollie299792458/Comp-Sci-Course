Ever since I was a child, musicals have always caught my attention.  Not the animated Disney kinds, although those are excellent in their own manner, but ones with real people bursting into song and dancing their hearts out.  My first musical was 'Mary Poppins,' which also starred Dick Van Dyke, and I have been hooked since.

Set in England, Van Dyke plays the loving father to twins, a boy and girl, as well as being a somewhat bumbling inventor.  His portrayal and connection with the children is heart-warming, charming, and all-around winning--he can sing and dance exceptionally well!  Sally Howles, his radiant co-star, portrays Truly Scrumptious, who suits her rather unusual name perfectly--like Van Dyke, she is charming with a tongue-in-cheek kind of humor and primness that is all too endearing.

The story takes place before Van Dyke's character pleases his children in purchasing their 'toy' car (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang)--including the means he goes to get the money--and the imaginative story he tells that takes up most of the movie where an evil baron will go to any means of getting the car.

If you have children or simply want to watch a dazzlingly beautiful, heart-warming story, I highly recommend this!  The delivery was faster than I had imagined and the price perfect!
