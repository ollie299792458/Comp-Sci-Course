This is one of my top ten favorite films.  Almost a Christian film, although a Hollywood production, because of Alvin C. York's testimony and influence in the film.  The story is mostly a fictionalized plot, except for the actual battle scenes where York captured all those Germans. The real York insisted that those be done just the way it happened with no embellishment (except for the "turkey call").

Gary Cooper gave one of his classic low-key, everyman performances as York. Great cast of supporting players, from the great Walter Brennan down to new-comer Joan Leslie. (Watch "This is the Army," which was made a couple years later and see some of the same contract actors from Warner Bros. Studio.)

I watch this one over and over and show it to friends and relatives. (My family and I even went camping in middle Tennessee and visited York's grave site and the beautiful little mountain valley he came from.  His home is a state monument.)

A great film, with a great cast and a great director, producer, and music director about a great American. Shows what old pre-war Hollywood could do when they did something right.
