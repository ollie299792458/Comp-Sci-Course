Season two of Alias was awesome. That's one of the best ways to describe it. I picked this DVD up on a Friday, and watched it over the next two days. I couldn't turn it off. The show has all the right twists in all the right moments, all the drama at exactly right time. This season we see the end of the Alliance, in one brilliant assault at the same time across the globe. Thus, Rambaldi becomes the focus of the CIA for the remainder of the season. There are many plot twists and dramatic moments which made me scream at the screen. If the first season of Alias was the build-up, then the second season is definitely the downward slope of the roller coaster. The episodes are:
1. The Enemy Walks In
2. Trust Me
3. Cipher
4. Dead Drop
5. The Indicator
6. Salvation
7. Counteragent
8. Passage (pt. 1)
9. Passage (pt. 2)
10. Abduction
11. Higher Echelon
12. Getaway
13. Phase One
14. Double Agent
15. Free Agent
16. Firebomb
