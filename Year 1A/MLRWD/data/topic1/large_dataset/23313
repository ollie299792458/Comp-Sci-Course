Mickey- There are plenty of missing scenes since the directors cut is appox. 40 minutes longer than the theatrical version and some of those scenes end up in the TV version but not on the DVD. There's a scene in which Superman rescues a little girl from a tornado that Nuclearman caused for instance and that scene is included in the TV version.
I believe that the scene with the furnace that you asked about comes from the George Reeves' Superman series. In that series he enters a furnace after he has had his atoms frozen. They really need to put that series on DVD too.
In Superman IV he uses the crystal to heal himself as shown in the DVD version BUT you are right in thinking that there seemed to be something missing after that. There are several scenes missing from that point on. Nuclearman kidnaps Lacey and then Superman rescuses her. That's why Nuclearman says "Where's the woman?" when he and Supes confront each other. Also there are pictures on the DVD box of Superman handling a red sports car. Those pictures come from cut scenes involving Supuerman's battle with an earlier DIFFERENT version of Nuclearman that we don't get to see on the DVD! The DVD version of Superman IV is the same as the theatrical version but they really need to put the director's cut of this one out on DVD.
