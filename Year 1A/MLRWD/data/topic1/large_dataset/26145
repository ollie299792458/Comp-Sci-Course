Just got this great DVD for Christmas. I know it has been out for a few months but it made a nice gift to me from the family. We saw this concert in its arena form on this Black Ice tour and this is a great souvenir to have of it. Angus is probably slowing down but you can't tell from watching his performance. The rest of the band is as rock steady and professional as ever. This is my generation's Rolling Stones. They have so many great songs and they just keep keepin' on. I hope they keep at it till they can no longer pick up their guitars. Just love them and their high volume boogie rock n roll. I have read some complaints about the constant cutting between cameras but this is just the way things are done today. They have lots of cameras and the director tries to capture both audience and band with lots of cutaways and some split screens. I did not find it that distracting. The color and sound was fantastic. I also enjoyed the small documentary on doing the show in Argentina that was included as an extra. All in all nice package.
