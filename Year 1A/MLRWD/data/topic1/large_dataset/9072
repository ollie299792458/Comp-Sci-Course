Standing on the rooftop, looking down into the empty square, three thieves are about to meet in The Red Circle. I like me a good caper film, and Le Cercle Rouge shot right to the top of my favorites, along with Heat and Rififi. I'd have to go; Rififi's silent heist then Le Cercle Rouge's no-nonesense burgle closely behind.

Alain Delon plays Corey, an unflappable theif who is on the cusp of being released from prison, when a guard convinces him to go for a gigantic jewelry heist at a shop the guard's relative is employed at. Corey's job will be to assemble a team somehow and fence the jewelry, basically do everything. The guard insists. Meanwhile, a man named Vogel (Gian Maria Volont?) is being escorted to Paris by the police for some unknown crime (at least I may have missed the mention). These two men's path eventually meet, and that of a third, to pull of a jewel heist of biblical proportions. All of this happens as Vogel is being hunted by nearly all of France's police might.

The subtlties of Le Cercle Rouge are endless, with the best aspect being the ommission of superfluous patronizing on the part of Jean-Pierre Melville. Even the actors employed a certian "economy of motion" (one of my very favorite phrases) that kept things fresh and natural. I don't really know what to add other than an extended recap. It's a must see for fans of the previously mentioned films.
