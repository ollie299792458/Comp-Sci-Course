This movie was billed as an action flick during its theater release, which was a mistake. Audiences were expecting exactly that, and the movie is something entirely different: it's a comedy, and a clever one, at that.

Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) is the favorite action hero of young movie buff, Danny Madigan. A magic movie ticket and a wrinkle in reality transport Danny into Slater's world, where car chases are a daily event and Slater's never-before-seen police partner turns out to be a cartoon cat named Whiskers. Slater and Danny fight crime while dodging action-movie cliches right and left. Then, in a nod to meta, they hunt down a Slater-world villain who has crossed into the real world and is attempting to defeat Slater once and for all by killing the actor who portrays him.

The movie doesn't just mock the cliches of its genre, it mocks movies themselves. Slater's closet only contains identical versions of the same clothes he's already wearing. The police captain's unintelligible scolding is revealed to be exactly that: even up close and in person, it still doesn't make sense.

Slater is forced to realize that he and his world (where all phone numbers start with 555) are fictional. He immediately becomes angry about all the stresses and hardships he's suffered at the all-too-casual whims of writers.

There are lots of great details in this movie (the daydreamed Jack Slater version of "Hamlet" is priceless), and several talented character actors: Mercedes Ruehl, Charles Dance, Robert Prosky, and F. Murray Abraham all make appearances here.

If you like irony and satire, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Here's hoping it finds the right audience on DVD, now that the studio has stopped trying to pass it off as something different from what it actually is.
