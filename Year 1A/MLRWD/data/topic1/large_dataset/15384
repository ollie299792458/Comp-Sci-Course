I felt that this film didn't have any original scares and surprises.  The film starts out in the one and only scary scene where a group of doctors are performing an autopsy on some one who is still alive in an insane  asylum.  Then the inmates break loose and kill the doctors and are killed  as well in a fire.  After some years later Geoffrey Rush and wife Femke  Janssen invite 6 people to the now converted asylum for a night of terror  in which if the participants live through the night they each win 1 million  dollars.  You can guess where it goes from there people die and lots of  needless gore.  Through out the film as I watched it I found that a lot of  the scares were taken from other movies such as the ghost man that shakes  his head was taken from Jacob's Ladder.  This was another Hollywood remake  that should have never been made.  The original was far scarier and who  doesn't love Vincent Price.  If you can avoid this film like the plague do  it its not worth the time or the money to rent.  If you want good horror  see something like Jacob's Ladder where the scares are constant and is also  a moving film.
