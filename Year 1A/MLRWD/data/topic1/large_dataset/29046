Very good adaption of the Ryan book, which stays about as true to the epic narrative as is probably possible. I've seen others remark that the score to the movie sometimes is out of place, and I would agree, but it's still one of my favorite movie scores, and is quite rousing.

I'm generally not a fan of the 'big name star stew' casting, but it works, for the most part, in this movie. Bogarde and Hackman are especially good. One of my pet peeves in war movies is obvious anachronism. It appears here in the use of modern vehicles in place of period German tanks. I can excuse this, since this movie didn't have the boundless budget of, say, Saving Private Ryan. They did at least use Shermans for the Allies. Overall, the movie is entertaining, and reasonably true to the book/historical events.

The dvd itself, however, is nothing special. The picture isn't horrible, but it's a little grainy, and you get pretty frequent flashes of scarred film. The movie would probably need a serious revamping, a la 'Vertigo' or 'Rear Window' to substantially improve this, though, so this is likely the best we'll get.
