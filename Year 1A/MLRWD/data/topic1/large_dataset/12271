Wow, initially, a friend recommended me to watch this movie after he received it for christmas. I was almost laughing at him because of the commercials and I thought it was horrible at the time. After constant nagging by him, I decided to give it a try and I feel in love with it. This movie is incredible and almost, almost brought me to tears. If you know me, I'm one that you can't get to start crying.

::HERE IS A SYNOPSIS THAT I WROTE::

The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland, if not Europe. At the outbreak of the Second World War, however, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the conquering Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman has seen his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945.

I guarantee you will absolutely LOVE this movie.

Thank You and enjoy
