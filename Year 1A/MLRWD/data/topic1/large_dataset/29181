What Bobbie de Niro offers in this movie is something more than simple acting. I read somewhere that Scorsese wasn't so enthusiastic at the idea of making this movie ( maybe bacause at the time he was going through one  of the harshest moments of his life ) and one of the reasons that this  movie saw daylight was probably because de Niro wanted to make it at all  costs - and when you watch him playing La Motta you can understand why!  Very probably the man knew that this would prove to be one of the best  movies of the last twenty years and undoubtfully one of de Niro's strongest  performances : nothing short of Brando's one in " In the Waterfront  ".  To see how powerfull and merciless was La Motta in the ring and  how pathetic he was outside - I found it really touching! This was a man  who had to fight against himself more than against his opponents, a  restless heart, a macho, prisoner of his catholic upbringing and his bad  temper, but deep down inside a very good hearted man..."which friends,  I don't have any friends..."  The black and white, the links between  slow moving scenes and the normal fight ones, the creation of the  atmosphere of the fourties and the fifties - everything is quite perfect in  this masterpiece!  I really like Robert Redford's directing in  "Ordinary people", but quite frankly the Academy Award should  have gone to Scorsese that year. And it would have been well deserved!
