This true masterpiece directed by acclaimed director and writer, Oliver Stone, is avant-garde filmaking at its breaking point.  The whole theme of Natural Born Killers is that the media is obsessive over violence and brutality; therefore, the extreme violence in the movie is used as a satire, not as entertainment.  Definitely one of the most controversial movies ever released, especially in the 1990s when the Simpson trial, Rodney King, and the Menendez brothers became celebrity darlings because of the mass media and not because of anything credible.  The acting by all the leads, especially Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, is amazing.  Their true love is another theme that proves vital in Natural Born Killers.  It is the one and only thing that can hold people together when faced with such things as violence and a tormented childhood.  The actual violence portrayed is not even that graphic after one viewing.  It is the break-neck pacing and high-speed cuts that give the movie its violent intensity.  If not Woody Harrelson, then definitely Juliette Lewis should have received some sort of Academy nomination, such as an Emmy, if not an Oscar.
Oliver Stone beats one in the face with this media spectacle that boasts every type of film style imaginable.  Everything from 36 mm to black and white to animation to a video camera to color tinting to fast and slow motion is used in abundance with fascinating success.  Roger Ebert said, "Seeing this movie once is not enough," and he is right!  A must see.
Brilliant Filmaking!
