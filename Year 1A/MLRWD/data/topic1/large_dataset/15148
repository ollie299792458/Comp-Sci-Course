A family is outbound on vacation when a huge mushroom cloud is spotted over LA.  So, naturally, the first thing dad does is head back to town to check on grandma.  Traffic is streaming out of the city, at times in both lanes, almost colliding with the family car.  But dad plods on, and so does the plot, evolving into no more logic than that with which it started.  But no one seems REALLY worried--not about radiation, more bombs, invading troops, or even just who the hell is dropping nukes on the major urban centers of the U.S. or its allies.  Nope, as dad has an epiphany and heads away from the nightmarescape of LA, he finds that people are more concerned with waiting periods for gun purchases and the price of gasoline.  He risks life and limb in a fight over a pistol, yet viewers later learn that he has more than one shotgun in the family travel trailor.  Teen son thinks it's all a lark, and teen daughter believes it's a drag.  And thus the movie itself would be if there weren't a laugh waiting around every curve in the road.  Accomplished actors Ray Milland and Jean Hagen play it straight, and unaccomplished actors Frankie Avalon and Mary Mitchel do what unaccomplished actors usually do.  Teen idol doesn't muss a hair of his plastic-looking pompadour, though, so maybe he did accomplish something.
