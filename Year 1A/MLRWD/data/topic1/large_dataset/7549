OK, I am NOT a huge DVD fan.  But, for this show, I made an exception and bought the first season.

This is the best show on TV.  Leary is perfect in his role as firefighter, screwed up husband and somewhat devoted dad.  Leary never seems to be acting.  It always seems to come straight from his core and he has a way of surrounding himself with equally talented actors.

I especially love the absolutely realistic look at addiction, AA meetings and the hell that it can cause in your life.  You can feel for Tommy and as a friend says "people in 12 step program have a special perspective on this show".  I agree. I really love when Tommy's conscience and higher power comes to talk to him in the form of his cousin or the dead in his life.

The only part I am not overly fond of is the interaction with his dad and uncle.  While it is an important to understand where Tommy comes from, it often drags the show for me.  BUT, that is my ONLY minor complaint.

I really get into this show and I even ADORE the theme song which seems perfect for this show.

Leary is great! the show is great.  BRING ON SEASON TWO ON DVD and SEASON 3 on TV.
