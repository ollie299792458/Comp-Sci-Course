I totally disagree with the Amazon reviewer, who of course has to praise the film lavishly so that people buy the DVD. The truth is, very little happens during the first 75 minutes of the film, and the final 15 minutes are disappointing.  The problem here is two-fold.  First, the repetition - night after night of nothing happening gets boring fast.  Secondly, there are hardly any scares in the film (pool cleaners exiting the pool are not scary; neither are falling pots, closing doors or crying babies) and what few scares there are rely on cheap loud noises to startle the audience. I didn't like the first film, but at least its scares were well-earned.  For example, there is nothing here as remotely creepy as PA1's images of the girl hovering over her boyfriend for hours or the paw prints in the baby powder.  To make matters worse, there are some ridiculous things about this film such as the family not moving out once they saw the footage of the mom being dragged by an invisible presence.  What??!!  Any sane person would have left the house immediately.  This should have been much better.  I'm not a movie director, but I'm confident that if I had the same budget to work with I could make a much scarier movie.
