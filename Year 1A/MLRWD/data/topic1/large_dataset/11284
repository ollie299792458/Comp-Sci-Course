A remarkable adaptation of an outstanding, life-changing book. Oprah Winfrey and Toni Morrison are true geniuses.  I am proud to live on the same planet as these two great women.  I do have one suggestion. C'est  dommage!  One of the greatest films in the Amazon.com DVD Collection has no  French soundtrack or closed captions.  Anyone who has learned English as a  second language in the US in recent years will tell you how helpful closed  captions on TV have been as a learning tool. Teachers of French would love  to see this be routinely adopted as an industry standard.  My fear is that  the movie industry will pass up a unique opportunity to participate in  public learning of foreign languages.  By the way, isn't it actually  against the law in Canada not to include the French?  Shouldn't Region 1-  (US and Canada only) encoding  ALWAYS include French sound and French  closed captions- not only as a courtesy and an added value, easy to  include-but to comply with Canadian law?  Otherwise, a truly great film in  a wonderful format!
