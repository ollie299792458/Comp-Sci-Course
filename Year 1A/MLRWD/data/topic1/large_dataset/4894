Having not watched either the 1988 original or the Broadway version of Hairspray, I am enthralled by the 2007 update. The casting was excellent.

Michelle Pfeiffer is the evil station manager Velma Von Tussle whose only intention is to keep her teenage daughter in the limelight as the ultimate Miss Teenage Hairspray. Her foxy sultriness and impeccable aura makes her role shine. John Travolta in his fat suit and much hyped about gender-bending role as Edna Turnblad is anything but hilarious. While he tries to mimic the voice of a middle-aged obese woman who is disconnected from society, it's really his (or her) antics that lights up the screen. Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad is incredibly affectionate yet deadpan at times though he delivers that fatherly and husband instincts with great aplomb. Queen Latifah as the over-the-top Motormouth Maybelle fights to keep her black cast on the show with excellent rendition of songs especially the tearjerker I Know Where I've Been.

In the end, the two unbelievable stars of Hairspray must be newcomer Nikki Blonsky and High School Musical Zac Efron who play Tracy Wilbur and Link Larkin respectively. Blonsky plays the fervent show chaser who aspires to be part of the cast with great fervor and becomes an accidental anti-racism activist while Efron shakes off his childish shadow by playing a charming TV character. The unlikely romance between Tracy and Link unfolds with much realism onscreen as their chemistry is unmistakable.

In Hairspray, the acting is great and the music is good. The New Girl in Town", "Big, Blonde and Beautiful" (Reprise), and "Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)" are the three songs new to this version of Hairspray.

The musical is highly entertaining and celebratory despite some minor flaws. (A)
