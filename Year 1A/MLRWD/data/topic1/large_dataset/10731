If you like the post-apocalyptic, after-the-virus type of movie, this may be for you.  It's a bit of a mess, but it all seems to work.  There are any number of plot holes and/or things that simply don't make sense, but somehow it still manages to be enjoyable.  Rhona Mitra stars in this film, and she performs admirably and adds a much-needed air of credibility to the film.  Malcom McDowell and Bob Hoskins also have small parts in the film, and both helped me gloss over the movie's flaws.

The Blu-Ray has features a nice 1080P transfer; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the audio mix.  The dialogue was a little soft, and the explosions boomed with a little too much authority, so you may either be adjusting the volume of the movie throughout, or simply dealing with extreme loudness intermittently.

The special features aren't bad, but they aren't spectacular, either.  There's a commentary here (I haven't listened to it), and some U-Control special features that are fairly interesting.
