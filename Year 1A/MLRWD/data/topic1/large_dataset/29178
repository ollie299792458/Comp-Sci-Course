We bought this movie at the recommendation of a Londonwalks tour guide(neat outfit, highly recommend, btw) , after she happened to mention it during a walking tour that included Picadilly Circus. Her story intrigued us, so I ordered it when we got back.

What a fantastic movie! Judi Dench plays to perfection , Bob Hoskins is easily her equal, and I knew nothing of Will Young, but looked him up after the movie and will be buying some of his CDs. Speaking of which, I have already ordered and received the fabulous soundtrack for this movie. Soundtrack is ten thumbs up, as well.

Basic premise of the movie is that, a few years before WWII,  giddy, bored, upper crust widow Dench buys a theatre on a whim, and hires Hoskins to manage it. When attendance goes south, she surprises society by incorporating nudity in her show, her ostensible reason being that Paris has the Moulin Rouge, and a stellar world city like London ought to have the same. Her real reason, of course, is surprisingly far more personal, and she is far less giddy than she lets on.

Be forewarned that there is a lot of nudity in this movie, but it is very tastefully done, since it is done in the same conventions as the era. My movie rule of thumb is, "would I watch this with my 73 year old dad?"  Not only would I watch it with them, I've been begging my folks to watch it. They would love it. The nudity is incidental, yet integral to the story.

There's not really much plot to the movie, but it moves along at a good pace, there's a few tearjerking moments, the art, choreography, singing, dance, and costumes are A+, and if nothing else, it's worth it to watch Dame Judy Dench charm, rather than chew, her way through the part. She gets lovelier the older she gets, and she just lights up the screen in this period piece.

Oh, why can't all movies be this surprisingly good?
