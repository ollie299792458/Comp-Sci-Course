I bought this DVD on the day it was released and I must say this is a very extensive and the BEST DVD release ever of Dirty Dancing! I am so glad it is in widescreen and not stupid fullscreen (which is very annoying). You can defenitly tell that the sound has been remastered..I could not believe my ears. And all the special features is mind blowing. Throw away all your other versions of this film as like I said this is the most extensive and best DVD version ever released. The film is presented in a widescreen format of 1.85:1 with tons of new features including all new interviews with Jennifer Grey, writer Eleanor Bergstein, and others. Along with Deleted, Alternate, and Extended Scenes and very funny Gag Reels/Outtakes. Just take my word for it..BUY IT NOW if your a true Dirty fan! I do not think this movie should EVER be released in fullscreen format because if so then it will be taking away some of the picture in the film and the movie would just be terrible if it was in fullscreen as you do not get the full effect of it in fullscreen like you do in widescreen. One word left to say...BUY THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY DVD! You will NOT be disappointed!
