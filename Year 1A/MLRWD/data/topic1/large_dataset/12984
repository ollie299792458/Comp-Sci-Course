When people think of midnight movies, many may come to mind, but a few stand out. Kentucky Fried Movie is one of the few at the top of this  short-lived era, where more explicit or more artistic films could be shown  in the wee hours.
Its still quite hilarious on its own. There are some  outrageous, vulgar-but-funny takeoffs. It is, however, quite dated. Some of  the sketches fall flat. For most, really, the film will be a mixed bag -  the chapter skip function is a welcome feature here. The film's most famous  sketches ("Catholic High School Girls In Trouble", "Fistfull  of Yen" among them) are incredible, though, and will leave your sides  splitting.
Its the perfect movie to recreate the TRUE midnight movie  experience with. Watch it with a group late at night. Throw back a few  beers (or other mind-altering substances of choice). Put on KFM. Laugh  yourself silly. Takes you back, doesn't it? :)
One other note: I found  the DVD commentary, although not too insightful, incredibly amusing - worth  the DVD price on its own.
