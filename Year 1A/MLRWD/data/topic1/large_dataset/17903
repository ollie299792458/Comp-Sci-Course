It's 2024, or 2036 or 2096 -  or whenever it is - and we've "killed the planet earth" (We've done that already by the way. Summers aren't what they used to be.) Apparently we have no option but to bombard the surface of Mars with moss and hope it grows so we can next go and kill Mars. Naturally, our botanical experiments are a huge success and in no time at all, we've converted a lifeless space-rock into Bali. The next thing we've got to do is overcome radiation, gravity, reality, acting and direction and propel five Americans and an ageing Englishman across the cosmos to see how fast we can set up shop on our nearest neighbour. Naturally, our little voyage is a catastrophe. The space philosopher-cum-senior citizen played by Terence Stamp dies in the opening twenty minutes, ostensibly of a spleen injury, but one suspects of embarrassment. A robot called AMEE, created by the American military to assist matters falls on its head and decides to murder the whole crew. The 'craft' is hit by a solar flare and catches fire. The ground party land miles from their destination and run out of oxygen ten minutes after discovering that their home-from-home has been ravaged by martian cockroaches. Oh - and by the way - you can breathe on Mars. It has to do with the moss. And the cockroaches. Or something. I could go on - but I won't. Lacking in every department, though an impressive advertisement for Arizona.
