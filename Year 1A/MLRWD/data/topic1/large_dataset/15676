The first half hour of this movie might have you thinking that it will be a formulaic farce, but it quickly turns into a an interestingly off-balance look at the tension between societal expectations and true love, succeeding both as a light-hearted comedy and a serious commentary on the ultimate irrelevance of economic classes in the pursuit of love.

  With lesser actors, the script might have turned into something heavy-handed and forced, but Hepburn, Stewart, and Hussey do a wonderful job of revealing vulnerabilities in their characters, something that transforms the action from soap opera to something special.  Cary Grant performs admirably in his role as the once-favored of Hepburn, but his role lacks the emotional range of the roles that Hepburn and Stewart played.  That aside, the acting is consistently great and quite moving, though 21st century sensibilities might find it a little too emotive.  The work of the young Virginia Weidler, who would die too young in 1968 of a heart ailment, is just one among many other hidden gems in this film.

Please watch this film if you'd like an idea of what "romantic comedy" meant in the US at the dawn of WWII.
