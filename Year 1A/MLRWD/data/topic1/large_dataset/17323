When I saw the trailer I thought I would enjoy this movie, especially being a big fan of Mr.Cage.  I thought my wife would not like it at all.  Well I was wrong on both counts.  My wife liked it, I didn't really care for it.  Having said that I probably would have given it 3 stars had it not been preachy, even as it was subtle with it's sermon. I was not expecting a social commentary film on the evil that gun merchants do.  I actually expected somewhat of an action movie.  I think most people realize what arms dealers do for a living and the often horrifying consequences of that.  I really don't need a 2 hour movie to educate me on that fact. The characters I thought were pretty weak as well. Picture Woody Allen as an international arms dealer doing business with ruthless war lords that would cut your heart out in a second.  That's obviously an exaggeration, I mean it is Nicholas Cage, but you get the idea.  I'll leave it at that because I don't want to give anything away.  If your looking for something along the line of The Rock, this isn't it.  If you want to see a movie about how disgusting and evil arms dealers are (their not really bad guys they just do really bad things), and how terrible the US Government is for associating with them then you'll really like this movie.
