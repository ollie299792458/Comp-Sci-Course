I don't know why people are complaining about the Digital Copy/UltraViolet thing, I had absolutely no problems downloading my digital copy through iTunes. I know the same URL is shown for each choice, either UltraViolet, or Digital Copy, but when taken to the website, you choose any format you wish. I chose Apple iTunes then you punch in the authorization code and pay no mind to the other stuff below (Please send me information about Paramount yada yada yada) and my iTunes opened and you punch in the code again where you redeem gift cards and voila! it starts downloading. Simple, right? The movie was great. I enjoyed the Mission Impossible movies, as I enjoy most spy movies like this. James Bond is great and I am looking forward to Skyfall when it comes out, but Mission Impossible is clearly different, no matter what people here have been saying. James Bond deals mainly with sleeping around and a lot of action. Mission Impossible deals with gadgets and tough locations, oh, and action too. If you want to call it a James Bond ripoff, then you have to say the same about True Lies, Spies Like Us, Bourne trilogy, and all the rest. All in all, Tom Cruise does a great job, as well as Simon Pegg and all the others. If you're still not sure, rent it. You will enjoy it.
