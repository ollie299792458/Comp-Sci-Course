I don't even know where to begin. When this movie first aired I was younger and didn't really have the ability to truly appreciate this movie, so I was in and out of the room and missed alot of the movie.Then one day a couple of years later it aired on VH1 and I decided to sit down and watch it. I was so mad that I hadn't payed attention the first time!! This movie is phenomenal, it had me wishing that I was born back then so that I could have been at the actual concerts and meet the real Temptations. I too only have one grip: It was told from Otis's point of view so we might not know the ENTIRE story. But other than that, it it great. I fell in love with the whole cast and each of their portrayals of the Tempting 5. I now watch it faithfully at LEAST once a week. And true to this heading, it makes me cry everytime. I've even got my 9 year old niece hooked on it. Whenever she comes to visit me, we watch it at least 3 or 4 times.We've become so hooked that we went out and bought the Cds. Between the two of us, we have around 15 Temptations CDs. And not the new Tempts, the original ones. We also spend time looking up site dedicated to the Tempts to learn more about the group that influenced a whole generation...and still doing it to this day.
