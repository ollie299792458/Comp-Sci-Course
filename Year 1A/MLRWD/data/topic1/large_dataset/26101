I'm going to make this as short and sweet as possible, if you like mindless violence and fan service, then go for it. If you want a story or character development of any sort, look else where, far else where. The story does not know what it wants to do, which is generally a sure fire way to drive it into the ground. Most of the time, it's just mindless fanservice and zombie killing which would be fine if they didn't try to add a serious side to the show which falls flat in the most ungraceful way imaginable.

It fails as a fun fanservice anime by having an exceptionally uninteresting and boring cast.

It fails as a serious anime by having highly cliched, predictable, and bad story, both for an anime and a zombie show.

If it had chosen to be just a fun non-serious anime I would have given it some slack, but unfortunately it tried to push a terrible story with equally terrible characters.

Pros
-Animation is beautiful

Cons
-Terrible story
-Characters are as interesting as watching paint dry
-Both the action and the fan service get repetitive
