The complicated plot has several intersecting characters with the anit-hero at it's center as we follow his decention into bloody madness.
The b&w photography is masterful as well as the direction that never repeats a shot thusly keeping the eye always interested.

But it's the fantastic swordplay of the individual against groups
That keeps the viewers coming back for more. These are staged in a quiet forrest, a snow storm, and a burning building, making each one different. And each fight becomes bloodier as the villian becomes more insane. The ending is magnificent because it avoids the obvious conclusion and give us better than we were hoping for.

Even if you've never heard of Tatsuya Nakadai, you'll become a big fan of his after viewing this film. He gives a truly inspired(deranged) performance.

Because of the blood and flying limbs be careful who you view this film with. Even in b&w it's very bloody and the dying are vocal about it. An adult will see the style of it though and appreciate the staging of the swordplay.

But the movie is far more than the fights. It's a fancinating tale of intersecting characters that finally converge on each other, blending real historical people with fictional ones. It's only a shame that most people won't see this movie in a dark theater on a wide screen. I did many times and was always moved and excited as were the friends that I took to see it.
