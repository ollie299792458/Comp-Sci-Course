This movie is absolutely essential if you want to get a glimpse on how the arab world felt during the war in Iraq. This is a great documentary: no voice over, no questions or interviews, no one-on-one sessions: mostly bits of life captured while following journalists of Al-Jazeera. Some may find this a bit too one-sided, but hey: this is about Al-Jazeera, not about the press coverage of the war. Although for contrast, I'd really like to see the same documentary filmed inside CNN or Fox News.

I have to say that I was amazed by the knowledge, the culture, the humor and the sharp analysis that is displayed by all the protagonists. It makes this documentary truly enjoyable. I felt a lot of empathy with the journalists, watching them struggle, endure the insults and the hatred of the rest of the media and the US administration: they were showing what noone else wanted to show, they questionned the army spin and brought the arab point of view, and a lot of people despised them for that.

This is a very intersting movie, if you want to get both sides of the story. This is also a great documentary.
