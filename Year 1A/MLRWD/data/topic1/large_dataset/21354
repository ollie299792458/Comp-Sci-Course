Ah, Jamie Lee, queen of the horror fan's heart.  In this goofy entry in the dead teen/slasher subgenre, every possible cliche is played to the  hilt, with the results being both hilarious and quite endearing.  We get  references from "Carrie" and "Halloween" as well as  countless other stock situations.  
Jamie Lee plays the ubiquitous  "final girl," although in this film we learn early on that she is  in no danger from the killer. Those students who ARE being stalked on the  night of "Disco Madness" run the gamut of stereotypes for this  kind of film: the bitch, the party girl, Mr. popularity, the virgin, the  greaser.  They are dispatched in typical stalk 'n' slash fashion, but the  gore content is pretty tame (although some viewers may be disappointed by  this).  The soundtrack is a real hoot, with disco songs that sound eerily  familiar to popular hits of the day -- you'll be able to spot a couple of  BeeGee's knockoffs and an inane "I Will Survive" clone, among  others.  Best of all is Jamie Lee strutting her stuff in a pointless disco  extravaganza.  It may not add anything to the movie, but the kitsch level  is increased tenfold!
Despite its derivative nature and its piecemeal  construction, "Prom Night" is a cheese-filled indulgence for  those who get a kick out of slasher movies.  Strange as it may seem for a  horror film, it has an innocence and a slight tongue-in-cheek quality that  make it highly entertaining.  If you have a sense of humor and an hour and  a half to kill on a rainy afternoon, check out "Prom Night."  It  may not be great cinema, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.
