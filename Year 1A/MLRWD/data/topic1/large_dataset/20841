I believe that if you love the United States, you should love The Postman. This film is not just about glorifying the mailmen in our country. Actually, it centers around normal Americans rallying around a figurehead that has long since vanished in this post-apocalyptic world, and helping to bring about the restoration of the United States.
The story starts out with Kevin Costner as a drifter, traveling the wilderness of what used to be America. After coming across a group of soldiers (the Holnists) who are in charge of governing this world, led by the tyrant General Bethlehem (Will Patton), Costner escapes, finds an old mail jeep with a dead carrier inside, and crawls inside to seek warmth and shelter from a raging storm.
At first he seeks personal gain by claiming the dead carrier's uniform and mail bag, to get food from the local townspeople. By masquerading as a mailman of the "Restored United States", he also instills a feeling of hope in the hearts of the people he meets. This allows the survivors of the holocaust to believe in something again after years of hardship and destitude.
Costner, by the end of the film, comes to believe in himself and truly does create a new U.S. Postal Service, thereby helping people in distant settlements and hamlets to communicate with loved ones they haven't spoken with in years
The end is anti-climactic, as some have stated, by having Costner and Patton fist-fight and wrestle like two young schoolboys, but the whole movie is so patriotic that we can overlook this.
