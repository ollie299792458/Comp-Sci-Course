I waited for years to see the director's cut of this magnificent movie. In the early 80's, after Visconti's heirs regained possession of the rights to it, they ordered it to be edited according to the master's wishes. I had  then the privilege of watching "Il Gattopardo" in a movie theater  in all its splendor, exactly as Visconti wanted it to be. Forget the ugly  and stupid English-dubbed version that was released before. The true  meaning of this movie can only be completely grasped when you see the  Italian-spoken version, in spite of a central character, the one played by  Burt Lancaster, having to be dubbed in Italian. I hope that when this is  released on DVD we get the real thing, with its full lenght and the  delightful cinematography by the great Giuseppe Rotunno. Please don't be  insensitive to those who love true cinema: give us the real "Il  Gattopardo" in its original widescreen format, its entire lenght and  the melodious sounds of the original Italian dialogue. And, last but not  least, the stunning beauty of the young Claudia Cardinale...
