I decided to watch this film only because it starred one of my favorite actors, Ian Holm, who has lended his amazing talents to such films as TIME BANDITS, LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, LOTR: RETURN OF THE KING, JESUS OF NAZARETH, and KAFKA.
For those who never fail to be overwhelmed by the amazing acting skills of this man, you won't be disappointed.  He performs the role of Napoleon just as well as he has performed Napoleon previously, or Bilbo Baggins, or a Pharisee, or an evil doctor (as he did in the aforementioned films, respectively).
If you're not familiar with the story of Napoleon (I'm not all that familiar with it myself), you'll still be throughly entertained if you're the kind of person who likes a well-developed plot, well-developed and believable characters, and fantastic acting.
I'm not an astute enough student of history to be able to say exactly what type of man (at least, in terms of virtue) Napoleon was.  I've heard that he was a tragic fallen leader of Europe from some sources.  And from others I've heard that he was almost on the same plane as Hitler.  But this film - showing his life and mind through the brilliant dramatic acting of Ian Holm - has definitely made me want to study more about what manner of man he really was.
