Please don't buy this film if you are a super film critic and wish to tear apart the weaker aspects of Original Sin. Buy this film if you love love and are fans of Antonio Bandaras and Angelina Jolie. It was quite a strech for these two blockbuster actors to do such intimatly nude scenes together, I have never seen either do nudity. They were beautiful together and sizzled the screen with their bedroom and tub love making. It was definatly an afternoon turn on to see these two great actors make love in such a realistic fashion it made me blush. Thomas Jane added more to the film with his bad boy good looks, these three actors were made to take their clothes off, they all had such awesome bodies, it was art on the screen. The plot was set in Havana, and shot in Mexico and you could really get a feel for the Spanish influence Antonio wore elegant panama suits and the wedding scene all the people wore beautiful panama draped white suits it really made you feel you were in Cuba, the shots of the cuban country side were rich with sensual colors and mexican people and planations were beautiful. The plot had many interesting twists to keep you intrigued. When I saw this movie I was extrmemly surprise that it didn't get a better box office review, but I am the kind of person that doesn't always like what everybody else does and this is one film I really loved.
