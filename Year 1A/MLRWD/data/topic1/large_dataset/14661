This is a classic piece of 80s horror. It's not scary at all, and you'll figure out who the killer is in no time, but Pieces makes up for its shortcomings in its sheer audacity and its heavy doses of bad movie cheese. If you are a fan of movies that are so bad that they are good, stop reading these reviews and check this movie out lest you spoil any of the surprises.

Pieces is a bad movie, but it's not boring. It gives fans of the horror genre exactly what they want: the gore is legendary, there are gobs of nudity, the music is all synthy and cool, there's dancing, red herrings, bad dubbing and a dash of kung-fu.

The DVD extras are okay. The interviews on Disc 2 are interesting but fall short of being a good "making-of" documentary that you could watch more than once. Most of the extras on disc one consist of Eli Roth gushing over the movie at a recent theatrical showing. There's some fun stuff there, including the theater audience audio track. The Spanish version has a different, more serious soundtrack that's worth listening through also.
