I have both the Chinese *rare* Ritek DVD, and the English DVD.  Just thought I'd share my comments:
-The English DVD has much better video quality
-The Chinese DVD has terrible music
-The fight scenes are better in the English DVD, as the music and sound effects are more dramatic
The thing is I always prefer to see chinese movies in chinese audio with english subtitles.....and I hate dubbing.
However, I have watched both and this is my favorite movie.  Having said that, I'd say the experience is better watching the English version, because you feel much more emotionally into the fights and drama as the music is much more appropriate.  The chinese DVD music is terribly wrong and doesn't suit the movie at all.  It totally wrecks the final fight scene.  Imagine watching an amazing martial arts fight but listening to some really cheezy 1970's drama music.  It's terrible.  The English DVD doesn't play music during the fight scenes.  That is the way it should be.
The video is much better on the English DVD. Its flawless and colorfull.  The Chinese DVD is dull greyish, and it has the snow white flakes all the time as if it was recorded from a movie theatre reel.
It would be really nice to have Fist of Legend with the Chinese audio and English subtitles, but the English DVD video quality and also to remove the music from the fight scenes.  That would be perfect =)
