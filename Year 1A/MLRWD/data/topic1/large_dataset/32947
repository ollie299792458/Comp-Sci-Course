this is one of my new all-time favorite movies. i loved it! it is a tight film...from the opening scene to the opening montage to the end of the movie. guy ritchie and his team did an absolutely fabulous job on the story, direction, production, editing, music, visual effects, etc. and while i'm a major benicio fan, the entire ensemble cast rocked. the movie goes so fast and is so good, you'll never once look at your watch. as for the dvd goodies, it's the best one i own (some of my others include: fear &amp; loathing in las vegas, se7en, taxi driver, traffic, goodfellas, etc). beyond the usual extras , you get a very entertaining and very well produced "making of," subtitle option just for pikey (brad pitt's part), this fabulous "stealing stones" option which allows you to see deleted scenes within the movie if you choose, superbly produced menus, etc. i'm going to agree with premiere magazine which stated "one of the coolest movies of the year" + i'm going to add, one of the coolest dvds you'll ever own.
