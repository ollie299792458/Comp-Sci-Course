At first glance i thought this was going to be one those animes that i can't ever get into.  I always tend to be the guy that judges a book by it's cover, when it comes to animes.  So i didn't pick this one up, but instead had a friend lend it to me so i could check it out.

So i'm bored and finally decide to watch this anime.  The artist has talent to start with, and Death note is very well drawn.  Which for me is a must.  I really can't watch too many animes that aren't drawn well.  (Yu Yu Hakasho, Tenchi Muyo....)  It's very suspenseful and keeps you wanting to see the next thing that's about to happen all the time.  No action like a lot of the big animes (Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball Z) but has probably one of the best storylines out there.  That story is so well thought out and put together it's just too good to be true.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes anime, even if you're the type of person who doesn't watch anime, that lacks in the action department.  It's that good!  I need to get my hands on volume 2! lol  Don't miss out on this anime, it's really really good.  I can't believe i'm writing a review on this.  Oh and for the record, i'm actually a hard critic on anime. I don't hand out 5 stars to just any anime.
