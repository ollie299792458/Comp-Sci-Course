After reading Stephen King's novel "Pet Sematary" and being a little disturbed by it, I figured that I would rent the movie to see what a terrible adaptation some money-hungry fellow made. After viewing the film I  was quite surprised. The first half of the film starts out nice with a  happy family enjoying thier new rural home. But then we see the second half  of the film in which all turns to hell. After Gage is killed you can't help  but feel bad, no one wants to see a boy that cute skin his knee let alone  what happens to him in this film. The performances in the film were mostly  well done, especially from Fred Gwynne (Jud Crandall), Denise Crosby  (Rachel Creed) &amp; Miko Hughes (Gage Creed). The Pet Sematary novel was  meant to be disturbing, and this film certainly is just that. Most likely  the reason people hate this film and think it's sick is because they too  were disturbed by it. It's definitely not a film to give you a positive  outlook on life, but I guess that's what makes it such an effective horror  film.
