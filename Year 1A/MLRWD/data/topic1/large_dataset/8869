This movie is not for the faint of heart.  It contains wry wit, raw language, raunchy/kinky sex, and a good deal of violence.  It is, however, highly entertaining, and fun to watch if the above mentioned content doesn't offend the viewer.

The main character, Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a washed up hit man whose moral compass has gone way off course.  The very nature of his occupation pumps him with so much energy, that the vices of the normal person do not satisfy.  Therefore, his pleasure seeking leads him down paths upon which an ordinary person would fear to tread. He is extraordinary, to say the least. Pierce Brosnan plays way against type here, putting aside forever the persona of James Bond, 007.  Whereas Bond was the clean-cut hero, Noble is a chain smoking, drunken sexual deviant, who's chance encounter with a travelling salesman triggers a strangely close and moving relationship which enables each to act in ways neither would have imagined possible. Fate steps in to form a friendship between two men from completely opposite worlds that will alter the lives of both forever.

The film is very well written, and all the debauchery aside, very funny and entertaining.
