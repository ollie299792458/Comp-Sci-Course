I went into this movie not knowing very much. I just knew it was an 80's homage film that was shot very independently in Ohio. I bought "The Sleeper" two weeks after it was released.

The director Justin Russell captured everything that was so perfect from 80's horror. Everything from the opening score, the look, and atmosphere. Bravo Mr. Russell.

It's 1981 and the girls of Alpha Gamma Theta sorority are having a party, but an unexpected guest is watching the girls every move. Peering through windows, to even sneaking into the sorority house. This movie definitely pays tribute to the original Black Christmas, John Carpenter's Halloween, Prom Night(dance scene in "The Sleeper" = AWESOME) and The House On Sorority Row. I loved this movie. I really got what Justin Russell did here. It is very obvious that he is a HUGE fan of the genre and it shows in his film.

The acting in "The Sleeper" is very top notch. Mr. Russell did a great job on the casting. All of the girls are likable in their own personal way. The killer in the film looks and acts the part, he reminds me of the killer's from: He Knows You're Alone, and The Slumber Party Massacre. Like both of those killers, he gives the wide-eyed looks, creepy voice, and his overall movements. Actor Jason Crabtree rocked out!

I personally can't wait to see what Justin Russell comes up with next. Death Stop Holocaust which he made before "The Sleeper" is also available now. I am a huge fan of Mr. Russell's work. Keep on doing what your doing Justin!
