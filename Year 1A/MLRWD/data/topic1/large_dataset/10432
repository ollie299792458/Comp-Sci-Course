does play his part to perfection, adding a depth and obcession that Raymond Massey lacks in the 1934 version.  Ian McKellen really is the only actor in this 1985 version who outshines  his 1934 counterpart. Otherwise, Alexander Corda's 1934 production of Scarlet Pimpernel is better. I don't know about the DVD version of Korda's film since I only have a VHS Classic Collections print and that seems to have been butchered when it was transferred to DVD, at least that's what the reviews on Amazon led me to believe.

So, I ordered a DVD of the 1985 Jane Seymore version instead.  Even with costumes and color, silly backstory and 136 minutes of run time, Jane Seymore can not hold a candle to Merle Oberon.  And, Leslie Howard is far better than Anthony Andrews at playing the Scarlet Pimpernel. (Although, if you want to see a "fop" played to perfection, watch Anne's "father" in the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version of Persuasion.)

Too bad it isn't possible to cast Ian McKellen as Chauvelin along side Merle Oberon and Leslie Howard.  Alas, that is the Scarlet Pimpernel DVD version I'd like to find!
