This movie, based on a true story,takes place during WWII, when a Jewish teenager, Soloman escapes death by feigning his identity. He leaves Germany and Poland and sails to Russia, joining a communist school. About two years later, he finds himself in the hands of the Nazi, and escapes by saying he is a pure German. He becomes a translator between the German and Russian troops. Oddly, he ends up joining a Nazi school to save himself.

THroughout this movie, Soloman can be viewed as a brave person and a coward. He conceals the fact that he is Jewish in a Nazi school. However, the fact that he is willing to change his identity rather than fight for his people shows that he is somewhat of a coward, and is willing to do anythnig for his survival. In Europa Europa, it is evident how crazy Nazi idealogy was. In one part of the movie, when Soloman was in the Nazi school, his teacher claims that you can easily identify a Jewish person through the thickness of their head and manner in which they walk. However, everyone fails to recognize that Soloman is Jewish himself.

It was an odd experience watching this movie in my history class, seeing as some scenes were awkward and weren't needed (like one scene in which Soloman is chased around a barn naked). It was somewhat funny that so many German women, and a man, found Soloman so attractive, not even knowing he was Jewish. We further learned about Nazi idealogy and psuedo-science. Throughout the movie, it was clear how lucky Soloman was, to be at the right place at the right time.

Minus a couple disturbing scenes, this drmatic movie was great. It displayed how Nazi idealogy was contradictory and based on psuedo-science. The acting was great, as well.
