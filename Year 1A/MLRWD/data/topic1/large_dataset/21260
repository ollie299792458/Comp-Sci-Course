It may be sadistic, disgusting,and twisted but it is very entertaining and cool to see the horror from the bad guys point of view. The Texas Chainsaw Massacare was definetely a big influence on Writer/Director Rob Zombie because The House of 1000 Corpses resembles all of alot of the classic 1970's horror films. It is about how two young couples hear about a notorius murderer legend named Doctor Satan who lived in the same town that they are visiting. The couples then go out on a mission to get a little more information on him and see a site at where he once was. During their journey they pick up a young woman who is hitch hiking in the rain. Their car breaks down and they are forced to go get help at the hitch hikers house. They meet the woman's very strange family and our freaked out by their seeings. When their car is finally fixed they aren't able to leave because the family won't let them go and they are now being horribly tortured by these sick individuals. This film has alot of gore and some very intresting charecters. The dialogue is also pretty good and has some great moments of suspense. This is a great start to Rob Zombies directorial debut. If your a fan of horror then you will love every moment of this film.
