No extended cut?  Sorry, not interested.  I don't need a dressed up version of the same film I already own, I don't care how nice the box is.  Yes, the documentaries are good, but not enough to make me double-dip for the exact same films.  What's frustrating as a consumer is that I did get the first two Ultimate Editions, and was looking forward to completing the collection of extended cuts.  I know, I know...  The studio gave the directors a chance to re-edit their films, and both directors felt the film that exists was the best cut, ergo no extended cuts are necessary.  Nobody bothered to ask what the FANS actually want.  Crazy thought...  All I have to say is, they better not screw up the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Edition.  Everyone KNOWS that film had a full HOUR of stuff cut, footage that had been COMPLETED with effects and everything.  So, you've got no excuses, WB!  You can still release GREAT editions of Phoenix, Half-Blood, and Hallows, even if you have messed up these two Ultimate Editions...can these sets even be CALLED "Ultimate" when they are exactly the same films sitting in my living room?
