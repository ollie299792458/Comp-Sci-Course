While it was something of a groundbreaker in the late 60s, today "Midnight Cowboy" seems dated, and not just for its phony psychelic party scenes. The sexual revolution rolled on and left this film in its wake. Now the movie seems naive and occasionally grating, especially in its depiction of its homosexual characters. Whether young (like timid teen played by Bob Balaban) or old (the aging man played by Barnard Hughes), they're pitiful, self-loathing creatures just waiting to be bashed. This from a gay man - director John Schlesinger? - it's hard to believe, but those were the mores of the times. (Even "gay" productions of the era - "Boys in the Band," for example - are awash with neurotic queers). The full truth of Joe's troubled sexual past, presented in fevered flashbacks, is also problematic in the screenplay. What saves the film and makes it worthwhile 40 years later are chiefly the solid and detailed performances of Jon Voight as laughable New York hustler Joe Buck and Dustin Hoffman as street-smart con-man Ratso: two men desperately in need of nuturing male figures. They make their own odd couple, and while sex is never even implied, the emotional bond of men in a relationship that transcends mere friendship is there. If Ang Lee had been able to get some of THAT feeling into "Brokeback Mountain," that film would have been a masterpiece. Avoid the old MGM release at all costs - it was struck from dirty film print and you can see specks all over the first couple of reels. That transfer is grainy and the old non-anamorphic widescreen blowup to 16x9 only emphasizes all the transfer problems.
