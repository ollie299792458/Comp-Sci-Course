Although the title is wrong. This movie is actually called "Scrooge" and NOT A Christmas Carol. This 1951 version starring Alastair Sim in the title role, is my favorite version of all time. Much as Sean Connery is the only Bond, Alastair is the only Scrooge for me.
I have collected many versions of this movie from the early VHS days to this new Blue Ray version. I have to say I was very impressed by the print and quality. The Sound is also very good. I have watched a 16mm print of this movie years ago and what always impressed me about that print was the depth and atmosphere created by film and the focus grain being visible. I also noticed on the Blue Ray the same focus grain, which to me just enhances the experience of this classic.

I would recommend this Movie on Blue ray to any potential buyer. As a life long fan of this movie I got just what I wanted, the ultimate version for all time.
Buy it you won't be disappointed.
I have enjoyed reviewing this release and will review more movies if Amazon send me free copies.....
