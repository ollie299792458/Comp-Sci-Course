I spit on your grave is a fun film for fans of Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" and other "Rape/Revenge" classics, There are some elements of this film that are genuinely gruesome, and others that are practically laughable, either way, it's not a bad way to spend 100 minutes of your life, not if your like me anyway. Joe Bob Brigg's commentary on this film is a great treat for anyone who has heard about this picture because of it's controversy, because he does a great job of explaining all of that, and also if your just a big movie buff and want to hear interesting facts about the movie, because that track is chock full of info that is a great addition and Joe bob is pretty entertaining anyway, Meir Zarchi also has a commentary track on this DVD witch is interesting because i had heard that he had kept pretty quiet about this picture since making it, but frankly i was ready to fall asleep about 40 seconds into his track so i can't really say i found it that interesting, all in all "I spit on your grave" is a fun midnight movie for hardcore buffs, and curious horror fans alike.
