I must state upfront that I am an avid Colin Firth fan and have been since "Pride & Prejudice".  I adored him in "The King's Speech".  He was magnificent.  Now you know why I opted to view "Main Street".  Colin Firth.  (And also Orlando Bloom is a lesser draw as well.)

You can imagine my dismay when I realized that Colin Firth was playing a man from Texas with the thickest Texan accent I've heard anywhere *except* Texas.  Orlando's accent was fairly close to some of my friends from North Carolina, but still - it just seemed plain WRONG to hear these speech patterns coming out of their mouths.

Enough about the distractions of speech.

Even if you can overlook a Texan Colin Firth and a Southern Orlando Bloom, there is still a MAJOR problem with this movie.  It never developed and never really finished.

After 30 minutes, I wondered why on earth I was still watching it, but continued on simply because I thought SOMETHING had to happen soon, either in the action or between the characters.  After 45 minutes, nope - nothing.  After 60 minutes, I'm sitting here, banging my head on my desk.  Did they not hire someone to complete the script?!

As the credits scrolled up my screen, I knew I had to write a review to prevent someone from making the same mistake I did - wasting my time and energies trying to figure this thing out.  There *is* no figuring it out.  It just never develops and never ends.  It just stops.

Do yourself a favor - don't waste your time, and, for heaven's sake, don't waste any of your money!
