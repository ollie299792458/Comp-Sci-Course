Opinions about Appaloosa are very mixed.  I watched it on DVD and enjoyed it.  Not the best Western ever but not bad and certainly better than a number of the comic books done over the past 20 years.  I would rate it as good to very good. It is clich&eacute;d but that is part of being true to this genre. Best Westerns ever:  The Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, Ride the High Country, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and the 2010 version of True Grit.  The Shootist, Monte Walsh, Will Penny, The Cowboys, and Bad Company are also good.  The Long Riders and The Assassination of the Outlaw Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are also worthwhile.
I cite the above to give the reader an idea of my taste in films.  I like Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but don't consider them great movies.  I think Once Upon a Time in the West should be seen by anyone interested in western movies.  Tombstone is wild but tiring. I purchased but don't particularly care for Open Range. Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece of film even if it was made for the small box.  Perhaps the best western movie of all time is Lonely are the Brave (also known as the Brave Cowboy) but it is a modern western like Hud.  Hombre is one of the best adaptations of an Elmore Leonard story and almost any of the movies based on Leonard's stories or novels is worth watching.
So in my opinion, Appaloosa is good but not great.
