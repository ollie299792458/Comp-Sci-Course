Just like the name says, it is a fast paced movie with some furious driving and acting.  The main reason that I like the movie is it aint like most action movies like XXX, it actually has a solid storyline and acting behind it.  Vin Diesel (playing as Dominic Toretto) makes his action-packed debut in this awesome movie.  He is the best racer out there, well he has this rival named Johnny Tran.  Both of them are very good, but nobody really knows which one is better.  Well they were out to find out who is the best as both of them are think they are the greatest at what they do.  Also, Paul Walker plays the part of the new guy in town who thinks he is just as good as Vin Diesel and Johnny Tran.  And he is sure that he is going to prove it in just a matter of time.  But what's this guy's secret?  Your going to have to watch the movie to find out!  He was great accompiant for the flick.  These guys live for speed, racing in these amazing cars.  Also, the races take place in the greatest city in the world- Los Angelas.  Basically if you are a fan of racing-action-high speed movies this one may wind up being your favorite.  It is definately my favorite of this genre.  There are many high paced, dangerous stunts performed in this movie.  Can you handle something going at this speed?  Go out, pick up this movie, and find out today!  Additionally, one more thing, JA RULE is in this movie for ya'll who don't know!  That is another plus for a reason to pick this up.  I'm outta hear, aiight? Take care.  HOLLA!
