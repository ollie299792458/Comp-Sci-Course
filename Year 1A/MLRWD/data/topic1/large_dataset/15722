One of the most important DVD's released, for the fact that it changed the movie completely!  I knew that Disturbing was good...yet missing something...and this DVD delivers more than any others I own. Talk about a  butcher (read Jeff's review)! How the hell a studio can do this to a movie  is frightening! Talk about cutting any real character development and some  awesomely acted scenes from all three mains. What really made me furious  was the fact that a 20 second scene was cut, which makes the movie make  sense: I'll explain - the mother finds Gavin's gun under Steve's bed and  THEREFORE signs him up for the program! (Because his brother killed himself  with a gun). Without this scene it has NO real Depth!  And Jeff(reviewer) i  agree, like 54(which hasn't got the removed scenes which is SO deserved)  this movie has butchered by the pathetic Studio's who really don't know  what they are doing!  (obviously shows!)
Any how...great DVD (picture and  audio GREAT!) And new cheap price!  BUY NOW!
