What a joke. Before I trash this movie let me just say the only thinkg keeping this from 1 star is the interesting idea to use real backrounds with the CGI characters. I can't tell if it was an act of genious or lazyness. But either way it came out pretty good. 
Now for the reason it got 2 stars. Disney has sunk to an all time low. Not only have they made a silly attempt to copy the success of Pixar films, but they went so far as to shamelessly rip off The Land Before Time. I mean, they didn't even try to make the story original. The opening scene copies the opening scene in the TLBT almost directly. What's worse is that I went into the theatre expecting this to be the best movie ever. I came out wanting to throw up from digust of this trash. I thought the whole movie was going to be like the promo trailer and nobody would talk. It would just be a visual art piece. But then I heard them talk and I was appalled. Another thing that drove me crazy was the fact that a lot of the characters just weren't lovable. I'm going to spoil something right now. 80% OF THAT MONKEY FAMILY DIES AND THE REMAINING DON'T CARE AT ALL!! Sure they cry for one second then they just go back to being comic relief. It's just not a good movie and I can't recomend it.
