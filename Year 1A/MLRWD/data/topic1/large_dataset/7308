These R&H films are enjoyable presentations of great musicals, and I won't disagree with any of the more detailed positive comments about them.

But I do wish that the first version of State Fair, from 1933, had been included.  It's currently unavailable on DVD, and really deserves to be more widely known.  While it's not an R&H musical -- which I guess gave the '62 Pat Boone musical re-make an edge for inclusion here -- it's probably the most accurate screen production of the best-selling novel by Phil Stong.  With Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, and Lew Ayres as the stars, and a very low-key, gentle sense of humor that brings out the warmth of the story, I'm sure that many would see it as the real inspiration for the excellent R&H musical film from a dozen years later.  Heck, the 1933 film even includes extensive background shots of the actual Iowa State Fair, although I don't think the stars were photographed on location.  (Frankly, I could live without the Pat Boone version, which unaccountably transfers the state fair from its Iowa origin to Texas, although I do like Tom Ewell and Alice Faye very much.)

I hope that Fox will soon release State Fair (1933) -- perhaps as part of the highly anticipated (by me, anyway) third Will Rogers box set.
