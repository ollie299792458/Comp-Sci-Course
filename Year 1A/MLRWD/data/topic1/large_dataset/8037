Many have criticized this story for being too twisted and mean-spirited but I find it to be a dark-humored gem. Not only is Colin Baker at his best but we also get to see Patrick Troughton's 2nd Doctor back in action. He gets to stretch and be involved in scenarios and characterizations that he never would have been able to in his own late-60s run. The viewer is just expected to ignore the fact that both he and Frazier Hines are about 20 years older than they should be, although I'm sure someone in Who fandom has concocted a rationalization for this. Once you get past that, his performance is pure pleasure. It makes you wish that he had been able to participate in more of the, relatively, sophisticated storylines of 70s and 80s Who.  Since they're in sunny Spain, Colin Baker also gets to take off his ridiculous frock coat for long periods of time which increases his Doctor's credibility, within the confines of the show, by about 1000%.  The whole Androgum storyline is a hoot and the Sontarans are back. Can't ask for much more than that.
