It's been a long time coming.  The greatest peformer of the 20th century has recently split with his wife, in a few months he'll play Madison Square Gardon (4 shows in 3 days, 2 on CD), he will perform for the world via satellite (the first to do so) in less than a year and in Cleveland he was described as a black studded tornado.  This is not Las Vegas.  While I love the Vegas shows, this is a whole different world.  City after city, no days off, sometimes 2 shows in a day.  The voice is more powerful than previous.  Sure, the filming was not that great and at times the audio was a little weak.  But where else can you find Elvis performng in 1972?  1972, regarded as the year Elvis peaked.  This is just a small glimpse of Elvis, but it's the only good one we have.  One can not watch and listen to "You gave me a mountain" or "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" without realizing he was blessed with an abundance of raw talent, the kind we may never see again.  He knew what he was doing.  So ignore the film work and enjoy the greatest performer you will ever see.  The King of Rock and Roll.
