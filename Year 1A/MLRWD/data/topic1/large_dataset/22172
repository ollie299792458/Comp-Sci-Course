Okay, first things first: If you loved Simon Pegg's movies SEAN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, then you'll enjoy SPACED. If not - then it's still an intriguingly funny, if flawed, look at young adults forming families of choice as opposed to families of birth while trying to make it in the arts. Be advised, though - it's very much what the British call a "post-watershed" show (that means they drop the F-bomb repeatedly, openly drink and use drugs socially, and engage in casual sex), so it's not for anyone under 16.

Pegg plays Tim, an aspiring comic book artist who's just broken up w/his live-in girlfriend and needs to find a place to live. Jessica Hynes (here under her maiden name "Jessica Stevenson") plays Daisy, an equally-aspiring journalist desperate to get out of her squatter's flop. They meet, they agree to pretend to be a couple in order to rent a reasonably-priced apartment for an eccentric landlady...and this is where the series DOESN'T go where you'd expect it to. Tim and Daisy, though they become close friends, NEVER become lovers, nor is there any hint they ever will, as the series becomes about their (often surreal) interactions with their friends and neighbors, and the friends' and neighbors' interactions with each other.

But enough of the regular sitcommy stuff - what about the wacky pop culture references? Oh, Pegg and Stevenson bring it there - in spades! Seems nobody can have a conversation with, or about, each other without referencing some movie, comic, television show or videogame - and the series mercilessly rips into horror movies, zombie films, SAY ANYTHING, performance art, porn, cop shows, war epics....

Again, if you're a Simon Pegg fan you'll love it - if not, watch it for how series writers Pegg and Hynes bring out the often-artless attempts of self-absorbed creative people to reach out to one another in love and friendship.
