This is, I believe, one of John Candy's better films he's starred in. Same goes for Steve Martin. Absolutely hilarious film about a traveling marketing agent (Martin) who starts out in NY City during a business meeting and has to get home to Chicago in time for his family's Thanksgiving dinner. Along the way, he keeps getting detoured to different parts of the country via plane, train, and automobile (as well as other means of transportation) by none other than Del Griffith (Candy). At the beginning of the movie, he meets Del Griffith, the shower curtain ring salesman who is a slob in both dress and manner, and who unintentionally keeps messing up Martin's plans on getting back to Chicago. Many will know this movie by its popular phrase "those aren't pillows!" Absolutely funny movie.

The reason I gave this a 4/5 stars is due to the one scene where Martin drops the F bomb about 18 times in under a minute, expressing his misfortune to the car rental woman. I believe that if this film didn't have that scene, it would only be rated PG-13 instead of R. Other than that, there's no sexual scenes (unless you count the scene where a young couple is smooching violently on the bus for a few seconds) and so I think this movie is pretty decent if you know where to 'fast forward'. There are other mildly crude words spoken by Candy and Martin, but it's not so dirty that it's every other sentence. Overall, this movie has quite a charming story that ends pretty slow paced, but wraps up nicely with Martin and Candy resolving their differences by being kind to each other and being sincere about it. Great music, funny comedy, and loveable characters, this is one film you'll want to watch every Thanksgiving.
