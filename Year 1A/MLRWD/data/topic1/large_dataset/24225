This movie is really excellent, I am not just another fan who gives it a good rating just because of the action and the gore, I actually look at the whole picture.  The acting was quite good, and so were visual effects.  I think that the movie lacked slightly in the story, and it wasn't as hard hitting as I expected, but it still was entertaining, made you think, and was never boring.  Excluding maybe 15 minutes in the middle, this is not as much as a horror movie as the first one.  This one has a lot more action, and a lot less tension, so if your looking for a horror movie to scare you, this would not be your best option.  If you enjoy martial arts, action, and all around coolness however, you will enjoy this movie.  Another great aspect to this movie was the soundtrack, it contained many adrenaline boosting songs, and really added to the movie.  If you are into action, rock music, big guns, an interesting story, and you don't mind violence/gore, then you will definately enjoy this movie.  A real must-see.
