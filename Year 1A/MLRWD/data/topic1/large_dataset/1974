Whether you are aware or not, like it or not, the mainstream middle eastern media carries stories and images which denounce the west and encourage radical behavior on a daily basis.  Obsession exposes the slanted middle eastern media and the agenda of the Islamists who encourage their people to hate and kill non-muslims (aka kafirs or infidels) - much of it though lies and disinformation to people whom have little to no real education, outside information or reason to distrust their leaders.  These are people who have been brainwashed since birth to believe only what their religion tells them to believe... or else.  The video exposes Imams, Shieks, Muftis and other Islamic leaders who preach this hate against the west and drive their followers on an agenda of world domination, all while they collect money, enslave their women and live the good life.  Commentary is provided by terrorism experts and ex-muslims who are forced to live in hiding for fear of their lives.  I highly recommend this video to people who want to learn about what's going on in the world right now.  For a more in depth look at the history of the overall situation, please consider this excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037541486X">The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11</a> - You will learn a lot about the history of their motivation and hatred of western culture.

Also, a note to the person who's review is entitled "a film for the ingorant."  In fact, it is that person that is ignorant as the evidence and footage displayed in this film are genuine and would be very difficult to discount or dispute.  How anyone can claim "ignorance" in the face of that evidence is beyond reason and common sense.
