I've been following Jillian's workouts for about 5-6 months now and was getting a bit tired of 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and Six-Week Six Pack. Don't get me wrong, they are all fabulous and I love them, I was just ready for a change. I decided I would go with No More Trouble Zones to get a more involved strength workout. I really had no idea what I was in for. This workout is TOUGH and will leave you feeling fatigued, yet exhilarated. I was sore for a full 5 days after doing this workout, and keep in mind I've been working out consistently for several months. This is quite a long workout, and lasts about an hour including warmup and cooldown. I really like how the circuits are designed and how when you feel like you can't go on any longer, Jillian changes up the move and gives your tired muscles a break - without letting you stop completely. Her use of active recovery is brilliant. Yes, the music kind of sucks, and yes, her assistants are too cheesy and don't look like they're working hard at all. Use your own music and ignore those girls in the back and you'll be set. I have already seen fantastic results and feel so much stronger. PLUS, if you have knee problems, THIS might be a good workout for you. Ripped in 30/30 Day Shred were both starting to wear on my knees a bit, and since I have given those a rest and switched to NMTZ, my knees feel great. For the past two weeks I have been alternating between NMTZ and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and I feel greater than ever. You can make them as short or as long as you want to, but I would urge you to push yourself and go as far as you can. Start with 1 circuit and work your way up if you need to. This is an incredible workout, and I strongly suggest you check it out if you want to change up and challenge your fitness routine.
