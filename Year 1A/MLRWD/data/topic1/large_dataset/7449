I can't wait to own this movie! I saw the preview while attending another movie. I thought it looked like it might be fun. So I asked my boyfriend if we might be able to see it. He wasn't really up for the idea of seeing what he thought to be a silly animated kids movie. I own a retail store where we sell fantasy gifts and jewelry. Dragon related items being among them. I love dragons and always try to have the coolest ones. I really wanted to see this movie. My boyfriend finally said... "If you really want to see it we'll go." I really don't ask for much. This I wanted. Without giving anything away, at one point in the movie I got a little teary eyed. My boyfriend noticed,  leaned over and whispered in my ear, Me too. The movie was great! At the end, I kid you not!
My boyfriend said.... "That was a wonderful movie! I'm so glad we came." The story was interesting and entertaining enough for adults. The animation was amazing! So even if children of a very young age couldn't quite follow the story,  they could still very much enjoy the colorful characters and action. I would highly recommend this movie, and I feel safe in saying so would my boyfriend. We are both in our late forties, and still very young.
