I would like to put in my two penny worth or as you yanks say two cents worth. They have been numerous reviews on the DVD version, all complaining about the same matter - Why MGM did not issue the full 202 mins version?.  The John Wayne (God bless his sole) Alamo has always been my all time movie. As a fourteen year old lad in 1960, I had the privilage of shaking John's hand at the London Premier and even remember John giving our good old queen bess a saddle as a gift. Surely this DVD deserves the full directors cut and cannot understand why this version was not put to DVD in the first place. Is it possible that MGM will issue the full version on DVD at a latter date in order that we pay for the DVD that is currently on offer and that pay for the full version. I will keep the Full VHS version and only play the documentary on the DVD which l rate 5 stars. Does anyone out there know if the full version will be available? COME ON MGM - You should be ashamed of yourselves. Remember the Alamo.
