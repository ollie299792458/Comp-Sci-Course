The movie Kundun is based on a true story of a young boy that was discovered and thought to be the 14th Dalai Lama. There was a test given toKundun to prove his purpose after he succeded they moved him and his family to Lhasa. After the boy was removed from his homeland the monks raised him as the re3incarnation of Budda, the most powerful leader in Tibet. It was interesting to see how a young Kundun, just fourteen was conventially appointed to the throne as the Chinese invasion began. The Chinese had wanted Tibet to become a part of them but the people refused.  The movie contiounes through his growth into adulthood and displays the trials he is faced with alomg the way. The whole story was revolved around Kundun's and the Tibet people before and during the invasion of their country. Eventually the Dalai Lama had to flee to India and live in exile for the rest of his life.I have never watched "Seven Years in Tibet" completely through however what I have seen is similar to "Kundun" . All in all the movie seem to be a good movie for the whole family. Although there may be some scenes that small children would have a problem with. The way the young child grew and took respondsiblity for his country which had suffering, showed the courage that different culture take.  The information I have obtained from the chapter on Buddism has opened my eyes to the different beliefs and their reactions to stressfull situations. It seems our country does not have the confidence to stick by our own beliefs.
