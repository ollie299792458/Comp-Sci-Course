I came into this film with absolutely no expectations.  I watched it solely on the fact that two of my favorite actors took the starring roles.  From the opening shot, I was mesmerized by the incredibly beautiful cinematography and direction.  I will be checking out more of Lars Van Triers' work, you can count on that!  Every shot amazing and haunting.  The first half hour sets-up the conditions for what appears to be a portrait of a tragedy.  Then...the film evolves into a manifestation of penance and self mutilation that takes guilt to a whole other level.  Even though we wouldn't think we would ever get to that point, you understand the reasoning for the violence and the possibility that it very well could happen. You will cover your eyes a few times, but the script pulls you back to see if there is any absolution.  Does it come? Watch it and see.  Incredibly disturbing at times, I was hypnotized by Ms. Rampling's acting range.  I loved her and I wanted to kill her. Willem Defoe holds up his end with incredible verve.  I consider this "a must see" film.  As David Lynch once said, "There's a lot of beauty in the dark gritty places of the world."
