If you love Conan O'brien and you love his wacky charecters that come on his show like The masterbating Bear,Preperation H Larry,The constipated Robot...etc you will LOVE this dvd! I've show this amazing dvd to friends that only know Trimph from the lawsuit W/pets.com sock puppet and about 5 min in they are laughing so hard they are in literal tears!

I grew up wathing Conan since I was in high school and I love the show very much. I'm really happy and excited that they actually put this out. If you like Trumph on the show you will love the highlights of him humping people's legs,humping dogs@the dogshows,insulting Al Roker,Conan,Andy Rickter,Katy Lee Gifford(b*tch),and really laying into the Star Wars Geeks as they wait in line to see one of the Star Wars movies.This my friends is the best possible representation I can imagine when I think of Triumph's career best of DVD it's got everything and anything you would ever want to see and then there's some,"extra poop" that is almost almost better than the actual retrospective! This is one of my favorite DVD'S in my collection, it's one of those dvd's you can watch over and over with friends and even YOU discover new funny as hell things you missed before!! All round *****'s (5 stars)
