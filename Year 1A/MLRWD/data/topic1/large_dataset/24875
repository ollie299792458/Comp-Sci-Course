IN WHAT FILM DID THE CHARACTER DESCRIBED BELOW APPEAR IN?

We have a gruffy but handsome young man from the wrong side of the tracks, he has no mother, has a disconnected relationship with his father, has a cocky attitude, wishes like hell to become a Naval officer, somehow the kid makes it into naval officer training, while there he and his African-American training commander seem to hate each others guts and in fact wind up fighting each other, gets disgusted and threatens to quit naval officer training. in the end, the character surprises the viewer by showing up just in time to let us know he is now a changed man and re-dedicated to his naval career. End of film.

Hey,I know what film that was....AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, with Richard Gere and Debra Winger, of course.....WRONG Mr. MaGoo, the film is "ANNAPOLIS"  Annapolis may not have been touted as a remake of An Officer and a Gentleman" but this is exactly what it is, and an extremely poor remake at that. Its not even worth the trip to the video rental store, let alone the four bucks to rent it and then having to take it back. Buy the real thing, An Officer and a Gentleman.
