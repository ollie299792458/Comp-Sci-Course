If you happen to like "magic" that insults your intelligence, then this is for you.  It's sensationalist claptrap for the most of it, relying on a variety of misdirecting dialogue and behavior rather than anything truly skillful in the way of "magic".

For instance, there was the tesla coil episode.  Sheesh.  First they show you previews of an ambulance, and Chris being carted away on a gurney.  That gets you thinking that something will happen.  It "sets the stage" visually and mentally and makes it easier for the observer to believe the load of bull he's going to try to hand you next.

Then he dons a mesh protective suit and then lets the Tesla operator ramp up the coil enough for a nice big spark-over in excess of about 3 or 4 feet long.  He takes the bolts easily in the suit because that's what the suit does:  It directs the current and voltage through the mesh suit to the ground rather than through your body.

Now here's the "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" moment.  Angel then lifts one foot off the ground long enough for a few sparks to become visible between the bottom of his foot to the ground.  (This is completely and utterly painless and NORMAL in the suit he was wearing!), but he feigns electrical injury; they shut off the coil, and cart him off to the hospital.

I have a couple of friends who are the creators of the now famous singing Tesla Coils on YouTube (see Masters of Lightning, and Dr. Zeus), and though I'm not an engineer, even I could tell his whole act was a total fakeup.  Lame, lame, lame.  Not believable at all.  After that episode, I never watched another one.  Couldn't stomach being insulted.

Buy this only if you like a fluff performance.  But don't think too hard about it or even more of his act will come apart.
