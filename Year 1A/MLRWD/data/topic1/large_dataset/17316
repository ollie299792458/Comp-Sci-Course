I will admit, I have yet to be at a concert for over a decade.  Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and when I saw this DVD come out, I was thrilled.  From the beginning, I was on my feet in front of my television for a good two hours experiencing the phenemonal energy flow through my blood while watching Coldplay Live and browsing its features.  This concert was energetic and lucid.  Though it was basically the band playing their music within a huge light show, the atmosphere just seemed so much alive.  I was impressed more so when they got deeper into their show as it seemed the band itself became more alive and the energy reflected off of them onto the fans.  This is truly a remarkable collection to own, especially if you are a Coldplay fan.  It also includes 2 new songs, which are not too bad, but I'll leave that for you to judge.  I would strongly recommend purchasing this DVD/CD.  The energy produced will flow into your stream of blood quickly and will add vivid colors into your imagination!  If money is an issue, try getting this burned.  If you are not a huge fan of Coldplay, but still enjoy their music from time to time, try borrowing this DVD and check it out.  (My favorite performance was when they did the song "Yellow" :&gt; )
