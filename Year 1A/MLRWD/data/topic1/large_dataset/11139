They say people ran screaming out of the theatres when this movie was first shown back in the 30s.  What they don't tell you is that this is not a horror movie.  This movie is actually intended to show real freaks in real life; the story plot is probably the most unrealistic part of the movie, even though it's standard soap opera and you might even watch this same plot on TV today.
What makes this movie interesting isn't the plot, it's the actors, or I should say the people acting out the story.  Because most of them aren't really acting.  The leading villainess is probably an actor, I don't know.  And there are probably a few other real actors here.  But most of the "actors" are real freaks: the pinheads, the midgets, the siamese twins, the human torso.  The pinheads don't need to act out their confusion and inarticulation; it's real.  The midgets don't have to act out their social isolation.  The siamese twins don't have to act out their physical and mental fusion.  And the human torso doesn't have to practice lighting a cigarette with no arms and no legs to make it look real.
Because these "actors" are real freaks.  And, more importantly, they are real human beings.  Which is why the title "Freaks" is so ironic; this is a movie about human beings who also happen to be freaks.  
Seventy years ago, people ran away screaming because they didn't want to believe it was real, and this movie was banned for a long time.  Today, I'd like to think that people watching this movie have more understanding about the real message in this movie, that a human freak is not just a freak, but a human being also.
This is not a horror movie.  And it's not an exploitation movie.  It's in a category all by itself.  It will fascinate you and repell you, and hopefully make you think.
