This film by Martin Scorcese is quite simply the most underrated and underappreciated film in existence today. It is the comedic story of one man stuck in an excruciating cycle of mishaps and strange occurences on a single night in the SoHo district of New York. But the film is not merely a well-concocted comedy. It is the story of human existence on Earth, exemplified in the life one one man and his travails on a fateful night. The story begins with Paul (Griffin Dunne) in his office, anxiously awaiting his escape from the monotony of the work day. That night, he goes out just to "have a little fun," only to find that eventually, all he really wants is to get back to the safe harbor of work.  Throughout the film, Paul keeps saying that he wants to go "home." In the end, we see what he means as the pearly white gates of his office complex swing open, and Paul, all white and angelic (and/or dead)-looking enters with relief. What was out in the world for him? Excitement? Yes. But also trouble. Pain and suffering, and the feeling that the whole world was out to get him. Ever feel like that?  This movie works so well on both levels, plot and thematic, that the latter is nearly forgotten or unnoticed by the average viewer. Perhaps someday this film will be recognized for being, while not perfect, one of the most meaningul comedies ever made.
