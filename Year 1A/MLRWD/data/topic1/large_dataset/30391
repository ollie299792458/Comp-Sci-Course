I hope to never forget the feeling I had leaving the downtown theater in small town Rochester, Michigan after seeing this movie during it's first run in '77. My only experience w/ "Woody Allen" movies was seeing  "Sleeper" on CBS earlier. I think I was expecting a similarly  flavored excursion down slap-stick, sight-gag lane. Instead, my date and I  found ourselves floating down the sidewalks, trying to recall to each other  scenes that impacted us the most. We both knew we had experienced something  special, something that would hold us together like a bond through  time.
Today when I think of scenes that exemplify the film, I immediately  recall two narratives from Allen, one near the beginning, the other at the  end.
In the first, Woody is describing two older, Jewish Ladies  complaning about their food at a resort in the Catskills. "Oh, the  food.... it was terrible!" stated the one Lady. "And such small  portions!" cried the other. Woody used this as a comparison to life in  saying, "It's cruel, maddening, frustrating...., and it's all over too  quickly!"
During the films final moments, Allen tells the joke about  a man in a Psychiatrist's office telling the Doctor about his Brother who  thinks he's a chicken. When the Doctor asks him if he's done anything to  correct his Brother, he said "no." When the Doctor asks why not,  the man answers, "because I need the eggs."  It seems that  regardless of how illogical and untrue "true love" often is, we  still feel the need to persue it.
Yea, life and love is a bitch, but  ain't it grand.
