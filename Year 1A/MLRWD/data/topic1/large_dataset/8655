After the disappearance of her father who has been dealing with illegal drug activities, 17-year old Ree Dolly who lives in the Ozark mountains has to take on the role as head of the family and look after her sick mother and two younger siblings. Her neighbors and relatives offer her some help, but when Ree starts questioning the members of the small community about her father's whereabouts she is faced with a wall of lies and secrecy.

Independent filmmaker Debra Granik's second feature film, after her directorial debut "Down to the Bone" (2004), is an adaptation of a Daniel Woodrell novel with the same name from 2006, and gives a realistic depiction of an American highland community where the residents are scared to silence by an extensive underworld of illegal met-amphetamine labs. With a camera that tracks every move the main character makes and a persuasive linear narrative, Debra Granik has created a thrilling and unpredictable social crime drama with a lurking mood and a credible story co-written by Anne Rosellini. The overall acting is good and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Lawrence who previously appeared in Guillermo Arriaga's "The Burning Plain" (2008) is exceptional in her second lead role as a young woman struggling to save her family from being victimized by her father's criminal actions. This is a fine piece of American film where the main focus rests on the characters, the milieu and the story.
