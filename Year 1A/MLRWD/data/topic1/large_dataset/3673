Michael Caine stars as simmering London gangster Jack Carter in the gritty 1971 British noir type action flick "Get Carter".  Caine's character, in a departure from his usual portrayals, displays a vicousness that he pulls off rather well in this noteworthy film.  Filmed in some of the seamier locations of both London and Newcastle, the movie exposes some of the slimy underbelly of the English underworld.

Caine when learning of his brothers "accidental" death feels compelled to attend the funeral up north in Newcastle.  Against the advice of his London boss he's determined to find out what exactly happened.  After disembarking the train he took, he immediately gets the idea that his presence isn't welcome in Newcastle.  Despite warnings to subsist in his investigation he eventually learns the details of how his brother's niece was lured into the local pornography trade.  The measured Caine's temper begins quickly percolationg as he sets out on a violent trail of vengeance against those responsible.  The local crime boss Kinnear played by John Osbourne, the man culpable, orders Caine's elimination.

As is typical for these types of crime dramas, in the end justice is served.
