This is by far my favorite Tyler Perry movie. The acting is good, the characters are believable (well, apart from Boris Kodjoe- I mean please- who would turn that down!)and the story-lines are great. I especially enjoy the way the mother-daughter interractions between the main characters play out in the film. I watch this when I need something funny but at the same time deep and uplifting.This movie covers quite a lot and at the center of it is Madea who is funny as hell. After awhile you forget it's Tyler Perry in drag- the character is so good. It takes on a whole life of its own-funny and outrageous, yet real and down to earth somehow- with a lot of wisdom to offer. Some serious themes are touched upon and at the heart of it is a great moral (for everyone). The only problem with this movie is that I want to reach into the television screen and knock Blair Underwood's character out. LOL. Oh, and Lyn Whitfield's too. No, but seriously-Tyler Perry always aims to please and he definately delivers here.
