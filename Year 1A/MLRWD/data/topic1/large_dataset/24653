If you're not sure which to buy, I recommend the Blu-ray over the original DVD release.  Comparing the Blu-ray resolution to the DVD is like night and day.  This one will get repeated viewings without a doubt; the older DVD was viewed only ONCE years ago after being so disappointed with the quality, so bad that it was no better than a standard over-the-air broadcast.

I bought this along with numerous other Blu-rays through Amazon, trying to finally get some of my favorites updated to Blu-ray, and found one interesting anomaly with two of my movies, both Paramount.  This one and DEEP IMPACT were apparently resealed for some reason with cheaper shrinkwrap and a portion of the older security stickers still left on the cases; the white strip was gone, but some of the clear plastic still remained.  And, I noticed the back of the cases had newer copyrights of 2010 despite both of these Paramounts having been released in 2008 and 2009.  Does Amazon sell resealed Blu-ray or is this Paramount's doing?  There were no obvious fingerprints on either.
