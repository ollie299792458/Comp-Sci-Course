The Forbin Project has just come out on DVD and I highly recommend it. The DVD is in full screen and I know many film purists insist that Wide screen is the only way to go, but I disagree ; big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen drive me to distraction. The movie has a slight grain to it but overall the quality is not bad, certainly it's much better than my old VHS tape. However it wouldn't have killed them to include a few extras, at least they could have included a scene selection on the menu, if there was a menu and there isn't one.

But these complaints are just quibbles, the movie is 35 years old now but it's still the most intelligent and accurate portrayal of Artificial Intelligence ever put on film. In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made, without a doubt it is the most underrated movie ever made. Be warned however this film will scare you; there is no blood or gore and the special effects are primitive by modern standards, but if The Forbin Project does not scare your brain then you have not understood it.

This is one of the very rare occasions when the movie is better, much much better, than the book. When I read the book years ago I remember thinking the premise was great and with a few changes it could be really great, but as it is the book is mediocre at best. With genius you wouldn't expect B grade moviemakers to have they kept all the brilliant parts and eliminated all the stupid parts. This movie has stood the test of time extraordinarily well, it's a gem.
