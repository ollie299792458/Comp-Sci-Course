Bill Murray has dynamite timing, excellent acting skills, as does everyone else who played a role in this movie esp. the actor that played the dead "Spencer" sitting in the chair and had to sit through a few takes with his eyes open, looking dead. Thankfully they gave the guy "blink breaks". Excellent movie! Makes you laugh out loud! The part I laughed the most almost to the point of tears was when Bill Murray's character is tied to a chair with "Lori" and he starts having an allergy attack and he's sitting there trying to clear his nose through snorting, and sniffing and making hilarious noises. In the commentary the director says that that's Bill doing his own "snorting". (I guess there had been some questions from people watching the movie) and that this scene had to have quite a few takes because the cast and crew were laughing so much. I loved this movie. If you need a comedy pick-me-up this is worth buying and watching again and again!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734796">The Man Who Knew Too Little</a>
