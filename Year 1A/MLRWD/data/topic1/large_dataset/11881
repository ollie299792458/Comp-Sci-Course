The story of Master Ip is quite the tale and I for one enjoyed it. Though the master does not go through what others may see as character development, one can cheer that he remains a man of integrity inspite of circumstance says volume of a man's character.

But that's not what I'm excited about for this movie and I won't pretend either. It's the fights, the choreography and level was amazing. And in the past years where most kung fu movies have your fighters defying gravity and physics, Ip Man does the opposite. Up to a point where the Master unleashes his skills with such ferocity does not make me cheer but stand there in awe at the raw power. Donnie Yen has outdone himself here. One nitpick is the climatic fight of the film...could have easily been the first fight of the film because it really didn't add anything other than how strong Master Ip really was.

All in all, I enjoyed the film for what it brought and I loved it. Though on the dvd product, the case is pretty flimsy and that should be worked on especially in closing the case with the assurance it's not about to pop open.
