This movie was well done for a smaller budget movie. Showing the viewer both sides of what ended up being one of the greastest rivalries of the 20th century. I think this movie focuses a bit more on Apple than Microfsoft. Noah Wylie as Steve Jobs gives an impressive performance showing the renegade side of Jobs as well as the cold, calculating man that along with his brillance as a leader has made Steve Jobs what he is today. Anthony Michael Hall does well as Bill Gates, the seemingly goofy, nerd that beneath the surface holds an even more cunning genius towards buiness, which just happened to be personal computing. The movie follows them from their humble beginnings through their monumental efforts to design and sell personal computing in different forms to a world that thought computers were only for engineers and businesses.
