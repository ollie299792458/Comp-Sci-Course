My kids are very indulged as they are the only grandchildren from a family of 4 uncles and 5 aunts.  They are gifted all the movies as they hit the market.  Many are still in their plastic wrap because my kids are so active it is rare they sit down in front of the TV.  I bought Meet the Letters after reading reviews in one of my favorite homeschooling magazines.  I was pregnant, very tired, and feeling like I was neglecting my toddler especially since I had started propping him in front of the TV.  Meet the Letters is his favorite video and within two weeks he knew his Uppercase and Lowercase letters.  I could not believe it!  I bought the rest of the family (numbers, colors, shapes)and he faithfully watched them while I dealt with his new baby brother and homeschooled his big sister.  In two weeks more he learned all his numbers, shapes, and colors, and still loves watching the films at least twice a day.  I now purchase these for all toddlers birthday's!  If you only plan to buy one video, educational or simply for it's entertainment value, this is the one to buy.
