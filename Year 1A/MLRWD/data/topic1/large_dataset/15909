Early on in the movie Conan's father, played by William Smith, speaks a line that just about sums up the whole movie. It goes something like this: there's but one thing in this world you can trust "... not men, not women, not beasts,... (he looks down at the sword he has just completed and says,) "this you can trust."
That line send chills down my spine everytime I hear it. Conan's mother is played by the achingly beautiful Nadiuska; it breaks my heart every time James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom cuts her head off.
Conan speaks very few lines in this the movie that made Schwarzenegger a superstar. Sandahl Bergman and Gerry Lopez, Conan's compatriots in the movie are quite good but sadly did little of note after this movie. Sandahl Bergman's fight scenes near the end of the movie (as they escape Thulsa Doom's Mountain of Power with the princess) reminded me of Trinity fighting the cops at the begining of the Matrix. There are parallels with Gladiator too. The scenes of gladiatoral combat are perfunctory and on a much smaller scale than in the Russell Crowe epic. 
There must be something about the ways the male mind is wired that there are few cinematic experiences as satisfying as a good revenge fantasy. This movie, along with Gladiator, Chato's Land , Death Wish, Valdez is Coming and Mr. Majestyk is one of the premier examples of the revenge genre.
Basil Poledouris score is excellent. More than just background music, the score becomes an important character in the movie, swelling to a frantic pace in the fight scenes and setting a lighthearted tone at other points
It is amazing to think that Robert E. Howard created such a fascinating fantasy world despite never having left the environs of his small Texas town and  having died at such a young age.
