This follow-up spectacular to "The Poseidon Adventure" is truly horrific in spots in its depiction of the fiery ends of some of the minor characters.  This is definitely not a movie for younger children as it may terrify them - but then, on the other hand give them a healthy respect for stringent fire safety.

The special effects are awesome and this was the era before CGI and other advanced computer techniques.  The mastery of the special effects team is admirable, to say the least, and ALL of the effects are convincing.  The miniatures are realistic and believable and the fire effects makes one wonder how all the actors got through the film without major mishap.

Faye Dunaway floats through her scenes in a gown that reveals everything but her nether regions and she seems to be in some sort of trance or drug-induced coma - all acting, of course.  Richard Chamberlain is convincing as a slimeball husband and subcontractor for the building of the world's tallest building and his ending is not gruesome enough for me.

The lead actors - Newman and McQueen - are outstanding and entirely convincing as architect and fire chief respectively.  It was quoted by one of the above that after making this movie he would never stay at a hotel or live in a condominium or apartment above the fourth floor - perhaps wise words.

The extras are exhaustive but really give a sense of the dedication and consummate artistry that went into the making of this ground-breaking disaster epic.  They may remake it again with a plethora of CGI effects and even more gruesome deaths by fire but this classic will never be surpassed.

I like the inclusion of "Lobby Cards" and an exhaustive booklet on the making of the movie plus the other extras included.

This movie is a tribute to the grandiose film-making talents of Irwin Allen and in his genre he equals Cecil B. DeMille.
