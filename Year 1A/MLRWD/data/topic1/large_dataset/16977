...as soon as Charade was over I had to get online and share my thoughts.  I enjoy Hitchcock quite a bit and was expecting a suspense film like some of his movies, but honestly, I enjoyed Charade more than anything Hitchcock gave us.  Charade equals Hitchcock in terms of character development, suspense, and romance, but easily outdoes him in the comedy department.  This movie is really funny!  You should be aware that the Madacy label DVD has about 4 hours of material on it, so don't expect a very clear picture; it's all very compressed.  It includes the 1953 version of "Charade" with James Mason (a movie I'd never heard of and still haven't watched yet).  I appreciate a bonus feature, but I wonder if all this compression has led to the occasional fluctuation in volume.  That's right, sometimes the volume dropped right in mid-sentence!  "DVD's aren't supposed to do that," you say, but that's what happens when you jam extra stuff onto a disc.  I notice there's a "Criterion Collection" version of Charade, and if you can pick that up I'm sure the technical quality is much improved.  But even if you can't find a better quality DVD, this is still a high quality movie.  If you're looking for a fantastic story with a fun balance of humor and romance, you can't go wrong with Charade, and probably any DVD label will do.
