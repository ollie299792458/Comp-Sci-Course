We take it for granted that kung fu movies will include weightless, acrobatic battles, thus distilling the ideals of that martial art and enhancing them for the cinema.  But samurai movies?  They have yet to create a defining visual style.

This movie changes that.

It has a completely original style.  It distills the Samurai essence of the quick strike, the calculated kill.  When Zatoichi draws his sword, the movement blinds you, and computer enhanced blood flies.

Zatoichi is a visual jewel.  It invokes the anime sensibility of creating coolness as an artform, realism be damned, and succeeds brilliantly.

Happily, this does not denigrate the plot.  Many have compared this movie to a Terantino work, and with justice.  However, if I were to compare it to any writer, it would be Wes Anderson.  It is a thoroughly modern affair.  There is no Kurosawa didacticism here.  No one will preach, and the viewer will find no easy moral.  There are only characters who, like real men, have good and evil in their soul in varying degrees.  Men who will do evil to serve good, and do good to serve evil.  There is joy amidst strife, and shameless romanticism beneath the characters' cold and mechanical speech.

I love this movie.
