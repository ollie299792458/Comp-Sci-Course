I went into this film, intrigued by the storyline.
I came away from it absorbed in it's overwhelming visual beauty, and initially confused, by it's conclusion.
After a second viewing, the final segments made sense.
I highly recommend paying attention to the subtle clues, sprinkled throughout the film.
If you do so, the ending will have even more of an emotive impact.
Although the story revolves around two best friends, portrayed in a series of flashbacks & present day, the foundation of it presents the viewer with the idea of being faced with crucial, life altering decisions, and how a split decision can haunt one person for a lifetime.
The film, subconsciously, plays on our own choices.
What would or wouldn't one do, if faced with similar circumstances?
The acting is exceptional, and the dreamlike current of the film, sort of conveys that all is not as it seems.
But i won't spoil the experience by exploring any further.
See "The Life Before her Eyes" with your own eyes!
