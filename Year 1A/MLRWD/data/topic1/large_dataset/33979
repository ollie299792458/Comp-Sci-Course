When this movie opened on the big screen, I did not go to see it because I thought it was going to be a "spoof" about vampires.  However, when I saw the video, my assumption couldn't have been further from the truth.  I found myself enthralled with the tormented Louis (Brad Pitt), the flamboyant Lestat (Tom Cruise), and the exquisite child Claudia (Kirsten Dunst).  This is a very passionate, expressive, and vivid adaptation of Anne Rice's novel.  Tom Cruise brings the character Lestat to life with all the bells and whistles (he went for it) and is one of his finest hours on the sliver screen.  It seems the vampire Louis was written for Brad Pitt - need I say more.  The child vampire, Claudia, was played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst, and she looked the role all too perfectly.  I found myself caught up in the macabre atmosphere and genre of New Orleans and the 18th Century.  This movie takes the classic vampire as we know him, and shows a different side where human emotions, vulnerability and the need for companionship meet.  Underlying it all is the "thirst" (no pun intended) for knowledge about the origins of the "dark gift", the fear of abandonment, and future survival.  It takes the fears that we go through as humans and fuses them with these vampires.  For those of you who like the mysterious and eerie, this is a must to see.  I fell in love with it and have watched it many times over.  I love Anne Rice's book, but adore the movie.
