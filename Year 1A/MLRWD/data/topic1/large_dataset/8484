Okay, I've heard this film called uneven, poorly paced, and a slow retread of 100 different westerns that got by on the basics of the plot.  I've seen [people] praise the film for its supposed ties to the Alien franchise.  I've read the reviews from the die hard Sean Connery fans talking about how great he is in it, and offering that opinion up like his performance is the only saving grace of this film....  This is a good picture all on its own.
The pacing is excellent, the atmosphere created is tangible, and the setting is interesting and engaging.  The cast delivered here in a big way, and not just on Sean Connery's part.  Yeah, he is gives a good performance here, but I personally felt that the rest of the cast outshined him at moments and stole some key scenes.  I particularly enjoyed Frances Sternhagen as the company doctor here.  She begins with a character that is presented as fairly two dimensional and fleshed it out with her own flairs.  Peter Boyle is also noteworthy here.  This is a far cry from the dancing Frankenstein's monster in Young Frankenstein, and still further from his current primeime sitcom drivel.  
The downside I will concede here is that people who enter into the film with a notion that this is an action flick are going to go away dissapointed, particularly those jaded by the last few years of 'summer blockbusters' that favored MTV style direction and Matrix level special effects over content and film making.  If that's what you want, I heard Swordfish is a nice DVD to own.
Leave this one to people who appreciate film as a story telling medium, and I think that this may well become a rediscovered treasure in the DVD collections of many.
