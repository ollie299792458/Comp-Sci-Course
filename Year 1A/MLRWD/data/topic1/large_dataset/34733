This film provides a reaffirmation of the original values of punk: be true to yrself, don't take no for an answer, listen to what's not being said, etc. Justly giving due props to progenitors from the 60s (Velvets, Nuggets, MC5, Stooges; the mentions of earlier people like Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis, though appropriate, seem less thought out) and continuing on through the mid-70's scenes in NYC and England, then back to NYC for a bit of No Wave, then finally touching on LA punk of the 80s, it covers about as much as possible in 90 minutes or so.

I agree with most of the comments below (no X? funny looking older punks--what HAS Glenn Branca been doing?), though the most frustrating thing for me was the performance clips (a few seemingly taken from "The Old Grey Whistle Test") that made me wish for a companion dvd of live clips only. Some fantastic glimpses of classic (and not so classic) songs.

The extras on dvd one (artist bios and punk family tree) were underwhelming, but I've more hope for the second disc.

Overall, a great overview of an important time in music/history; should be required viewing for anyone starting a band.
