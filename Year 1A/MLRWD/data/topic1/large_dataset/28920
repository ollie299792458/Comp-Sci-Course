I had been a fan of the Resident Evil movies, but I am by no means a gamer. It was a lazy Monday night, and I felt like watching a zombie movie, so I figured this animated film might be worth a try. I was dead wrong (pun intended)! Coming out of this movie, I feel like I've been cheated 1 hour 36 minutes of my time (2 hours if you count writing this review). The animation is so-so and comparable to those of straight-to-video movies that litter the bargain aisle. To their credit, the first 30 minutes of the movie with the zombie action was okay. After that the story line just went downhill, bordering on ridiculous. And what is up with the strangely awkward sexual tension between the two main characters every time they avoid sudden death? There's several 3-second pauses where they just stare at each other and do nothing. Throughout the movie, the characters just evolved into nothing more than bloated American stereotypes probably invented by some foreign script writers/video game designers. A five year old could've written a more believable plot line. The lines were extremely cheesy too - "Maybe we could go diving sometime" as a goodbye/thank-you to the person who just saved your life? Really?? Do people say that in real life?  It was that bad. If you're looking to watch a movie, look somewhere else.
