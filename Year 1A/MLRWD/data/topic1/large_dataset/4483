Went in knowing this movie was sentimental, plot-simple and without a close hold on reality.  Fair enough. Instead you suspend believe, get caught up in the story's mystical web and are transported to a land where dreams come true and the bonds of love and music draw you in completely.

The eclectic music was brilliant and mezmerizing.  The cinematography was thoughtful and well edited.  The actors were all well cast, (including  minor and supporting) all were compelling and believabvle in their parts, especially the brilliant young actor, Freddie Highmore who plays the boy music prodigy. The story builds at a nice pace, including the dramas of finding and losing throughout.  Sure the ending is predictable, but who cares when you have already been drawn in and you are rooting for that predictable end to happen?  It is magical and totally engaging, the kind of movie that makes you want to clap at the end (which my daughter and I did as did others in the theater.)  The trouble with critics (who see way too  many movies) is that they have lost their sense of wonder and delight, having already been there and done that from their perspective.

AUGUST RUSH was never meant to succeed on its plot.  It is the execution that makes all the difference.  As previously stated, when all the cinematic elements are right on:  acting, cinematography, editing, casting, music, direction, set and location, the result is a winner
The movie is refreshingly rated PG with nothing to offend anyone.
5 stars! Bravo!
