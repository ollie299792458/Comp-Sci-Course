As far as I am concerned, Star Trek the Next Generation went down with the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations.  This movie, like most of the TNG movies was simply thrown together showing off special effects and blowing things up.  As other reviewers have noted, all the other characters besides Data and Picard have been reduced to background people.  Worf has become comic relief and a wimp compared to the Klingon with the warrior's heart in the TV series.  Nothing is familiar on the enterprise (it's just a ship like any other that they move around in and shoot things with)  The Borg are too emotional and ordinary with the introduction of the Borg queen as opposed to the cold mechanical unstoppable juggernaut of the TV series.  Now in this movie we come to B-4 the recently discovered and previously unheard of android that just came out of nowhere (the romulans just happen to find him laying around some planet).  If I remember right, Dr. Soong (Data's inventor) only created two androids.  Data and Lore (the evil prototype).  I could have written this story much better.  When I saw the preview and it showed two Data type androids, I suspected and was excited by the idea that they reassembled Lore for some necessary reason.  And finally, we have a movie about the Romulans that isn't about the Romulans.  The story is just thrown together.  I give it two stars just because it's mildly entertaining and worth watching just for the action....the only thing worth while that relates to the series is that Troi and Riker get married.  But after Gene Roddenberry died, Trek just went downhill from there.
