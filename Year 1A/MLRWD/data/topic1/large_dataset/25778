Pet Sematary is by far the most disturbing horror film I have ever seen. From the creepy opening credits to the tragic ending you will either be creeped out or disturbed by this movie. The most unnerving part of the film  is that you can't root for the killers demise because he is an innocent  little boy who did nothing to deserve what happened to him, it is a  complete injustice. The fact that Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby) is seen with  red, swollen, tear filled eyes after her little boy is taken away from her  only makes the tragedy seem real. As well, the flashbacks of the Ludlow  town's hidden secrets, told by Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne), are intriguing  and make you wonder why people wouldn't move far away from that place.  Having picked the cutest little boy to portray the tragic role of Gage  Creed (Miko Hughes) is one thing, but him giving such an outstanding  performance at the age of 29 months is incredible...incidentally it took 2  girls to play the role of Ellie Creed! All in all this film is great for  people who can stand emotionally unsettling situations, it is truely a  horror film.
