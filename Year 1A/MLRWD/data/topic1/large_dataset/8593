After a long-awaited theatrical release of Brent Monahan's truly sinister, if slighly fantastic novel about an entity that terrorises the Bell family, inparticular the daughter Betsy, and claims to be the first ghost to kill a man, I am left feeling ever so disappointed. The performances of Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were as good as they could be with the scant material they had. It's always difficult to bring an effective adaption to the screen but in most cases you find yourself saying, "if only I had made it, it would have included this and this...!" For me I was expecting something a bit more from the ghost. In the book the ghost is one of the central characters and builds one to one relationships, and much of the dialogue from the ghost, (yes, that's what I said), forms much of the intrigue and wonder, and certainly holds the key to the twist in the tale. Unfortunately, none of the great scenes with interaction between the ghost and the characters was included. And it was those scenes that I wanted to see in the first place. Most irritating was the prologue thrown in to set us up for a present day twist. Very poor and completely unneccesary. The original story stands alone on own merit and required no alterations. And alterations there were a few. I could be wrong, but I don't recall any exorcist style possesion in the book with eyes turning white.

 On the positive side it was mildly entertaining, but unfortunately won't be added to my dvd collection. Some moments were quite eerie, like John Bell seeing a man on the roof of the house. The poster looks good too!!
