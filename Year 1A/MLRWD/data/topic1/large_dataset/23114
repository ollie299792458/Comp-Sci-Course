I saw this film in August on VHS. I loved "The Insider". It was so good, I watched it three times. There are many excellent elements in this film that I must share with you. The production values were excellent, the screenplay was very well-written, the acting was of great caliber, the cinematography was great, the film score was superb,and the pace and tone of the film were in the right spot. The widescreen format and the film's running time were no problem for me. I'm excited by this film as a work of art and as an example of what to do when one must make a choice. A lot of people used the film as a discussion to trash the tobacco industry, but what jumped out at me was what Mann was trying to say about the character of Wigand and Bergman. The credits hit and I was exhilirated by what I had seen: an excellent film about two men who stayed by their convictions. I'm definitely treating my friends to this film, so if you saw this film, too, don't sit in it: show it to your friends also. For those of you haven't seen it, the acting is great and the film score is superb, but watch it with someone who knows the events rather well. Thanks for movie, Michael Mann.
