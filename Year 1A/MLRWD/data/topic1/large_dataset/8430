Granted, this movie won no Academy Award......and never had a chance to, for good reason........but it IS a movie so definitive of the 1980's.  The clothes, music, and just 'the style' depicted in the movie are a great way to reminisce about that era.  The main thing is to not take the movie too seriously, because the movie doesn't take itself seriously...

Vanity is as pretty as she ever was.  The characters are funny.  And the dialogue is also quite memorable.  Much like Napoleon Dynamite, the Last Dragon was no great movie......but what it lacked in story, effects, and acting, it made up for in 'quotability'.

Who can forget such lines as "Just Directa Yo Feetsa to Daddy Green's Pizza!"  and the titular:  "Who's The Master?  Sho' Nuff!!"  At least those of us who can remember the 1980's will appreciate the movie for those lines and for the walk down memory lane...

In short, it's a classic 1980's kung fu comedy with some 'soul'.  Get it, watch it, enjoy it, but most importantly....don't knock it until you have tried it.
