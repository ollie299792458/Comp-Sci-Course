...and quite a selection of reasons behind the tears as well such as dissappointment when the protagonists don't do what we want them to and at other times they are tears of boredom.  This very slow and in places dull film about a chance meeting between a National Geographic photographer with an intimacy complex and a bored, unsatisfied housweife redeems itself considerably with the scene where Robert (Eastwood) stands in the rain waiting for Francesca (Streep) and then waits for her in the lorry.  It was dealt with all the intensity and intrigue necessary for that scene to work and paid dividends but the rest of the film does take a while to get into and I got the distinct feeling that this was really a re-working of Casablanca than a film in it's own right.  Also, I didn't find the film made it quite clear exactly why those two people got it together it just sort of put it on a plate and expected us to get it.
Eastwood, however, gives an interesting and convincing performance which makes a pleasant change from his normally, very wooden action films.  He certainly can handle alternative roles and is apt at directing (Eastwood blatantly works better when he is directing himself).
Not bad, but I wouldn't rush out and buy the video.
