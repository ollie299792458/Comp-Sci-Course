The director/writer immediately admits his biases straight away by saying he was indoctrinated as a kid, and now believes in the "loving gospel", whatever that means. He then tries to convince the predominantly Christian audience to be more human to their fellow humans. He does this of course, through extraordinarily labored jokes, obvious denial of massive cultural stumbling blocks (i.e.- priests raping children), and a sort of "hey guys, we're all cool, right?" tone throughout the movie. It's tired, it's cheap, and it certainly won't win any atheists over. Speaking of which- where are they in the discussion?

  Not to be found, as it turns out. There's a clip of college kids proving their knowledge about Darwinism, something ANYONE who went to public school should understand. The Christians don't understand Darwin (Oh, God bless them!). He goes to biblical colleges, talks to Christian radio show hosts, and even talks to goddamn Rick Santorum, but no atheist was interviewed explaining where their morality comes from, or how their lives can be complete without irrational belief.

  Effectively, this documentary fails to complete the task with which it charges its audience- be loving, understanding and more Christ-like. This movie is propaganda with a thin veil of "cool" draped over it so it'll play at the youth rallies.
