The Wind and the Lion is a fabulous, old-fashion adventure film with something for everybody: dashing leading man (Sean Connery), plucky, pretty (let's not forget smart) leading lady (Candice Bergen), a terrific supporting cast (which includes Brian Keith (as Teddy Roosevelt) and John  Huston (yes, the director), gorgeous scenery and action aplenty!  I  remember seeing this on a date with an ex-marine (he loved the Marines and  fight scenes, funny thing) in 1975, when it was first released in theaters  and seeing this video brought back all the excitement I felt for it this  movie. Connery is so sexy...you can't help but be swept away! Bergen is the  perfect foil for Connery; able to hold her own on the screen with him.  Their comedic reparte' is so endearing. I still can recite some of the  lines by heart!  The cinematography is epic, the sound track, monumental (I  bought the CD! ) The director obviously had a field day with this (you'd  never guess he was a ex-marine! ) If you're looking for a historically  accurate movie...pass this by, but if you're looking for a little  old-fashion adventure, give this one a try. There is violent content, but  no inappropriate language or nudity (the closest to nudity you'll find in  this is when Sean has his shirt off.) Go on...give yourself over to a  little adventure! Grab your popcorn, your significate other and ride back  in time with the Raisuli. Mrs. Pedicaris, I'm glad you're a lot of  trouble!
