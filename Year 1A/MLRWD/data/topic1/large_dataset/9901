When I first saw this autobiography of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris stars, it was like being there with them.
Growing up in Brooklyn, NY, and Joe Pepitone (another Yankee local scouted and signed with the Yankees, his brothers Billy and Jimmy were our neighbors.  I lived that era and thought I knew everything about every Yankee.  This film, I have sought for years and now that I immediately purchased it through Amazon.com, I can tell any fan of baseball that is has all the fun, drama, trials and problems of any normal person that brought tears to my eyes of what went on during and after their professional careers.  The class and charachter that more then describes those great players were my idols.  But meeting them in person, in the dugout, never, ever gave me anything else but goosebumps.
This film I would highly recommend to any father not knowing these greats to sit with their children for a heart warming and insite not only how to behave and present themselves but a learning lesson of how a sport brought out the finest in them that will last forever.
