I loved Terms the first time I saw it in a theatre, and still love it today - I've watched it over and over through the years.  I first met Emma and Flap in Larry McMurty's extremely long novel, "Moving On" and was pleased to learn more about these two interesting characters. Everyone knows the plot, the superb performances all round, the tragic ending.  I wanted to call attention to two scenes, one being the most heart-warming love scene I've ever seen, and the other, the last few moments.
When the usually overdone, perfect Aurora walks into the Nebraska motel after being with Emma, Aurora with her black roots capping her blond hair, make-up shot, shlepping along, and you hear Jack Nicholson (Garrett) say, "Aurora!", she looks up the motel stairs and there he stands, the cad, his tummy barely diguised by his black sweater, with his face full of love and compassion, and they meet on the stairs, they embrace, Aurora's nose is running, and she says "And who thought you'd turn out to be a nice guy?"  Of course, the theme music adds its special magic, and corny, yeah - and I JUST LOVE IT.  And then, just before THE END, the scene between Garrett and Emma's oldest, troubled son dressed in his church suit.  I used to have that scene memorized word for word - I thought it just perfect.  As I've worn out a Beta tape and a VHS tape, maybe I'll invest in a DVD.  This film just touches every emotion.
