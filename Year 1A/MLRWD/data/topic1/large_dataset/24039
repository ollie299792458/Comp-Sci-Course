I cannot rave enough about this DVD.  My comments will probably restate what most have already said here, but I have to recommend this dvd as one of the highest quality I have seen.  There is a great deal of substance for learning drum solo technique.  This video is made for every level, from beginners on drum solo technique, to the seasoned dancer who wants to polish her technique and learn a challenging choreography.

There is a complete warmup on the DVD in a separate section.  Then, the DVD is divided into a Rhythms section hosted by Raquy, an extremely talented drummer.  The rhythms taught include Beledi, Maksoum, Chiftitelli, and Saidi, to name a few.  Raquy offers great instruction and advice on identifying rhythms.  The DVD also has a choreography section divided into three choreographies according to beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  This DVD clearly draws the line between these distinctions.

Each choreography is divided into the following sections: a performance demonstration by Jenna, a section that breaks down the choreography in smaller sections, the full choreography itself, and a section where you can learn the dance with music from the beginning.

Jenna's teaching method for shimmy drills is effective for mastery of the move, especially the 3/4 shimmy.  She points out minute details that really make a difference in a dancer's technique.

Jenna is a wonderful performer and has a very fluid and coordinated style.  Her instruction is concise, and she demonstrates correct posture and technique.

The music for the advanced choreography can be purchased on Raquy and the Cavemen's CD "Jordan".

I simply cannot find anything to criticize about this DVD.  This video is probably best for those with a basic knowledge on belly dance moves.  There is material here that is difficult to find with other instructional videos.  I consider this DVD to be a must-have in any one's belly dance video collection.
