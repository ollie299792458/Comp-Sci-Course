This is a truly great movie.  It is based on an equally great book.  The thing to keep in mind about Gilbert's house is, his dad built it.  It has a lot of symbolic value.  Mr. Grape married the prettiest girl in town, and fathered the kids in the movie, but the house is not stable, and the family is not stable.  The family is left to survive in the house his dad built on a careless, wrongly-built foundation.  The mother hides inside the house built by the father, who hanged himself.  Just like the house is being held together by the inept efforts of young Gilbert, nailing up little pieces of wood down in the basement, so is the family.  The book reveals more than the movie that Gilbert's buddy, who helps with the basement, is kind of fixated with Gilbert's mom.  Gilbert's buddy, as well as the town's policeman is attracted to her, the image of the prettiest girl in town going to ruin.  Poor Gilbert is doing the best he can, and Johnny Depp does a great job portraying the heroic efforts of this better than average young man.  DeCaprio is equally great as Depp's younger, mentally handicapped brother, who ties Gilbert to his dying home town, his job at a dying grocery store, and his crumbling house.  Notice how Arnie keeps trying to climb?  The water tower has a lot of symbolic value, too.  This movie is almost too good to be a movie.  It has very deep meaning, especially to those of us who have lived the reality of the Grape family's precarious existence.  I would give this movie infinite stars.
