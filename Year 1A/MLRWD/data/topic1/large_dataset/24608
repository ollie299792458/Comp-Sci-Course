Arrogant and self centred TV weatherman Phil Connors is given a chance to fundamentally change himself in this reworked and updated version of Dickens a Christmas Carol.
What would you do if you had the gift (or more  likely the curse) of immortality but were condemned to spend it in the same  tiny provincial town and to re-live the events of one isolated day? Phil  goes through the whole spectrum of emotions as he tries to come to terms  with his unique predicament. Frustration, anger and rock bottom despair.  Eventually he comes to accept his lot and starts to enthusiastically  indulge himself in a completely selfish manner. He tries desperately to  seduce Rita his producer, but she always manages to see through his veneer  of pleasantness to the ugly character underneath. Its hard not to be moved  by Phil's despair when the Ray Charles track `You don't know me' is played.  Much much later on he stops thinking of himself and begins unselfishly to  help the townspeople through their day. As in life we reap what we sow, and  Phil is eventually rewarded for his new found humanity.
Groundhog Day is  a truly great film and it works on many levels, as a black comedy, a love  story, and a spiritual journey. It's one of those rare films that you can  watch over and over and still feel it's impact. Bill Murray deserved an  Oscar for his performance and the supporting cast were totally solid too. I  defy anyone to see the Ned Ryerson character (needle nose Ned, Ned the  head) and not feel the urge to damage him in some way. Buy this classic  film and enjoy it forever.
