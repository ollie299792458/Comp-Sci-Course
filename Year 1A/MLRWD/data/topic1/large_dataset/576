"Zombi 3" (1988), also known as "Zombie Flesh Eaters 2", also known as "The Beyond", not to be confused with the 1981 movie called "The Beyond" which is also known as "E tu vivrai nel terrore - L'aldil&agrave;".  "Zombi 3" was a follow-up to "Zombi 2" (which was called simply "Zombie" in Italy), an unofficial sequel to "Dawn of the Dead" directed by Lucio Fulci.  Confused?

Briefly, here is the plot of "Zombi 3".  A government's experimental chemical is stolen.  The chemical infects people with a contagion that turns people into flesh eating zombies.  This variety of Zombie has mild speech, strength, and move relatively quickly.

I was surprised when I found out that this is a Fulci film.  I really enjoy many of his films, such as "Don't Torture a Duckling", "City of the Living Dead", and "A Lizard in a Woman's Skin".  All wonderful (and disgusting) horror movies.  "Zombie" three was made almost 15 years after some of those films, and it is terrible.  The acting (really bad voice-overs) is abysmal.  The effects look like something one could find in a high school student's film.  The plot is more tangled than last year's Christmas tree lights.  I like many bad horror movies, but I expected more from Fulci.  According to i.m.d.b., there were two additional directors on this film who are not credited.  I wonder what the story is with that, and if it explains what went wrong with this film.

On a positive note, if you like bad horror, then this is a movie for you.  I rank it above the an Ed Wood film or something you'd see in a Bci Eclipse "10 zombie movies" box set, but far below "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Day of the Dead".  Good for viewing if you're in a silly MST3K mood, or to have on in the background when friends are over.  Just don't get your hopes up, and you might enjoy this film.  It's not great, but I've seen much worse.
