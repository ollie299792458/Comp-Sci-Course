Phantasm II is a seriously underrated classic. If you don't think a low budget horror sequel can rise to the level of art, then read no further. The camera work and cinematography are exquisite, with the camera always crawling, panning, or hovering menacingly. It's sort of between what you might see in a Dario Argento or Sam Raimi film.

Those who would dissect the plot are, I think, missing the point. It moves with a dream logic, and throughout, characters are never entirely sure if they are awake or asleep. The Tall Man is simply a primitive evil source who Mike and Reggie alternately hunt, or are hunted by. Along the way there are beautiful women, mutant dead dwarves, parallel dimensions, abandoned towns with empty graveyards, homemade super-weapons, malicious metallic orbs, and fantastic amounts of gore.

The visuals, while obviously dated, still hold up amazingly well. I personally find a certain charm to the old school grab-bag of make up, mechanics, and slick camera tricks. No CGI here, folks.

While the characters are cliched to a degree, the actors all bring some extra personality to their roles and there seems to be some genuine chemistry among the cast. Some diehard fans of the series dislike the fact that the original actor who played Mike was replaced by a new one, but it did not bother me. Of course, Angus Scrimm steals every scene he appears in, as the Tall Man.

My guess is, if you don't already relish this genre, this film will not convert you. But for those who like their horror topped with heaping amounts of imaginitive bloodshed (often served with chainsaws and blowtorches), this is a fun ride.
