The truest to life movie with the most cast of realistic actors ever. You can see this movie in so many colors -- this baby is both the simplest and the most complex plot, all at once. Every theme, each one of them, is very familiar to us whether we like/know it or not.

Someone below did a fine job of saying this movie embraces life in its full awkwardness. And the b/w makes it more seem more vintage.

And forget Texasville, this is a good prequel to how Jeff "the Dude" Lebowski got started in life, with Walter Sobchack in reversal as Sonny Crawford returning from 'nam, Donnie as a reincarnation of baseball-cap Billy and of course Sam the Lion coming back as the Stranger, with Dylan/CCR songs instead of Hank Williams. Only the game is now bowling. Besides that, you've got the impulsive, semi-androgynous Cloris Leachman as the abandoned and furtive Ruth Popper in the form of pederast Jesus Quintana.

My only question is why isn't there a Criterion made out of this yet?
