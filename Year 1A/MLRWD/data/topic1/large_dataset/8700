When I was younger, "The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow" was my favorite bedtime story and Disney movie. Here it comes to life with a brilliant twisted director Tim Burton, (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Nightmare Before Christmas) as he puts his own dark but beautiful style into this art. Scenery is very beautiful and realisitic, along with the brilliant acting performances from Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Miranda Richardson and more. Contains some disturbing images with gore and blood which fits great into the movie. This is definitely the best Tim Burton movie to date. The eerie and suspensful dark forest is a great touch, along with all the other sets: Church, Windmill, Cave, Town, and the creepy tree of the dead, where the headless horseman keeps his victims' heads. This DVD however, has a boring uninteractive menu, with hardly any bonus features, so I suggest waiting, if you truely love this movie, for a more packed DVD. Breathtaking special effects and acting make this movie a gem for all movie collectors!!!
