I watched "Wake of Death" on cable a few weeks ago, right before Christmas. The next day, I bought the DVD from Amazon. Director Philippe Martinez and Jean-Claude Van Damme both did an excellent job of bringing the well-written script to life. It's one of my favorite JCVD movies.

Set Design and Cinematography- A+
Music- 50/50. I don't care for the opening song or the song used during the love scene. In my opinion they are mediocre and don't belong. The movie deserves better. The music used at the end of the movie is outstanding.

Jean-Claude did an excellent job of portraying his character. - The hardened and weary Ben Archer is suddenly grief stricken, with the brutal murder of his wife. Blind with rage and consumed by hate, Ben Archer is relentless- "Revenge is all he has left." There is a touching scene of the devastated Ben arriving back home from the police station. Ben barely makes it through the front door, before he falls apart and begins to cry...and drink. To question Jean-Claude's acting capabilities is nonsense. (An actor is only as good as the script + Talented director/ producer who believes in the project.)

The movie is pure action from beginning to end. This includes a suspenseful car chase scene, endless gunfire and fighting, plus the famous JC kicks. There is just the right amount of blood, guts and gore and a tastefully done scene of Ben Archer making love to his wife.

The action stops in the final scene, because it is the final scene. It's the showdown between the Chinese Mob boss and Ben Archer. At night, on the bridge over the water, at ship Katrina, with the missing daughter, Ben's kidnapped son and JCVD dressed in black....

I tried, but could never get into Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes, Chuck Norris, etc. Then late one night, I watched "Bloodsport" and everything changed...
