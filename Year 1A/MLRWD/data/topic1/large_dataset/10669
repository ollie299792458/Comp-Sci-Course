I loved the TV show and waited a long time for this to come out on DVD.  The DVD itself is great.  I love watching the show in progressive scan and seeing the high quality visual.

The problem is that they changed the soundtrack for each episode.  I'm not sure what the motivation for doing this was, but it really sucks.  Scenes that I remember as fast-paced and exciting such as Nottingham chasing Mobius to the sound of The Crystal Method have now become dull and sluggish.  You don't realize what an impact the music has until it changes.  Some of the new music sounds like someone dubbed a $10 Walmart electric keyboard's electronic beat into the show.  No more Sarah McLachlan, Gerrard McMahon, or Soul Coughing.  Every good song from the series was replaced with something that feels totally alien and inappropriate to the action on the screen.

Take that into consideration before buying this DVD set.

Three stars for the excellent show, but minus two for the absolutely horrible change in soundtrack.
