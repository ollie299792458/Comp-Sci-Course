I'd like to ask a question from the people who ended up writing angry and bitter reviews about how stupid and juvenile this movie is; what on EARTH were you expecting when you decided to watch a movie with a cover like this titled Knocked Up? come on, the whole movie is based on a nerdy guy who gets a girl pregnant after a drunken one night stand. this is not a cimnematic masterpiece - its predictable, stereotypical, and at times rather vulgar and childish.

is it funny though? absolutely, I was laughing with watering eyes and equally much on the second time I watched it with another group of friends. the movie is filled with funny, over the top characters, offensive cracks you cant help but to laugh at, hilarious punchlines and witty humour. At the same time its actually a somewhat touching story aqbout growing up, growing in and out of love and relationships.

if you have reasonable expectations, a good sense of humour and an open mind, you will most likely enjoy this movie a lot.
