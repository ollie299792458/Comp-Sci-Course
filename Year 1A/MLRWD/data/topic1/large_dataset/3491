It looks like it took a "neverending" amount of time, but it has finally happened! The "Neverending Story" and the "Neverending Story II-The Next Chapter" has finally been released on DVD! So what if it isn't widescreen? It would be great to skip to any scene in the movie and see it. I have had these movies (on VHS) since I was a little kid, which was in the 1980's. Now, even though I still have them on VHS and they work perfectly, I may still purchase them again on DVD! If you like fantasy, you'll love this. Please, ignore those 1,2,or 3 star reviews. This deserves 4 stars at the minimum, and it would only lose a star with me if the bonus features weren't that good. However, considering that these movies were released in the 1980's, you must take that into consideration. My favorite movie, Disney's "Flight of the Navigator," I have on DVD and it doesn't have any bonus features. Yet, I still gave it five stars (see my review for that movie). So, if it's bonus features you're after, don't buy this. You'll be disappointed. If it's a great fantasy film (films in this case) that you are after, go for it. Great price too. Just do it!
