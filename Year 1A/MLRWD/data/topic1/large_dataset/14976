First of all, I love Kevin Kline; I think he is a brilliant actor and I really enjoy nearly everything he's ever done.  Put him together with a wonderful cast that includes Joan Plowright and Tracey Ullman, and wow...this is just laughing-so-hard-there's-tears-rolling-down-your-face funny.  Joan Plowright is probably my favorite character but the two stoners are very close.  Keanu Reeves plays his very best role here; maybe because he doesn't have to work very hard?  River Phoenix is part of the cast too, but I could take or leave his character.  Sorry, Phoenix fans; I know he's dead, and that is a tragedy, but his part just isn't very interesting in this film.  However, one of my favorite parts is when the mother (Plowright) spends time choosing the music to put on the record player to mask the sound of the gunshot.  She doesn't want her daughter (Ullman) to put on Madonna.  "Rosalie, you know I love Johnny Mathis!"  Interesting to note that Heather Graham and Victoria Jackson both have bit parts in the film.  Overall, a very silly film, and that's just the way I like it.
