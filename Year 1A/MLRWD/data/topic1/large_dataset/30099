I was surpised to find out what a low budget movie this is after watching it. The directors did quite a good job specially considering it was their first movie.  The special effects are pretty good, though deliberately cheesy at times with lots of excess blood.  It is no Shaun of the Dead, but it was a nice mix of zombies/sci-fi/humor.  They had a great unexpected twist to it as well.  Some of the characters were overly stupid and annoying, namely the mustached cop, and the music was mediocre, but overall it was quite entertaining.  It reminds me of the Evil Dead series more than anything else with its blend of horror,humor, and deliberate corniness but it has its own unique feel.  It was refreshing to see an unpredictable horror film for once too.  It had several scenes that made me laugh out load too(like the flying fish).  If you don't like dry humor you probably won't find it funny though.  It is a nice homage to zombie films that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some creative twists.  I thought it was better than 95% of the horror out there, though I'm partial to weird horror/comedy mixes.
