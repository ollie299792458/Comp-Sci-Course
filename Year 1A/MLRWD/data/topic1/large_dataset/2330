By no means is this movie good.  But, I enjoy watching awful B-movies, and this is one of the best out there.  To me, this movie is more of a comedy rather than a sci-fi/horror flick.  When you sit down to watch the movie, keep a keen eye out for some of these "highlights"...
1. William Shatner is waaaay more disgusting than any of those spiders.  Check him out putting the moves on the women!  Horrible!  Just watching this guy being a sleazeball jerk is worth the admission alone!
2.  Watch for Mr.Johnson's wife (they're the couple with the RV staying at the lodge).  I have never seen a human being that looks so weird in my entire life.  I wonder if she really is human at all.  She looks like a Muppet!
3.  That poor guy who just keeps getting shafted by the man upstairs.  He loses his prize cow, his dog, his bull, breaks his arm, and dies a horrible death by spiders!  Geez, tough breaks huh?
4.  I rented the VHS version of the film and from what I saw, there wasn't an ending!  There is no resolution to the story.  I won't tell you how it ends but is by no means an "ending"!  Perhaps it is included with the DVD version...
If you're looking for a serious horror flick, look somewhere else.  If you're looking for a campy, badly-made B-movie than look no further.  I'll definately be buying this movie on DVD and I'll be laughing for many years to come.  By the way, I happen to live in the area in which this movie was filmed (Sedona and Camp Verde, Arizona) and there are tarantulas here, but there has never been a case of thousands and thousands of venemous spider taking over a small town.  At least not yet.....
