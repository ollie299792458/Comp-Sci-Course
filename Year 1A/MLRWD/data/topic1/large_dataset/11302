Michael Douglas and Glenn Close give the performance of their careers, in this classic! The story is very convincing, as this kind of nerve racking situation could very well happen to a man or woman, who cheats on his/her spouse....by sleeping with a psycho, who would do anything to threaten the couple's marriage, if that person couldn't be indulged! This can happen! Douglas plays the husband, who discovers this intriging woman, Close, at a book social - they meet and, soon, become attracted with each other! His wife goes away for a weekend to her parent's house - and Douglas begins a brief and secretive affair with Close. After that weekend, Douglas goes on with his work and life, as if nothing ever happened. His wife returns with their young daughter, and the family lives happily ever after....that soon changes when Close begins harassing him with phone calls at work and at home; the blood begins to boil as her harassment begins to put him over the edge! The secret between them could be leaked out by her....so he has to do everything in his power to keep a lid on this liaison....the tension between the two gets more heated as the film goes on! It will keep you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat....it's that good of a film!!!! The infamous boiling bunny scene is effective, in showing just how crazed Close's character is in getting back at Douglas! This is one roller coaster of a ride....you'll see!!!! I highly recommend that you purchase this DVD!
