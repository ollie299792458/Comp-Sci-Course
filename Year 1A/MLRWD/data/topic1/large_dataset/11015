A correctional facility brings in a few kids [who just so happen to be both male and female, and the females look nicer than anything ive ever seen come out of the joint haha], to renovate an old hotel that just so happens to have a mad man who kills because it is, "God's work..."

all in all, a waste of tme unless you just want to laugh at the shere stupidity of each character, and root for the monster.

First of all, I give it a star for the relativly good begining [suspense for about 200 seconds and then, WHAM!], but i take one away for that being the only scene that catches my attention. I give it one star for all the character's being stupid, but take a star away since the monster is just a little smarter than they are and... they only gave him one line.

and I take one star away for it not being gory enough [the trailer is a bit missleading if you ask me], or original... Not that many slasher films can be original.

This is a movie that is good for a laugh. Seeing as how the dumb chicks of the story play with a tripwire, don't know how to shoot a gun, and of course, as all ways... just don't defend themselves. As for the guys of the story well... They just kind of let themselves be killed most of the time.

I didn't see how taking cheap shots at Christianity is original, and i dont see how no eyes is supposed to be scary [seeing as how red Dragon, a better film than this, did it]. For a slasher flick, this isn't even close to predator or any of the great slashers of the day... now instead we have Kane gently caressing girl's faces and on occasion, throwing an old lady into some spikes...

Hollywood, GET BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!
