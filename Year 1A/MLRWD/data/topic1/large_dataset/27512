When i first heard about this release i was very happy to find out that it was going to be released in blu-ray, and given the first Appleseed Movie(conventional animation) i expected this one to have the same intense gripping action scenes and storyline. How dissapointed i was when i watch the whole movie, it literally bored me to death with the weak plot and lackluster action sequences, if it weren`t for the beautiful visuals and stunning CGI effects of this movie(first by anime standards on blu-ray) i would have given this movie a 1 star. There was not enough action and drama to keep you excited, the story was shallow and simple and the voice acting was mediocre, even the climax of the movie was pretty lame. Overall this movie is a must have for hardcore fans only, if not you be better off renting it from Blockbuster or Netflix(if they have it) or just buying the dvd version which is alot cheaper than the blu-ray edition. I wish they should just have released FFVII: Advent Children on blu-ray instead of this, i would have been alot happier.
