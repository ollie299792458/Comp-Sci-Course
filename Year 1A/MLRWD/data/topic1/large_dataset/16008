Silence of the Lambs, based on the book by Thomas Harris, is one of the best spine-tingling thirllers of all time. I've read all the books by Harris--RED DRAGON, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL. The movie follows closley with the book as Clarice Starling--a fresh and eager FBI agent in the making--is chosen to interview Dr. Lecter in order to extract information regarding Buffalo Bill. The scenes between Starling (JODIE FOSTER) and Hannibal (HOPKINS) are pure magic. There's a reason this movie won a plethora of Academy Awards. The acting is superb and the dialouge and action sequences are excellent. Foster plays a wonderful character and her growth throughout the movie is amazing--from a tedious and reluctant FBI trainee to a fierce and vigorous tracker of a killer. It is quite a shame that she turned down the role for the movie HANNIBAL--Foster did not like the way Starling's character was portrayed at the end of the book--I won't spoil it for you but Starling and Hannibal have somewhat of a romantic trist at the end of HANNIBAL. Obviously if you've seen Hannibal then you are aware of the movie ending that is far different from the book ending. 
With the recent release of RED DRAGON a boxset will be forthcoming. If you haven't seen this movie you're missing one of the best films of all time. It is one DVD that you need to have in your collection. Hopkins and Foster are brilliant in this film and it is destined to become a classic--up there with Psycho and Citizen Kane.
