This exceptionally acted film covers multiple stories of people coping with drug-related pressures and is one of the best portrayals of such a difficult subject matter that I have seen for many years. The stories are graphic at times, but they show the subject quite literally as if you were a fly on the wall. There's no Hollywood shine or spin to sell you something, which makes this film so refreshing and engaging.

I had a tough life growing up with a single parent mother and encountered many problems of my own, so some of the scenes in the movie brought tears to my eyes as I felt quite closely connected with the actors as they toiled with their circumstances. People that have enjoyed more sheltered lives may find the movie quite uncomfortable, but I think it is an important piece of work and educational in many respects too.

I had to deduct a star for some irritating cuts. The film uses a cutting technique that deletes around half a second of footage, so the action jerks between two locations at times. I felt this was overdone and it started to irritate. I got the feeling that someone was experimenting and for me, that really distracted me away from the immersion.

Overall, I felt that this was a movie with many messages and an insight into drug related lives that is quite accurate and focuses on people that are slipping under the control of addiction or coping with the collateral circumstances such as theft and violence. It also examines how cultures adapt and become entwined with the power struggles that surround drug use, including how impressionable children become the unfortunate fodder and victims of criminal intent.
