There is a rule in Hollywood: when a Democrat is in office, movies about the President of the United States should portray decent and honorable men, like Air Force One and The American President. But when a Republican in office, the President should be addle brained and/or evil, like the senile old man who launches a war in Clear and Present Danger.

Unfortunately, Absolute Power was released when Bill Clinton was President, so the critics were predisposed to damn it. And that is unfortunate, because it is one of Eastwood's best. If Bob Dole had been elected in 1996, this would have been regarded by The New York Times and The Washington Post's critics as the classic that it is.

The plot might be a bit far-fetched, but it is a great parable about the corruption of power and a reminder that truth isn't always on the side of the most powerful. No wonder The New York Times hated it! William Goldman's script is spot on.

The cast is A-1. Laura Linney is an attractive woman, but she does not have movie star looks, which makes her perfect as the daughter who discovers she really hadn't been abandoned by her jewel thief father. Judy Davis is terrific as the President's Chief of Staff slowly going crazy. A scene where she is dancing with the President while she discovers that the necklace she is wearing was worn by the murdered woman is a classic.

The action scenes are wonderful. A scene where Eastwood
manages to evade two separate assassins and the Washington police is a great set piece.

Of all the excellent aspects of the movie, its humor, its thrilling plot, the very best is the endearing father and daughter relationship between Eastwood and Linney. They are both very fine actors and this element of the movie raises the movie far above others in its genre.
