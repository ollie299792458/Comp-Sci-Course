My mother introduced me to the different PBS "house" shows and I've seen all of them except for Ranch House. Frontier House is my favorite by far, with Manor House a close second. I first picked up Frontier House from the public library and was so captivated by the show I watched both discs straight through! I rarely do this with ANY program. I rented it a handful of times before finally adding it to my personal DVD collection.

FH provides a (mostly) historically accurate step back in time, where three modern day families are "transported" to Montana in the 1800s. The series shows the hard work, skill, tools, and everyday tasks of the homesteader during that time. It candidly shows the struggles each family has while trying to adjust to their new lives.

I am such a fan of Frontier House that I bought the accompanying book of the same name, by Simon Shaw. I also contacted PBS about any "10-yr anniversary-where are they now" programs or sequels in the making, to which they responded neither are being considered at this time. :[

I would rate the series as "PG" because there are a few candid discussions about contraception and intimacy on the frontier, but overall I feel it is a great show to watch with your family. Hope this review helps!
