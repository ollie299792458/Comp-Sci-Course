The Original, The Special Edition, The TV Version, The Laser Disc Version, and finally the DVD Collector's Version have all shown up.  The DVD is done very well, with some outstanding interviews and behind the scenes info.  Spielberg's segment was particular telling in his take on how he,and all of us most likely, have changed, matured, or simply developed a different slant on life. What strikes me about this version is what it is lacking.  It is a well know fact that Spielberg regreted filming the inside-the-ship segment inserted into the Special Edition.  But in all fairness, it should have been included in the deleted-scenes portion of the special features.  There were numerous other scenes that could also have been included in the same way. Regardless of some interesting supplemental material, the Laser Disc version had so much more, and also included many versions of scenes that had been removed or changed. Don't get me wrong, CE3K is one of the top 10 movies of all time in any version, and the DVD stands very tall on it's own.  Perhaps in the future we will see Close Encounters of the 6th Kind, a version that includes every feature from every version released.
