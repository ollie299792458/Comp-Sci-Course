I thought I had seen everything that movies had to offer until I saw Mamma Mia! last night on DVD. What's new is seeing Meryl Streep unwind and let it all fly -- singing, dancing, acting -- well, we all knew she could act with the best, but who knew she could sing and dance as well? A great team of supporting actors and actresses, all of whom could sing (Pierce Brosnan excepted). Actually, I enjoyed Brosnan's performances, including his singing. Sometimes a little less polish and a little more realism carries the day. Brosnan could always deliver a line, and he has some key ones in this movie. I thought the big production numbers were very entertaining. I even enjoyed the plot line, although there were some cruel twists at the end. I won't spoil the movie by revealing the twists I didn't like, but they soured me enough to knock off what would otherwise have been a five star rating.

As usual, it is best to ignore the professional movie critics. Something happens when you take money for your movie reviews, and it is not good. My wife and I enjoyed this fine, entertaining movie. I thought most of the cinematography was very good to excellent. The scene that a lot of people seem to be complaining about features a pretty amazing performance by Meryl Streep. That was captivating enough to draw my attention away from some supposed faults in the cinematography. Oh well, too busy enjoying the movie to be hypercritical. I think you will be, too.
