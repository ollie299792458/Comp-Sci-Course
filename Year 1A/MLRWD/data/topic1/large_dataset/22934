This is one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films ever made, performed by, arguably, the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever during, unarguably, their creative peak.  Some things not mentioned that really impressed me:  Keith, the rock 'n' roller for life, is so into the music that he spends much of his time facing the drums, playing directly to Charlie.  Jagger's musical professionalism really stands out.  There are many instances where he makes a point of not hogging the limelight when it's the other musicians time to shine.  Sometimes it's just by turning his back to the audience during someone's solo.  Other times, when the spotlights just don't want to move away from Jagger, he'd move over behind the soloing musician to force the light onto them.  When Keith starts singing "Happy", Jagger not only turns his back to the audience, but points a wagging finger at Keith to get the obstinate spot operator to illuminate the right musician.  And there was that moment during Bobby Keys' sax solo in "Rip This Joint" where Jagger starts to move away from Keys, but then comes back to adjust Bobby's microphone.  The mark of a true professional and something you just don't see much at that level of the music world stratosphere.

Taylor's solo during "Love In Vain" proves by itself what a great guitarist he is.  And there is one short phrase in his "Street Fighting Man" solo that should make send rock guitarist into ecstasy. Can you figure out which one it is?

If you are anywhere CLOSE to being a fan and/or student of Rock 'n' Roll, you need to see this movie.
