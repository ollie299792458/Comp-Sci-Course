This is a very beautiful, but rather confusing movie.  You feel the progress of the plot in your emotions, but you're not quite sure what the progress is.  Nevertheless if you think, you can piece together a general idea of what it's about, and a general idea is all you really need to watch something (if you're in doubt, watch Akira or spend some time as a working immigrant).  The movie feels slow, but when it's over it seems very short, and you wish it lasted longer.  It has a soundtrack of haunting music box melody, oldtime 50s tunes (we are not speaking of rock music), and one other style, used to great effect in one of the funny parts.  The overall mood is melancholy, but also often very beautiful; sometimes pensive; sometimes a sense of wonder; sometimes very funny and sometimes dry.  This movie has something for everyone, and is mixed and out there enough for everyone to think it is weird.  You'll be glad you watched it, but no one else will be able to predict why you'll feel that way.
