This movie, starring - among others - Sean Connery, Micheal Caine, Elliot Gould, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Edward Fox, tells the story of Operation MARKET GARDEN, the largest airborne operation in history. The aim of this operation was to seize a number of bridgeheads across the Rhine, and other rivers, through Holland, so as to allow the Allies to drive into the centre of Germany's industrial heartland, the Ruhr. 
Field Marshall Sir Bernard Montgomery, famous as the commander of the British 8th Army in North Africa and Italy, devised the plan to use airborne troops to 'Lay a carpet across which XXX Corps (an armour and infantry column) can pass".
The movie provides very accurate depictions of the prelude to the operation, and it's conduct. It clearly shows the failures on the part of Allied commanders and gives graphic vision of the type of street fighting the soldiers of the British 1ST Airborne Division endured in the city of Arnhem. It is in fact the bridge at Arnhem that gives the movie - and the Cornelius Ryan book it is based upon - it's title. 
For the soldiers of the 1st Airborne (British) - heroism showed no bounds. To have held their location for 9 days against overwhelming odds was nothing short of miraculous. The efforts of the US 82nd and 101st airborne divisions also get the credit they deserve - particularly the daylight crossing of the Rhine by the 82nd Airborne, under the guns of General Wilhelm Bittrichs Panzers.
This movie tells the truth about a military disaster of the worst kind. It's author, Montgomery, described the operation as '90% Successful'. Prince Bernard of the Netherlands said "My country can ill-afford another of Montgomery's successes". 
An outstanding cast give fine performances in what is easily one of the top 5 war movies of all time
