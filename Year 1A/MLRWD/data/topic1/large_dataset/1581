Why did they make this movie? How did it go so (bad/stupid/pointless)? And how did stars the caliber of Gwyneth and Mike Myers get involved? 
I am not involved in the movie biz except as a regular viewer and I can tell that this flick somehow went hugely astray. This was not, and cannot be the movie they set out to make the first day the producer said, "hey, my Dad has a barn!" 
If you've seen the previews, you need to know that will not be the movie you will see when the lights go out. Mike Myers is goofy and entertaining. If the director had gone that way with the whole movie, I'd be a happy consumer. Gwyneth is a sweet and lovable in the rest of the movie, and if the director had gone that way with the whole movie, then my wife would have been a happy consumer. Instead, they created a hash that left both demographics bored and unhappy. Movies are supposed to generate a big emotional response; goofy, romantic, sadness, patriotism, fright. This one generates a capital letter WHO CARES!!! 
I'm the guy who can sit through anything and be entertained. On this one, though, save not only your $ at the theater, save your $ when it comes out on video. Oh, why 2 stars and not 1? Because I liked Mike Myers, and I really enjoyed ripping this movie at dinner with my wife. That was easily worth an extra star.
