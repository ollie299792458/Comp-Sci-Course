Southland Tales lacks any focus whatsoever. If Richard Kelly could do basic math, he would have realized that with about 30 characters in his movie, even with a 2.5 hour running time, that gives each one an average of 5 minutes of screen time. If he knew the first thing about ensemble storytelling, he would have realized that each one of those characters has a story. And I'm not saying that 5 minutes isn't enough time to tell a story, but when you're watching 30 different five-minute "Tales" chopped up and strewn together at random, you spend half your time just keeping track of everyone. Did Miranda Richardson even have any lines? or did she just sit there looking menacing the whole time? Likewise, Justin Timberlake's character didn't seem to serve any purpose, and the movie would have been better off without him, although he does spend the last seconds of the movie telling us his relationship to Sean William Scott's character, which he has to TELL us because Richard Kelly never SHOWS them in a scene together. Can you tell I was frustrated with this movie?

The most hilarious part of the disc is the bonus featurette, in which about half the cast confesses that they too had no idea what the movie was about or how their character fit into it. Richard Kelly might argue that the movie is about chaos, and therefore it should be disjointed. Perhaps that's true--and let that be a lesson to every filmmaker out there: don't make a movie about chaos, unless you want it to suck. What this movie is really about, though, is The End of The World (as the characters themselves tell us over and over, with all the subtlety of a a dead-horse-beating, "It ends not with a whimper, but with a bang"). In other words, Richard Kelly is really just recycling the same time-travel narrative that worked so well in Donnie Darko. But unlike Darko, Southland Tales IS sci-fi, so the big time-travel secret comes as NO surprise.
