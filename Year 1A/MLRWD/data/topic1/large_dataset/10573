I remember the TV series Due South from 1994 on TV.  I had just gotten married and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  It is entertaining and clean TV - just fun to watch.  Paul Haggis is the creator and the writer for the first two seasons.  I think the clever writing is what makes the show so timeless.

Due South was the first time I heard Canadian singer, Sarah McClanchlan's voice in the background on the 3 episodes about Fraser's one love, Victoria...  Fantastic!  Due South uses many Canadian actors and singers.

My girls are young teenagers and they love watching the DVDs as much as I do.  In fact, we got a puppy in October and named him Fraser... he has a red collar like a Canadian Mountie!

I've really enjoyed all four seasons!  I would highly recommend it.  However, the quality of the DVDs is not perfect.  I had three episodes that "locked up" on me while watching the DVDs.  I contacted Amazon and they were amazing to work with.  In the end, I received another DVD set, and still had problems viewing but it was with different DVD.  So, between the two sets, I have a complete, defective free, full set of Due South.  I would suggest that Alliance, the company that reproduces the DVD's of Due South, should do a better job and create DVDs of better quality.
