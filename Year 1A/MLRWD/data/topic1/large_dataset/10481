Few can argue that Ninja Scroll is one of the best anime films to come out of Japan. A lot of people have hyped it up as a masterpiece of epic proportions. Unfortunately, hype is a double edged sword that can either  make or break a film's(i.e. Ghost in the Shell) mystique and charm to begin  with. On the other hand, only an elite few can fit the mold and live up to  the expectations. In my opinion, Jubei and his pals have accomplished just  that. Ninja Scroll offers what have led millions to join the anime craze to  begin with. Action, over the top yet realistic characters, a subtle plot,  and a gorefest of monsters and men run rampant in this samurai/ninja flick.  The fight scenes and background are top-notch that ooze drama every second.  The characters are charming (although somewhat underdeveloped and badly  dubbed) and interesting enough to give each a specific amount of attention.  So with all these compliments, why not give it a perfect score? Well, it  may have lived up to it's hype as an artistic action film piece, but it's a  little low on the depth department. It's standard anime style story leaves  a little more to be desired. But with a good enough plot, cool enough  characters, and tough enough action, Ninja Scroll ends up being a winner in  what it was meant to be. An eye catching...stunning...and fun-filled  adventure for the wannabe ninjas all over the world.
