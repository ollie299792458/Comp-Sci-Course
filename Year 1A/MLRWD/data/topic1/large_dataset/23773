Many who denounce this movie I guarantee you did so solely on the basis of Ben Affleck's casting.  I used to be one of them, until I saw it in theaters.  Aside from Changing Lanes this was his only starring role I've ever liked.  Then, of course, this version was released and I've come to like it even MORE.

Those who may have seen the theatrical cut (TC) and didn't like it may wanna check out the DC.  It's darker with longer and more brutal fights, a new subplot to show how Murdock & Nelson really works, more badassery for the Kingpin and less of the forced love story between DD and Elektra.  This is NOT the same movie, despite how familiar scenes look.

Mark Steven Johnson was pressured by the studio to deliver a PG-13 movie, meaning a lot was cut from this R-rated movie to fit that mold.  That only proves that sometimes the directors know a tiny bit more than the studios when it comes to the stories they're crafting.  About the only thing that really plagues this movie is the miscasting of Jennifer Garner as Elektra.  On a personal note, I never liked how Matt and Elektra met in the movie.  I would have preferred a reunion from their college days like in the comics, but that's just me.

The DVD IS a little light on features, but that's because it's meant to COMPLIMENT the other release.  In reality, this was supposed to be included with that release, but they decided to push it to the following year.  However, what it lacks in the features it makes up for in design.  Gone are the cheesy menus of someone walking around an alley with a camcorder poorly edited to resemble DD's shadow world.  No, this time we get an animated menu with a shifting cityscape and images of the stars from promo posters included.  That only further shows the care attributed to this version of the movie.

If you like Daredevil comics, get this version.

If you didn't like the Daredevil movie, get this version.
