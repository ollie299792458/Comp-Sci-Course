Unfortunately, I made that mistake when I first saw this film.  The movie consists almost entirely of a dinner conversation between Andre and Wallace, and I was lost the whole time and had no idea what was going on.  Luckily for me, I was able to rent it through Netflix and this time, I paid close attention to every subject matter during the conversation.  It starts out with Wallace meeting Andre for the first time in several years, followed by Andre telling a series of wacky stories.  Then comes a philosophical discussion about the life of playwrights, the separation of the audience from the story, how people separate their dreams and goals from reality, and how people tend to live like robots and not ask questions.  A lot of the subject matter discussed pertains to musicians and songwriters as well, and that is probably what drew me in, since I could easily relate to it.  Songwriters also have the greatest challenge of crossing that barrier between themselves and the audience, and it doesn't help anymore to simply reveal the horrors of society, such as murders, rapes, thefts, wars, corruption, etc.  And furthermore, what you see in people is not what they really are, since you might look at somebody and perceive them as highly successful and self-satisfied, when they're actually in pain and agony from certain issues in their lives.

In any case, this would be a good DVD to add to my collection, since I didn't quite get a chance to catch every important concept they discussed about.  It's one of those movies that need to be seen over and over again a few times to really get the big picture.
