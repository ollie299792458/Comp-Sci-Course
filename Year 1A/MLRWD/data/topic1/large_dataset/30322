It is dissapointing that the Academy Awards is allowing ten nominations next year. Had it been this year, The Wrestler would have been nominated hands down. Even that aside, I felt this movie should have been nominated instead of Milk, which I felt was nominated because of one reason, which I will not utter.

This movie is NOT a wrestiling movie. Yes, it is about a wrestler, yes it has wrestling in it, but the fact of the matter is that it is about a broken down lonely man who tries to cope with a NEW life.

I cannot praise Mickey Rourke's performance enough, he is without question outstanding, almost like he was born to play this movie. In fact, I have always liked Mickey Rourke, I think he is an outstanding actor, but has been in some lousy movies which have really affected his career.

However, as much as Rourke is phenomenal in this movie, Evan Rachel Wood steals the show. Her performance should have garnered her a supporting actress nomination, AT LEAST! She is an incredible actress with a lot of potential. She will win an Osacar someday for sure.

 I think this movie was very well directed and had a great flow. The ending is very good, and it really tells you how this man shows what the TRUE love of his life is.
