This was basically the first horse movie I had ever seen and liked. I didn't like the movie version of "Seabiscuit" or the various other horse films made throughout the years. This wasn't the top on my list of must-see movies, but I went anyway.

First off, the trailers (particularly the super-long one shown on evening tv) did this film a major dis-service. The trailers show Dakota Fanning and Kurt Russell in cheesy, lame moments, so I was expecting this of the movie. Not so. The story of a good horse who is injured, then fixed, then injured again, then fixed for good was terrific. In parts in was hilarious, and the supporting cast fit in perfectly with the two main stars (I especially liked Kris Kristofferson as "Pop"). For the most part, you know what's going to happen, but it doesn't matter. It's fun to watch them struggle and learn, and at times it is very..touching.

And about the cheesy moments..they're not cheesy in the context of the film. It is very enjoyable from start to finish, and the dialogue, for the most part, is believable. I would recommend this one for anybody, unless you don't like horses. Well, that's it for me. Farewell, and happy trails...
