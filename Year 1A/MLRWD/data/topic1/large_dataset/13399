Oliver Twist has always been a personal favorite story of mine. I love the book. I love most of the movies. And, of course, I love the musical! Many directors and producers have tried to adapt Charles Dickens masterpiece of a novel, and only a few have really hit the mark. Two personal favorite of mine, besides the musical adaptation, are BBC's 1985 version, spawning over five hours lone. That version seems to capture every detail in Dickens book. Also, Roman Powlanski's version is another favorite of mine, capturing the gritty realism of the piece. But my favorite version has to be this, David Lean's masterpiece. In fact, David Lean's Oliver Twist, while it might not have every detail in Dickens novel as does the 1985 BBC version, it captures that same gritty realism that Roman Powlanski and so many others have copied off of. Beautifully shot and acted, this version soars above every other attempt at the story. Upon my first viewing I could not believe that this was a movie of the 40's! The camera movements and cinematography and use of special effects were so beyond the times, and a testament to the greatness of David Lean. This truly is a classic version of a classic story!
