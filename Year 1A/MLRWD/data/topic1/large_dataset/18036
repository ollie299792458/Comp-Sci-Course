... This movie was my absolute favorite from my childhood days. The first time I ever saw this was when I was in grade school back in the 1970's. They would show this movie at school on the old motion picture projectors on rainy days when you couldn't go out for recess. I remember falling in love with the movie instantly and always looking forward to the next time the school would show it. It was such a magical experience to watch it as a child and I can honestly say this is the only film that I can still hear and see in my memory. The music, and the sound of the little boy running through the cobble stone streets, and the stark contrast between the balloon's brilliant color and the boy's very grey world. I also remember the teachers at school telling us how they had to request this movie from the city library many months in advance because it was such a popular film with the school district. Who would have ever thought that American public schools could make such great decisions? Showing this film over and over year after year was one of the best ideas any of my teachers had. I really recommend you share this movie with your loved one's as it may just help create wonderful memories for them to look back on someday.
