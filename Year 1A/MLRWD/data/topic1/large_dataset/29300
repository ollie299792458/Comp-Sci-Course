What a great movie Erin Brockovich is.  I usually don't write reviews on DVD's/Movies unless they are typical guy movies, war movies, etc.  However, I had to make an exception for this wonderful, outstanding acted movie.
Julia Roberts portrays true life Erin Brockovich.  A lady who came from a not so glamerous background who with the help of the law firm she worked for took on big and powerful Pacific Gas And Electric (PG&amp;E) and won a huge settlement for the townspeople of Hinckly, California.  This is a true life case where PG&amp;E used Hazardous Chemicals in their electric turbines and took the waste from the turbines (Chronium) and instead of safely containing them in lined waste ponds, decided not to make the ponds safe and thus the Chronium seaped into the ground soil and contaminating the town's water supply.
Erin Brockovich (Roberts Character), needed a job desperately and was able to work for a law firm who had the case "pro bono".  THANK Goodness for the law firm and Hinckly that Brockovich worked for the lawyers (even though she isn't a lawyer). 
Overcoming a tremendous burden (single mom, low paying salary), Brockovich researched the cases, got to know the townspeople, gathered evidence, and to make a long story short, won for the "little people", over 300 Million Dollars!!
This is a movie that everyone would enjoy.  Roberts rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actress from this movie.  All actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job.  The plot is true life captivating, intelligent, and will keep the viewers interest from the very first scene. 
Highly Recommended!!
