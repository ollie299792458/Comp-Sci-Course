I was blown away by the edutainment-per-dollar value of this DVD set.  I mean, c'mon, it was like $2 per disc!  While all of the minor criticisms in other customer reviews are true (mediocre DVD quality; repetitive use of footage, etc.) these seem to me very minor quibbles.  What we've got here is the finest general introduction to the Revolution available, with lots of backstory and examination of what led up to the revolution; battlefield maps and reenactments; excellent coverage of the politics and personalities and events; etc. etc.  It is comprehensive and interesting, fast-paced and well-detailed, easy to watch and educational.  I would've liked to see some more coverage of the British perspective on the war, but there are several good books on that topic (such as "Redcoats and Rebels", or by going straight to the source with books such as Peter Oliver's "Origin and Progress of the American Rebellion").  As an overview of the Revolution and to get a feel for what the whole era was about, this DVD set cannot be beat.
