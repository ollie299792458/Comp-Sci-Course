This definitely lived up to my expectations. If u complain that it wasnt true to the book, apparently you have no idea how long the actual book is, and alot of these reviewers are wrong about the page number of the book. Its not 870, its more like 730. But thats not much a difference anyhow, I just wanted to straighten that out. But back to the review, for the book being so long, Newell directed an extroardinary film. For a 700+ page book, he did awesome.

I am a huge fan of movies 1 2 and 4. If you watched the first two movies, and read the book,itd be like readin the exact movie script. But in movie 3, Cuaron made an awesome movie, but was not true to the book. I loved the movie, but he did not go by the book very well. He put alot of non-important scenes in there, but left out the really important stuff u needed to understand the 4th movie. He did not include the right parts, and the parts he did include were all out of order.

Back to the 4th film, Newell did a perfect job of makin the book to a movie. If your a true diehard fan, u will appreciate this film and enjoy it. The visual effects were out of this world. Very impressive stuff.
