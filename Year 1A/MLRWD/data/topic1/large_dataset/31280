Before there was Diehard, before there was The Terminator, before there was Shawshank Redemption, before there was Gone With The Wind (the greatest movie of all time) there was Birth of a Nation.  This movie was epic in scope, especially considering that it was a silent film.

This film set the standard for a Hollywood epic.  The plot was not simple, and it could hardly be divided into three rational Acts.  This film details the civil war and its aftermath.  It is not easy to watch, but there is no reason to think that it is historically inaccurate.

The main criticism of the film is its glorfication of the KKK.  The KKK is an organaztion derived from hatred and bigotry, but hindsight is no reason to assume that this is not a reflection of the times.  Even Gone With The Wind glorified the KKK to some extent.

If you can get past the blatant racism, this is a great film.  The cinematography was wholly original for 1915.  The epic plotline was wholly original.  This film should not be discarded becasue of its antiquated views on equality because it set a new level of film making for its era, which was not even approached until Gone With The Wind.

In its era of silent films, this was the best that man could create, and it should not be missed.
