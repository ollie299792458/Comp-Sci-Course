This movie has a lot of hype going for it, yet it fails to have any lasting impact. Even for the time period, this movie fails. The story line has a lot of promise, though the hysteria of witches is poorly done. There is little characterization to lead to credibility that the people being tortured are actual witches. It is understood that most people tortured were not witches, yet without characterization, there was little compassion for those being tortured. Without empathy for the victims, this became a run of the mill gore flick, without much gore. The torture scenes, though not overly graphic by todays standards, are adequate, but nothing special. Even the hype of the ripped out tongue fails to have any lasting impact for me. The musical score was awful and not overly fitting for a torture movie.

To its credit however, the movie was fairly well acted, even though the dubbing was hideous. There is also a historical value to the film, as it tries to show the hysteria of witchcraft running rampant in a small town. It certainly shows how easily people are persuaded by the powers that be, and how easily society can be lead astray by hysteria (of any kind).

Overall, this film rates a "C-". Its worth a look, but dont expect to be moved by it.
