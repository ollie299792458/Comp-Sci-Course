George Clooney has finally made a movie about something here in David O.  Russell's Three Kings, an intelligent action film that ranks among the best  of its genre...ever.  Clooney was good in Steven Sonderberg's Out of Sight,  but the film didn't have any original punch to it.  Elmore Leonard books  that are always adapted to films have a certain coolness to them so the  credit in that film was only partial to Clooney (not to mention Jennifer  Lopez...what a kitty cat).  This film is an action film, as I described,  that provides substance.  It takes place during Desert Storm in the early  nineties where four G.I. Joes (Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Being  John Malkovich's director Spike Jonze) plot to steal gold from a bunker  behind Arab lines.  To put it in simplist terms, the plan goes heywire and  there you have your film.  Some thoroughly stunning visuals are in this  film, even looking better when viewed on the superb transfer of the DVD.  Check out the special features because it is one dynamic disc, with a key  pointing to the film's commentary by the filmmakers.
