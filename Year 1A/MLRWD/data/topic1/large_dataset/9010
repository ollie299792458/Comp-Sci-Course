My wife and I saw Elton John in performance a few years ago in Knoxville. I was stunned from the first note to the encore. In all honesty, I don't think there is a performer anywhere that puts more raw energy per square centimeter into a performance than does Sir Elton. That energy comes through full force in this disc; Elton John obviously is having a wonderful time, and so is the audience. In fact, the only reason I don't give this disc 5 stars is from a bit of disappointment at the lack (on what was supposed to be a "greatest hits" disc) of two of my favorite EJ tunes, "Pinball Wizard" and "Grey Seal".
I note that some other reviewers have made negative comments about the duets; don't let them put you off this disc. Yes, perhaps it might have been more a "pure" EJ show without them, but take my advice, take the duets on their own merits (especially the electric performance from Anastacie), and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
(One further note: the Dolby 5.1 mix is dynamite.)
