I loved this movie!  I went into the theater with very low expectations and several free passes.  I came out with my boyfriend and our sons a fan. We walked out the theater planning to buy it. This was such a magical and funny move. I was disapointed that more people did not see it.  None of my friends have seen it, so I had no one to talk to about it.  I am so excited that it is FINALLY on video.
Michelle Pfiefer is great as the witch, Sienna Miller (I think she is over-rated) makes a short apperance in the movie, which becomes the catalyst Tristan's journey. I have never been a fan of Claire Danes, but she was wonderful as Yvaine, and I really liked the guy that played Tristan. Oh yeah, Robert DeNiro, I don't really like him in comedies  (except Midnight Run), but when my boyfriend and I talk about this movie, we always qoute one of his lines.  I figured out the ending about halfway through, but even that doesn't spoil the experience, it's so about the journey.
Enjoy this movie and let me now what YOU think.
