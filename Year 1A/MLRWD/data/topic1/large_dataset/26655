I was very happy to finially get to see and now own a copy of the Wicker Man.  Besides being a longtime fan of both Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward, this film covers a topic that is of immense interest to me.  Robin Hardy has gone to enormous lengths to painstakingly create an accurate portrait of the pagan practices of the ancient Britons and Scottish, and he went to equally great lengths to create these scenes in stunning artistic beauty.  Who can argue that the remote Scottish Isles are some of the most beautiful places on earth?

It is with great pleasure that I recommend this movie for anyone to see a true picture of what a pagan ritual might look like.  Of course, minus the unfortunate human sacrifice.  The performances by Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee will satisfy and nothing is left out, much of the information from a historical view is accurate and it is obvious that there was much research in the making of this.

Do see THIS version: alas there is a remake in the works as I write this featuring Nickolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in the lead roles, changing the locale to the US away from the British Isles, and no doubt will change much of the meaning.  In addition, Robin Hardy himself is suing the producers of the remake to remove his name from the list of credits, as he wants nothing to do with it.

I gave it 4 stars because to a modern audience, it might seem a bit dated, but I do highly recommend it!
