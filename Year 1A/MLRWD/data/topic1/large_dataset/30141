A stellar performance from Steve Martin and the late, great John Candy.
I don't know where that guys doing the Editorial Reviews are  coming from, this movie is great!
Steve Martin is stuffy ad executive  Neil "I can take anything" Page and John Candy is the bungling  but warm-hearted shower-curtain-ring guy (I know what you mean), Del  "Extra set of fingers" Griffith.  We follow this mismatched pair  half way across the States and back again as they encounter one crisis  after another.  As the title says, our heros travel whatever way they can  to get to Chicago- from planes to trains to cars.
One of the funniest  scenes is when after Del gets his coat caught behind the driver's seat,  panics and sends the car on a tailspin causing him to go the wrong way down  the Interstate.  We see their car get caught between two semis.  During the  squeeze, Neil looks and sees Del as the Devil, complete with pitchfork and  horns.
In all, this movie is great!  You will not be disappointed, that I  can promise you because it's "filled with helium, which makes it 10%  lighter."
