Cutthroat Island is by far the best soundtrack I have ever heard, and will probably remain my favorite for years to come. Written in 1995, John  Debney's Cutthroat Island remains one of the best scores for soundtrack  collectors. After all, no CD collector has a complete collection without  Cutthraot Island! Using the London voices as the background choir,  this  brings out the music even better then ever. Using a mixture of French horns  and Trombones, which are  switching back and forth as the lead instruments  in this score make up most of this soundtrack. Much of the music on  Cutthroat Island (and just about all of it) is very tense and swift, yet  very beautiful (thanks to the London voices) John Debney must have had to  spend a long time writing music with such a good tune, and using just the  right instruments to make it one of the best scores written. The first  track begins with trombones and French horns before growing into a huge  orchestral explosion. It sounds as if every instrument in the orchestra is  busy, and using surround sound, you can really hear this one well, and it  is well worth every cent that goes into buying it. The soundtrack itself  was much more successful then the movie. This soundtrack is becoming rare  and expensive, so don't hesitate to buy it while you can! One other large  factor in the success of this score is the orchestra that performed  it...The London symphony orchestra. Using all of its 120 piece orchestra,  the sound is incredible! (Listen to it loud, and you'll understand)  John  Debney himself must have been a little suprised at first hearing this  score. When he first directed it, he was "blown away" by the  music, and was amazed at both the score and the orchestra performing it.  Anyone who collects CDs should have this soundtrack! Don't let the price  scare you off, because anyone who buys this CD will never regret it!
