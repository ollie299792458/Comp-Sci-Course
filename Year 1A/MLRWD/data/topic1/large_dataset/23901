The Abyss is probably James Cameron's most underrated and greatest film. Not only did he direct the impossible senario of an almost complete underwater film, he also managed to show one of most intense character  films in recent history.
Rather than focus on the "aliens" as  the monsters or threat of the movie, Cameron instead showed what  monster-like qualities humans posess. It wasn't what people wanted at the  time. They thought they were going to get another "Aliens"  underwater. But as you gradually take in this film, you realize it has ten  times the intensity of "Aliens".  Please, please, please get the  DVD version so you can see the Director's Cut of The Abyss. It is nearly 3  hours in length, but adds so much more to the story then before. This is  one of the gretest movies ever made, and should be viewed the way Cameron  cut it on the special edition.
PS. Ask any fan of the film. This movie  has quite possibly the most intense, well acted scene in movie history.  Once you see it you'll know.
