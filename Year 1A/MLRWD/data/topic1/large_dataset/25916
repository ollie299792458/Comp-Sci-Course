What a great high school/pre-adult/comedy drama there is no way that todays movies about high school life can measure up to this 90s classic movie.

So two unpopular girls in high school became such good friends that even years after graduating high school they are still living and spending time together. I seriously doubt such an amazing female friendship could exist in real life the characters are relatable, funny, a little strange but you just love those two and you root for them all through the movie.

So anyways they both receive an invitation to the high school reunion and decide to attend to show all of the high school kids how much they achieved in life in fact they realize they have not achieved anything, so they in turn concoct a story about them being successful business women and of course they fumble and get into non sense trouble once the classmates realize it was all a lie.

The ending of course is positive it is the classic the nerds in high school get more out of life than the mean and popular kids. Very good story about accepting yourself as you are and not caring about what others think of you.

A funny movie with a great cast and a good lesson. In fact the movie features good music as well, even my boyfriend whom I forced to watch it with me liked the movie so definitely this movie is worth a watch.
