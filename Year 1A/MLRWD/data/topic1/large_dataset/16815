A Universal DVD

This is a story that coveys the close relationship that develops between two utterly different men that must share the same hospital room after being both diagnosed with advanced terminal cancer. The first, Edward Cole- Jack Nicholson- is the CEO that runs the hospital and is a ruthless persona and the second is a mechanic, Carter- Morgan Freeman-, who wanted in his youth to be a history teacher but life circumstances did not allow him to do so. They share the common adversities of the infirmity and they, ant the same time, share a long trip that will tie the relationship even further.

One day, Carter starts to write a "Bucket List" containing all the things that he would like to do before he dies and Cole finds it out. Afterward, they decide to write the "Bucket List" together and start going on marvelous trips around the world and sharing precious moments and becoming the best of friends.  Two utterly different persons become the closest friends ever in the last months of their lives.

What really stroke me about this DVD was that it not only applies to two terminal cancer patients: What stroke me the most is its universality. If we think a little deeper, it could apply to two or more persons sharing similar adversities- or joyfulness for that matter- and relying on each other for comfort, understanding, and the sharing of knowledge and experiences.

The performances of the two principal actors are outstanding and make you laugh and cry at different times during the performance.

Highly recommended!!!
