The Battle of Algiers is an amazingly relevant movie for the times which we are now living in. The Battle of Algiers investigates the insurrection in Algiers by the FLN against French colonial rule, and documents the process of the recruiting of an insurrectionist, the creation of a terrorist organisation, the initial terror campaign targeting the police and representatives of the government, the authorities response and the escalation by both parties culminating in bombing campaigns targeting civilian populations.

What I did find surprising was the impartial portrayal of the French military intervention. Instead of being portrayed as monsters, the French paratroopers are shown as utterly pragmatic in their understanding of the forces that are arrayed against them and the actions which they must be willing to do to shutdown the rebellion. Actions which include the torture of suspects to gain information on the terrorist cells, information which they know will ultimately lead them to the FLN leadership, who must be captured if the insurrection is ever to be defeated.

A key example of this even handed treatment is in the character of the French Paratroop Colonel. A soldier who had fought with the French resistance in World War 2 and who had been defeated in the French Vietnamese conflict, the Colonel is fully aware of the immorality of his actions, but also knows that if the insurrection is to be defeated then these methods are necessary. As he explains to the assembled press "Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences."

Ultimately the movie shows the futility of trying to enforce control by military means upon a population whose sympathies remain with the insurrectionists, a population who will comply with your orders only long enough to reorganize and prepare another revolt.
