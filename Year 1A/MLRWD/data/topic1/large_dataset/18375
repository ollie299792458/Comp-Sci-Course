This is a good film.  Is it well-rounded enough to be a great film?  No, but that's not the point.  Its a solid, satisfying film which tells a specific story.  I think most people will know before they see it if they will like it or not.  I won't spend any time on that aspect of it.  Two criticisms I don't understand though are the acting and that it is a propaganda film.

Lots of critical reviews fault the acting but I don't really understand that.  Sure some of the lines are flat compared to Brad Pitt or someone but isn't that balanced or even made better by having the real people say them?  It's like being mad that real life isn't as idealistically delivered as Hollywood lines.  Sometimes we say flat or cheesy stuff in real life.

Second the propaganda angle is also a bit off.  Its simply a film about people of high character doing cool but dangerous stuff and it gives them the credit they deserve.  Its just a pseudo documentary.  It hardly sugar coats anything, no spoilers but bad things happen to bad people and good people in the film.  Maybe a little simplistic for the critics but most people really are a lot simpler than people in "the movies" anyway so whats wrong with a film of well-adjusted people now and then.

Finally, there is no comparison between this and many of the completely average movies out there.  I mean it grossed about the same amount as Contraband.  Really? How is that remotely as good as this movie on any basis?
