This film, which may seem a bit quaint by today's standards, nevertheless is an excellently-acted, taut disaster drama that was the forerunner of all airline disaster movies that followed. The ensemble cast is excellent; it is filled with famous stars of the 1950's and led by the sensitive yet commanding performance of John Wayne, who shows a different side of his talents in this film. This is not an action film or a Western. It is a psychological thriller and focuses on the characters, and Wayne gives a magnificent performance as do all the others in the cast. This movie is a classic and I highly recommend it for fans of Wayne, the disaster genre, or of ensemble films of high caliber. If you've never seen this film before, you'll be on the edge of your seat. If you have seen it before, it holds up very well to repeated viewing as the cast pulls you in and makes you care about these people on a crippled plane over the Pacific who are trying desperately to stay in the air rather than ditch in the stormy sea, which would be an almost certain death sentence.

This is an excellent adventure/psychological thriller to add to your collection!
