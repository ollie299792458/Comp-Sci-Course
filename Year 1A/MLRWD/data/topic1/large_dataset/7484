This documentary, in addition to reading the works of Dr Neal Barnard and listening to lectures by Dr Esselstyn, has put me onto a new path of healthy and wellness.
I struggled with my weight and an eating disorder for years, and this finally cured me. For those of you who are predisposed to compulsive eating, (just as some people are predisposed to alcoholism, and others are not), this will clarify why certain foods are addictive and others are not. Once you understanding the biological reasons, your will have new and powerful insight into how to treat your bad eating habits.
FOK also challenges the status quo and the assumption that the SAD is the norm- it tracks the history of our eating habits in the past 100 years or so, and you will be shocked to see how much our consumption of meat and cheese has shot up over the years- steadily growing so that each successive generation barely detects our growing, hazardous gluttony for animal products.
Ultimately, i still eat animal products very occasionally as i'm fairly young and did not have a risk of heart disease or diabetes. What led me to change to a predominantly plant-based diet was the desire to lose weight, be active and healthy and not be plagued with the common diseases of affluence like so many people around me are, particularly a bit later in life.

If you're open-minded and willing try something other than the opportunistic, commercial drill that meat and dairy are the essential to good health, then this may very well change your life drastically for the better, as it has mine.
