I've seen those based on true events movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wolf Creek.  Upon actually researching these "true events",through this wonderful thing we call the internet, I was quite relieved to find that although these events were real, they are "Hollywood-ized" for entertainment purposes.  As much as I would like to say the same about Borderland, this is not the case.  It was real, very real, so real that I found it difficult to sit through this movie.  I remember these events all too well.  I was just 14 years old when I heard about this poor kid coming up missing while partying in the bordertown of Matamoros.  It hit very close to home, as Brownsville, Texas (the city right across the border from Matamoros)is a major part of my life.  I spent many childhood years there, both living and visiting family.  As familiar locals, we all knew back then that this story was not going to end well.  However, we could have never imagined the horrible reality. We were in a state of shock as disturbing details came to light. These were details that no half-way decent human being could possibly fathom.  As someone who knows this true story all too well, I must say that this filmaker did his homework. So much, that I almost turned the movie off (something this hard-core horror fan has never done) once Rider Strong was captured.  If you've seen this movie as loosely based on actual events or even fictitious, then it's just another horror flick.  Try watching it now and actually thinking of these characters (especially Rider Strong's) as real people that had a life and still have loved ones and it's more horrible than anything that you could imagine.
