Far and away my favorite Bond movie of all. Many people complain that it's a slow film, but it still boasts some great action sequences (underwater fighting is inevitably going to be at a slower pace than on the ground). John Barry's score reaches its pinnacle here, especially in the underwater scenes where there's obviously no dialogue. Add on to that, one of my favorite Bond girls, the sexy Domino, and Blofeld's rogue-ish Number 2, Emilio Largo, one of the best villains (by the way, this is the first appearence, both in the film and in the book, of Bond's nemesis Blofeld).

One of the biggest factors in making Thunderball my favorite Bond movie is the beautiful locale: The Bahamas. Bond goes tropical! Can't get any better.

This is Connery's last Bond movie where he seems to still be having fun in the roll (he was obviously getting tired of it by You Only Live Twice), and the film sparkles for it. The interplay between Bond and villainess Volpe is especially entertaining.

Arguably the last true classic Bond movie in a row (You Only Live Twice is very good though, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service is vastly underrated), Thunderball feels like perhaps the ultimate Bond movie of them all. Nobody does it better.

I recommend seeking it out.
