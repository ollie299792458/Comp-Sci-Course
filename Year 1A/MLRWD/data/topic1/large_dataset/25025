"Horror" indeed!  This movie is about as scary as a poor little kitten in a dryer.  Now that was repulsive!  I'm a dog lover in the first degree, but this doesn't mean that I hate cats.  In fact, I think hurting any animal is a terrible thing, but you knew it was going to happen.  In fact, you knew everything that was going to happen before it even entered the script, simply because the title alone is cliche'd, so shame on me for expecting something else.  At least a viewer would have the decency to dislike it highly after being exposed to such a lousy film.  Leighton Meester is the only cast member under 30 that I ever heard of before, and that's only because I admittedly watch Lifetime once in a while.  Minka Kelly's character takes so long to figure out what kind of psycho she's living with you wonder how low of an IQ even a fashion designer has to have to get into THAT college.  When the writing's on the wall, READ it!

I am surprised at the appearance of an excellent actress like Francis Fisher in this poor ripoff of Single White Female and Fatal Attraction, but they can have Billy Zane, the king of heavy eyeliner, because he's appallingly bad no matter what movie he's in, so he fits right in with the younger cast.  I have never seen anyone so old playing roles that are a desperate attempt to make him look cool to an audience so far out of his age range.  It's time for him to play daddies and bosses instead of some funky looking enigma, because he can't carry it off any better than the stiff and lifeless Dermott Mulroney can play romantic roles.

Full of overused cliche's, a bad script, and predictable from start to finish, this movie is a complete waste of time.  It's not boring, but it does leave you rolling your eyes so much that you resemble Little Orphan Annie all too frequently.  Hell, now that I think about it, you're better off watching Annie.  It's not nearly as insulting to your intelligence.
