It takes a pretty mean monster to make Schwarzenegger shake in his boots.
An elite cadre of military rescue specialists find themselves stuck in a hostile jungle, pursued by an enemy they cannot see. One by one, they are picked off, until only the team leader (Schwarzenegger) is left to face the invisible foe. Nothing could prepare him for the truth--his opponent is a trophy hunter from another world. And it's armed to the teeth.
Because "Predator" is a somewhat hokey premise, it would have been an easy movie to screw up. Instead, it fires on all cylinders. The jungle combat is deftly staged, and the characters are memorable and entertaining. The cast oozes (I'm not done) testosterone, so check your politically-correct sensitivity at the door (and almost everyone is called by their last names). Nonetheless, you feel for these poor guys, once you get a hint of what's after them.
The big payoff comes when the creature is finally revealed. Stan Winston and company designed one of the perfect movie villains, human or otherwise. The late Kevin Peter Hall can never get enough credit for his performance; his body language and menacing stature perfectly enhance the Predator's frightening appearance.
As a DVD, "Predator" doesn't make much of an impression. I'm holding out hope for a more in-depth special edition, including some pictures or footage of the (hilarious) creature they ALMOST used. However, the sound and picture quality are decent, and make much more of an impact than my old VHS copy.
