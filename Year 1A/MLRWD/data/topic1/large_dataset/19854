Here Stanley Kubrick gives a war film.One of the greatest directors here gives a very good film.But he could have done so much more in my opinion.One of the greatest directors to step on this Earth gives his view on the Vietnam war.

The film show's us the character of Joker who we see threw the training of marines in boot camp and how difficult it is and cruel it can be.We also see Private Pyle how he is constantly abused in the training and how tough a drill instructor could be.While drill instructors used be that cruel in the army.Now they cant lay a finger or verbaly abuse a private.We then follow Joker to Vietnam while he is a reporter and seeing in the process how dehumanizing the war is.And how death can change people.

In the film we get great performances from the whole cast.Matthew Modine in probably the biggest role he is ever gotten does very good job.Vincent D'Onofrio gives a tremendous performance as overweight and stupid Private Gomer Pyle.He even broke Robert De Niro's record of how much weight to gain for a film.He gained about 70 pounds,10 pounds more than De Niro.R.Lee Emrey gives Golden Globe Nominated performance for the mean and tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.He was actually a drill Sergeant before he became a actor.And later on his career has he played tough loud mouth characters.He also spoofed his character Hartmann in Peter Jackson's Frighteners as a ghost of the Sergeant .I think the reason that he is a great actor is the discipline he has from when he was in the army.

The problem the film has its that the last part of the film deals with a subject that has been done again and again quite a few times.On how you lose your humaninty.The thing is Kubrick could have thought some other way to end the film.He does everyhting great in the film.But he does something that has been covered in other Vietnam films like Platoon,Deer Hunter and others.But what he does in the film that is great,original and the best thing of the film is the whole boot camp scenes.The realism of the training and the hardship that is with taken trough out it is marvelous thing to watch.Especially with Stanley Kubrick behind the camera.But that's the only thing to mind that is perfect in the film.The later scenes in Vietnam are good to to a extent.This is not one of those action Vietnam films.So I was expecting any of that.The weird thing is how the soldiers are being interview about their thoughts on the war felt not needed.It cut the flow of the film a bit.The sets of Full Metal Jacket is one of the problems of the film.Other Vietnam films like Deer Hunter,Platoon and Apocalypse Now were filmed in real locations being very similar to the ones in Vietnam.Instead Kubrick uses sets in England that make the atmosphere not as real as the jungles in Vietanm.Also the ending with the Mickey Mouse song I still don't get why they put that  in.

Sadly to say as with almost every Stanley Kubrick DVD this is a bare bones disc.No features at all.There are though exceptions like Dr. Strangelove,The Shining and Spartacus even though its not considered a Kubrick film.

This is good war film.Flawed but worthy.Im not big Kubrick fan like my best friends that are nuts.But I do admire his work especially Dr. Strangelove and The Shinnig.Those are perfect films in my eyes.Any loyal fan of Kubrick pick this up.This film is another nice view on how the Vietnam was,how the army training works and how wars change people.
