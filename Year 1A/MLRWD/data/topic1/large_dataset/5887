Unless you like very DARK stories you are probably better to avoid this one and even if you do like dark stories, you can do better.  If you must, watch it on a streaming content provider.  I watched this on Netflix and boy am I glad I didn't buy it.

The first four episodes play through decently enough as it paints a story about a girl trying to overcome hardship and rescue a friend.  The plot up to this point isn't amazing but it's not half bad either.  Only for the final episode, in what I can only IMAGINE is an attempt to be creative and surprising, to throw out the most insane twists out of nowhere that has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING in the story up until then.  A couple aspects you can see coming but other than that, the extreme lengths the developers went to in order to make the ending as shocking and morbid as possible are almost laughable if not such a weak and random disappointment.  It will leave you feeling depressed and baffled.

It does have a lot of fan service and it can be a bit ridiculous (shirt exploding uppercuts) but as silly as it may be, it's hardly different than similar fan service animes, so if you are ok with them you should be fine with it here.

Overall you can just simply do much better for your money.
