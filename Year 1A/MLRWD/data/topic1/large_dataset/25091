I just finished watching this on TiVo, streamed by Netflix.  I'll watch anything with Meg Ryan, pretty much, so I figured this could be a funny, enjoyable film.  As you've seen in other reviews here, the basic story is that when her husband of 13 years tries to leave her for a younger woman, pushy, career-oriented, crazy woman Louise (Meg) won't allow him to leave.  She cracks him on the head with a flowerpot and he wakes up duct taped to a chair.  She's decided he can't leave until he loves her again.  A great movie will make you suspend your disbelief without even realizing it.  I spent this entire film thinking "no wonder he was leaving her, the woman is psychotic."  The "don't blink or you'll miss it" ending drives that home.  At the end you just want to help Ian (Timothy Hutton) find his way into the Witness Relocation Program.  There's a nerve-wracking home invasion element to the story that seems especially awful in light of the fact that the screenwriter, Adrienne Shelly, was murdered brutally during a home invasion before this script was finished.  My guess is she never would have let it go out like this.  It's really a shame.
