I've watched this movie several times and must say that it's interesting, good, and involving.  Election is a satire that's based on a novel.  G. W. Carver High School (in Omaha, Nebraska) is holding an election for student council president.  An ambitious student named Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is running unopposed for the position.  Schoolteacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) decides to encourage student Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against her.  That's basically the gist of this unconventional and intricate satire.  Election moves at a steady pace and never becomes tedious.  The acting from the entire cast is exceptional.  Broderick and Witherspoon are especially convincing in their roles.  The story examines various human frailties (hypocrisy, adultery, lesbianism, etc.).  I also find the movie's character development to be impressive.  There are some funny scenes along with some unexpected and surprising ones, too.  Repeated viewings have helped me to get more out of this film--it contains some subtleties.  Election is a thought-provoking movie that's definitely worth a watch.
