This review is on the VHS tape. DVD is avilable in Peru (South America) but the region 4 encoding permits a limited selection of DVD's available. Anyway, all my other music tapes are on VHS. I'll catch up with the DVD'S later on.
The show is great all around. The picture and sound are VERY GOOD. I have my Hi Fi Stereo VHS hooked up to my sound equipment with four speakers and a 29" Sony TV. Once you crank up the volume you can get an accurate and good feeling of the excitement and the power of The Who's live performance in the 2000 tour. I had heard that P.Townshend was suffering acute hearing problems, but he has clearly recovered because he and the band just BLAST AWAY at FULL POWER !! I can only imagine the sore eardrums of those who had the luck of seeing the band live on the 2000 tour.
The shots (filming)are good although I notice that the editing of the video was done by someone who does'nt know THE WHO'S repertoire very well. The editing misses out on some (few) important action shots and just switches the images to much. But it can pass, it's OK.
The song selection is one of the high points of the concert with the band turning out great versions of WHO jewels such as Relay, Bargain, The Real Me, Let's see action, I'm One, and a wide variety of songs that I had'nt heard or seen played live before. It's great to see the band in great musical shape turn out songs from what I consider their best albums "Who's Next" and "Quadrophenia". Zak Starkey's Moonish style of playing the drums really melts in great with The Who and "Rabbit" fits in perfectly with the band as always. They really give an accurate feeling of The Who in their best 70's moments (LOUD) accented with todays technology advances in sound and instrumentation. Pete plays very well with no worry about his or anyone's ears, Roger gets by OK+ on vocals and The OX is magnificent on bass (his solo on 5:15 is awesome).
Don't worry to much about the guests, they have an acceptable participation and generally don't interfere with what we all want to see which is THE WHO.
I DEFINITIVELY RECOMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS TAPE / DVD YOU'LL GET PLENTY FOR YOUR INVESTMENT. AS A LAST THOUGHT I HOPE THE WHO REALIZES THAT THEY CAN STILL BLOW OFF THE STAGE WITH EASE ANY YOUNGER BAND AROUND TODAY. SO, I HOPE THEY MAKE THE MOST OF THE LEFTOVER ENERGY THEY HAVE AND TAKE TO THE ROAD SOON AGAIN. THEY MOST SURELY WILL PACK ARENAS WITH EASE. I HOPE THEY THINK ABOUT NEW AUDIENCES WHICH WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO RECIVE THEIR VISIT. HERE IN PERU THEY WOULD MEET A FULL HOUSE WITHOUT A DOUBT.
HAVE A GREAT TIME WATCHING THE "STILL" GREATEST ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD. AND HEY WATCH THE CONCERT AT FULL VOLUME !!!  &iexcl;&iexcl;LONG LIVE ROCK AND THE WHO!!
