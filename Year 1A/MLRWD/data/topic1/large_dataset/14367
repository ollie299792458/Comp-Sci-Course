So this review is more for the product and not the series. I've been a fan of the series for quite some time, hence why I got this complete series.

So, previous reviews had indicated that the box set came in the pink packaging that the BluRay version comes in and other peoples reviews had indicated that it came in the picture shown above. I was really confused but I'm here to tell you that I bought from this page (in other words, I bought the non BluRay version), and was slightly surprised as to what I found considering some of the one star reviews and all. This product does indeed come with all the episodes with some fun extras, the thing that will throw you off is the fact it comes in a case that is the size of a normal DVD case. All four discs were in there, it was just cleverly placed to be compact. The inside is organized according to episode place and name. The front cover is the one indicated on this page, not the pink version. It came with a slipcover to boot, which I thought was nice. All in all, it was very organized and professional considering who has the rights to it. (Yeah, I'm talking to you Rumination) The price I wasn't too thrilled about, which is why I saved up for it.

I know some previous reviews pointed out some mistakes from the dubbed version, which is correct. However these mistakes are hard to find unless your listening close. I personally like the English voice actors (the same guy who does Kyotos voice does Sebastains voice from Kuroshitsuji! *swoon*), but again, this is all just my opinion.

Anyway, I hope this review helped a little!
