First off, let's not be too analytical about this video. Some of the reviewers need to chill out. I grew up listening to Van Halen. They were definitely a step up with Sammy. I thought they were great with Roth but limited. Roth doesn't evolve, this is obvious, look at him now. Sammy was successful long before Van Halen, he still is. And as I write this they are touring with Sammy again. 'Live Without A Net' was awesome. I used to own it but it got away.  Yeah, it's 80ish but some people seem to think that quality runs out when style does. That's in the eye of the beholder. As a 'true' Van Halen' fan I think this concert is the best ever because it has just the right balance between yesterday and today. That was a time when things were mostly for fun and you could wear anything. It's more fun to watch a band that is truly having fun and these guys are!! Definitely a rockin' sound. 
Eddie's tech at the time was Zeke Clark. Eddie used a plexi marshall head w/ a variac transformer. The speaker out was directed into a 'load' box I believe, basically compressing it, the hard way. I did this one time and that is -part- of the secret to getting the harmonics he got. He most likely fried some heads because that is very hard on the circuitry. Variac is adjustable so you can really tune the dynamics in ways that no effects unit can do to this day. The sound is much more responsive than just running through a signal compressor. Now Eddie doesn't even come close to the sound he had in 1986. He has perfected his technique so much that it doesnt even matter what he plays through. 
Michael Anthony basically had a vibe going. Thats the way Eddie wanted it. No wonder he killed a bottle of JACK. I gotta get this video again.
