In 1972, Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham wanted to make a horror film that would go further and be more horrific than any movie made to that day. They succeeded.
Two girls go out to a concert and on the way, bump into a group of escape convicts while trying to buy drugs. The group drive the girls to a nearby forest, rape, torture and kill the girls. The group then find a house and stay the night, without realising that their hosts are the parents of one of the deceased. The parents take their revenge in extreme ways.
That is basically the summary of the film - but the power in this film is in the viewing and for the 92 minutes, you are very much alive, on the edge of your seat and cannot tear yourself from the screen. This film is vicious, intense and every bit as extreme as you've heard (probably more so). 
The real power of the film is the way in which its made - handheld cameras and excellent performances make you feel like you're actually there, watching it all for real, a helpless bystander to the gruesome tortures inflicted on two young girls.
Ultimately, for me, this is a 'perfect horror film' - it delivers all that it promises and stays with you long after you've watched it. 
This DVD edition has a stack of extras as well as a fully uncut remastered print, so if you want to see this film, then definately buy this DVD - it's the best available. 
Be warned though - it's no easy ride and probably will give you nightmares..
Enjoy!
