I sat up late last night watching this movie and I have to agree with most that this was the weakest of the Rocky movies in terms of plot and plausibility. The Rocky of the first four movies, who despite his lack of education and slow exterior, is far from stupid and rather shrewd in reading people (except maybe his brother in law Paulie). In this movie, Rocky makes departures from character that brain damage can't explain. It's hard to believe that Rock wouldn't see through a violent upstart like Tommy, trust alcoholic Paulie to be in charge of his finances at all in the first place, or be that distant from his son (though of course he doesn't realize he is at all in his zeal to develop his own version of Mini-Me). And that street fight was just corny.

However, what saved this movie for me was the interaction between Rocky and "the kid" because it was played by a real life father and son. Sly and Sage didn't have to act those scenes-those tender shows of affection (mostly on Rocky's part), and Rocky's heartfelt plea to assure his son of his wish to keep the "home team" intact, were absolutely genuine, and made the movie worthwhile to me (of course, I love sappy stuff like that).

I'm only sorry Sage didn't return for Rocky 6...
