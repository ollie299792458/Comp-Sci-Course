Josie and the Pussycats is one of the best movies I've ever saw.  It didn't do very well at the box office, but its because they didn't market themselves correctly.  There are so much things to rave about, but I think most of the reviews spoil the movie by telling what its about, and I don't think the film makers wanted you to know because they never mentioned the other plot in the trailers.  (Yeah I know my review sounds confusing!)  But the other great things about this movie is that the characters are very likeable and hilarious.  The girls actually look like rock stars, and the music just makes you wanna get up and dance.  I swear after you've seen this movie, you'll have to get the soundtrack.  The boy band DuJour is hilarious, and I loved the I Want it That Way spoof of the Backstreet Boys (although the Backstreet Boys aren't a boy band, they're a harmonizing group)  although I wonder why there's four of them instead of five.  Alan Cunning and Parker Posey are just perfectly cast, and they're such great actors.  In short, JUST SEE THIS MOVIE!
