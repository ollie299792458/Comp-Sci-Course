Alright. I think most of us already know that 'Zombie Holocaust' is not about to be nominated for any oscars. But who defines good taste anyway?

 There were a great number of things about this film that I enjouyed (speaking as an avid horror fan of course). The many involvements of the plot, I found to be most effective.

 The film starts out as though it is set to be a medical/hospital themed horror film, a little like Re-Animator, which would've worked for me because I love that sort of thing.

But Zombie Holocaust reveils its true colors and begins to introduce tribal elements, before the main characters ship off to the island of doom and the film proves to be along the same lines as 'Cannibal Ferox.'

There is never a dull moment and the veiwer will always be guessing.

 The title 'Zombie Holocaust' is a puzzleing one, because there really is very little zombie holocausting going on.

But it is still a zombie movie and holds a proud position in that sub-genre of my horror movie collection.

It must be agreed, that the zombies in this movie were done remarkably well. The make up is probably the best I've ever seen for this sort of thing, and the zombies are scary.

This movie has got it all: Cannibals, zombies, gore galore and a mad scientist to boot. What more could a horror fan ask for?!

 This movie is also very harsh and sadistic, especally the infamous 'vocal cord removal scene'

Yeah, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

 Zombie Holocaust aka Dr. Butcher M.D.  is one of the most individual movies I've seen. Combining primative, tribal elements with medical elements is a rare thing, and the film will not be forgotten for it.

The dubbing is ok. A little cheezy at times (at least on the version I've got), but would we have it any other way?

In conclusion, I recommend this film to any horror fan.

Wether you like it or not, it is undeniably a milestone in horror cinema.
