This video captures Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble as well as anyone could ever hope to.  Bands generally divide into two categories.  The vast majority do their best work in the studio and try with varied success to capture some of what they did in the studio in their live performances.  Then there are those rare bands whose natural element is live performance.  These bands try in the studio to capture some of what they do live.  Double Trouble was definitely the second type.  The performances on this video are every bit as technically proficient as anything Double Trouble ever did in the studio, but they are fluid and alive in a way that is rarely if ever captured in the studio.  Incredibly, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble were actually better live than they were in the studio, a rarity.  I had the good fortune to see them live a few months before Stevie Ray Vaughn died.
I only wish there were some more SRV videos of this quality available, particularly some later ones with Reese Wynans, who I personally think made an incredibly good band even better.
If you buy only one SRV video, this is the one.  Buy this one first in any case.
