First of all, I'm a political science/history major and I'll still be the first to admit that I was a bit sceptical of this series.  I just didn't think that they could make this show as interesting, informative, and especially funny as it ended up being.  After watching about the first disk of the series, I was hooked and it had become my favorite show.  The first season just blew my mind.  I've now watched the rest of them, and they haven't let up a bit.

This is anything but watching an hour of Capital Hill voting on CNN, though.  There's an incredible cast including Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe who take you into the show and the world of politics.  It's nowhere near stuffy; full of humor, love interests, and interesting information.  From the first frame of the episode, you'll be glued to the TV.  If you're interested in politics, or even if you're not, give this series a chance.  You won't be sorry you did.

Martin Sheen is my President.
