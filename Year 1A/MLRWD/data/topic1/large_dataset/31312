I'd always wondered what it would be like if in a zombie movie the dead came back to life, but were for the most part uninterested in humans. This is that movie and the answer is nothing would happen. And I mean nothing. There are some good ideas here, but they are wasted with poor acting, boring dialogue, a confusing plot and poor photography. It looks like the editor ran it through the Final Cut suite's Color program about 15 times. To the filmaker's, here's a hint: Low key lighting and muted colors serve a zombie movie better than a "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" color scheme. But the real problem here is the plot. There are parts of this movie that literally make no sense. At almost 2 hours, a lot of scenes could have been cut to tighten up the plot. Add in one of the most clumsy and ill thought out dream sequences ever, and you have this bomb. This is on the level of a bad student film. But I'm sure if you were to ask the filmakers, they believe that they made some kind of arty zombie film and the poor bastards who don't like this boring waste of time just don't get their kind of "Genius."
