The very concept of family entertainment just doesn't get better than this film!!  I have to admit, I've never actually seen the original Disney version of Peter Pan but after watching this "remake" I would have to believe that the audience would probably get a stronger feel for the underlining power of the messages the original story is trying to bring out.  And in my opinion, there's not a single filmmaker in history that can bring these kinds of messages to the screen better than Steven Spielberg!! Here we have a grown up Peter Banning taken back to his "roots", shall we say, as Peter Pan as well as to rescue his kids from the infamous Captian Hook in never neverland. Along the way he rediscovers the true power of childhood friendship and imagination.  IMHO Spielberg is really at his best working with this kind of material.  He's always done a great job at balancing out visually and emotionally the "earthly" world from the childlike essence of his "outer" world and even at times, bringing them together(Jurassic Park).  I don't think you have to look any farther than Close Encounters of the Third Kind for evidence of that.  I think Spielberg is one that really gets a kick out of playing with our emotions.  I even remembered during an interview that when talking about a scene from Close Encounters, he really never considered the rationality of the scene as much as how he thought it would look visually or feel emotinally.  Kinda brings note to how we experience the world as a child in the first place!! And not to take anything away from his ability to tell stories about the real world because there's absolutely no denying the power of classics such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, or The Color Purple.  But it is indeed his fascination and understanding of childlike innocence that, along with this beautiful film, brings out the child in all of us!!
