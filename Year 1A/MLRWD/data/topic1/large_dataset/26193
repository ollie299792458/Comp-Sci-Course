Wow, all these bad reviews are just one obvious sign of the dull and heartless minds of the new communistic generation. The freaking funniest part is, you are so stupid and self righteous you cant even see the real plot behind the movie. What? its religious? because the women always press the button? Thats it? Thats as far as you can think? You FOKING liberals are so self absorbed you failed to see your very own ideals that the movie was drowned in.

You LIBERALS!! Unbelievable. Let me enlighten you.

"Mankind must make sacrifices for the greater good or they should be forced to."  Sound familiar??

Is that not the very agenda of your communist president, Mr OBMAMA? and the rest of you Liberal/Progressives?

God teaches "Freedom" above all! There may always be consequences to your actions, but you are FREE to CHOOSE for your self.
This movie had nothing to do with God. Those people were forced to make choices.

I know what I ought to do. Im gonna go around and kill anyone who claims to be a liberal. Ill call it "MY sacrifice for the greater good."

Anger? YES!!  You want to enslave me for my own good!!!  Yes! it pisses me off!!

And Yet I actually liked the movie. Very thought provoking.
