I'm thrilled with this tape!  I was looking for a low impact, but challenging, exercise routine to do at home.  I used to power-walk every day for years but I injured my ankle and I can't put too much stress on my feet.  I decided to try Pilates again - I tried the Windsor series before, which is good, but it just didn't  captivate me enough to stick with it - but as I searched the Internet I came across this tape and read the reviews.  Thanks, fans!  Your reviews were on target!  Just as you said:  1) the instructor gives clear instructions and cues; 2) the workout is challenging, and you can increase the degree of difficulty by simply modifying your hold on the exercise band; and 3) my favorite, the five 10-minute segments makes this workout easy to get through.  The routine is broken down into 5 segments (upper body, lower body, abs, total body, flexibility), with each one lasting 10 minutes.  I often start out thinking I'm going to do 3 segments (30 minutes) and before I know it, I've completed all 5, which is 50 minutes of workout.  I'm so glad I tried this tape because I know that Pilates is a great exercise for stretching and toning our muscles.  I'm a very physical person and I think this tape is challenging.  I'm here again at Amazon looking for the next of this series to try; It's a good thing to have a little variety.
