Funny... i didn't read the back of the box or read the reviews online.  I liked voice of a distant star very much.  I wish I had read the back of this box, so that when i said to myself "holy ****, this is the next miyazaki", i would have realized everyone else was saying it too :)

In truth, this may not necessarily be accurate.  The art has fantastic detail, the pace DOES feel slower than Miyazaki's works.  That being said, I think in order to draw out the kind of feelings the viewer gets from seeing the work, the pacing is part of the design, and probably intentional.

My only complaint is that we need MORE anime like this, to a wider audience.  You want to prove anime is not just the cartoon network or saturday morning stereotypes, but can engage the viewer on many levels, with a emotionally deep story, this is the movie.

A side, and somewhat humorous argument could be that this sort of anime may be the ultimate answer to making geeky guys watch the equivalent of a chick flick and LIKE IT. (yes, silly I know, but the focus is really the emotional attachments of the characters over time moreso than any other element)
