when i saw Roseanne season two on the shelf with it's little sticker announcing that the episodes were the uncut "Network" versions i was so happy- as one who "whined" about the cut season one dvd i felt almost proud- like we had been heard then I, ever vigilant devided the running time by 24- the number of episodes they say are in the season two dvd box set and came up with an average of 22 minutes- not 24 which was the average leangth of the "network" versions! is it a mistake? did they originaly design the packaging with the syndicated/cut episode running times and not change the packaging instead opting for a cheaper sticker to provide that information or did they just stick it on the same syndicated/cut version of season two they were going to release anyway?
I guess i'll find out if i buy season two and compare the episedes to the original network versions i have.
Just trying to give people a warning unless the studio's are up to their usual cheap tricks. If so Roseanne deserves better, if not re-release season one in the uncut versions and all will be forgiven Carsey/Werner.
