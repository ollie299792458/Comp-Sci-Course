My sister in Atlanta told me about this series.  It sounded so good that I found the set and bought it! From the first episode (which was terrific), I was hooked!!!  Granted, I did find it odd that the few survivors who meet up with each other don't seem particularly happy to see one another (I mean, wouldn't you be a little excited?).  And, found it odd that there wasn't a more cohesive 'plan' once the group got together (why didn't they ever sit down and make some cohesive decisions as a group about where they wanted to settle, what they planned to do in the future, etc.).  And, once they found other survivors along the way that weren't out to kill each other, why did they just have lunch with them and then say, "Well, see ya!"?  It seems there would have been more of an effort to say, "There are so few of us left on this earth, and you have a nice crop of food growing here, and you seem to have room for us, can we stay with you?"  I mean, make a colony already!  But, then I guess there wouldn't have been much of a story.  I did so love this, and loved the characters (even the really evil ones).  Some characters really surprised me.  And, I was NEVER bored!  I was so eager to see Season 3, but then saw on line that there would not be another season.  SO disappointed! It ended with such a cliffhanger and I had so many questions!  Isn't that always the way?  Just when you fall in love with a series (i.e. Defying Gravity, Pushing Daisies, etc.), they go and cancel on you!  I WANT MORE "Survisors"!!!
