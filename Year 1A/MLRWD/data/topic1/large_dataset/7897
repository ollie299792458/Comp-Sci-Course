With the all star cast one just cant help but to have expected more.
The scenery and atmosphere in this movie are just stunning.  The dark gothic feel is as good as any I have seen.  The Insane Asylum setting, with the old methods used in that era to treat people with mental problems is perfectly done.
The special effects in the movie are very well done, but very over used.  The movie felt like they were searching for every odd chance to throw in another bit of flying gore or another beheading.  The plot feels very thin and weak, and it is hard to tell if the CG effect fiasco was to cover for the weak plot, or the plot was weakend by the goal of getting in all the special effects they could cram in.  Unfortunatly with so many of this type of movie anymore this seems to be the case.
As far as the cast, Del Toro just did not do anything for me as the wolfman.  He seemed uninterested and the character felt forced.  I feel that Anthony Hopkins was completly under used in the movie as well.
In the end you are left still waiting, wondering if you missed something that would make it more interesting.
