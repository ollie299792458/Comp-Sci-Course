In my personal opinion this is now the top "Le Nozze", the one which all others are to be measured against. I own the two Glyndebourne (73 and 94) productions featuring outstanding "name casts". This one with new young singers,though I'm sure they are well known in Opera circles, is just as outstanding. Those of you who have had a problem with David Mcvicar's productions (he is known for non-traditional stagings) will find this staging very acceptable (i.e. traditional though set in maybe 19th century?) and enjoyable. Presented in much better sound and video quality than the 73 or 94 versions. The 94 version while in good stereo and 5.1 it is a "full screen 4:3" video version. This version is in 16:9 wide screen w/ stereo and DTS 5.1. The 73 version is "historically " outstanding but allowances need to be made for the video and sound, while not bad,not quite of same guality of the 94 or this 06 version. You can not miss with any of these but if you need just one then this 2006 Mcvicar production is the one to purchase. It also comes with a mini-doc with director, conductor, and members of the cast where as the other two are just the opera.
