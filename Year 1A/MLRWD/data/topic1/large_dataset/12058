I do not fault the filmmaker for minor conceptual and factual flaws in this film.  Performances by everyone involved in the film project more than make up for them.  But in my opinion, there was one unforgivable factual omission specific to the 2003 DVD release.  That is why I assign 4 rather than 5 stars to this DVD release.

Dialogue within the film appears to discredit Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom's statement that he did not blow the hatch cover when the Liberty Bell 7 space capsule splashed down.  When the film was first released, it made sense to include this controversy and the filmmakers themselves cannot be held at fault for doing so.  But in 1999, 38 years after the splashdown and 4 years before the DVD release, Wilhelm Aerospace Engineering helped salvage the Liberty Bell 7 from its watery grave 15,000 feet beneath the sea.  And while no one can say for sure what caused the hatch to blow, their website includes a photograph of the "undisturbed" hatch cover trigger, proving conclusively that Grissom was not at fault ... that, as Grissom said at the time, it must have been a technical glitch.

Because the DVD was released 4 years after Grissom's vindication, this fact should have been mentioned either prior to the film or immediately afterward so as not to cast any aspersions on the bravery of this great astronaut, who later gave his life during the tragic 1967 Apollo fire (along with his colleagues, Edward White and Roger Chaffee).  And, it would have also served as a belated apology for aspersions cast in the film itself and in previous releases of the film on home video.
