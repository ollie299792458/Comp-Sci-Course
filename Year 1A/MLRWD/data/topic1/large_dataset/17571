Ed Harris creates a convincing Beethoven. ( Immortal Beloved committed  crass nonsense  identifying Beethoven's widowed sister-in-law as his beloved.. No historian of standing would try that.)  Composers had copyists. The female copyist in Copying Beethoven is gentle and delightful fictionalizing.  At the real premier of the 9th Symphony Beethoven had an assistant conductor who turned him around to see the ovation at the end.  That passage was done perfectly in this film, it was deeply moving.  Diane Kreuger  does the alchemy of hero-worshiping empathy and self-asserting spunk beautifully. There she speaks for all of us  who love the difficult man as well as his music.  In May I visited Beethove's apartments in Vienna, the Pasqualatie house, and in Heilingenstadt.

In several leading biographies, including Thayer and Maynard Solomon,  I have never read that Beethoven smashed a young engineer's bridge model.  His roughness could have been shown by his berating the engineer loudly, disturbing the meeting, and raising his cane threatening to smash the model, but not going that far. If he was trying to teach the engineer a lesson in self-criticism, that would have been enough. Any notion that Beethoven was jealously  striking at Anna Holst's friend is ludicrous.

Those moments in the film when Beethoven explains his music to Anna Holst allude to how Beethoven 's genius  and soul conquer deafness to attain a higher level of consciousness and then communicate this to us through his music.  One can hear him doing this in his pure, not program,  music  where he is out among the galaxies dealing with things that do not connect to earthly concerns, or talking and thinking fractally with God.

The film's score was powerful, the performances first rate.  Costumes, scenery, stying right on the mark. The film approaches Amadeus in quality.  I sent a copy to my composer son.
