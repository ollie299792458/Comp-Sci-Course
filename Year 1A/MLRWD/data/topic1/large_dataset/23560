About halfway through watching this Swedish gem, something inside me thought, "Wow. You will absolutely never see anything else like this." Songs from the Second Floor is an abstract meditation on the human condition that's loosely based on a poem by Peruvian poet C&eacute;sar Vallejo. This is a very quiet, unadorned film: the camera moves in a scene only once in the entire movie, and the scenes themselves are set in the most mundane of places: sidewalks, apartment bedrooms, train stations, bars. But these ordinary surroundings are punctuated with borderline absurd occurrences: A passerby gets stabbed for speaking with the wrong accent. A salesman sells oversized Crucifix statues but decides that's not where the real money is. Self-flagellating stock brokers move like a herd through the streets while an economist looks for answers in a crystal ball about the problem of work getting too expensive. Some of these strange vignettes work better than others, but all of them ring with a striking sadness about moving forward through life without all the proper pieces in place. It's hard to describe this movie accurately and without making it sound ridiculous, but afterward I felt like I'd seen something truly singular and special - and, despite the stark sadness of the themes, I still felt optimistic at the movie's end. Watch it with a glass of wine and an open mind.
