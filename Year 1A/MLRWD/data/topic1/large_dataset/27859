The movie still holds up today which is a true testament to the writing and directing. Regarding the effects they have not aged as gracefully. The cenobites still look great/repulsive/scary but The Engineer (the monster Kirsty fights over the puzzle box at the end) and The Winged Skeleton Dragon looks both dated and a bit cheesy. Acting, editing, production design and of course the music are however top notch.

The disc both looks great and sounds great considering the age of the movie and the fact that it was made somewhat "on the cheap". There is a pleasant sharpness and depth to the picture but a considerable amount of grain, but I'm guessing that has to do with the intended look of the film and budget constraints. It would however be nice to see an even better transfer than this because there is room for improvement.  The sound is good and the dialogue is sharp and crisp while the excellent music shines through at every moment. The audio is not reference quality by a long shot but works nicely.

The extras are also great but those who have owned the dvd will not find any new material.

All in all this is a great movie and a good disc to add to your collection.
