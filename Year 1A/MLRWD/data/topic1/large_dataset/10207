I can only say one thing short and simple about this film:

I cannot believe I actually finished watching this poorly made movie, and the worst is the dumb storyline and absolutely horrendous acting ever !!

Ok, I can't end this review without saying this, because I just CANNOT, ok?
The main actor, the dad, OMFG, has the worst acting EVER!  It is SO bad that in every single camera angle, scene, view, whatever, he carries the same EXACT expression !  I mean its like watching a robot in a movie playing the main role, like C3P0, but even C3PO has a good voice-over job behind it, but this guy, same exact expression, same exact voice and tone, from the start of the movie all the way to the end !  LOMAO !!!

May be they ARE supposed to be ROBOTS in the movie, because out of all the vehicle accidents they encounter, none of them get hurt, not even a scratch seen anywhere, everyone is unbelievably calm. LOL !!!

The ONLY scene that's worth watching, is this homeless dude trying to steal/rob their van, because that dude, has the best acting in the entire movie !  LOL!!!
