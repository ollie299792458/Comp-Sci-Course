How can you even begin to describe the brilliance, talent and surprises that are Dexter: Season 4??  Mere words do it no justice.  You want to run out and tell everyone who isn't watching it to sit down and pull up a chair.  Each season has it's own flavor, some a little less palatable than others but I always enjoyed the show.  Season 4 is just out of the park good.  John Lithgow is so amazing as the Trinity Killer (not a spoiler) but the depth of his madness goes so deep its unlike anything Dexter could even imagine for himself.  The interaction with his family and slowly revealing the true story was brilliantly told. The "Hungry Man" episode (also known as the Thanksgiving episode) is hands down the best episode of the entire series.  I have never been on the edge of my seat from beginning to end of an episode like I was with that one.  Just as you think the finale is going to be a little on the disappointing side, you're hit with the final scene.  All Dexter fans know that the lid has been blown off and the rulebook is out the window as far as what kind of man we're going to see coming into season 5.  All I know is I can't wait to watch!
