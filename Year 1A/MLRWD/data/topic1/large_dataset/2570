The Untouchables is one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. By simply looking at the cast of the movie it is apparent that it is a must-see film. The film stars Kevin Costner as federal agent Eliot Ness, Robert De Niro as gangland kingpin Al Capone and Sean Connery as Malone.
Directed by Brian De Palma, the man who introduced the world to Scarface. The Untouchables is his greatest directorial achievement to date. The soundtrack is brilliant, it is solumn in some parts but overall it is a blend of classical opera music and a jumpy "Gangster Movie" soundtrack.
The film has a fantastic script written by David Mamet. However, the film's success must be awarded to the actors. Sean Connery was awarded in 1987 by receiving the Academy Award (Oscar) for an Actor in a Supporting Role. I believe that Connery deserved the Oscar; firstly because he had never one an Oscar before and secondly because his acting in the film is astonishing.
I have rated this movie with five stars because it stands in my collection as one of the greatest movies ever made. The Untouchables stands proudly alongside such previous gangster films as The Godfather.
The DVD transfer is excellent. The picture and the sound are extremely clear. Although the lack of special features is frightening; since the DVD only boasts a Theatrical Trailer. Also the DVD is presented in widescreen I recommend that the film be watched in this format so that its full potential can shine.
