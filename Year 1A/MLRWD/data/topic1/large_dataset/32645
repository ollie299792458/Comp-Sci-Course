I have all of the seasons and I would give them all high praise. This show is so well executed at every level -- writing, acting, directing -- it is astonishing it did not receive more aclaim, or survive past its fourth season.  You will be hooked after an episode or two, and you will absolutely want to cry when the last season ends (because you want it to keep going forever).  I am a huge fan of anything involving covert activities (from the fantastic, e.g., Bond, to the gritty and real, e.g., this show) and The Unit just by concept alone is cool (a super covert unit that reports only to the president) but when you see how well they execute it in this series you will just have to shake your head in astonishment. Everything from the way they hold their weapons to lingo and tactics really are spot on (Delta Force veteran Eric Haney was a consultant on the show and his book was the inspiration for the series).
Some have commented that the "homefront" side of the show is soap-opera-ish, and they have a bit of a point, but I think the powerful manner in which the actors/actresses in this show deliver those situations, you are absolutely sucked into that side of the story as well.  Haney said that he wanted to show the "human cost" of war/military service as well as the operational side, and this show is really the first one to do that in a series mode, and does it very well.  It adds a dimension to the show psychologically, i.e., these men have real risk and real lives beyond their black-ops activities, they're not indestructible action movie heroes.
I must say that even my wife has become a huge fan of the show, and she generally avoids violent shows of any kind (even police dramas) so it has wide appeal.  Get it, you won't be dissapointed.
