Wedding Crashers is a riot! The "Crashers" referred to are played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and they have great chemistry together. We easily believe that these two guys are the best friends that they play in the film. The plot is simply enough described. Vaughn and Wilson play two carefree bachelors who crash weddings to pick up women. As the weddings go by we see that Wilson's character is somewhat weary of the superficial nature of their exploits. In a final hurrah to the wedding season the guys decide to crash the wedding of a daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (played by Cristopher Walkin). There Wilson's character falls in love at first sight with one of the Secretary's other daughters, played by Rachel McAdams, and Vaughn's character has a fling with the third of Walkin's daughters, Gloria. Gloria, a wild and cooky character, falls instantly in love with Vaughn and the two buddies end up invited to the Secretary's summer house--much to Vaughn's chagrin. There Wilson tries to make time with McAdams and despite the fact that she is engaged, he wins her over until the guys are exposed as wedding crashers by McAdams creepy fiance. Wilson's character then goes through a period of despair over never seeing his "soul's counterpoint" again. In the end of course, things all go as they will in buddy movies and it's done somewhat more sincerely than usual in this type of bawdy comedy.

Most importantly, this movie is raucously funny! It isn't for kids, but for adults who want to laugh out loud and don't mind some raunchiness, this is a movie for you.
