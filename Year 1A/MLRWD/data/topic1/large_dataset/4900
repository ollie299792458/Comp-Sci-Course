"Dog Day Afternoon" still feels fresh to me.  Maybe because Lumet packed so much talent and so many unforgettable moments into it.  Why should you watch it?
It's the best Pacino has ever been.  (I thought the Oscar belonged to him and not to Nicholson that year.)  Want to see how far into a character a good actor can delve?  Watch his face after he hangs up the phone from talking to his wife (no, not Chris Sarandon -- the other wife).
It's not only the late John Cazale in another of his brilliant 70s performances, but it's Pacino and Cazale together again after the two "Godfathers."
It's the quintessential New York location movie.
Sarandon's near-monologue in the barber shop is so convincing, you'll think, "No way was this guy ever married to Susan!"
Sully Boyar's naturalistic approach to his role of the bank manager might have you thinking, if you've never seen him before, that he's not a professional actor.
James Broderick's performance as the FBI agent is a masterpiece of iceberg acting (in which 90% of what's going on is beneath the surface, making the 10% you do see that much more powerful).
Pacino again, this time -- well, not to give anything away -- let's just say the look on his face the last time he sees the bank staff.
Oh, so much more!  I guess I'll quit here with two final words.  "Attica!  Attica!"
