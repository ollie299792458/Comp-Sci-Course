I've been a fan of this film for years and years now, ever since I first saw in on the Western Channel that we had back when Primestar was still around.  I looked for it on dvd, but never found it and discovered it was in fact, still unavailable.  Flash forward a few years and I'm working at an on the verge of collapsing dvd/video store.  They decide, while I'm there, that they're going to throw away ALL of their video tapes.  I talk my manager into letting me have them instead.  I end up with four thousand video tapes.  In this behemoth I find a pretty good quality video tape of Lonely are the Brave and rediscover how much I love it.  Flash forward a few more years and I catch a newly remastered version on TCM and I'm pissed about my crappy video tape.  I want a dvd now!  And now, finally someone was smart enough to put this thing on dvd, cleaned up and in widescreen.

I'm left wanting on the special features, especially since there's no commentary, but I can live with this.  The simple fact that I now have this cleaned up version is quite enough to quell my years of frustration at Hollywood for not releasing some of their best films to dvd.
