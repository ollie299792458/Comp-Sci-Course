The "Sex in the City" movies (and the HBO series) are excellent cultural documents of post-Giuliani gentrified Manhattan if looked at as satirical commentaries on a certain class of silly women of a certain age, and a particular type of equally silly, female-identified gay men who emulate them. The characters are excellent representatives of mindless consumerism that thinks of itself as stylish and cutting edge, of people incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship who think of this as being independent, of shallow sexual antics that disguises itself as sexual empowerment, and of the class-aggressiveness of the professional middle classes (with a faint whiff of racist exclusion manifest by the papacy of non-white faces in a majority-minority city) that masquerades as urban sophistication. It captures these realities of contemporary Manhattan perfectly, to which may be added similar scenes in Washington, D.C., Centre City Philadelphia, the Castro in San Francisco and several other trendy urban environments. The film itself is of course silly, but that's beside the point. It is a major artifact of the current moment in big city America, the way "The French Connection" captured the urban decay and grittiness of the 1970s. Anyone interested in this phenomenon should definitely see this film, then take a stroll though the far west side of Chelsea, or Login Circle in Washington, or down Market in Phili, et. al. It'll be enlightening as well as a good laugh; just make sure you're laughing at these scenes and people and not with them.
