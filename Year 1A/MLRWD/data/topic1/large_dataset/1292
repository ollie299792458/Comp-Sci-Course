I have read many of the nearby reviews and nothing has been missed, the symbolism and all.  What I may be able to add is before this was available I recorded it off cable TV and pulled it out often to watch.  It is a great shame that this movie was not taken seriously when it first came out; the Duke rarely gave such an intense performance as he does here.  But Westerns were a dime a dozen and dismissed as kiddie fare despite the advent of the first "adult" Western "High Noon" 4 years earlier.  The photography is fantasatic, the performances are first rate and the dialogue, well, is mostly good.  Vera Miles (also in Wayne's "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance") plays the spinster patiently waiting for Ethan Edwards (Wayne) and her awkward-in-love beau (Jeffrey Hunter) to return from the search for the kidnapped girl while Ken Curtis ("Festus" of TV's "Gunsmoke" and former member of Sons of the Pioneers) romances her with his guitar.  Panhandle Pete Perkins, a Western veteran, is a dotty oldtimer.  Wayne perennial Ward Bond is on hand as a preacher and lawman/military man whose "authority" does not impress Wayne's character.  Patrick (Dad--got-me-the-job) Wayne turns in a good performance as a green cavalry man.  Harry Carey, Jr. is on hand in the search until a fit of rage drives him into the gunfire of the outlaw Indians.  Wayne pays tribute to Carey's father, a cowboy star in Hollywood's early days, in the end by resting his elbow in his hand (a Carey, Sr. trademark gesture) before turning his back on the warm family scene that he has made possible but is somehow foreign to him and wanders rather aimlessly away.  Oscar worthy.  You can get this flick in a set with other great Wayne movies if you like, but don't miss having THIS one.  Incidentally, early rocker Buddy Holly took the line that Ethan often spouts in the movie "that'll be the day" and made it into his successful rock song the following year. All good things.
