Just saw this movie and can't stop thinking about it. Larry Clark might very well be the Fred Durst/Korn/Marilyn Manson/Eminem of the film world where he tries so incredibly hard to show the dark, shocking, disturbing, and depressing world of youth that it's almost as though he's not creating reality at all... but rather an offensive bland of what angry kids THINK their world is encapsulated by... just to profit off these very same children and parents who believe their world to be this way.
OR Clark is a terrific and breathtaking alternative to the happy facade of teen films such as "She's All That" where all life's troubles can be solved by talking to Mom and Dad who love you so much and everyone has blonde hair whilst driving a Miata.
Either way, I'm glad SOMEONE's at least TRYING to create a brutally honest version of teen angst no matter WHAT his motive.
The second half was terrific, for sure, and the photography was beautiful. The music was perfect and the acting was surprisingly realistic and well developed.
