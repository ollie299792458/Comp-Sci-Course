Marc, the main character decides one day to shave his mustache. To his surprise nobody, not even his wife seems to notice. When he confronts her about it she claims he never had a mustache. His first instinct is to assume that everybody is ganging up to play a joke on him, but soon he begins to doubt his own sanity.

The premise of this movie is very original and intriguing. It would've made a great Twilight Zone episode. Unfortunately the whole thing soon turns into a mess. The writing is sloppy. The interactions between the characters are confusing at best, bordering on the nonsensical. At worst the whole thing feels smug and pretentious. The few scenes where Marc and his wife bother to talk to each other like normal people are so loaded with psycho-babble that even Dr Phil would beg them to shut up.

This would've made a great short film. The first 15 minutes were OK but as the movie went on I just wished it was over. The ending is as unsatisfying as it gets. I was left with the impression that writer and director Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re was trying to demonstrate how much smarter than the rest of us he is. All right, I get it, but did it have to take that long?
