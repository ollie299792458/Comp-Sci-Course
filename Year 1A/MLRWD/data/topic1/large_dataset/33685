Andrew Fleming's motion picture "Nancy Drew" (2007 DVD) is a fun, wholesome, and clever who-done-it murder mystery.  Stepping from the mid 20th century teenage sleuth genre this flick brings a refreshing view from Hollywood.

Emma Roberts, in the title role, gives viewers a fresh, happy, and energetic portrayal.  Nancy's world is rapt with fascination for the hunt, reflection upon complex clues, and determination to catch the bad guy(s), all while trying to make that world a better place.  In the end, Nancy solves the murder, makes new friends all around, and shows how persistence and positive attitude always accomplishes good.

This is a fun safe flick!  There is no foul language, no nudity, and no provocative innuendo.  The teenage romance (between Nancy and boyfriend Ned) is innocent sporting only a brief kiss during the final scene.  (Kudos to Bruce Willis for a cameo in this wholesome film.)

This screenplay depicts an interesting mystery that an innovative teenager with imagination and courage solves.  Nancy is faced by a complex and demanding world that she justly confronts and overcomes.  The character Nancy Drew continues to be role model material.

"Nancy Drew" novel aficionados will be well pleased with this presentation.  This movie/DVD is well done and recommended to whole family.
