My 3 year old son loves the tv show, Curious George.  We were excited to watch the movie, but before we got half-way through, he was in tears.  I just fast-forwarded to the end where TMWTYH was holding George.

Here's the thing.  In the show, TMWTYH is warm, generous, smart, has boundless patience, perfect parenting responses and a child-like wonder.  The basic cool dad for a 3 year old (monkey), with some eccentricities (like the yellow).

In the movie, TMWTYH is a bumbling, self-absorbed loser with low self-esteem.  The yellow outfit was a humiliation forced upon him.  The museum is awful and the search for the African idol just underscores the man's lack of character.  The first part of the movie, George is constantly seeking affection from TMWTYH.  George is ignored or shoo-ed away and lands himself in some scary situations where he is unloved and alone.  This is what made my 3 year old cry.  He felt so badly for George.  Even at night, I heard him call out "George-y, George-y."

I'm very happy that the creators of the show chose to rethink the characters in a way that shows an understanding of young children's minds.
