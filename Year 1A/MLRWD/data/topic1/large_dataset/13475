For those of you who may be wondering "Do we need another vampire movie about a hybrid who hunts them down," the answer is yes.  It's about time Blade got to face Dracula, even if they had to call him Drake.  (I still believe he was renamed for the film to avoid confusion with all the other Draculas out there.) I've been a Marvel comics fan for years, and have been very pleased with all three of these movies.  Pac-man was a nice little bonus.  Loved Hannibal King's humor, and Abby was such a bad-ass that she made a great compliment to Blade.  A lot of people are saying Blade seems tired in this movie, but think about what he says.  He tells the police he has killed more than 1,000 familiars.  Familiars!  That's not vampires, sweetness.  All those of you who say this film was bad or tired, or had anything negative to say, I have 2 things to say.  One, it exceeded every expectation of this Marvel comics/vampire fan, and Two, reread Hannibal King's name tag.  I'm only sorry the series is over now.
