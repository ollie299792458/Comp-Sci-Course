I was impressed by the way this film was able to get candid interviews from the people involved. Redford must have been seeking the real truth without prejudice, or he would not have gotten so much honesty from everyone he interviewed.

Watch this film closely. I think if you do that you will see, as I did, that some of the people he talked to know exactly what happened, they are just not saying.

Whoever Mr. X is, he is a coward. How can he allow Peltier to languish in prison for his crimes? This is an outrage.

In any case, the people of Pine Ridge were in a crisis situation when this happened and any and all reactions to a couple of white men in pursuit in a nice car on the rez is understandable. An Indian was also killed in this exchange of gunfire, and no one was ever charged for the crime. Being white does not mean your life is worth more. Give me a break.

As for Leonard Peltier, as far as I am concerned, if he is 100% guilty and committed two executions at point blank range in 1975, he should still be paroled today. Whatever he did or did not do, the man is totally rehabilitated. He is a light to the Oglalas, and he ought to be free. He is also a diabetic and may not have long to live.

He's in jail because (in my opinion) there is some power struggle going on over land in South Dakota and over the relationship of Indians (NATIVE Americans) to the rest of us. I don't fully understand it, but I know that by now, any white man convicted of the same crimes probably would have been paroled.

This is an injustice.
