Goodfellas is a raw adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. It follows the lifelong journey of an Irish-American mobster named Henry Hill. The movie starts with his childhood, growing up poor and his infatuation with the people that were feared and the people with the power-mobsters. Henry gets a job with the mobsters at the cabstand. His job is basically an apprenticeship with the leader Paulie Later in the film, Hil is all grown up and is a big time mobster. the adult Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta in the performance of his career. Liotta also does the voice overs throughout the movie. You are then introduced to some of his friends played by DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and his wife played by Soprano's star Lorraine Bracco. The great thing about this movie is how real it is. The mob movies that came before only focused on the good parts aboutmob life, but this film focuses on all aspects; the pressure from the hierarchy, the constant running away from the police, the conflict of interest between prison time r ratting out your friends. The film is directed by Martin Scorcese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) and is similar to the other two films in the sense that it is a character study on the rise and fall of a man. This film is truly one for the ages.
