A quite surprisingly good movie about the civil war told from a different angle.  An amazing array of actors, all doing a superb job.  Tobey Maguire doing a nicely understated portrayal of Jake.  He always does a great job in his roles.  For an Aussie Simon Baker effects an excellent portrayal of a southern, somewhat rogueish, gentleman.  For an Irish lad with a beautiful brogue from County Cork, Jonathan Rhys Meyers portrays southerner "Pitt" very convincingly.  Of course he is always excellent as troubled, menacing characters.  It would be refreshing to see him in some lighter fare, where his character is not even as brooding as in "Bend It Like Beckham" (also excellent).  I barely recognized Jonathan Brandis, he was all grown up - I will miss what kind of actor he would have become, may he finally rest in peace.
I am surprised that this movie wasn't properly released in the US &amp; Canada given the talent that is in it.  If you are a fan of any one of the actors in this movie, give it a chance.  I suspect you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was to find a movie worth renting on it's own merit.  Enjoy!
