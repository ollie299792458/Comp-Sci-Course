May I suggest that 'surround sound' is turned off???
As all the other reviewers seem to be concentrating on the presentation and not the content of the film, here's my twopence worth. 
Definitely not a kid's film, this is a dark, sensual adult film of the age-old theme of the devil wanting darkness to take over the world - requiring the services of a virgin and a unicorn. The visual effects and photography are just brilliant, given the era this was made in - you can see Ridley Scott's influence and imagery in the latest Lord of the Rings films. 
The acting is superb;
young Tom Cruise (as Jack) brings off the young lad charged with the task of rescuing the Princess and destroying Darkness with a grace and style that belong to a veteran;
Tim Curry is in his best-ever role here, (even better than Frankenfurter!); the stifled undercurrent of rage is barely held in check as he woos the slightly-willing princess; one is almost convinced by him as he declares his philosophy and aims - "No Good without Evil; no Love without Hate; no Innocence without Lust..." in that rich chocolatey voice; and his laughter and dismissive tone as 'the BOYY!' Jack confronts him sends shivers down one's spine;
and Mia Sara (whatever happened to her?) is both innocence and seduction, and believable in both roles, but her forceful rejection of the Lord of Darkness is as powerful a piece of acting as you will ever get.
Altogether a classic of film-making - seeing it again after several years makes one realise what a masterpiece this is!
Unreservedly recommended. *****
