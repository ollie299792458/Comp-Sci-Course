After Alien I really wasn't sure I'd like this follow up. Besides rarely does a sequel live up to it's predecesor (Star Wars did but that's another story). This has got to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. The setting is perfect, and the fact that you don't know who's going to die next has you sitting on the edge of your seat. This movie is not about gore at all, it has a great story line and some great actors. The marines, for example Hudson has a great sense of humour and seems unafraid of anything until he sees the Aliens. There is a tremendous character growth to all those who come face to face with the Aliens and it really shows in the movie. Even the android Bishop (gotta love that knife thing he did to Drake and Hudson) will have you laughing. My favorite character has got to be Hicks, calm under pressure, brave, keeps his head. Aliens was one of the best trilogies ever (why did they have to make Resurection?!) and this could very well be the best movie ever made too. Get out there and rent it this instant you won't regret it.
