I first watched this film nearly 50 years ago, not without a dry eye. 50 years later it had the same effect. The ageing Dr. Isak Borg is about to receive an award from Lund University. Outwardly the epitome of worldly success, he finds himself, neverthless, confronted with his failings and weaknesses as a human being and begins to seek redemption from those who are close to him. Wonderful performances, especially from the young Ingrid Thulin, as the doctor's daughter-in-law, at her most radiant.
Throughout the film, which is packed with symbolism, Bergman treads the fine line between dream and reality, poetry and prose,comedy and tragedy, memory and actuality with the utmost delicacy. This is the absolute antithesis of Hollywood. Nothing is for effect, yet everything is effective. Many consider it his greatest masterpiece, soaring over its technical limitations - in Swedish, black and white.
"It is not the drama of events that compels us most, but the drama that is within the soul of every human heart."
