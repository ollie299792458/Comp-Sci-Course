INTERMISSION was filmed in Ireland and you have these Irish actors with their heavily-accented English, which is wonderful but hard to understand at times. This film has been described as a black comedy. Black, yes, but I don't recall laughing at this essentially violent film. If we don't have blokes hitting lasses in the face with their fists, we have cops beating up suspects, kids flinging stones at buses and cars causing wrecks, robberies and kidnappings. And then there is the emotional violence: a bullying supervisor, a deserting husband, people made fun of for the way they look. So this is Ireland? Or a slice of life in Ireland? Well, I hope not. Almost all the characters in this movie seem angry or drifting. That some of them calm down and find a better direction in the end is redemptive for INTERMISSION but the viewer is still left with a bad taste in his mouth. After watching so many of these art house flicks, one wonders if the time would be better spent at the Gaugain exhibit at the museum or on a Louis Auchincloss novel. Something, anything, with a little class and some uplifting spirit.
