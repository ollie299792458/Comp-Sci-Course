Be it interesting and moving at some points, the story is medically unlikely. Personality change after brain injuay happens not infrequently, but usually not in this pattern. Post-traumatic brain often makes people slow, inflexible, and impulsive. These patients may still have some prelearned skills reserved, but often lose the "fine tune" and quick learning ability, such as subtle feeling of emotion, social appropriateness, tolerance to frustration, and short term memory. The morality sense of brain injured people usually become stubborn and self-centered. Most people act better than their inner personality. When brain injured, people may have something called "disinhibition," that is to act more of their inner nature and less of socially learned behavior, which is usually not pleasant. The movie told a story of a naturally kind and loyal person acted as a selfish, greedy, dishonest person until he got brain-injured then turned into his own born-with gentleman. Ask any neurologist and psychiatrist, if they have ever seen such cases.
