Okay, let me start out by saying I think the Bourne Identity is a great movie. One of my favorites. Needless to say, I already owned the DVD that was previously out. Then along comes the "EXPLOSIVE EXTENDED" edition. Awesome! I don't ever upgrade movies when an extended version comes out later, but, I had to make an exception this time. Well, never again.

 I think we can all agree that when we hear the term "extended edition," that means that the movie itself is different-it's longer, has some added scenes, etc. Well, I'm afraid that's not the case here. What we get instead are an ending and beginning, (which you can tell by the quality of the film and the sound effects weren't even finished!!!!!) that add maybe a total of 5-6 minutes, and have to be accessed by selecting an icon WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THE MOVIE!!! The movie then cuts to throw in the incomprehensible beginning scene (which may not work on all DVD players the warning said). At this point I said forget it, I'm just going to watch the theatrical version.

 I have never felt so ripped off by a movie studio before. If you already have it, then by all means, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you don't have it, well, get it because it's a great movie and go see the sequel courtesy of the studio with a free ticket.
