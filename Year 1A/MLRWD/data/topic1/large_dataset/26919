This movie is such a reflection of Pretty Woman, that I almost found myself singing the song.  Instead of Julia Roberts as a prostitute, we get Jennifer Lopez as a hotel maid.  However, besides the obvious similarities, the movie stands alone with the honest reflection of two people from different worlds, who quickly discover they need each other.  The politician who finds himself in awe of the intelligent woman, who reminds him that he doesn't really have a clue what those in receipt of his charity functions truly need, or what their lives are like.  And the maid with dreams of her own, but with a little more fear of success than failure.  This is a wonderful romantic film, and if I had to make a complaint I would have liked to see the politician step into the shoes of the poor for a day or two - as suggested to him.  This is the only place the film ran short, as Marisa did step into the lifestyle of his.  It would have made for a much more interesting, and maybe a little more humorous film.  All in all, this is a highly recommended film, and if you haven't seen Pretty Woman... I'd get them both and sit back for an evening of pure romance and fun!
Oh and how can I forget the character that plays Jennifer Lopez' 10 year old son!!  He's spectacular... now this is a young actor to watch!!
