Hello everyone,
 For everyone who is thinking about taking up kettlebell training, this is great!
I am 42, 5'6" tall and 245 lbs. but weighed more before I started this program. I am an over the road truck driver trying to get in shape! I have tried everything else imaginable, it was either too cumbersome to do in the truck or way too many reps and too time consuming to get any results.
With Lisa's program on my DVD player and a 35 pound kettlebell 3 times a week, I have dropped down 15  pounds and going down. She explains the excercises in great detail from different angles and tells you how and how not to do each excercise. It is very easy to follow and she is such a positive person that you just can't help but enjoy the workouts along with her.
Her workouts affect your muscles so differently than with free weights and your whole body feels more vibrant right away.I have told my trucker friends about this DVD and the results that come from it, this is the best exercise to do on the road.
I have tried other books and DVD's but I gotta hand it to Lisa! She really know's her stuff! For those that gave her bad feedback, some people cannot handle positive people. I thank Lisa for great results and more to come,she is a great inspiration!
