Watching Barbara Stanwyck in 1933's "Baby Face" is a refreshing link to Hollywoods Best Days. All this fuss about the Hays Code-why the family sitcomes that come on TV... everynight in fact... make Baby Face as harmless as watching Buffalo Bob & Howdy Doddy. This is some good watching and is really harmless. I love vintage movies and I think this is some of Stanwyck's best acting next to my favorite picture of her's "Stella Dallas". All the different wierd reviews from others like there's not enough info presented on the disc with the movie. What do folks need someone to explain every little aspect of the flick to them.

I really disagree with the comments that state this movie is what got the Hays code in action. I always read that it was Johnny and Maureen in that naked under water scene from "Tarzan and His Mate".

Whatever... if you like old Hollywood and great acting then spend the 28 bucks for this set as it is well worth it and believe me it's not the dirty movie stuff that it is made to sound like. Sure Harlow and Stanwyck play rough and tough parts but your not watching the filthy sex takes that so many of todays shows base the whole darn story on...if Turner's did that I would never buy it!
