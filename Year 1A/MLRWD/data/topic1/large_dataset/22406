When It was announced that Anthony Hopkins would appear in an action thriller written by David Mamet with support from Alec Baldwin (Glengarry Glen Ross)--I looked forward to a brilliant effort--and I wasn't disappointed at all.  Mamet has fashioned a "Deliverance" type thriller but with a twist in that it's about how two men survive in the wilderness and then how they survive each other.  Hopkins finds his niche in Mamet's language and of course, Baldwin, who was already brilliant in Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross" matches him in artistry and wit.  In it's own way, "The Edge" is more of a theatrical piece/play than the 1972 classic with Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds, but it's still very good thanks to the two leads and fine direction by Lee Tamohori (We Were Warriors;Along Came A Spider).  Hopkins in fact later saw it on video and proclaimed to be a pretty good little action flick--I doubt that you'll be disappointed at all. The Blu-ray version is several notches better than the standard DVD, particularly in the colors and the definitions of the Canadian Rockies where this was shot.
