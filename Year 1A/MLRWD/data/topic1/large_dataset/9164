I got this DVD as part of a set of Hallmark mini-series and hoped it would be as good as some of the others. The other mini-series were fantasy-based so unrealistic dialog worked just fine in them but this one was full of overly theatrical and unrealistic assertions which not only ruined the story by robbing it of any depth but also made it very difficult for the actors to perform well. After all, it's hard to credibly deliver one sweeping statement after another with little in between to connect those statements or build relationships to the point where they make sense.

I think the writers (perhaps properly) assumed viewers were familiar with the basic characters so they just skipped character development and went straight to having the characters speak in a macro fashion. This was a mistake and the entire miniseries suffers for it.

Timothy Dalton seems to give it his all despite poor material and Billy Zane either by virtue of his character or adequate acting chops does alright. Leonor Varela, unfortunately, is simply not up to the task of playing Cleopatra as she deserves to be portrayed. While waiting for Caesar, she seems to be waiting anxiously for her prom date to show up. In her scenes with Dalton, she seems to be acting in love rather than coming across as actually in love with him. She does look great though and can wear the revealing costumes well.

I wouldn't have bought this DVD on its own and I'm uncertain if I'll watch it again. I like mini-series in general and many of the Hallmark productions specifically but I'm afraid I can't recommend this one.
