I was very skeptical to see this movie when it came out. I figured it was like the boy who could fly so I didn't see it until 2002. It was lent to me by a friend from HONDURAS. My friend Andres said I would like it, if I liked Hoosiers. I liked Hoosiers and Larry Bird is my favorite basketball player of all time but this movie blows Hoosiers away. This shows you even if you feel like you are alone or are an underdog you can do anything on your mind. Don't ever let anyone tell you it can't be done!!!!!! If you see this movie and you don't have any tears of joy or goosebumps you should refocus you life. I did however think the end was corny with the Rudy chant which is why it took me 9 years to see this movie.

This movie is all about passion and drive. Do you have it and if you don't get it, it's what this country is all about.

Back to basketball, I have a question for all.

Do you think Michael Jordan ruined basketball???

HE DID

When Bird and Magic were running in the 80's he came in and created this 1 on 1 thing.

It was unintentional but people saw AIR JORDAN and it was all ahout him  and the team game was dead!!! He became a team player eventually and probably the greatest ever but he created this crap on the court and in LIFE!!
