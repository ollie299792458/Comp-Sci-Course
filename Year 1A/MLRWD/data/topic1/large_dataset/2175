Logistics first: the dvd's are amazing; the movie hysterical, the extras compelling. My particular favorites were the feature on Kubrick's life in pictures and the salute to the man of many methods him self -- Peter Sellers. Both are very informative and fun to watch. Even the split screen interview of George C Scott and Peter Sellers was worth the watch.

As for the movie in its entirety, it is indeed a masterpiece. It is  one of the most well acted comedies of all time. Peter Sellers in three roles of which I had no clue until the end credits, George C Scott as the imature commander who over acted into the zone of perfection, and Slim Pickens as the captain of the fated B-52 bomber that delivers the "release" of war-like and subtle sexual tensions all across the board while riding his phallic like atomic bomb into oblivion. What else can be said, he who makes fun of the end of the world...should be respected and laughed at in all of its worth. Investigate the movie, it only gets better and better...
