This was an awful movie. My sister and I just finished watching it and I said, "If the credits start rolling now, I'm going to kick myself for watching it". Yes, it was REALLY THAT BAD. Never understood the "so called" twist (and I'm not stupid). I never understood "the point" and "the ending" is worse then both, it made no sense whatsoever. We were both looking at each other saying "what"???? Just as another rater put it. Its not worth the watch trust us.

On a moral note... I'm not much for ranting but we both felt naked Nicole Kidman in a tub with a naked ten year old boy raises some obvious objections. I'm not all that "straightlaced" but you just find yourself thinking "it just didn't feel right". For anyone who is sick enough to want to see it, it's not done in a way where you can SEE anything, so don't get too excited about it. You simply question whether a child should play that particular role.

Overall the movie is dark, depressing, the characters are bleek, its uneventful and when you think it becomes "eventful" it's pointless because your not given enough in the film to "figure it the heck out".

In a few words, "don't waste your time or your money, you'll be left very sorry you did".
