This two-disc edition of the excellent 1964 Best Picture winner MY FAIR LADY is out finally in the ultimate DVD release jammed-packed with a chockful of extras that will keep you entertained for hours!! This is a HUGE improvement from the 1998 DVD release with hardly any extras,only commentary,and trailers.The first disc contains the entire 173-minute feature in a beautiful,high-definition transfer taken directly from the 1994 restoration print in its glorious 70mm Super Panavision format (2.20:1),but also has an excellent audio commentary by the film's art director Gene Allen,Audrey Hepburn's singing dub Marni Nixon,and the film's restorationists Robert A.Harris and James C.Katz which originally appeared in the previous '98 release.The second disc is mostly bonus features such as the outstanding 1994 documentary "More Loverly Than Ever" (originally a part of the 30th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set,which is now out of print) which promoted the film's 30th Anniversary rerelease about the making of the film and also the restoration which took nearly two years to complete and is hosted by non-other than the film's co-star and TV's Sherlock Holmes,Jeremy Brett.Also included here are rare production featurettes such as the featurette "The Fairest Fair Lady",The 1963 Production Kickoff dinner,1964 LA Premiere,Oscar ceremonies,and much,much more!!! I highly recommend this DVD for any fan of great musicals and is perhaps THE BEST 'special edition' release in recent years!!! Three cheers to Warner Bros and CBS!!!!
