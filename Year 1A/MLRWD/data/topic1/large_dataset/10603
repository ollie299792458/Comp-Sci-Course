A Silence of The Lambs for the computer generation?  Absolutely!

I have to admit at the outset that I'm not generally someone who's easily creeped out (one of my favorite films is The Exorcist)...and so it was a pleasant surprise when I found myself not only enjoying this movie but really being pushed to the edge of my seat.  I know that to call a movie an "edge of your seat thriller" is a rather cliche review, but in this case, the description fits.

Diane Lane does an excellent job (as she always does) in providing a centered believability to her role, without which the plot here might easily have descended into run-of-the-mill, campy b-movie fare.  Whether it's in a romantic comedy or in a thriller, Lane seems to feel genuine in each of her roles.  I was also impressed with Colin Hanks's performance...which was perfect for lighter moments as well as some white-knuckle, "oh my god" moments.  He is a strong actor in what might otherwise have been a throw-away supporting role.

I'm not going to discuss the particulars of the plot (I'm sure by now that most people are at least somewhat familiar with the over-all premise) however I will say that it was at once basic thriller fare and, at the same time, it went beyond "basic."  An interesting story idea for an age dominated by computer webcasts and privacy/security concerns.  The movie definitely presents the viewer with a disturbing set of questions: how much freedom should there be on the world-wide web (should there be more regulation), how secure are you really, and what about the human condition: could morality be twisted in the realm of cyberspace in such a way as to create a real threat?  Hmmm.....
