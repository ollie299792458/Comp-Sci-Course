YES this version is different from the original Streamline release.  YES it has different voices and dialogue.  and YES, it IS better for it.  the original translators butchered the script, often with hilarious results, with dialogue that often didn't make any sense, thus rendering the story almost beyond understanding.  don't get me wrong, i will always cherish my original VHS.  that's what got me into anime to begin with.  but the fact is, it was obviously done with serious budget constraints and did not get the care and attention it deserved.

with the new version, however, the team went back to the original script and re-translated the dialogue to more accurately reflect Otomo's vision.  the is clearly documented on the bonus disc.  the story is now more understandable, and the "wtf?" bits of dialogue have been replaced with that which makes sense.

an example of this is Kaneda'a original "just when my coils were reaching the green line".  this has changed to the more accurate "just when my motor coils were getting warmed up".  what was also incorrect in the original is in the scene after the gang is arrested when the man pulls a grenade.  in the original, the gang sounds like they are defending the would-be suicide bomber ("what are you gonna do, hang 'em?").  what they were actually doing, as is seen in the new release, is berating the man for his stupidity in endangering them all ("next time why don't you just hang yourself!").

as for those who bash the movie because "it's not Disney'!!!  you are just morons.  the movie was NEVER intended to be viewed by children.  it is an adult feature film.  the japanese don't just make movies for kids.  animation is the major form of cinematic entertainment in japan.  don't be an ill-informed ignoramous.

all in all, the new release is superior.  again, i will always cherish my VHS, if only for it's blatent campy dialogue and for obvious sentimental reasons.  but for viewing pleasure, it's the new release all the way.
