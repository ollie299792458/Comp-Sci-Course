This film has the storyline and action scenes not too far similar from other films which have been released over the years. It may not win the award for the most unique or incredibly written story, but this film offers so much more that other films cant. Instead of the usual Hollywood ripping off a great Asian film, its the other way about, but done really well, as to stand up with other films such as Taken it feels like.

The flow of this film is impeccable, and keeps you watching and sucks you right into the storyline. Everything is done tastefully and the characters are developed quite well to help bring you deeper into this film. The artist rendering of this film is amazing, and it boasts some great cinematography throughout the whole duration of the film, showing great care and attention was put into creating this.

No film is without it's slight annoyances or quirky moments, and having a character that only talks english to everyone is kind of weird as it just doesn't feel right to the flow of the film.

This film is subtitled in english, and it's quite easy after a few minutes to read and watch at the same time.

Overall I found this to be a great film, mainly for its gripping flow and its great look in most shots. The story wasn't bad, but I felt it could of had a little more uniqueness to it, and really been something great.
