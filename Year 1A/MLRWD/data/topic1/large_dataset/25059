"Cheaper By The Dozen" is a great comedy about the importance of family. When Todd Baker(Steve Martin) lands his dream job of coaching a college football team, he has to move his whole family to Chicago. When his wife(Bonnie Hunt) gets her first book published and has to leave town for a press tour, Todd is faced with the dificult challenge of running a household of 12 kids by himself. The Bakers go through many obstacles that test the strength of their family, including the kids struggling to fit in and Todd's job being threatened. Since there are so many kids ranging in ages from 5 to 18, there is a character that every member of the family can relate to. This movie is humorourous, lighthearted, and unoffensive. The only thing that parents might be concerned about is the eldest daughter(Piper Parabo) and her conceited boyfriend(Ashton Kutcher) do make out for about 3 seconds, before the mom puts a stop to it in a humorous way. There also isn't enough to keep children younger than 6 interested.
This is a very disapointing DVD release. I am glad that Fox put both the widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film in the same box, but there are hardley any special features. I like commentaries, and there are two of them on the DVD, but I want to know more about the making of process. There is an interview with the director and deleted scenes. I would have liked to see interviews with the cast, as well as footage of the fun had on set.
Your whole family should love "Cheaper By The Dozen" because there is a little something for everybody.
