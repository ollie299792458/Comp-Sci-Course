This movie is probably Li's best. The movie zips along after the scene where a Chinese drug dealer gets zapped by a whore, who gouges him with long knitting needles. Some of the movie was idiotic, especially the scene where Fonda has to urinate in Jet Li's shop, and where Li's Chinese contact gets shot. The plot basically centers around Jet Li getting framed for the murder of the Chinese drug dealer, and escaping throughout France, from the corrupt police chief and his gang of drug dealers. There is one spectacular scene where Li is in the police station, and destroys a group of 30 martial arts cadets who attack him with sticks and body moves. The ending is triumphant, Li demolishes two massive  bleach blonde twins, in the most amazing show of kung fu yet.  Tcheky Karyo as the police chief has a wonderful charm, and seethes with sinister trickery simultaneously.
Chris Mahon could have gotten a little more out of the relationship between Fonda and Li. They are more like the Honeymooners, always arguing and Fonda wise cracking. The scenes didn't connect. All in all, worth seeing for Jet Li fans.
