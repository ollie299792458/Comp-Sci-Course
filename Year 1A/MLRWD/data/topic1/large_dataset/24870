When I first saw this movie on TV many years ago I liked it. I thought it was a good representation of how things are so magical and scary when you are a kid. However I hadnt read the book before I saw it. I recently read the book and saw the this movie again as was suprised at how much it sucked in comparison. I loved the book and as I read it I kept saying, "Why wasnt that in the movie". Bottom line is that they cut out the majority of the book just to make it marketable to television audiences. That was a mistake. If any book was made to be brought to the big screen it was IT. Come on, the movie weakened one of Stephen Kings strenghts which is his character development. It even made the bond that they each had as children seem so random and weak that it was no wonder that they didnt remember each other when they grew up. When you read the book you wonder, "How could they forget". My advice is to read the book and wait for Stephen King to write the screenplay for this to become a real movie.
