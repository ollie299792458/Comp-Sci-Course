Just a typical day...you slam your fists on your boss' desk in a rage.You feel like passing out, like you're just a number and there's no escape. You wake up in the morning and it's the same thing all over again. The piped-in music everyplace is driving you crazy, and where did all these people in striped outfits come from? Just when you make a run for it, this giant white ball stops you. I grew up watching this with my parents on Saturday morning. Not cartoons? Yeah, we're still a weird family. Our local PBS station showed it a decade and a half after its original airing in the sixties. This series made a big impression on my eight-year old brain. I bought the set a few years ago and watched it again, this time in color! It still makes an impression. Fantastic production values, great acting, paranoia-inducing with fabulous scripts. Patrick McGoohan plays a secret agent who is shipped off to a deprogramming facility by helicopter when he questions his superiors. (It's actually a real village in Wales called Portmeiron created by an eccentric in the 19th century ). Thought-provoking is the way agent number 6's  (McGoohan) dilemma is reflected back into the society we live in. Society vs. individual identity, groupthink, power of suggestion...it's heady stuff and a pschoanalyst could spend hours trying to uncover the layers. I suggest you enjoy it and expect all your expectations to be turned upside down. Bravo! An instant classic. People in Hollywood should be strapped to their chairs and try to learn something from this.
