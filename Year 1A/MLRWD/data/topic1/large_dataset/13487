So the kids at school are talking about this videotape -- you watch it, then a week later, you're dead.
Cute premise for a horror movie.  I came into it only knowing there was an American remake in the works (and shame on it!); however, the Japanese cinematic masterpiece "Ring" is the most frightening, original movie I've ever seen.  And, embarrassingly, I actually had to sleep on a friend's floor after watching it.
Paced artfully, gracefully, and with intelligence, "Ring" begins as simply a clever basis for a horror movie.  Layers of nameless, cerebral horror build as the action rises.  Once the plot begins to unravel, the audience will sit back, smug, thinking, "This isn't so scary after all..." Then, the real horror!
Toeing the line between urban legend and the spoken-word ghost stories of antiquity, "Ring" knows real horror lies in those things unsaid and unseen.  "Ring" left me a broken a shell of a girl, in a state of paranoid terror.  No joke.  Way to go for watching it alone in the dark.
7 out of 5 stars.
