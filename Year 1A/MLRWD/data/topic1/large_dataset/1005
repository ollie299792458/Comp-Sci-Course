The first time I saw "Bright Lights, Big City" was when I was pretty young and knew nothing about drugs. I also only saw Michael J. Fox in comedies like "Back to the Future" and I was absolutely  shocked to see him in this type of role. My innocent childhood hero looked  like a horrible person in this movie--because he portrayed a horrible  person. After watching this film, I vowed to never touch a drug in my life  and I keep that vow. Jamie Conway (Fox's character) is a cocaine snorting,  selfish, scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock  bottom. It took me years before I was able to accept Fox in other roles  after being literally taken in by his performance. As far as entertainment  value, this film keeps you interested but it isn't for casually viewing  because you'll be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that  state of mind stays with you. Did I love the movie? No. Did it do a good  job scaring me off the night scene and from experimenting with drugs. Yes.  Show it in any health class.
