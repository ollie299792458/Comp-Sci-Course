Clean, Shaven is an account of a schizophrenic man's (Peter) attempts to find and reclaim his daughter, who has apparently been placed up for adoption by relatives while Peter was incarcerated in a mental hospital. The stylistic tics director Lodge Kerrigan uses to provide insight into the mind of a schizophrenic -- short sequences where the camera is aimed at something quiet and banal (like the view from a moving car), accompanied by  nonsensical (?) radio-staticky voiceovers -- also succeed in creating some slight tension. That said, these scenes are plentiful and while interesting, can't provide any real narrative pull for the viewer to get caught up in. However, the film's real weakness is that it  wants to be both a snapshot of life as a deranged person and a deft psychological thriller -- a tough combination to pull off. The motivations for Peter's behavior are left ambiguous (in an attempt to mask a would-be twist ending); leaving  Peter a difficult character to empathize with. The story wanders along until a detective begins seeking Peter for reasons related to a series of child murders. The detective also behaves very erratically (he has emotional outbursts alone in his car; he seeks sex with a woman related to the case; and he employs an incoherent logic in pursuing Peter -- it seems impossible that the clues shown would lead the detective to Peter's location). At times it's difficult to remember which of the two characters is supposed to be the crazy one. Throw in a lusty librarian and several scenes of graphic mutilation and you end up with ... well, with very little. Here is a movie that ends up being less than the sum of its parts -- and its parts weren't all that thrilling to begin with.
