When I first saw this movie (recommended by a friend) it was a bit mediocre for me.  However, after re-watching it a few times, I have truely grown to love this movie.

DEBS may be campy, corny, and a bit over the top, but it has a few underlying themes that many typical, one-time viewers won't catch on to.  The fact that this is the only lesbian/gay PG-13 film ever made says a lot.  And it's got an awesome, real-life ending.  There are so many movies that don't represent homosexual relationships as a whole.  In a lot of movies I have seen, there's always the girl dies or wasn't even gay to begin with kinda thing going on (i.e. Lost and Delirious, Head in the Clouds).  But DEBS portrays a normal lesbian relationship that people of all demographics can relate to.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is not Oscar-worthy by any means.  If any awards are to be given for this movie, it would be to Jordana and Sara (Lucy and Amy) for MTV's best Kiss of the Year and possibly to Angela Robinson (the director) for being so damn cool.  It's a lesbian, PG-13 movie that isn't stereo-typical...that says a lot in today's society.

It's a semi must-see for anyone, but I do think lesbians and straight men are going to be the audience that responds to the movie the most because...Jordana Brewster is simply hot in this movie.  Whew.

P.S.  The soundtrack is amazing!
