I love these videos!!!! I've been using them consistently for about 2 weeks and can't tell you how pleased I am with the results. I feel stronger and am proud of myself for taking the initiative to get back into shape. I take the stairs rather than the elevator. I've found that my posture is better. And most important, at the end of the workout I know that I've done something good for my heart, lungs, muscles and overall physical health. I am only in my mid-20's but have a bad back and knees from my cheerleading days. These are the first workout videos that I can complete without hurting or feeling frustrated because I can't do the moves. I completed the 2 mile today and am amazed at how fast the time went and even more amazed that I completed the entire session. If you haven't exercised in forever, are frustrated with videos that are too intense, have a habit of quitting your exercise routine after 2 days, or simply feel unmotivated about exercising then I encourage you to buy these videos and give them a chance. I guarantee you that you will be proud of yourself and your body will thank you for giving it such a great workout.
