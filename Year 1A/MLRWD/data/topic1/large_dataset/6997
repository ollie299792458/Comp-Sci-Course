Spider marks a triumphant return to form for director David Cronenberg after the lightweight and screwball eXistenZ. Like much of his most heartfelt work - The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers to name a few - Spider is a tragic tale of an alienated and afflicted man. We first meet Spider - beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes - as he takes up residence in a halfway house, a dismal limbo between institution and the real world. One look at him and we know in our bones he will never take that next step. He is a man without a future and whos present is overwhelmed by his past. What unfolds is a story of memory and madness as seen subjectively through the eyes of a shattered personality. Cronenberg's direction is brilliantly assured and deceptively economical. And as good as Fiennes is, and he is good, its Miranda Richardson who delivers the films most impressive performance. She will no doubt be overlooked but certainly deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination. David Cronenberg's Spider is a small, sad and beautiful film and one of the best of 2003.
