Wow, it's refreshing to see lesbians that don't look or act like men! Finally something that will open up straight people's eyes! In fact I have many straight woman friends who just love this show, and they even admitted that they could be close to another woman!

Why is it that most gay men take so much care of themselves but most lesbians don't? How can one be attracted to an overweight woman with a military haircut, tattoos all over, B.O. and hairy armpits? Before I get a woman that looks and acts like a man, I rather go for a real man!

The show is so erotic and interesting from the first to the last tape that I could not stop watching it. I was attracted to almost all of the characters in the show, especially Alice.

The women on this series definitely help us "lipstick lesbians" to feel even more sexy and attractive, ready to make every man jealous! ;)

This show helped tremendously in proofing that lesbians can be smart, classy, sophisticated, attractive and sexy at the same time. I know they are out there, unfortunately they are hard to find, but they are out there!

I can't wait for the 2ndd season, too bad Marina won't be in anymore....
