This movie is incredible. As harrowing as "Thirteen" but with a different focus (A.K.A. girl bullying rather than sex, drugs, and cutting in Thirteen, though Evie's subtle manipulation of Tracy in that movie is worth noteing) and suitable for younger audiences. I recommend this movie for all girls and mothers regardless of circumstances. It's a great thing to watch together as it brings up an opportunity for discussion.

Sadly, this is really happening in middleschools and Junior Highs all over our country, and I know I am not in the minority when I say I have gone through similar experiences. Rachel Simmons book, "Odd Girl Out" is worth reading if you need more imformation, but you obviously don't need to just to see the movie. Some of it might be hard to watch, but it doesn't ruin itself with poor, crude humor like "Mean Girls".

Alexa Vega is truly the star in this movie. Her emotion is so strong and so relatable, in all the trauma, in fact, throughout the entire movie she really puts herself out there, a hard thing to do, especially for an actress so young. It shows just how much she has grown up since "Sleepover" and the "Spy Kids" series.

This really is more like a theatrical movie than the workings of a made-for-TV movie. This really is one to see, especially if you have (or are) a young teenage girl.
