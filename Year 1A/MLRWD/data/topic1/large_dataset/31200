First of all IGNORE the BAD blu ray REVIEWS of PREDATOR.

This will always be one of the GREATEST SI-FI/ ACTION / THRILLERS of all time, as will as one of SCHWARZENEGGER`S GREATEST movies.

Like the the PREADTOR this movie grabs from the spine and never lets you go and will leave breathless, packed with nerve cracking suspnse, will made special effects & pulse pounding action, from movie makers MEGA ACTION producer JOEL SILVER ( LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD & THE MATRIX) & ACTION MASTER director JOHN McTIRNAN (DIE HARD & HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER)

MOVIE RATE 10/10

I have owned the movie on all formats VHS, LASER DISC, DVD and on BLU RAY.

NOTE: I campared it to 2004 to PREDATOR SPECIAL EDTION DVD.

FOX made a proper transfer as good as COMMANDO another ARNIE filck from FOX, the jungles are in more detail like you`ve never seen it before, the sweat on the actors, the night and dark scences, the blood dripping from the leaves and trees, the special effects and the action looks so great, see and hear it like never before.

The sound is the HIGHLIGHT of the blu ray format, the guns, explosions, grenades, the Predator`s weaponry, the background sound of the jungle, the water fall and an OUTSTANDING music from ALAN SILVERSTARI (FORREST GUMP &  BACK TO FURTURE) which gave the movie life, never sounded like that which made speakers roaring.

BLU RAY RATE 8/1O

MY ADVISE TO YOU IS TO GO FOR IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.....
