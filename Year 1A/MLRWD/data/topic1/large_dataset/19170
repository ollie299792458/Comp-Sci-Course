I feel lucky to count myself among those who grew up watching modern masterpieces such as "Aladdin", "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty and the Beast" and the like. Nowadays they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Sad but true. (I'm not keen on the Pixar flicks, sorry). I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with "Mermaid" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. "Aladdin" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise. Nevertheless, "Aladdin" remains as enjoyable as ever and much better than most of its successors.
