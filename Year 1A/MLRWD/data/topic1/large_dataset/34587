If you like Vince Vaughn in Swingers and Made..........buy it.

If you like tons of hot chicks.........................buy it.

If you and your buddies rip each other all the time....buy it.

You will get addicted.  It's one of those rare shows that flys by.  When it's over, you're disappointed and want to see what would happen next.

The characters are believable and hillarious in an authentic way.  The dialogue carries the show.  This ain't "Friends."  No contrived little plotlines.  It's just a group of guys living it up in Los Angeles.  When you think about it, the writers actually show good restraint.  It'd be easy to have the guys doing all sorts of over-the-top things.

The real star of the show is Ari (Jeremy Piven).  He's a motor-mouth neurotic agent.  He steals every scene, every episode.  Think Jay Mohr's character out of Jerry McGuire.  Or better yet, an example from Season 2.  Another agent says that Vinny has slept with every actress in town.  Eric asks Ari if he's going to just sit back and let someone bad-mouth his client.  Ari's response:  "I thought that was a compliment."  Classic.
