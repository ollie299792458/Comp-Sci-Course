I honestly don't remember the last time I laughed so hard. This is a movie which will leave you sore for days afterwards. A complicated tale, which actually improves with re-telling, "Lock, Stock" has more quoteable quotes than Shakespeare and is ten times more violent.

Featuring a mix of rising stars, old stars and even some genuine villains, "Lock, Stock" is the tale of a bunch of small-time crooks braced against the might of "Hatchet Harry", a big wheel in the London underworld. Four young hustlers go after the big time in a game of cards and find themselves in debt to the big man to the tune of half a million pounds. They have a week to pay or they start losing fingers...

A chance crossing of paths with several rival gangs finds our heroes with the opportunity to get themselves out of debt in the allotted time but also finds them in a world of trouble. Clever crafting of the script, with its bewildering array of entirely plausible sub-plots, leave the film with a final body count akin to "Where Eagles Dare"...but without any Clint Eastwood characters.

A word of warning though: many people, particularly those unfamiliar with the intricacies of irony and rhyming slang, will find this film extremely difficult to comprehend. This is British comedy at its best and it is really refreshing to see that the genre has survived the Trans-Atlantic kow-towing of attempts such as "A Fish Called Wanda".

Don't miss it.
