Flashdance is probably one of the best movies there is that was released in the immortal decade of the eighties.  Released at around the same time as 'Dirty Dancing', 'Footloose', and 'The Lambada', Flashdance managed to get quite a bit of viewer attention.
The basic plot is that Alex, played by Jennifer Beals, is a welder by day and works by night as a dancer in a bar.
Her biggest dream is to become a famous dancer and go to a prestigious dance school.
As can be expected, a romance blooms between Alex and her boss at the welding factory.
Alex is repeatedly asked out by her boss and she shoots him down every time.
He finally asks her why she won't go out with him and Alex tells him that she dosen't think that it is a good idea to go out with the boss, (And she is NOT referring to Bruce Springsteen when she says this)
Her boss then gives her what I believe to be the funniest line in the entire movie: "Fine.  You're fired.  I'll pick you up at eight."
Of course he dosen't actually fire her that was just his way of getting her to go out with him.
