The first trailer I saw of this film was when I went to see "Million Dollar Baby," and of course felt that it had to a rip off weaker version of the film I was about to see. It turns out I absolutely loved "Million Dollar Baby" and of course that film went on to be named Best Picture of the year at the Academy Awards. So by the time that June rolled around and "Cinderalla Man" hit theatres (and mostly positive reviews) I did not, like many people to a great deal of experts eyes, flock to see this movie.

It was not until the end of July when I was on vacation that I saw it at a small theatre in the town next to where I live in New England did I go out and see it, dragging with me my family who, like me loved "Million Dollar Baby" and was expecting a cheap knock off of that film.

"Cinderalla Man" however proved not to be "Million Dollar Baby," it proved to be better. Russell Crowe (whom I have always felt was overrated in both "Gladiator" and "A Beautiful Mind") turns in what is easily the best perfomance of the year. A tender, heartfelt performance that can be compared to Wallace Beery's perfomance in the orignal "The Champ" (which won him an Oscar in 1931) in some ways. Zellweger is good as Crowe's devoted and caring wife. But the perfomance that impressed me the most in this film (apart from Crowes) was Paul Giamatti as Crowe's manager. I've seen just about every movie that has come out this year and I would find a shame if neither Crowe nor Giamatti would not be recognized this coming award season.

Ron Howard directors the brillant cast in what I feel to be his best movie since 1995's "Apollo 13," and like "Apollo 13" "Cinderalla Man" will most likely remain at the number one spot on my top ten list this year.
