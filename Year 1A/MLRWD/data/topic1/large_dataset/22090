This was one of the best shows of the 80's. While everyone else was watching all the other dreck on prime time TV I was watching this.

There are many reviews here about the picture quality of this set. I think, for the most part, it looks good. There are many shots on here that really do look bad. Don't let that deter you from buying this set.

This show was meant to be a low budget, late night affair. It's no wonder it was never released on VHS back in the day, so these DVD's are all the sweeter for it. So I never expected this to be some over the top digital remaster with corrected sound and color. It would take away the magic for me. These shows were meant to be a little dirty and unpolished. It adds to the atmosphere of the show. These DVD's are exactly how this show should be presented. A little rough around the edges but not quite in need of repair. I do wish they would have kept the original 30 second opening explaining the premise of the show, but I'm sure they felt it would be repetitious.
What I really miss is the 'coming next week' segments at the end of each show. Only the Quilt Of Hathor episode has Jack explaining what happened the previous week. Hopefully on further releases they'll gather these together.

Until recently I haven't seen any of these shows for 20 years. Back in the day I may have seen them twice, maybe three times and seeing them again made me realize how much I remembered about this show. So this was a good nostalgia trip, if nothing else.

So if you were a fan of his show, buy this thing!
