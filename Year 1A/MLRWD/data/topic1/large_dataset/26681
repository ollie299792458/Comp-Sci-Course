The Secret Lives of Altar Boys can be pretty raw in language and deeds, perhaps a bit preteniously so in places, and yet, it merely sets the stage for who these boys are and where they are on the evolutionary scale.  There is a tendency in the beginning to show that these boys are rather "charmed", which makes it that much more startling when their luck runs out in a rather grusome manner.  Vincent D'Onofrio does a fine job playing the priest who is quite willing to endure the misbehavior of the boys, until he gets an inside look of how they see him.  Then, he takes a more serious tone, searching for where he went wrong with the lads?  While not trying to give away the ending, the "loss" isn't really dealt with in a satisfying way.  One would have hoped that a stronger moral character developed as a result, rather than the launching of what might have been in that age the same as becoming a rock star today. There was a feeling that the character suffered, yes, but failed to "grow".

This movie will not fail to entertain.  It's quite believable.  In fact, in places, it's "award worthy" - especially when they find a dog by the roadside - excellently done!

This was given 5 stars because when it was good it was so good that it's not to be missed.  This is an "adult" movie...definately not for young children.
