N.B.:  Anyone reading this review should be aware that the reviewer is a fan or the work of Orson Welles and corect for tht fact!

Critics agree that this film is second-rate Welles.  In my opinion, it is still a very good film indeed. Welles was striving, at this time, to stop the incipient sliding of his Hollywood credibility. He was determined to do what too many influential people were saying he couldn't do:  make a mainstream, popular film which still met his standards for originality and quality, and moreover, to bring it home on schedule and within budgetary limitations. I think "The Stranger" accomplished his objectives. There was some studio tampering with the story, but it remains a very solid thriller with above-average character complexity, realized by dedicated performances across the board. Welles's gifts for lighting and camera work are strongly evident, while not as flashy as in some of his other films.  His editing, particularly as related to pacing, is definitely up to standard. Viewers are cautioned only to avoid computer-colorized prints. "The Stranger" works far better in black-and-white.
