This was the last combined effort between Dreamworks and Aardman animation studio.  Ths film fared poorly in the the box office and only just made back it's $100 odd million budget, mainly because of the amount of other films and people seemingly getting sick of "another CGI film". Those of you who have not seen this gem, you are missing out. The humour is pure british and some will miss the cultural jokes. Scots and Welsh viewers don't have a heartattack when you see the unionjack representing England. It was the best way to get the message across in the movie regarding the World Cup final plot device involving england and Germany.

The characters are well conceived and animated. My favourite is "Le Frog" and his evil henchmen including a frog version of Marcel Marceaux or should that be "MyCell" you'll get the picture.

Alot of Aardman "traits" can be seen in the computer animated characters. The reason for going to CGI was because trying to emulate water in traditional stop motion animation, would have been too complicated, since the story is based in the London sewers, it made sense to go with computer power.

The voices of all the characters are exceptionally cast, including Hugh Jackman as Roddy the upper crust pet rat from "up top". Kate Winslett as Rita a sewerwise scavenger rat with Jean Reno as "Le Frog" and Sir Ian Mckellen as the evil "Toad". There are some slight ineuendos (sorry if I got the spelling wrong) to justify the PG rating. But otherall a brilliant cartoon, which deserves its following. I enjoyed it more than Chicken Run and dare I say it Wallace and Gromit.

My wife loved it at the movies...and for the first 3 weeks watched the DVD virtually everynight.
