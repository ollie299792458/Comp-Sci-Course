I heard from a friend of mine who spent a lot of time in Japan that Lupin III is their answer to James Bond and Batman.  Seeing the movies and videos, I say that Lupin can easily whip either of them.  His humor,  cleverness, abilities, and wise choice of loyal friends (Jigen, the  sharpshooter; Goemon, the swordsman; Fujiko, the femme fatale; and  Zenigata, the inspector), make him overcome enemies and obstacles that  would make Bond and Batman pause.  It's too bad that, while popular in  Japan, Lupin never had much of an exposure stateside, like Pokemon and  Sailor Moon.  Hopefully, the re-release of "Castle of Cagliostro"  would change all that. For some time, I owned the Japanese version of the  film, and with a downloaded English translation, I still enjoyed the film  despite my limited (more like nascent) knowledge of Japanese.  The  well-crafted plot and story, with Lupin and the gang at their best, makes  this my favorite animated feature.  I also own copies of the other Lupin TV  movies (the latest being "Fujiko's Unlucky Days"), but while all  are rather good, "Castle of Cagliostro" is still the top of the  form.  Watching it finally on DVD further re-affirmed that belief.  I  wonder of Spielberg still considers this one of the best action/adventure  films even, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. My advice, get the DVD  or subtitled versions.  Like Pokemon and Sailor Moon, Lupin is best in the  original Japanese, and the subtitles are more accurate than the English  voice-acting.
