.....he might just be the Boogeyman!  Who hasn't thought the cable guy was a hunk and struck up idle conversation to find out more about him? Or talked to the plumber or maintenance guy.  Pity poor Matthew Broderick (War Games) who thought he was just being polite but then gets forced into a friendship that is much more than he bargained for.  I am a lover of dark comedies and this really fills the bill on that count.  The only recent black comedy that does as well is Death to Smoochy.  I am surprised by Jim Carrey's performance which is so powerful it carries the film.  What he won't do (or undo) for a friend.  I've recently been viewing Jim's work from The Mask to The Majestic and am impressed with his talent.  This film is a great showcase for his talent and perhaps just a bit too "dark" for some viewers.  Maybe mothers should take heed and "kill the babysitter" (TV) so their sons won't grow up like that!  I'm gonna be careful the next time my cable guy has to stop by.  The hunk could be another CABLE GUY.
