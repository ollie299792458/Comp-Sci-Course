First off I would like to say this movie was the scariest movie I've seen since the Exorcist, Yes its been a while. I loved just about everything in this movie. I thought the acting was great and the story plot was a breath of fresh air, especially from all the past scary movies i've seen. If your whining about the budget of this film or the "handfull of characters" then just go back to your usual boring horror movies with all the rappers and singers attempting to be actors and actresses. Sure it wasnt difficult to figure out who the killer was, but that wasnt even the main part of the movie and quite honestly i never understood what was so fun about sitting through a movie thinking about who the killer was the whole time. Your reading the wrong reviews if the rating is under 5 stars. This movie was very good and really does have a kick ass ending. I dont think the movie goes overbored on the blood and gore at all, and the fact that the boy covered in blood is very unpredictable will honestly scare the hell out of you. That dude had me guessin through the whole movie. Go ahead and buy this movie i promise you'll like the change.
