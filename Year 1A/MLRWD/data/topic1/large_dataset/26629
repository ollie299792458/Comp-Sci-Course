What can I say, but Wow!  I have grown to love Eric Bana for the incredibly handsome Aussie actor he is.  I saw him in such movies as Troy, The Hulk and most recently Munich.  Sure, he's an okay actor, but let's face it, we like him because he's HOT.  Well anyway, I digress.  I wanted to see him in the film that I've read is the reason that big time American directors, like Ang Lee, sought him out.  I'm really glad I did, because now I love him for the incredible actor he is, and not just for his good looks.  In fact, his looks are not what you'd expect in Chopper.  Eric underwent an incredible physical transformation to play this role, and that is one reason that his portrayal of Chopper is so unbelievably good.  You can also see his comic roots come through a bit and he just does a fabulous job playing a disturbing yet funny character and has the audience just loving it!  I've always been a fan of dark comedies, and love Quentin Tarentino movies.  I think Chopper is a darker, grittier and more subtle movie, yet has all the comedic violence we've come to love in movies like Pulp Fiction.  Let's just say that Chopper gives the audience some things to ponder and isn't in your face with blood and violence, although it is certainly there.  On that note, it is so interesting to me that Chopper is a real guy who is a real Aussie cult hero and that makes the movie that much more entertaining.  Eric Bana does a wonderful job portraying this rather dispicible character who is a legend in his own time, and just like the Aussie's like the real Chopper, anyone who sees this movie becomes enamored with him too.
