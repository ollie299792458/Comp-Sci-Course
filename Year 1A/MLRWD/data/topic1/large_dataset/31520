The middle of the John Ford/John Wayne Cavalry trilogy, this is most certainly the superior of this excellent trilogy. Starring John Wayne as 60-year old Captain Nathan Brittles on the verge of retirement, it has an excellent supporting cast, not the least being the great Victor McLaglen as First Sergeant Quincannon and Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree (a former Confederate officer).

This movie has it all, from exciting action and Indian fights, to heartful drama and romance. The photography is absolutely spectacular and the acting is top notch. The cast obviously has a great amount of chemistry, like the friends that they all actually were (being a part of the famed "John Ford Stock Company"). This transfers to the screen superbly. However, don't expect a garden-variety western, as the action is definitely a background to the story of the lone Cavalry Troopers on the frontier. Even the Indians are mostly portrayed in a way that seems rather historically correct, plus they are not a homogenous group (just like the White soldiers and their families aren't).

In all this is one of the finest movies I've ever seen or owned, with John Wayne's greatest performance of his long career. I highly recommend it to everyone!
