This film is about the victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what they saw in the immediate aftermath and how they lived their lives afterward. It describes the destruction not through impersonal statistics but through horrifying personal narratives and chilling drawings of the survivors.

I am particularly struck by an account of a woman who describes how she, 6 year old at the time, and her younger sister touched the body of their mother and it turned to dust before their very eyes. It is experience like this that made many of the surviving children kill themselves.

Contrast with that is an American TV episode with a Japanese man who ran a charity for the victims. They had the captain of the very plane that dropped the bomb to come forward to offer a "contribution." Talk about obscene hypocrisy!

To make it short, anyone who suggests "Let's nuke the Iraqis" or makes similar statements should watch this first. In the words of one of the featured victims: "This can't happen again."
