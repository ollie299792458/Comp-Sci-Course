As an English teacher, and lover of old films, I would have to say that this version of Dr. J. is exceptional.  I have reviewed several versions, and this one (while certainly deviating from the original text) is by far the best.  Fredric March gives a stunning performance, and the effects are excellent for the time period.  
The 1941 version, as an example, shows a lack of imagination. This film simply modifies the 1932 film and actually is much worse in its adaptation and effects.  The "Hyde" in this film is nowhere near as menacing and terrifying as March's monster.
Overall, the acting is first rate (again, considering the time period).  The film captures Jekyll's struggle with his evil nature and his dual identity in a way that captivates kids in 2003 as well as I'm sure it did in 1932.  Students can see the ideas Stevenson tried to relate through his text come to life on the screen, as well as discuss how Hollywood's adaptations effect the written text. While I doubt R.L. Stevenson would recognize much of his original novel in the movie, he would still be glued to the screen!
