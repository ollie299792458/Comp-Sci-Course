This documentary provides much insight into the psychology behind the last Kasparov-Deep Blue match.  You hear Kasparov discuss his suspicions about human interference (i.e., assisting the computer) in at least one of the games.  People from the Deep Blue team then explain their strategy for the match and of course deny any human help of the computer's moves.

Unfortunately, no game analysis is provided for those viewers who wish to see it.  Though such analysis exists in books and online, I would have enjoyed being able to watch the games replayed on the DVD along with GM commentary.  Perhaps as a compromise, at least key combinations or positions could have been analyzed.

I also didn't really care for the whispers utilized to make various comments during the documentary.  I didn't feel that they  provided any dramatic effect; in fact, they seemed to me like a cheap Hollywood tactic.

Considering Kasparov achieved only draws (as the end result) in matches against Deep Junior and Fritz 3D in recent years, I suppose one might ask, "What exactly does this DVD bring to the table?"  The answer is that chess devotees can watch Kasparov and other famous chess players discuss the 2nd match with Deep Blue and computer chess in general.  Casual players and others without an avid interest in the game might just find this video a bit boring.
