I'm a longtime fan of Ben Stiller's, but this movie left a bad taste in my mouth. What could have been a funny exploration of why some men fail to commit and why chemistry works with some and not others is totally lost in a mishmash of self-congratulatory, immature frat-boy humor (in the worst sense; I loved the frat-boy humor in Something About Mary and Knocked Up). I like Stiller best when he's paired with either a script or a lead actress with some heart, like in Meet the Parents, but in this movie the two actresses serve little function other than stereotypes on extreme ends of a testosterone-driven spectrum. For this movie to work, the wife must be truly awful on a grand scale, but I found myself feeling sorry for her and disliking Stiller's character more and more as the movie went on. The wife won't go deep-sea fishing. Horrors! She burns too easily! She thinks his nickname "Ed" is short for Edmund instead of Edward! That's grounds for divorce right there!

What can a man do? Only run to the arms of the dark haired salt-of-the-earth Mississippi girl who shoots tequila with gusto and laughs at his jokes. Monaghan is likeable but hardly transcends above the ideal good sport girl next door; there is no real personality that would set her so far above anyone else, that I could see.
Never explained is Ed and Lila spent 6 weeks together prior to nuptials and never discussed her job, their debts, their musical tastes, etc. Maybe there is a lesson to be learned there, but it isn't worth the two hours of life wasted on watching this movie.
