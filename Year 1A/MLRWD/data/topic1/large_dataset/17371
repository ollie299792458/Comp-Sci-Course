I am a big Mel Brooks fan, so with that in mind, I am very much undecided as to the funniest movie ever made.  It is either Mel Brooks western Blazing Saddles...or Mel Brooks slapstick comedy, The Producers.  One of the best things about the Producers, is that the basic plot is brilliant, people say to me "Mel Brooks movies are stupid, and have no storyline," however, the story is so creative, that even people like that can't complain, when it comes to The Producers.
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder play two con men, who raise [a] million dollars to produce a broadway play, however, they choose the worst play, worst director, and the worst actors...why, simple...they want the play to bomb on opening night, that way they get to keep all the money they raised...the catch, if the play is a hit, they will go to prison!
Another great thing about this film, is all the characters, even ones who appear for a few minutes are absolutly hillarious!  Zero Mostel, of course, steals the show, however, ever single actor in the film are out to steal it from him, and all of them almost succed!
This is one of only two of his films that Mel Brooks doesn't play a part (The other being Young Frankenstein) however, with the excellent cast, brilliant script, and wonderful music, there is no need for him (no offense Mel, I still love you).
SO...if you are a lover of musicals, comedies, or just a movie fan...I urge you, ...see The Producers, and you can't go wrong with anything else done by Mel Brooks either...and remember "THAT'S IT BABY, WHEN YOU GOT IT, FLAUNT IT, FLAUNT IT!"
