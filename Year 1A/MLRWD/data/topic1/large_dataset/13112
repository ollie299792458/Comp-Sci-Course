These interviews by David Frost of Richard Nixon were very interesting, but failed to really pull me in until the last 20 minutes, when Frost asks Nixon to make three admissions -- of wrongdoing in the cover-up of Watergate, of abuse of office, and putting the US through two years of unnecessary suffering by not resigning earlier.

I won't give away Nixon's response, but it gets pretty powerful right up through the end. You can see that both men were overwhelmed by the moment. Frost is clearly shaken, even as he tries to manipulate Nixon into making a heart-rending admission, and Nixon looks at one point almost like he was in anguish and ready to give in. And in the end, maybe he does, for all intents and purposes.

A lot of the interviews up to that final question deal with the minutia of who did what when, and what Nixon knew on specific dates. Frost was hitting Nixon with quotes from transcripts, in a lawyerly fashion, and at one point Nixon acknowledges explicitly that Frost was playing the role of prosecutor. These parts of the interview were a bit dull for me as I'm not a Watergate buff. I used to know more about the details, but I have long since forgotten them.

Despite the high level of detail in spots, this is a great document and important for people to watch. Highly recommended.
