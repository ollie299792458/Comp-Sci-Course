Burn's "Baseball" is really one leg of a three-legged stool, and the last of the three to be set down. As one of his interviewees says in the opening minutes of the film, America will be remembered for three things: the Constitution, jazz, and baseball. The Constitution was the subject of his Civil War documentary, and he followed that up with the wonderful "Jazz." In "Baseball," he uses the same style and tone established in those films to portray the American pastime as containing the great themes of the nation, confined within a nutshell.

But the point is this: it's really good. It's watchable. It educates. It entertains. Burns tells the stories of the great players, but also the stories of the game itself, it's evolution from earlier games, its codification, its institutionalization, its highs and lows. He looks at the racist attitudes that produced parallel leagues, the troubled labor history of the sport, and the gambling and drug scandals that have threatened to drive fans away. Some of the best moments, however, are the interviews with modern fans who tell why they love the game.

This set is worth the cost, both in terms of money and time.
