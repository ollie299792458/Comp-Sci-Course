To begin with, the 1 star rate is for the seller alone, since this movie is a little masterpiece, yet underrated by many, and IMO Robert Downey Jr.'s best perfomance ever, because I've specifically bought the BLU-RAY edition of this film, however, this seller, iNETVIDEO, managed to send me the DVD edition, if it has been a mistake or not, I guess I'll never know, but I`d like to ask how come someone send you a DVD when you ordered (AND PAID FOR) a Blu Ray? I wonder if the person don't know the difference between both medias, but the person surely knows that a Blu Ray is most often more expensive than a DVD is, especially when it is a recent release, so, at least is weird, wouldn't you say? You order a BLU RAY, you pay the price of a BLU RAY, and yet, you get a DVD? Come on? Since this has happened to me, it could well happen to anybody else, so, you'd better watch out, buy at your own risk, as for me, it has been an awful buying experience, so I'd never buy again from, nor will I reccomend this person to anybody else, someone who sends you a dvd when you order and pay for a blu ray can't be serious, and it's not worth to be on AMAZON team as well. People have the right to know what one may expect if choose iNETVIDEO over other sellers.
