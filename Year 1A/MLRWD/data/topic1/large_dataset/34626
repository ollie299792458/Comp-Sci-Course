From a lifelong lover of L&H films, zero stars, unless negative numbers are an option. These films are lousy through and through, and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them. They are painful to watch and about as humorous as Henry Daniell playing Doctor Moriarty. In deference to the two funniest men who ever lived, these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon Stan and Ollie after Roach sold their contracts.

If you really like Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc L&H set from Amazon.uk. It contains all their shorts (sound and silent) and some of the early movies. It also contains  the foreign language versions, in which L&H and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in Spanish, French, etc. Further, it includes different versions of certain titles.

For "Bonnie Scotland" and "Fra Diavolo," get the separate 2-disc set in NTSC. You'll have to purchase a region-free, PAL converting DVD player, but they are widely available in the United States and will play anything. (Don't buy a cheap one--the good ones are hardly expensive.)
