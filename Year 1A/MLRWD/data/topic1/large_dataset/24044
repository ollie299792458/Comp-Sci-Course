The movie "It's a Wonderful Life" (60th Anniversary Edition) has been beautifully done: the colors are vibrant. The performances of the stellar cast are superb. The message of the movie is lucid: your life matters!

Too often, we mortals equate life with the acquiring of material possessions. And we realize, with the gaining of possessions, that the real value of life is not to be found in possessions. To have a wonderful life is to have dynamic relationships with people - not possessions. Things can never say "thankyou," - people can. To the degree we pour our life into other people, is the degree we will find value in life.

The greatest point of the movie is often missed: our relationships with people will only take on significance as we find a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. It is the living dynamic relationship with God that provides us a foundation upon which we can appreciate relationships with people.

The movie is not preachy!  Get it, and enjoy "A Wonderful Life1"
