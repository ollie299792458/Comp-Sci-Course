Usually Jackie Chan's movies have a substantial amount of humor in them, usually intermixed with the action sequences. To me that has always been a draw, as the dangerous stunt seem choreographed and flawless, the outtakes show a much more painful reality. But the finished work is usually awe inspiring. With this new addition to the Police Story saga, Jackie goes for broke. It's a melange of eastern Hong Kong movie styles and Western Styles. Jackie's inspector ends up falling victim to his own ego and must face of with a band of criminals who aren't in it for the money. They see it as a game, and even make it into a video game. the Inspector starts off rather gung ho, and ends up struggling just to survive and to keep his head above water. With a mysterious partner, he ends up finishing the job, but at a high cost. The action sequences are top notch and vertigo-inducint at times. But, with this film, the plot actually matters, this isn't just a mindless action flick (not that there is anything wrong with that). Jackie Chan seems to want to show off his acting chops in this one, and does a really great job. The action sequences never seem forced, and fits well within the over-the-top villians who are in it for the chaos. There are undertones of the "like father, like son" issue going on (on both sides of the coin) to show the influence parents have in the lives of their children. And all it takes is either one act of kindness or an act of viciousness to turn a child's life either around, or send it down the tubes. I really did like this movie. It seemed to have a lot of Western sensibilities mixed in with Hong Kong filmmaking techniques and I think that makes this movie more universal (even if it is dubbed). If you are a fan of cop dramas, action movies, martial arts, or Jackie Chan then this is a definite must have.
