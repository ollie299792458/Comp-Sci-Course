So what's wrong with loving this "chick flick" (or any chick flick for that matter)? Very little bad language, no violence, no one gets hurt (except those who deserve it), and the guy gets the girl! A couple of hours of delightful, sometimes hilarious entertainment, and well worth the price of admission or price of the tape.  I bought it to add to my collection of rainy-day tapes, and there really aren't many movies I'll consider buying to have on hand rather than just renting from Blockbuster.
Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, the owner of a travel bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, world-famous actress. Their improbable meeting when he bumped into her on Portobello Road and spilled orange juice all over her shirt is just the first of the amusing, though contrived antics that are sprinkled throughout the movie. 
The character actors are nothing short of hysterical. William's incredibly offensive, but harmless roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans) is the most memorable. But there are others, including William's sister and hapless friends, and the brief cameo role of Anna's American boyfriend played by Alec Baldwin. 
The soundtrack, peppered with popular songs including Elvis Costello's "She", also adds to the charm of this movie.
