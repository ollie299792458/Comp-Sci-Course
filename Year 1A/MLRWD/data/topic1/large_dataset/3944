I had someone tell me about this movie and I was like, uh it's a comedy?  The title is so odd, but he swore the movie was just classic Mike Meyers and frankly he could not have been more correct.  This movie is just hilarious, especially Meyer's characters parents, one of which Meyers plays.  I was laughing so hard I had to stop the DVD because I was missing the next line because I could not stop laughing.  Nancy Travis is also quite good, but the lady that plays Meyer's Mom is fabulous, she steals every scene she is in, I mean when she french kiss's Meyers friend La Paglia, I was crying I was laughing so hard.  I always recommend this offbeat DVD to anyone who just wants to have a good laugh, but it helps if you are a Meyers fan to begin with, which I do plead guilty to.  Meyers can be really broad in his comedy at times, as with the Austin Power's movies, but in this pre Power's film, he tones it down a bit.  He and Travis have great chemistry and their romance is actually quite touching. Rent or buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed, honestly I don't know anyone who has seen this film that did not love it.
