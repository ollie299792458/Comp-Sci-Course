...Featuring a rabid St. Benard who turns into a vicious killing machine who traps a wife and child in a broken down car in the middle of nowhere, Cujo takes suspense to a whole new level.
Sure, the first half of the film is pretty paint by numbers stuff that features no horror and gore whasoever, but that was so you can get acquainted with the characters.... Cujo is technically an innocent victim of an evil disease, you can see that King didn't want this to be the typical "evil dog vs. caring owners" storyline... but basically ir comes down to a dog named Cujo getting bitten by a rabid bat. He then goes on a killing spree. Tad Trenton and his mom go to a farm to get their car fixed. Too bad when they get there, the people who were supposed to fix the car get killed by the dog. Then, the car breaks down, and all hell breaks loose.
The problems with the movie are few, but deadlier than the vicious streak of Cujo. The movie is too boring early on, and the ending sucks a big one. Plus, the DVD features no extras whatsoever, just improved sound quality and scene selection. The visuals are the same as they were in the 80's, so dont expect anything too great.
This is not a revolutionary film by any means, but Cujo delivers what King wanted it to: a tale of evil vs. good, but with shades of gray. And Cujo just looks too cool to be ignored for long. I reccommend seeing this movie without a doubt. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
