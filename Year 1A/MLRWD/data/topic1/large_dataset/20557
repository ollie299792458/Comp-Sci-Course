First of all, any review comparing Kick Ass and Super is being unfair to both movies.  They are two films with VERY different goals.  That said, I enjoyed Super FAR MORE than Kick Ass, based on only cinematic enjoyment.

Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page are probably the only people that could create characters that simultaneously make you want to identify with and notify Police about.  To be fair, I love most of what James Gunn has done (Slither is probably the best horror/comedy ever made) and my sense of humor fits the overall tone of this film.  However, this film is most definitely not for everyone.

As with any film really WORTH seeing, it has a goal and a point.  Because of that, there are people who will be offended by that goal and disagree with that point.  Those people will not enjoy this movie.  Those people will most likely be better served by going to see Transformers 3, Cars 2, or the Green Lantern.  If you have a hard time following anything more than generic dialogue, if it bothers you that not EVERY movie has 3D CGI, or if you think movies should just be hollow and meaningless, then you will most likely not appreciate Super.

But if that is the case, then it's your fault and your loss.  Super is a fantastic movie, well made and clearly thoughtfully created.  I watched it several times on On Demand, and will be getting the disc on day one!
