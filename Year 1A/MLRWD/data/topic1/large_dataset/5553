I'm not going to tell you that the acting is Oscar-caliber or that the plot is daring and original.  The "actors" are mostly dancers and the plot lines tend toward the stereotypical.  I am going to tell you, however, that this movie is simply great fun.  Whenever I want to put I smile on my face, I pop in this DVD.
The dancing in this movie is spectacular - especially Ethan Stiefel(Cooper)who is amazing.  Too often dance movies are made with actors who can't dance so that the "dancing" is shot in a way to disguise the fact that no dancing by the actor is actually occurring.  The fact that Cooper, Jody and Charlie are all played by dancers, and in Ethan Stiefel's case one of the best dancers in the world, allows the film to end with a bang up dance sequence that you'll want to watch again and again.  Other reviewers have said that the DVD extras aren't worth it, but the extras are worth it just for the extended dance sequences of "Romeo and Juliet" and "Stars and Stripes".  
And yes, the plots are contrived, but they are engaging.  Not every movie has to be edgy or deep or meaningful.  It's often quite enough for a movie to make you feel good which this movie does in spades.  If you love dance, you won't regret buying this DVD.
