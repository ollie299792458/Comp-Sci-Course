"Gloomy Sunday" ("Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod"/"A Song of Love and Death") is one of those rare films that stays with you a long time after you've seen it. Beautifully written, directed, photographed and acted, it's a magnificent tale of passion, love and death with a wonderfully satisfying ending. Joachim Kr&oacute;l (Lazlo) and Ben Becker (Hans) are standouts in the very fine cast of a story that will hold you from beginning to end.

I wish I had found this film sooner--it's now one of my very favorites. I'm actually surprised I hadn't heard of it. My only complaint is the English title, which I imagine may have had some impact on why it might have had limited release, although I'm delighted to read that it ran for 70 weeks in Boston. Why didn't Warner use the English translation of the actual title, "A Song of Love and Death"? Ah, well, suffice it to say that I'm delighted to have found this film. The DVD doesn't have any extras, but it is in widescreen format, preserving the original aspect ratio, and it has been enhanced for widescreen TVs.

At such a low price it's well worth the cost to own this magnificent film. It's a superb addition to any film-lovers library!
