Once there was a movie named Halloween... Then there was a sequel called Halloween 2. 20something years later, a man named Rob Zombie decided to remake one of his favorite movies (Halloween) to give the series a much needed hand in getting back to what it was all about. No busta rhymes... no "mark of thorn"... no man in black... just the basics. He stayed fairly true to Carpenter's original vision, while taking some liberties, exploring, and coming up with his own. Then the decision was made for him to finish his story. So he penned and helmed a SEQUEL. Rob Zombie has only remade one movie so far in his career, the aforementioned Halloween. This movie is his own thing. Sure it shares a title with a movie called Halloween II, but the reason people don't get it is because it is not a remake. These days, everything has to be a remake for people to understand it. I have been a huge Halloween fan for years, and to say this is the best one is simply not true. It is a good movie though. If you like originality and gritty b-movie style film making, then this is a must see... if you hold on to the notion of a remake, stay away from this because you won't understand. I wish more horror movies were done this way. And i love the fresh air Mr. Zombie has breathed into the series. My only hopes is they don't destroy it again whenever they get around to the once-rushed-now-sitting-on-the-shelf halloween 3D. hmm... A Michael Myers involved Halloween 3? that's going to make alot of people angry... because the original Halloween 3 didn't have myers. hmm... point proven. This is not a remake. If you have a craving for remakes a-la-carte, then keep up with Platinum Dunes.
