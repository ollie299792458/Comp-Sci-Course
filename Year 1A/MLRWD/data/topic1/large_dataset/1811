"Christmas Vacation"(CV) is one of our favorite  Christmas movies, along with "A Christmas Story"(ACS), so I was anxiously looking forward to watching them in HD.  We were terribly disappointed when we saw CV!  Instead of a sharp, vibrant picture as we have seen in other redone oldies, this was grainy and dull (unlike ACS).  After watching it, I put my non HD dvd of CV in the HD player, and saw little difference in picture quality. At times I felt the non HD version had better color!!??
ACS was like watching an entirely new movie, however, and I could see many things clearly for the first time in the HD version.
I rated CV 2 stars simply because I love the story, but would rate it as zero stars for HD quality!
What happened WB?

Update: After posting this review, I sent an email to Warner Bros complaining about the quality. I receved a prompt reply with instructions as to how to get a prepaid return envelope to WB so they could replace it. Dubious, I followed the instructions, returned the DVD, and received a new one after a week or so. Yesterday, still dubious, I watched it. OK, now I have a good quality HD version of Christmas Vacation - just what you would expect from an HD-DVD. Thanks WB! I would now rate it as 5 stars.
