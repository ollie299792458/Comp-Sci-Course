Simon Schama's A History of Britain presents the epic history of the British Isles in a lively, engaging and beautiful manner.  I have a passion for history, and have been plenty of documentaries.  A good documentary gives both a thorough recounting of events and sheds new light onto them.  A great one can introduce ideas that one had not previously thought of, but delight as well as inform, and Simon Schama's work definitely falls into the latter category.

An art historian, Simon Schama includes and explains many beautiful works of art, explaining how they helped tell us of Great Britain's past.  It also includes plenty of panoramic views of the gorgeous English countryside, which one could make a whole seperate documentary out of.  As other reviewers have noted, Schama avoids a dry recounting of events, and prevents it in an amusing fashion that can almost make one laugh out loud.  By the time one is finished with the fifteen installments, one almost regrets it is over.

The episodes frequently revolve around the stories of great leaders and thinkers, and how they changed Great Britain for better or worse.  Some lesser-known figures are given a much-deserved highlight.  King Henry I, whose imposition of a common law upon the realm would inspire the barons to rebel against his gutless, blackmailing heir King John.  King Edward Longshanks, whose utterly ruthless wars against Wales, Scotland and Ireland inspired patriotic rhetoric centuries before the age of nationalism.  Finally, there is Robert "Cock Robin" Walpole, who envisioned and helped to bring about a modern Britain built around money, rather than violent sectarian fervor and the destructive wars it helped to bring about.
