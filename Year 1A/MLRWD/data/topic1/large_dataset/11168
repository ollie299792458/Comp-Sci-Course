Beautiful, beautiful movie.  Anyone who enjoyed the direction in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban should revisit this magical film from ten years ago.

I was ten when I first saw this movie, and I really enjoyed it.  I'm nineteen now, and I recently came across it playing on tv...and I'm convinced it's one of the finest children's films ever made.  Very few films nowadays are of such quality--there is no stupid humor or gimmicky (not to mention annoying) animal characters, and there is no decline in artistry because this film is aimed at a younger audience.

I believe this is a film families can enjoy together.  It is full of imagination and is visually and musically stunning.  It is also moving...I found myself in tears of joy at the end (I do not cry often in movies, and only a few times in my life have I cried tears of joy).  I believe that this movie can reach both children and adults.

This movie, though perhaps unloyal to the book, is still a classic.  It is full of wonderful messages (for anyone looking to enrich as well as entertain the minds of youngsters--you don't often find films that do both).  It is sweet, hopeful, and fun.  I highly recommend it.
