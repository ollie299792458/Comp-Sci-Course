Okay, let's see, what we have here: A film by Keith Gordon, produced by Jodie Foster and it has Ed Harris, Molly Parker next to the marvellous performances of the two leads and a pretty good group of supporting actors? Story and cast are amazing. The execution is flawless. The acting awardworthy. So, why did nobody go and see the damn thing in the cinemas?? Folks- you are really in for a treat: an intelligent, touching and superbly acted film. The DVD is all that you can wish for : 45 minutes of outtakes (which allow you a better look at Mr.Harris and Mrs.Parkers small but perfectly cast parts), more of this wonderfully fitting score laid under the menus , informative commentaries by Keith Gordon on the feature and outtakes, and of course the trailer, biographies and a pretty forgettable featurette (the only weak part of this package). Congratiulations to everybody involved in the production and the DVD: You gave us a perfect evening on our sofa at home. Thanks! If you have a heart AND a brain go and get this film. What are you waiting for? It doesn't get any better than this.
