When I think about all of the god-awful stuff that is marketed out of the movie studios today, I cannot understand why such a gem of a movie as this has not been more popularly recognized.  I bought and watched "Grave of the Fireflies" months ago on DVD and was blown away by it. Even today, I can't shake the impact of some scenes out of my head & heart.

The best anime film I've seen hands down (to me, much better than "Spirited Away")- no flying robots or karate fights or mystical creatures. Just one of the 10 best movies (anime or not) that I have ever seen. And I've seen bunches.

And forget all the war/antiwar babble written in other reviews - Most of them miss the point by a mile, and that's NOT what this movie is about. This is flat out an amazingly beautiful story about love, devotion to family, pride, and basic human dignity in all of us against inhumane situations. It certainly doesn't have a hollywood-pat, happily ever after ending, but that's one of the things to love about this movie.

Movie fans: Treat yourself a 90-minute favor:
- BUY (or RENT), and watch this film on DVD today. (Use the MUCH preferred Japanese, subtitled track).
