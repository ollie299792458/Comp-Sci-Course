Pretty Woman is Julia Roberts's (some of you may know her as the actress who demands $20 million a movie) 2nd movie and one of her best!  Roberts is Vivian Ward, an L.A. hooker who doesn't fancy the job, until she gets asked for directions by a rich guy (Richard Gere) in a silver Lotus. Edward Lewis (Gere) is asking for directions to Beverly Hills, where he will stay on business for the week. Of course, Vivian won't give him directions for FREE! She charges him some money, and she drives him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Soon Gere asks her to stay with him for the week for $3,000, and be at his "beckin-call". Vivian falls in love quickly, and soon finds herself parading around greater Los Angeles -shopping on Rodeo Drive, going to fancy events, etc. with Edward.  The story of this charming movie is NOT just about a Hollywood Blvd. hooker, but it's about 2  very different people teaching eachother some things about life that they didn't know before.  An funny, carefree film!  FIVE STARS!
