For anyone like me who has enjoyed movies all his life, the Criterion Collection has given us a superb gift. They have produced a completely satisying restoration of "The Third Man" with so many special  features, that I feel they have actually enhanced more fully my enjoyment  of a film I have viewed many times, over the years.  Aside from being a  great example for film schoolers to study for techniques, it illuminates a  particular period in history as well as the period in film art.  It was  the first film I viewed today when my Amazon order of DVDs arrived. After  seeing it, I felt I had to come right to the computer share my enthusiasm  with you. This is a wonderful example of what great black and white films  could do so extremely well. The film is truly a work of art. Regarding the  zither: I can only say as a musician, and lover of many exotic and ethnic  atmospherics, I found the zither music to be an enhancement and by no  means, a detriment.  Joseph Cotten is great in the part of Holly Martins.  In fact, the cast was excellent. Even when one supporting actor, a soldier  working for Trevor Howard gets shot dead, we feel a loss because even his  small part added much to the richness of the characterizations. I have  always believed that when an entire cast looks good, one should always give  the director great deal of the credit. Carol Reed deserved and undoubtedly  received high praise for this work.  There is not much I can say about  Orson Welles that hasn't been said. He was always wonderful.  All in all,  it was a brilliant film with lots of great special features such as the  radio productions, alternate openings, and more.  If you love good films,  I don't know how you could resist this one. This what DVDs should be used  for.
