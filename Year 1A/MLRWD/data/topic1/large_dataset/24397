A wonderful movie especailly interesting to me as

a. I have travelled in this area and

b. I also work with visually impaired people in this country.  I knew the movie existed but had great trouble finding any more about it until a Video shop had an old movie festival catalogue and found it had been here in this country in 2000.  It was she who suggested getting in touch with your company.  I am so impressed with the speed the DVD arrived here too.

Not to mention the purchase of new TV as it would only show in black and white and finally a new DVD player which had multifunctions.  Finally it worked and I have watched 3 times already picking up new information each time I watch.

I actually had a Blind walking group here for lunch as it was raining and I was able to play it for them as well and describe  pieces to them.  They loved the sound of the throat singing and some were going home to practise!!!

Amazing scenery too just a fantastic film.
