I love SM, but I was a little disappointed by Pioneer's (the producing company) DVD. The English subtitled / Japanese audio version is wonderful, but I don't like what was done with the English audio. My main complaint,  is that the audio doesn't follow the subtitled (most accurate) translation,  and the point of the movie was changed. The second thing, is that they left  the Japanese music (which I love) along with the english words. The result  is funny at best and makes me wince in pain at other times. I've seen SMR  on VHS subtitled where DiC's music cues were used. Although parts were cut  out, the English audio/music is better than the E.audio/J.music, although  Tuxedo Mask sounds like Allan!  It's WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! In conclusion, I  love the DVD for the English subtitled/Japanese audio version and some of  the extra stuff on the DVD like character info and clips of  attacks&amp;transformations. Too bad the English version didn't have the  English music, and too bad they didn't stick to the subtitled words. They  changed a lot. (Since when has Rini EVER referred to SM as  "Moon-Mama" in ANY version! )
