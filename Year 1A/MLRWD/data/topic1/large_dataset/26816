I have been lifting weights for about 6 months.  Then the first trimester sickness and tiredness took over and I took about a 6 week break from weight lifting.  Today was the first day I tried it and I used this video.  There are positive points and negative points.  The positive is that it's nice that every month (up to 6 months) you get a new workout.  This keeps it interesting.  I also liked that the trainer used different equipment, but then I own all the equipment he used and had it readily available.  I thought that every exercise he did was new and different.  I don't think there was really a single exercise he did that I've done before and I've been working out very regularly for several years.  For the negative, it is not much of a workout.  He says that while pregnant you want to lower the amount of weight and increase the reps, but in the video he does not increase the reps at all.  Most exercises probably average 8 reps, maybe even 6.  I think I'd have to do the video 2x to get a decent workout.  On the plus side, it is very short, so those days you feel like you only have 15 minutes or don't have a lot of energy there is no excuse for not workingout.  Another negative is that the video stops at 6 months, so you're left with no workouts for the next 3 months of your pregnancy (even though in the special features she says she wanted to do a video that covered all 9 months of pregnancy and post partum.  Obviously not this particular video.)

Bottom line, if you have all the equipment ready to go and don't have a ton of high hopes in terms of getting a great heart pounding workout in, this is probably a good video to have for your pregnancy.
