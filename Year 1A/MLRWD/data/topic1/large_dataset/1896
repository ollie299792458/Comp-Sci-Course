Julie & Julia is a film about the parallel lives of two very different women who share a similar hobby. Julia Child is a expat in 1960's Paris with modest origins who develops into a world-famous chef. Julie Powell is a lost Gen X-er living in present-day NYC desperate for an outlet in her life. She stumbles onto Child's enormous Mastering the Art of French Cooking and begins to write a blog detailing her life and luck as she goes through every recipe in the book (yep, that includes aspics- ick). The two storylines are quite different but share similarities, as Child tries to improve her cooking skills and get the cookbook published, and Powell gets more consumed with what was once an innocent hobby in the hopes of being taken seriously as a writer. That's the gist of the film, which is very fun and great to look at but not offering much else. Meryl Streep, of course, is a standout, in a performance that is by turns mannered and lived-in. She elevates the film to a higher level by her lighthearted presence and careful optimism. Amy Adams, on the other hand, comes right out of the Eat, Pray, Love school of aimless NYC women with a slightly sophisticated way with words. In the end her enlightenment is nice enough, but is ultimately bland. Still, the film is highly entertaining, and is as light and enjoyable as any dessert available in Child's book.
