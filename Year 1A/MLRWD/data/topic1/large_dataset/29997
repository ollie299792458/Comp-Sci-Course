The Sex and the City-Second Season is a great item for those who don't have cable TV (unlike me). I get HBO just to watch these shows. Most of the year I don't have HBO, but when June comes, I rush to get it. I have all of the second and third season on tape, but this is a great gift idea for friends. I will probably buy this for one of my family and friends for birthdays or holidays. The great thing about this show is that every woman can see a little bit of herself in every one of the characters. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the character I most relate to because of her fashion sense and her personality (very similar to mine). Samantha (Kim Catrall) is the woman that most women vilify, but wish they were like. She is so bold, daring and downright outrageous. There is a little Samantha in everyone. Miranda is the workaholic of the bunch who seeks perfection in everyone in everything. She is bold like Samantha, but in a different way. Charlotte is the one who you find endearing. Her search for her Prince Charming with a Madison Avenue job and Park Avenue apartment is something to watch. She goes through so many frogs, it is hilarious to watch. 
The second season includes Carrie &amp; Big getting back together and breaking up again (can they ever make up their minds?!), Miranda having a real relationship (with Steve, a bartender), Samantha having a relationship (oh my stars!) with the perfect guy (except for one "little" thing), and Charlotte dating so many guys (your head will spin) and not keeping any of them.  It is a whirlwind of laughs, a few tears, and more, more, more.
This show has all of the elements that keep you tuning in. This is a must buy for all the non-HBOers out there. Buy it!!!
