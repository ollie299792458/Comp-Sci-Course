This is without  a doubt the best movie i have seen. It is simply a joy to watch.
The opening sequence is hilarious, but really establishes this for what it is. That being an honest film.
All the guys, robbers, thieves etc.. arre sitting around a table.
Now, you might think glancing at the coverage that this is a tough, manly movie right?, well yes u are right.
The men a discussing Madonna, yes thats right Madonna, how they like her, what they dont like etc....
Why would tough guys like this be doing this, you and they majority of the worlds generic film audiences ask???
Becuase they are HUMAN!!!!.
Gangsters dont just sit around shining their bullets, talking about murders, and that is what is so great about this film, it shows us the human side to everything....
It is not about the robbery , its about the characters,and as this marvel of a film unveils it gets better and more entertaining as the facts are revieled to us..
Belive the HYPE, this is better than pulp fiction.
" For all i know you could be the rat!"
"all right now your making some sense"
