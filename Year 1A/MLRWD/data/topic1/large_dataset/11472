If a movie is going to be really bad, it should have some camp value added in: i.e. real humor of some kind, some excitement and unexpected events, and some good hammy dialog. This groaner has almost none of these things, at least to my understanding. I did watch this two times over the years, once in the theatre, and another buying this tape for 99 cents. I really do like most science fiction films I've seen in the last 40 years, including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films. So I am qualified to submit an opinion. Lost is Space does have some entertainment value for kids. It is just OK, if you can turn down your IQ rather drastically and lower expectations also. I was able to do both a little the second time, and enjoyed it somewhat. In the theatre, I ended up walking out before the ending. This is the only time I have done this because of a movie. (One other time I did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes, but that is another story.)

Both times I saw this, the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game, and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start? The problem is, it never does. Saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who don't have enough to support their arguments, but in this case it is very true. Nearly every twist and turn of this story (there are a lot for such a bad movie), causes the story to worsen. So by the end, when the story has no ending, one really doesn't care at all. Knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe.
