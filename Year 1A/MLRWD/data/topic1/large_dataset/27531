Jesus Christ Superstar is, in my opinion, one of the best things to have ever happened to Jesus in the Common Era. Norman Jewison knows how to direct a musical (he also did West Side Story and Fiddler On The Roof), by  which I mean that Andrew Lloyd Weber's best ever music and Tim Rice's best  ever lyrics are taken and visualized in terms of the film medium, unlike so  many other musicals (Judas sees a vision of jet fighter planes in the sky  after having betrayed Jesus). But there's much more to the film than just  this. If Weber and Rice gave us soul-spiralling music and ruthlessly brave  new words, the point that Jewison so successfully drives home is that the  story of Christ is fundamentally a story, and by doing so urges us to  analyze why a story can make a difference in our lives. This is very much  in the direction of Jesus' own philosophy. This film is about humanity -  and like humanity, is too overwhelming to be anybody's favorite - but it is  a film every person should watch, and every fourth person should own.
