Northern Exposure is one of my all time favorite TV shows. I actually thought the first half of this season was pretty damn good, and disagree with the notion that Morrow's character was just going through the motions. I think the show gave a good ending for Joel. I think the show could also have gone on without him... but I think they tried so hard to replace Joel by introducing a new "out of town doctor" that it came across as grasping for story lines. Going on without Joel or a new doctor, and maybe gradually introducing new character(s), I think the show could've worked for a while longer at least. By trying to replicate the original formula of the show rather than trying something truly new, it just seemed like self-parody. I try to just pretend that the series ended when Joel left. The new doctor and his wife were a massive shark jump. That said the first half of season 6 was great and I look forward to watching it again... and perhaps after all these years, I'll even look on the last half of the season in a more positive light.

I just wish the show was still around with its mid/late-series energy. Oh well. It was great while it lasted!
