Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!

The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.

The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.

The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  "How long can this go on without being funny," one asks oneself.  "Surely it will be funny next episode!"

Nothin' doin'.

If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a "funny skit" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.

And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug.
