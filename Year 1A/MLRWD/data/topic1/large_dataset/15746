I really, really wanted to like this movie because I'm a fan of a lot of people in the movie: Mena Suvauri(American Pie, Loser), James Madeson(Disturbing Behavior, X-Men) and, Marla Sokoloff(ABC's The Practice, Whatever It Takes). When I sat in the theatre on the opening night I saw that it was half empty but that didn't bother me. I understand why this movie didn't work: It was suppose to be a really dark comedy, it was originally rated R but they changed the script so it would be rated PG-13 but everyone knows that most R rated movies that are aimed at teens(American Pie is an exception) usually flop. When I walked out of the theatre all I could say was,"I chose to see this instead of "The Wedding Planner"? Oh why?!" So unless you are just totally obsessed with really, really stupid teen movies then skip this one. PLEASE skip it! All the jokes were suppose to be funny (duh!) but they were all just really stupid. The only person I thought that did an even not horribly bad job was Mena Suvauri but don't see this because of her. If you want to see good Mena movies then I suggest "American Beauty", "American Pie", and maybe even "Loser"
