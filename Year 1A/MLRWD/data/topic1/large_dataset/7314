I enjoy character studies, and my preferred movie pace is somewhere between "slow" and "stop", so I don't have a problem with any of that. However, "The Secret Life of Words" taunts the viewer that it's leading up to something worth waiting for, possibly something profound, but in the final analysis disappoints. In fact, it becomes almost trite, in a "love conquers all" kind of way.

Tim Robbins' character's chatter didn't make him seem substantial enough to take on other people's baggage, and that detracted from the credibility of his behavior following his recovery as a burn victim, nursed by Hanna (Sarah Polley). And there were things I just didn't "get"; like what was with Hanna and the soap? And the exchange between the cook and the burn patient when the cook brought him his meal; I didn't get that, either. If other viewers can enlighten me, please "comment" below. Perhaps an understanding will enhance my appreciation for this film. I did like the glimmer of life on an oil rig, however.
