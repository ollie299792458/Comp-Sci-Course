This 1970's something TV Christmas story is economically priced, well worth buying and watching. It's an excellent addition to your film library that you will want to watch year after year. The program will inspire you to count your blessings and cherish family gatherings both good and bad as family gatherings often are. For being an older TV drama the DVD picture is clear and crisp. Colors are true and the story line is believable and well acted.  Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton star as the older wealthy separated couple that comes together in the family home and try to gather their adult children for what may be the last Christmas for Asner's character the stubborn self-made man and head of the fictitious Thornton family. Asner's character doesn't have the time or the stamina to travel to see each of his children who are scattered around the U.S.A. and Canada. Asner's goal is to mend fences without letting his children know how very ill he is at this Christmas gathering and so goes the title "The Gathering." Don't miss this one.
