Julio Medem's Sex and Lucia shares a desire for the ethereal with the director's earlier film, Lovers of the Arctic Circle.  While Lovers of the Arctic Circle seemed to be saying that we are all subjects to our own personal fate, and that its sometimes comic, sometimes tragic but always futile to fight this, Sex and Lucia seems to imply that there are always second chances in life.
Sex and Lucia's plot is rather complex in that it moves forward and back in time, and in fact one of the main characters is a writer and at some point the plot is unclear whether the film is reality or just the writer's vision...  Lucia loves the writer Lorenzo, who may have a daughter with another woman, Elena.  Lorenzo attempts to meet his daughter, but in the process starts a relationship with the girl's nanny...  eventually, Lucia ends up on an island with Elena and the nanny's lover.  The island itself is a dreamlike place, shot in bright, bleached out colors, and seems to be removed from life and reality itself.  Its a place where people are reunited, and have a chance to join their stories in the middle again:  a place of second chances.
I apologize if I'm being incredibly vague: this film itself is full of metaphors and symbolism.  Medem repeats certain themes, like being drawn to the sun and the moon, repeatedly.  Its a hard film to describe, but perhaps an easy film to recommend if you approach it with an open mind.  Regarding the explicit sex in the unrated version, there are perhaps three scenes that surpass what you would otherwise see in a very explicit R-rated film, and they are all well done.  There's some full frontal nudity but it never seems out of place, and flows naturally with the film.  Honestly, if this type of thing offends you then probably even the R-rated version is not the correct film for you.  Otherwise, watch the film with an open mind and be prepared to be stimulated a little in more than a physical sense.
