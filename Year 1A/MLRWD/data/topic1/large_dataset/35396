I thought this was a cool movie when I was in middle school. When I revisited the film as an adult, I realized how terrible and unintentionally funny it is - especially 15 years after the fact. I gave it five stars, because it is gloriously cheesy. It is, in my opinion, all of the over-the-top elements of Schwarzenegger's film career bundled up into one movie.

My friend and I were compelled to make a downloadable "iriff" for the film - a running commentary that offers jokes throughout the whole thing (you can find it at the Rifftrax website).

Eraser has plenty of the usual fare for a 90s action flick: crazy villains, an annoying female lead, a specialized government agency full of corrupt employees, a bad guy with a scar on his face, henchmen who either refuse to shoot or insist on missing, and a climax at (drumroll please) THE DOCKS!

Eraser also breaks new ground. Ah-nuld is forced to do battle with CGI alligators, drag queens, and gravity itself. (Okay, he doesn't actually fight the drag queens. But I think he should have.)

Along the way, Arnold teaches us some valuable lessons. Lesson 1: Don't put someone else's butt on the line just to make your own job a little easier. Lesson 2: Who you really are is on the inside, and no one can take that from you. Lesson 3: When things are at their absolute worst, you can always count on the mob.

Did I mention that the CGI alligators in this movie roar like lions? That alone would merit the five star rating, but thankfully it is just one of the many qualities that make this a timeless classic.
