I have a "Sony" (upconvert-1080p) DVD player.  It does an outstanding job of making older DVD's look amazingly close to H.D. PLUS making the more recently produced DVD's look even better than that!!!  I've had this player for a couple of years and couldn't be happier with it.  So, when I watched these three 1980's Star Trek movies on this player, I was very pleased with the appearance of the films indeed!  After watching these flicks in years past, on VHS and on the "Syfy" Channel, these digitally re-mastered DVD's were just the ticket........as far as I am concerned.

Perhaps it's because I do not have a "Blu-Ray" player, on which to make quality comparisons with.  We do have a 46-inch Sharp "Aquos" (HD-1080p/i), however; which combined with this upconvert DVD player produces outstanding quality reproduction of regular DVD's (not to mention any channel broadcasting in H.D.!).

Bottom line......very happy with the quality of the video reproduction as well as with the speedy delivery on the part of Amazon.com!!!
