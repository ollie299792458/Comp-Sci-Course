I first saw Stir of Echoes on the SciFi channel, and I really enjoyed it. When I saw the film at the store this evening, I pounced on it.

This film is definitely well-filmed and very well-acted. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe are believable as a married couple, and the little boy who plays their son is great. I usually find that children play parts that are too precocious or too (whether purposely or not) annoying, but this boy was quite realistic.

I wouldn't call myself a huge horror or thriller fan, but this one was really good. (It helped that I watched it with the lights on....) The story did get somewhat predictable toward the end, but that certainly didn't stop me from buying it so I could watch it again.

One technical aspect that I didn't like--on the Special Edition DVD, the menus are incredibly annoying; this is probably kind of hard to grasp without actually seeing what I'm talking about. The menu design is supposed to be edgy--the menu names wibble and shift with distortions, and occasionally the text completely disappears. Again, this is part of the design because it corresponds to some scenes in the film and it adds to the mood. However, when I'm trying to actually access the deleted scenes or play the film, I don't want to have to wait and make sure I have "Play" selected while all I can see on the screen is the word "See" backwards. It's minor and doesn't affect the film, but it is a pain.

4/5. Good stuff.
