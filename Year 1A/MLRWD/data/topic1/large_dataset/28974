After reading some other reviews I was a bit apprehensive about buying this dvd . I'm  a big fan of Sir Paul ,so I gave him the benefit of the doubt . . . I was not disappointed . I have seen Paul , live , three times before ,  but was not able to see this tour . I now feel like I've experienced the concert and then some . The editing was very pleasing , typical of what I expect from this consummate professional .What I was most impressed with was the raw emotions invoked throughout the film .The footage of the incredibly diverse audience , so obviously stirred by each song , brought me back to my earliest concert memories . The choice of songs , all about love and positive reinforcement , was a great departure from most of the pathetic attempts at music found in todays music scene . Paul's energy , his new band , and his new relationship were truely inspiring  for this aging Beatle fan. Judging from the huge varieties of age groups , all singing along with every song , this would be a great dvd for anyone who appreciates real music . If your idea of music is an angry , no talent clown , talking quickly over stolen melodies , don't bother with this dvd . . . you won't get it . But, if you want to see a true musical genius , I recommend this highly . I am a photographer and was very impressed with the way this concert was shot , I wouldn't change a thing . I am forty eight  ,I gave it to my  eighty year old mother and eighteen year old niece , they both loved it .
