Ah, Home Alone. Any kid who grew up in the 90's has probably seen this classic at least 5 times. Who could forget Culkin's hilarious performance as Kevin, or the infamous booby traps that the Wet Bandits had to go through?

The story is simple enough. The McCallister family is spending their Christmas in France. The youngest, Kevin, hates his family for the way they treat him, especially his older brother, Buzz. After getting into a fight, Kevin wishes to never see them again.

In the morning, Kevin wakes up to find he is home alone. The family left for France, and due to a counting mistake, forgot Kevin. Now as the family tries to get back to the US, Kevin has the time of his life and eludes obstacles such as the downstairs furnace, the creepy neighbor next door, and the Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv.

What can I say? Even though it's a family film, I enjoy it even to this day. Culkin does great for a child actor, there's a lot of humor, some slapstick, and the booby traps are well thought of.

It might be a little late to watch it this Christmas, but even in the middle of July it's a great film to watch. Any 90's buff should pick this up.
