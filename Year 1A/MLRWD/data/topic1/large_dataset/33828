I showed this to my 6-8th grade students, only one (out of 154) had seen it before. It is called by some a sort of lost gem, before Dreamworks was taken seriously as a threat to the Empire the Mouse Built. I had seen the movie before and hadn't really enjoyed it; I showed it to my students before Thanksgiving vacation and as a sort of history lesson regarding the Conquest (I showed another lost gem, Disney's "The Emperor's New Groove" before Christmas break as a comparison). The movie is rife with tropes, and inexplicably features one Spaniard with a British accent (Branaugh), one with an American accent (Kline), and Aztecs with some sort of strange quasi-Mexican accents. While I had to watch this movie 6 times through, it grew on me, but I still couldn't help looking at is as an attempt to rip off Disney. There were scenes with animation ripped right from Disney films- a shot from the Little Mermaid here, Aladdin there, etc. The Elton John- Tim Rice music collaboration was an obvious attempt to rekindle the musical magic of Lion King... my students loved it, however, so I will probably use it again. The only drawback to this DVD is there isn't a Spanish language track- I usually show the movies in Spanish with English subtitles to immerse the students in the language.
