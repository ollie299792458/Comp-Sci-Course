I'm 16, and I just had the opportunity, nay the privilege, nay the honor of watching Ishtar for the first time.  Now, I sit here, simply letting the magnificence of this classic film wash over me, like a cleansing, rising tide.  This film is the apex of all cinematic genius.  Pray, do not misunderstand my glowing appraisal of this masterpiece.  I do not mean that it was well-made or well-written or well-acted by any stretch of the imagination.  Rather I mean that the stupidity and futility of this movie is truly comic.  All the horrendous facets combine to create a movie, which is, in a larger sense, a much funnier, much more cultured Dumb and Dumber.  
In a larger sense, perhaps this movie is a comment on the futility of art, and of politics, and of life itself.  We try to achieve success through doing what we love; we try to achieve success through relationships with other people; we try to achieve success by taking advantage of all the opportunities we are presented with.  But in the end none of these things is a sure investment.  The only thing that is guaranteed to bring us success and happiness is, as this movie so clearly demonstrates, an ancient, much-coveted artifact which we happen to acquire.  
Indeed, life is certainly strange and mysterious.  But in this confusing and distracting world it is good to know that there is always one certainty, and that is the undying brilliance of Ishtar.
