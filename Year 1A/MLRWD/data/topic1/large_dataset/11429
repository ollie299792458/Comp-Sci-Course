First, if you have not seem this movie yet, just let me say I most highly recommend it. The acting by the entire cast is superb. Helena Bonham Carter's subtle movements say more than 100 words of dialogue. The Tuscan scenery is beautiful and the charachters and story give us a great overview of customs and mores in Edwardian England.

Since this is a review of the HD DVD release of the movie, let me make a few comments about it. Unfortunately the transfer is uneven. It does not appear that an actual restoration of the original print was attempted and therefore the colors are not as vibrant as much older films like "The Searchers" or "Forbidden Planet". There is considerable and unnecessary grain in the opening credits that could easily have been cleaned up to give a better first impression of the movie. Some scenes look better than others and overall I thought that such a good movie deserved a better treatment. Warner Bros is way ahead of other studios when it comes to taking care of their catalogue titles and other studios should do the same.

This is a 5 star movie but due to the reasons a mentioned above I give it 4 stars overall. It's only a slight improvement over DVD, but if you don't own this title or have not seen the movie you should definitely buy it and enjoy it.
