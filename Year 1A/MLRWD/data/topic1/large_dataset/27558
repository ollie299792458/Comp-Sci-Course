REVIEW OF PUSHKIN'S ONEGIN

The very talented cast is up to performing with passion Pushkin's Onegin, however Elena Zaremba would have been much better suited playing Tatiania's Mother and the more youthful looking Mother, Olga.

I do feel that Carsen's staging is a big disappointment to both the cast and certainly to the audience as well.  It was a great distraction from the performances. One has to ask if Michael Levine has a prejudice against presenting Russian culture in his stage scenes.  Two steel pipes and a stage strewn with leaves, does not make a birch forest in a Russian countryside.  And what would it have cost production to have two pillars in the backdrop and a chandelier hanging from the center stage to convey a ballroom scene in St. Petersburg?  The stark eclectic staging of Onegin is something only a Stalinist could appreciate.

I had considered seeing Onegin when it came to Chicago in March but after noting it was a Carsen-Levine staging I opted to buy the DVD and am so very glad I did so.  I saved over $280.  The performances are great despite the drab setting they were compelled to perform in.  Supreme talent outshines a mediocre production.
