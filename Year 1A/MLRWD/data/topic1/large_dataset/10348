Besides the glaring misnomer of the title, I was disappointed with how little diversity the spectrum of the movie held.  I am from VA and live 10 minutes from Jamestown so naturally it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the telling of Jamestown and this "New World."  Not only was there almost nothing, merely quick scenes of a single attack from Indians and one shipment of food to hungry colonists that doesn't scratch the surface in telling of the struggles of this heroic group.  This is the first permanent settlement in the new world; and there was nothing about the losses they suffered, the diseases they faced, harsh winter or really anything else of true importance.

  That aside, there was no real mention of how the loss of Pocahontas was felt by her people, how the colony dealt with the Indians after her arrival or how they fared after she and Rolfe left for England.  So much was time was wrapped up in this love triangle that little of the story, details that could have pulled not just the interest in characters (even more details about the three involved) but also in the colony left behind or what became of her people!  Nothing is ever mentioned again.

  It is as if they started telling the story of the "New World" and like a young teenager in love got distracted by a new crush and forgot what story they were going to tell.
