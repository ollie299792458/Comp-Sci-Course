This movie is my most favorite Cary Grant movie. Grant, Bergman and Hitchcock just hit it out of the park in this one. Great screenplay, great direction, every frame is brilliant and perfect. Grant has never acted better, the dark side that Hitch brings out of him makes it that much challenging for him. The closeups of Grant and Bergman are just amazing and the chemistry between the two has to be seen to experience. Even though this is Bergman's movie starting from the title, and the whole plot is based on her, you cannot imagine the movie without Grant in it. I wish I could see it in a theater but the DVD quality is really good. I liked the special feature, specially the making of Notorious is good. Did not like the first commentary though since the guy keeps rambling about Kerner when Grant and Bergman are heating up the screen. You would expect more on the actors at that time. A really good purchase. I have seen the criterion edition whe I rented the movie locally and I personally think this one is better.
