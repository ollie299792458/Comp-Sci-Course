I'm a Desert Storm Vet.  I liked Jarhead, both the book and the movie.  But I know other Desert Storm Vets who hated them.  I have more than a few friends and relatives who are either in Iraq right now or are home from Iraq.  The ones who are home who saw this show agreed that some of the tactics were wrong and not all the jargon was correct, but they were so appreciative that someone finally seemed to nail how they felt and what they went through.  I really liked this show.  The characters reminded me of men and women I served with.  No, not all soldiers act like these characters.  I was a soldier, I was deep in Iraq in Desert Storm.  We were soldier's, but we were still people with personalities and lives.  As collective as war may sound each soldier will have a different experience.  Soldiers who served right next to me will have a completely different story to tell you.  To dimiss this series because it lacked exact details is a disservice to the fine writing and acting on the show.  I found it vitally important that someone had the guts to make this show.  It seems this war just keeps going on and on and it moves from front page news to 4th page news.  People seem to care more about whether Nick and Jessica are together more than how many American soldiers were killed in Iraq.  "Over There" at least took this war and the plight of our soldiers and put it back in the forefront of people's minds.  I know many vets who like this show a lot.  If you find this show doesn't represent your experience or tell your story, then get out a pen and tell us your story.  Seriously, I wish more vets would put their stories out there in one way or another.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.
