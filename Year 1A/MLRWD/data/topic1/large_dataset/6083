I have had this disc for a month, and am still working through the bonus features on it. Disney jam-packs their BluRay releases with Bonus features, and this one is no exception. When you have a whole extra BluRay (not DVD) of bonus features included.... I think the disc claims over 14 hours.

The video transfer is crip and sharp, and film grain is next to non-existant. Colors are vibrant, blacks are true - you would think that this film was shot with HD cameras rather than being a film transfer. The audio tracks will blow you away - just the bombing scene at the begining of the movie with the Dolby Digital soundtrack will work out your subwoofer - mine was bouncing off the floor. But there is more - like most Disney releases, this includes an Uncompressed PCM audio track, which, gratefully, the studio did not limit the disc to work only over HDMI. This is one of the few titles that I was able to export the PCM in 5.1 channels over my toslink cable!

Don't be fulled by the number of languages listed on the back of the package - there are WAY more audio tracks than this. Every major European language is represented on the disc, as welll as a few middle eastern and Asian languages. The audio comentaries are actually pretty fun on this disc - I think I had more fun listening to the audio commentary of the children and the director than I had watching the movie.

The only drawback to this disc is, like most Disney releases, it is a bit on the pricy side, costing over $25 at Amazon (don't even ask how much this thing costs at Best Buy, you are liable to have a heart attack). However, it was a nice addition to my BluRay collection, and I am sure any fan of this movie and the series would have happily paid twice this for the movie in HD.
