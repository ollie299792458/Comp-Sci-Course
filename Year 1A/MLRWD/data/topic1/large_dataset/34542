Eerie, Indiana was a show I used to love.  For a kids show - it was great.  A great mixture of spooky and strange material with your usual family show storylines.  I really enjoyed the odd stories this show had to offer.

The city on the show is called Eerie because of all the strange supernatural things that went on in this seemingly normal town.  A thirteen-year old kid moves to the town with his family;  him and a friend he meets go about investigating the strange occurances  -- writing things down in a journal.

There will be some guest stars who you might recognize like Denise Richards and Toby Maguire.  As well as classic actors like John Astin (Gomez on the Addams Family) and Rene Auberjonois (who was in Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine).

This show only lasted for one season, and there were two unaired episodes.  I don't know if those two episodes are included on this box set, if they are - than there should be 20 episodes in this set.  If not...than 18!

I enjoyed this set as a kid, and I still might today.
