We really enjoyed this movie.  We have already seen it three times and I never see movies three times within the first viewing.  Acting is superb and the story is multi-layered.  If you are going just for a science fiction disaster film you are in for a treat...if you can be flexible.  If you can appreciate the humor in dysfunctional families and dysfunctional family events you get still another treat.  The wedding will make any quirks in your family seem mild by comparison.  The approach of the big beautiful blue planet is what you are waiting for and it does not disappoint either....but you have to be patient.  On top of all that, the settings are gorgeous....from the lavish estate and wedding to the surrounding countryside in a country you never quite identify...but it could be one of many in the Western world.  No cost was spared to bring you into another world with respect to the filming.  I am just sorry there was not an appropriate marketing campaign to let the world know about this one.  We stumbled across it one evening with nothing better to do and decided to watch it as one more grade B disaster film.  Boy were we surprised! This film deserves to be in the "hall of Fame" of great films but alas...not many know about it.  For starters, this film leaves Black Swan in the dust from both an acting and a story line perspective.  Just a wonderful movie that you will think about again and again...then go back and view again and keep thinking about it.  That is the sign of a great movie in my book!
