These two classics belong in everyone's home dvd library.

With "Holiday Inn", you get Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in TOP form, and it simply doesn't get any better than that. Mix in a plethora of Irving Berlin songs, and the result is pure musical gold. Not only is the all time classic "White Christmas" introduced for the first time -- when Bing had most of his vocal range -- but Bing's interpretation of "Easter Parade" is hardly "chopped liver"! Fred Astaire's dancing is sublime, as usual, especially his very annimated "Firecracker" number. A movie you will watch OVER and OVER AGAIN!

"Going My Way" established Bing Crosby as the truly fine actor he really was. Bing was reluctant to play a priest because of his theretofore image as a male romantic musical lead. However, his warm, understated and deft playing of the Father O'Malley role won him the Oscar for Best Leading Actor of 1944. With an excellent supporting cast -- including Barry Fitzgerald who almost steals the pictute -- "GMW" is an all time family classic. An often overlooked piece of movie trivia is that Bing Crosby was nominated again for Best Actor in 1945 for playing his "Father O'Malley" role in "Bells Of Saint Mary's"! This may be the only time any one was nominated for Best Actor in successive years for playing the same role, which proves that Bing's reluctance to play a priest was severly misplaced! Incidentially, "GMW" won SEVEN Oscars, including Best Picture of 1944.
