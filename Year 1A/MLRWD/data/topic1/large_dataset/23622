"Dwarfed by these large chambers illuminated by our wandering lights, sometimes we were overcome by a strange irrational sensation as if we were disturbing the paleolithic people in their work. It felt like eyes upon us. This sensation occurred to some of the scientists and also the discoverer of the cave. It was a relief to surface again above ground." - Werner Herzog.

The sense of being in the presence of the immense and sublime is almost overwhelming in this film. The paintings themselves are powerful. They feel human and honest and I felt the artists completely immersed in their subjects. The HD video is among the highest level I've yet seen on Blu-Ray. The score itself grabs your soul and refuses to let go until you admit that your rationality is only pretend and in truth you feel you are face to face with the Gods. Herzog's narration is compassionate and filled with awe for his subject.

Not having a 3D TV, I watched the BD at mere 1080p. But all the same, the experience was breathtaking.

In particular I was struck by the series of images as a pair of woolly rhinos were being watch by a few cave lions. Those cave lions were in turn being watched by a horde of woolly rhinos. Those rhinos themselves were being watched by a massive pride of yet more lions.

Even before discovering that the bonus features focused on the score, I looked up the composer. His name is Ernst Reijseger. His work in this film (all recorded in analogue) was so powerful that I have gone and ordered two of his albums. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GB7DTE">Requiem for a Dying Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052T5TQ4">Cave of Forgotten Dreams</a>.)

I was also motivated to look up books on the Chauvet Cave. It looks like most of them are out of print at this point. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810932326">Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)</a> in particular looked exciting, but the price is extreme at this point. Let's hope that the success of the film motivates the publisher to get these back into print.
