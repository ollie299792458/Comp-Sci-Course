I thought this movie was going to be another typical dumb teenybopper type movie, though was very presently surprised.  There is some crude humor (which is well done, and very funny), though it is also very nice, warm and funny. The guys in the movie(though they are all very different people) really bond and look out for each other (even while they are giving each other a hard time).  Part of the reason this movie is so great is it is a wonderful example of the perfect way that guys can get along, get over slights, support each other, have fun, and have great friendships. (Women don't usually do this as well unfortunately). It is a guy buddy comedy as well as a perfectly immature romantic comedy.  The main character is sweet, and does not give in to peer pressure to "do it" with just anyone.  The timing of the jokes is great, and you can tell the cast had a fun time making this movie.  During the chest hair waxing scene, it is obvious the waxing (and the subsequent laughter) is real.  I went to this movie with my husband.  It is one of the funniest movies I had seen in awhile!  This movie is for everyone over the age of 18 (as long as you don't mind swearing and some vulgar humor.  If you do, this movie is not for you.)  It is a hilarious movie.  Give it a try!

(For a point of reference, I think Little Miss Sunshine was also hilarious).
