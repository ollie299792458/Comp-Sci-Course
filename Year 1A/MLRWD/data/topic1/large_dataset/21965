When I first saw this disk available on your site I immediately pre-ordered it without even thinking. 
I've been a Creek fan since day 1 and due to my horrific work schedule I had missed most of the last two seasons.  I managed to get off work to catch the series finale on its play time on the WB and it had me wondering what had happened with Andy.. Well the DVD definately smoothed any questions I had with that one. =)
This DVD left nothing unsaid between the group. All information on what had happened throughout their lives on the show was revealed, joked about, and even enhanced a bit.  I think you were able to grasp alot of concepts you might have been fuzzy on just by watching it when it aired (like Andy, who Joey really was in love with, as well as other bits of info).
Dawson's Creek will never leave my memory because it wasn't just a "teen soap" or a show I watched on a Wednesday/Thursday night.  It was something that actually was able to reach into my soul and my emotions and take hold of them.  I know that I had gone through half a box of Tissues during the finale as well as many other episodes in between.  I laughed and cried with the cast and friends and I definately consider it a tragedy to not be able to tune into my favorite show every week at 8.  But at least I know I can always fire up my DVD played and watch the good times I loved and lived with for so many years.
