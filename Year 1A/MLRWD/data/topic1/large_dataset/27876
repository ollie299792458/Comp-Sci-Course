Taxi Driver: SE is one of the best examples of what can be done with DVD.  The image is excellent (aside from a few rough patches with noticeble grain and wear &amp; tear) and the remastered sound is incredible.  That would  have been enough for me, but the extras is where this disc really comes  through.  First off is an excellent 70-minute documentary that covers the  film from its beginning stages to the end (if you ever wondered how they  accomplished the final showdown, or how they did that wonderful overhead  tracking shot, or who the inspirations behind the charcters were, you will  find out here) with interviews from the cast and crew.  In addition to the  trailer, there is a storyboard (drawn by Scorsese) sequence that details  how the bloody end will be shot and a comparison with how it came out.  There is a wealth of behind-the-scenes photos and a gallery featuring promo  materials and poster art.  But the coolest feature is Paul Schrader's  complete screenplay, featuring scenes that never made the final cut and a  neat option to jump to the scene you are reading.  I'm glad they put this  on the DVD and did not make it a DVD-ROM extra, since those of us who care  about the movies like to watch them on our TV screens and not our computer  screens.  Add to that a cheap price and you've got quite a package.  Kudos  to Columbia Tristar for their excellent package.
