"The Fugitive" is what many adventure films wish they could be:  Well-directed, finely casted, intelligently written.  Never have I sat through a film that engulfs its viewer on a manhunt while the pursued  voraciously searches for evidence to prove his innocence in the shadow of  his beautiful wife's murder.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are  stunning and captivating in their respective roles.  Though they are on the  opposite ends of the law, you root for them nevertheless because somewhere  in the film the real criminal basks in his "perfect"  crime.
Thank goodness Harrison Ford was casted into this role as the  wrongly-accused Dr. Richard Kimble.  He should've been the first choice  considered over conceited and self-absorbed Alec Baldwin.  Baldwin was  originally casted before Ford, but ostentatiously withdrew believing  "The Fugitive" was a go-nowhere role for his so-called career.  Shows how much he knows.  Ford has far more appeal and true connection with  a film going audience and succeeds at gaining sympathy and respect in his  hunt of the real culprit.
"The Fugitive" was deservedly  nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and though it did not garner the  prestigious award, the film is a masterfully well-crafted film only  intelligent director Andrew Davis could weave together.  Could he be our  next Alfred Hitchcock?  Hopefully so.  "The Fugitive" is a  worthy and excellent addition to your video/DVD collection!
