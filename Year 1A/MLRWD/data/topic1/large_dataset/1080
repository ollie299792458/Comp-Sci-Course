The two sided disks contain the same formatted DVD and Blu-ray software as the one sided disks. And while they may or may not scratch easier?, that has nothing to do with their compatability in the Blu-ray players. The reason you get the problems with freezing, pausing, skipping and so on, is the Blu-ray players are not able to handle the disks software, and while updating firmware in players can prevent some of this, it will not always solve ALL compatability issues. Case in point - AVATAR Blu-ray. Almost 50% of the Blu-ray players out in circulation could not play the Avatar Blu-ray disk. And even with firmware upgrades, many still could not play it properly without menus popping up or staying on screen, skipping, pausing and so on. One of the players that had the biggest problem with playing Avatar - Samsung. Samsung initially took more calls and complaints than any other manufacturer, and I'm not sure if they ever got the problem solved. I'm not bashing Samsung, both of my higher end Blu-ray players, the Marantz and the Pioneer couldn't play Avatar either, while my Magnavox (first generation) Blu-ray player played Avatar perfectly, with no problems, and no firmware upgrade. The point is, the Bourne flip-disks are fine, if you have the right player. (Probably Sony(not sure about PS3), Vizio, Panasonic, Magnavox/Insignia/Sylvania, just guessing). By the way, I loved the Bourne movies (all three) with Matt Damon. Damon brings his unique blend of strength and sincerity to the part of Jason Bourne, and he delivered fresh and passionate performances in each film.
