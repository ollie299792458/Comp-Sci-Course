If Gothic you want, then Gothic this is-  a pleasant diversion from all the modern, glam, vampire poseur films. Filmed in 1922, Nosfartu is an historic, horror masterpiece. Without fast-action fight sequences, without high-tech special effects, without even dialogue (remember this was filmed in 1922) the film simply exudes gothic ambiance. The score from Cleopatra Records is the perfect audio backdrop to the visual stimulus; And, the music is continuous throughout the film (good thing, this is a silent movie otherwise). You may also want to buy "Bram Stoker's Dracula (Coppola)" and "Shadow of the Vampire" as they yield more storyline and provide a (fictional?) documentary prelude to Nosferatu. The three films together comprise an interesting trilogy (or shall we say, orgy) of vampire cinema. Having recently viewed these two other films made the viewing of this film far more meaningful.  This is no ordinary movie; don't expect to be entertained in an ordinary manner. Nosferatu is more 'feel' and 'attitude' than blatant bite-my-neck action. After several viewings you may find yourself listening to the soundtrack as primary entertainment, while the movie visuals provide secondary allure. On the complaint side- there were no printed materials included with the DVD-- no track listing, no historical by-lines. Nor does the DVD have any additional features. For these small omissions, "Nosferatu" falls slightly short of perfection, but rates a great 4 out of 5 stars.
