I've read most of the reviews on here.  What a wide range of opinions.  Most are negative.  A few people made a good point though.  Although there are no sharks in this movie or limbs being ripped of, the realism of something like that actually happening to someone is there.  Granted, you would have to be stupid to not put the ladder down and shame on them for not having a back up plan if that should happen.  I would hope a yacht like that would have a safety button down by the propellor just incase that should happen.  Still though, if you found yourself in that situation, how scary would that be??  I thought of the idea to take their clothes and make a rope before it was suggested in the movie.  I agree with another reviewer on why one of the heaviest people attempted to climb the rope.  Even before the rope idea, I would have had one of the guys make a human platform using the pressure of his body up against the boat and then take the lightest girl and have her put one foot on his back and the other foot in my hands as I pushed her up into the air.  Yes, there were a few unrealistic parts but when you are in a crisis situation, things aren't always 20/20.  The movie was realistic enough to me to enjoy and imagine myself in that situation.  I won't be diving off any yachts into the ocean anytime soon.
