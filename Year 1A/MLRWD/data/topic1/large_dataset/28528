This is easily one of the best movies ever made. Stoppard's use of language is incredible, and if you don't find this movie incredibly funny, as some reviewers have said, then I think you should probably stick to Hollywood schlock. This film is hilarious beginning to end, from the coin flips to the...end...

It's a brilliant look at Hamlet as one of the first plays to exhibit modern themes: fate, the inability to act, the dichtomy between thought and action, free will, existentialism. Hamlet was a play years ahead of its time, which is why Stoppard is able to blend the themes of Hamlet and Godot into such a seamless (and hilarious) whole.

All of the actors in this film are brilliant. Roth and Oldman are at their best. Richard Dreyfuss is absolutely priceless.

It doesn't suprise me that a lot of modern movie viewers don't have the patience or mental capacity to enjoy a film as complex as this, but for any thinking, intelligent person, this is one of the greats. I have been waiting for this DVD release for years. The world needs more comedies like this one.
