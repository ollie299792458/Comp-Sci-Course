The Covenant is a watchable movie, especially for the 13-20 age group, but this movie lacks one important thing:  ORIGINALITY.

The main tagline: From the Producers of Underworld, gave me hope, seeing as the original Underworld is an amazing, beautiful film.  This film fails to deliver, while it's storyline is easy to follow, it just lacks in so many departments.

The entire movie, all four of the main characters (sons of Ipswich) banter on and on about abusing their powers, and how they will pay consequences for them, but throughout, I did not see a single downside that they so feared.  Not ONCE did the four seem to age like they fear, or expose themselves, or seem to "get hooked" on using their gifts.  For a plot point that is mentioned as frequent as this, for no pay-off, it seems such a waste.

The casting of this movie seemed typical, and kinda Swimfan-ish, with guys who look alot older than the parts they are playing.  While this is always annoying, the actors at least do get into their roles, and try to make them shine.

But no matter how much you polish a turd, it just won't shine.
