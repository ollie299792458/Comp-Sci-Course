This performance of La Boheme should please most people. Villazon and Netrebko certainly live up to the hype. If you looked at the packaging, you would think that they were the only two performers. They are featured on the front cover and written about extensively on the back cover. Oddly, there is no mention of the remaining cast members, all of whom give worthy performances. They include  Vitalij Kowaljow,  Nicole Cabell and  St&egrave;phane Degout. Kowaljow and Degout are amazing and at times almost steal the show. Cabell is a delightfully flirtatious and then sensitive Musetta. This DVD is a movie and it's one of the better film versions of an opera that I've seen. Occasionally, Robert Dornhelm opts for closeups when the singers are wide mouthed, which struck me as odd. He clearly loves Netrebko and she gets plenty of loving closeups when she's not singing.

This is definitely a worthy addition to any opera lovers collection, but the lack of notes and casting on the packaging is unacceptable.
