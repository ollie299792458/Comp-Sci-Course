One of the greatest strengths of Dark City is the slow unfolding sense of mystery which exists for the opening few acts of the film. John, the frightened hero, awakes in a bathtub with a hole in his head and no sense of how he got there. He runs, before receiving a call from a man claiming to be a doctor, played in a very odd, plodding way by Keifer Sutherland at the height of his powers. John does not continue the conversation more than a few seconds, running into the night pursued by men in dark coats. The film then cuts to William Hurt, a powerfully talented investigator played in a serious and brooding way, who has been summoned to where John has run from to examine the body he unwittingly left behind, a body with circles cut into it. Then we move to Jennifer Connelly's character, John's wife who hasn't seen him in three weeks.

  But in a city this literally dark, nothing is as it seems and John is quickly caught up in a three way battle between Keifer Sutherland, a man who is allied with the men in coats somehow and the police, led by William Hurt with the help of John's wife. But the problem is not John's identity, it is the nature of the city itself, and the strange things that happen at midnight. I won't spoil any further.

  Alex Proyas, a cult icon, directs the film with all the resources at his disposal when the film was produced in 1998, and the elements of solid production design remain. Buildings shift, time change and the viewer begins to question what the strange beings behind the city's movements question, "what is the nature of the human soul?" I can't escape that the characters are somewhat one-dimensional and the script is lacking. What is not lacking is imagination, which makes Dark City a stroke of genius.
