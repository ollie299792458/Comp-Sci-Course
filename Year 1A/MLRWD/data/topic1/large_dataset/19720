This was always one of my favourite cartoons when I was a kid. It has a lot of the fun and adventure of the live action movies. The animation is just incredible. Far better than most kids shows of the period. When the set original came out, it was released with tin cases that held the discs. But after a while, they started putting it out in regular plastic cases....which is a lot better for everyone, cool though the tin cases may be. Having normal cases, it will be a lot easier for you to get a replacement if something happens to the cases you have. The set of five cases is housed in a really cool box shaped like the Ghostbusters' firehouse HQ. On one side of the top of the box, there is a cool lenticular picture of the "No Ghosts" symbol that, when moved, looks like the ghost is trying to cut through the no sign. If you're a Ghostbusters fan, then you should pick up this set. Even if you're not so much a Ghostbusters fan and more just a general 80s animation fan, you should still get this set to see 80s animation at it's best.
