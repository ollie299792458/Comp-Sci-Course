For all movie lovers who still believe that being in love is something magical, this is your movie.  It depicts how even when you encounter true love, how some people can't handle it because instead of enjoying and treasuring the moment, they feel as though they are giving up life as they know it and they don't realize that life as they knew it, was no life at all.  Life is short and you must savor every moment and people come and go so fast, that even if someone comes into your life but only for a short time, it may possibly be the most passionate and intense love you'll ever know.  This movie is sweet and romantic and it leaves out all of the hot and steamy situations that people think make a good relationship.  It's a movie that pre-teenagers can watch and bottom line is that being in love is great.  Reviewing it at another angle, it shows how, Amanda's mother, even though she is not with her, through O'Reilly and the "special" helps her get the restaurant and her love life in order.  Which is what all parents want for their children; that they find someone that makes them happy and that they do well in life.
