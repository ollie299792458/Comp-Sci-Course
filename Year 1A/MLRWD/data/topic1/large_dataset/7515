Catalina Sandina Moreno is one to watch. Its no wonder that she got nominated for an Oscar. Yes, I still marginally respect the whole affair. Both of my parents are colombian and I lived there for approximately 8 years. And no none of us have any affiliations with drug dealers. I guess this movie kind of hit me close to home, not because anyone in my family has been a drug mule mind you but because I recognized the speech patterns, I knew the places they were talking about, i had been to the places they were talking about. But that's not the reason why I cherish this movie so much. Rarely have I cared so much about a character. I love that girl. I've known girls like that. I wanted her to be allright, I wanted her to always be safe, I wanted her to stop doing stupid things, I wanted her to stop lying, tell the truth. This movie had a sense of dread which I have never felt in a movie ever. I just wanted her to make it so much. She's so charming, so good natured for a future drug mule anyway. But yet you still care for her and that I think is this movie's greatest achievement. That after she's done all these things and basically brought trouble upon herself, it's for a noble cause but still. you still like her, you still want her to do good, you are worried, you are sad, you are happy, you are amused, you are relieved. Highly recommended.
