I do not usually comment on Shakespearean plays, yet because this adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" is set in the Victorian period, I thought I would comment.

1.
This adaptation contains good acting and more elaborate sets than any other adaptation of "Twelfth Night" I have ever seen. The picture quality is also good (considering this adaptation was produced for a wide-range of viewers rather than merely aficionados of William Shakespeare's plays).

2.
The adaptation is pretty loyal to the original play. Of course, there are some deviations such as when Malvolio rides a bicycle in pursuit of Cesario (which is entirely against Malvolio's personality, even when set in the Victorian period), not to mention that it is still a little early for the type of bicycle Malvolio rode.

3.
I thought the 'romantic' scenes were effective. Unlike some adaptations, this Cesario actually looks like she could be male (rather than a female actor dressed up). Of course, when Shakespeare plays were originally produced, male actors played the female parts.

Final thoughts:
I think this adaptation is worth watching. I enjoyed watching it. I especially thought Ben Kingley as Feste played his part well. (PS: Feste is given a larger role in this film adaptation than he would have been in an actual rendition of William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night."
