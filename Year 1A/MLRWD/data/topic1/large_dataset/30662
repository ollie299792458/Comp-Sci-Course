Two reasons that this movie didn't get 5 stars from me. Well, 3 actually. 1. I already knew what to expect after seeing the first one. 2. It took awhile for the action to start. Which isn't totally a bad thing if you're building up to it with a storyline or vital information. The first one built up to the action. But during the build up you got to know the characters. Not quite the same in this one. 3. There were a few things that I picked up on that didn't fit as far as far as behaivor. Other than that, great movie. Not much makes me jump, so I didn't. But I enjoyed watching this movie. Especially the surprise later on in the movie. The ending was definately a curve ball. Not at all what I was expecting. Which is usually a good thing and was in this case. The last scene should've been different, but other than that, I definately recommend this movie and will be adding it to my collection. To everyone who helped make this movie as great as it was, thank you and great job. People often mess up on the third ones, but I believe you can do it.
