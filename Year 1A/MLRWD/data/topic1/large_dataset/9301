This film made me very uncomfortable when I watched it on it's original  release, which is probably why I didn't watch it again until it came  out  on DVD, when it once again left me feeling uneasy. I don't know if it's the  idea of the IRA bombing London pubs which is too close to home, or  maybe  the fact that the likeable cockney gangland  boss is also capable of  killing someone with his bare hands in a fit of rage. Either way, it is  nevertheless a brilliant film; however I cannot agree with it's description  as the best ever British gangster film, for me that will always be  "Get Carter". That said, there are many parallels between the two  films, the most obvious being that they both visually document an area of  England immediately prior to it's re-development. In the case of "Get  Carter" it is the city of Newcastle. In "The Long Good  Friday" it is the London Docklands. Harold Shand's ideas for  redevelopment,  although essentially criminal, are a precursor to the  actual renovations that would see redundant wharves transformed into  riverside apartments for the upwardly mobile eighties professional. He has  a real desire to use Mafia money to bring some culture into the  area..."A little bit more than a hot dog...Know what I mean?".  Arguably the most famous scene is the five minute closing shot which starts  at the Savoy Hotel and fades into the end credits leaving the viewer to  ponder on the film's conclusion. The Non-Anamorphic picture on the  Criterion DVD is nontheless excellent. The soundtrack is mono and very  eighties; No commentary and no extras apart fom the Theatrical trailers.
