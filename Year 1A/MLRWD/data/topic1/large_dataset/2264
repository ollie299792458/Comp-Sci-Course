I should start out by saying that this is my all time favorite comedy. And on my top three movies list with Forrest Gump and Goodfellas.I don't even know where to start! It starts with Eddie Murphy asking his manservant (I suppose that's what he is) Oha "Since it is my 21st birthday, do you suppose I could use the bathroom alone?" Oha looks at him and says "Most amusing your highness." And that is when you know you have gotten yourself into something. It then goes to Eddie Murphy's obnoxious fiance who barks like a dog on command. And then, in New York, There are some very funny parts nut the things that always get me are the men at My T Sharp and Randy Watson. And also Reverend Brown. The special make up is unbelieveable. And the final joke about the spoon took me more than ten years to figure out. Some dunce, huh? But basically, it's your typical prince with a heart coming from a strict dad and he marries a commoner. But the thing is they fix it up so nice that you pay no attention the the basic story and fall in love with the charaters. James Earl Jones is king for crying out loud!!
