If you're even slightly acquainted with Doctor Who, you'll know many stories from the late 60s were wiped and destroyed - this was a time before "re-runs". This is one of those missing stories.  Of the original 8 episodes, only 6 remain. The "lost" episodes have been re-created with animation. This provides a wonderful continuity and allows "The Invasion" to be experienced "in full". The animation is wonderful, and you can tell that the animation team worked very hard to bring you what you would have seen on the screen if the episodes weren't lost. If you're unaware, all of the _audio_ of every Doctor Who story exists - so the dialogue, sound effects and music are authentic, and aren't recreated.

This method of filling in the gaps - with animation - makes this truly a "resurrected" story. If you are even a mild fan of Doctor Who, I highly recommend this. The story, featuring the Cybermen, is a classic. Vote with your money - tell the BBC and 2 Entertain that we appreciate the extra work and effort into bringing this story back. Note to anyone with the BBC or 2 Entertain - please bring us more resurrected stories!
