The Thing is very well made. No faults whatsoever. I rented this movie and watched it during nighttime. Definitly not one of my better ideas. I was scared out of my mind! This movie will keep your adrenaline pumping well after the end.

 A group of American scientists' are conducting experiments in isolated Antartica. A couple miles away Norweigan scientists' are doing their own experiments. The Americans led by Mac  (Kurt Russell) are startled when one of their own sled dogs' is chased by a Norwegian with a gun and is almost killed. The scientists are suspicious but continue on with normal activities. Then they trek over to the Norwegians' station and find an empty ice block, a huge spaceship stuck in the ice and a dead mutilated human and a burned human-like corpse. The scientists take the human-like corpse back with them and there it "wakes up" and disappears.

  The scientists realize the horror of what this " thing " can do ( imitate humans and act and think just like that person) and now are trying to find out which of the scientists' are infected by this thing.

  Puzzling twists, shocking truths, and pulse-pounding terror make this movie a must-see for any horror fan. Definitly see it during the day!
