Even if this had been an excellent film, which it is not, there would have been something inherently sad about it.  That Belushi's frenzied, comical zeal is missing goes without saying, but seeing Elwood without his brother  just seems wrong.  It is impossible to view this film without feeling  impacted by the real-life tragedy of Belushi's death.  In fact, one of the  best scenes in "BB2000" is a dialogue-free, wide-view shot of the  warden telling Elwood that Jake has died, and Elwood's physical reaction to  the news.
Goodman is game, but his timid character leaves Aykroyd as the  leader of the band and the film, which seems totally antithetical to  Elwood's original, understated demeanor.  Jim Belushi, with the same sense  of danger as his brother (both consistently seem about a second away from  total meltdown), would have made a lot more sense.  The apparent desire for  a PG-13 rating really seems to damper the "anything goes" spirit  of the whole Blues Brothers act, further weakening an already desperate  venture.
As a huge fan of the Blues Brothers, I am glad to be able to say  that there are some stunning moments on the soundtrack.  At least that  component of the Blues Brothers has been kept alive -- exposing mainstream  culture to some great music, predominantly ignored by the masses.  The  Blues Brothers may not have been the best blues singers around, but they  surrounded themselves with talent that might not gotten the attention it  deserved without them.  This is about the only thing the two films have in  common (except for a shamelessly unimaginative re-hash of the original's  plot).
Thanks for trying, guys, but the king is dead.
