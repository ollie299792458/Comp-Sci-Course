I saw this movie in a small town theater with my girlfriend. Going into it, I expected good things...with the combination of Johnny Depp's acting and a story about fairies and imagination. But I have to admit, this movie blew me away. Rarely have I seen a movie that evokes such emotion without resorting to cheesy, overused one-liners.

There is one point in the story, during a performance of Barrie's play, "Peter Pan," when a character says, "Clap if you believe in fairies." Well I must say, there were a good many people clapping in the audience, both young and old. At the end of the movie, everyone was in or near tears. I was one of them, though not primarily because of sadness; just because the movie was so darn well done.

Many types of people will enjoy this movie - the elderly who remember a more innocent time as well as families who want to experience some quality entertainment together. This is a solid movie all around, and in fact was my favorite new release of 2004.
