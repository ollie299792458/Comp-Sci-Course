This is when musicians buddies are alive, but MUSIC dies.
Stones are old enough and drug-addicted enough to give even a good live (not to talk about great live). I watch the concerts and see how they killed and thrilled their music. Rolling Stones became a SHOW-ORRIENTED band. Quite similiarly to Madonna. Well... we all know Madonna can't sing, she hasn't voice and looks like old b**ch, thus puts everything in the show and stage-design to attract people.

If you are a MUSIC FAN, the music you listen must be GOOD TO LISTEN, not good to watch. The only thing I like in todays Stones, is their stage set, light effects and the number of crowd they attract. what about MUSIC? musically this is probably the WORST band from the list of Stones' cover bands.

the ONLY band, which comes from the sixties and MUSICALLY remains ABSOLUTELY GREAT, is DEEP PURPLE. Deep Purple & Rolling Stones are maybe worlds greatest Rock'N'Roll bands and true and greatest legends of rock. But musically only Purple remains as great as they were 40 years ago.

All in all, if yuo like great show, great stage-set and light effects, buy Rolling Stones, or Madonna, or Justin Timberlake's DVD...

but if you think that MUSIC comes first, and you love MUSIC & TRUE ROCK'N'ROLL, go and buy Deep Purple - Live At Montreux 2006, or Live In Birmingham 2002...

for me, music comes first, thats why I think sadly, modern Rolling Stones s*cks musically, just alike Madonna...
