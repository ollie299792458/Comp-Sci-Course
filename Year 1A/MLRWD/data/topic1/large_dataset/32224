THIS IS NICE. I MEAN,"THIS IS NICE!" DURING A TIME(NOW),WHEN THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY MOVIES(95% ARE NOT WORTH A ____). IT IS ALL FOR THE MONEY(AND ADOLESENCE). WE NOW ,THANKS TO SUNDANCE,REVEAL AND EDUCATE A NEW AUDIENCE FOR "THE HIRED HAND." A SLEEPER WHEN RELEASED IN 1971(I SAW IT AT A DRIVE-IN),THIS CLASSIC DOES SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. FOR ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES, WE VIEWED A FILM THAT WAS REALISTIC,TOLD A MARVELOUS STORY,INCLUDED EXCELLENT ACTING,VISUALS AND A SOUNDTRACK THAT ARE UNFORGETABLE. THAT MY FRIENDS PUTS "THE HIRED HAND IN THE CATEGORY OF A CLASSIC. PETER FONDA IS AN EXCELLANT DIRECTOR AS WELL AS ACTOR. THE LATE WARREN OATES IS SUPERB. VERNA BLOOM IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST ALL TIME ACTRESS(JUST WATCH THIS FILM). I AM A BUFF OF THE WESTERN GENRE,ESPICIALLY THE SPAGHETTI AND LATE 1960'S FILMS)YES,I LOVED "THE WILD BUNCH","THE "DOLLAR" MOVIES,THE "STRANGER" MOVIES,THE BANG BANG,SHOOT 'EM UPS AS WELL. "THE HIRED HAND"IS NOTHING LIKE THESE-IT TOLD ME A STORY. IT TOLD THE STORY SO WELL-IT HYPNOTIZED ME. IT IS UNFORGETABLE,BEAUTIFUL,AND ONE OF A KIND.THIS SET IS OUTSTANDING AND HIGHLY RECOMENDED TO ANYONE(DO NOT EXPECT ANY SLO-MO DEATHS).THE NEW AUDIENCE SHOULD TAKE HEED AND THEY WILL TAKE TO HEART "THE HIRED HAND."
