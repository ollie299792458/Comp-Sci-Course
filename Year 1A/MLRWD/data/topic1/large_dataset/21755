As a Chinese who deeply love our history,I hated this movie so much.Actually,it raped our history. The period before Qing danasity is one of the most wonderful age in Chinese culture.It's not like the savage time  Chen discribed in this movie at all.For example, the assassin Jing Ke was  not a professional killer.He was a well-educated, brilliant gentleman who  wants to be a consultant to those kings. "the emperor and the  assassin" is a household story in China.What I-- and many other  Chineses --have read in "Shi Ji"(a great history book written in  Han danasity)is all about wiseness(Jing Ke was a very smart man and he  tried many ways to fight with Qing),friendship(Jing and all of his dearest  friends knew that he couldn't come back but to kill king of Qing was the  only right thing to do,so when Jing took off his friend Gao , a famous  musician played a beatiful song for him and the song is about "we knew  why you have to do this.You are the bravest man in the world. What you  gonna do is worthwile to give up your life")and braveness.This kind of  braveness is not killer or even soldier's courage.It's from a man who was  well-educated and didn't want to kill somebody and never killed somebody  before.He decided to do it just because so many people hated to live under  Qing's cruel policy and at that time there was no other way to stop him.So  he'd rather give up his own life to try the only way. Another thing is the  plot is super stupid and inconsistent.This whole thing was from A  woman(Madam Zhao)'s silly ,childish thought? Give me a break. The king of  Qing first wanted to scare prince Yan to make him flee so he could have  some excuse (for this purpose he even told him"you'd better stay here  because your homecountry will soon become Qing's province") and then  he just sent his army to throw prince Yan away? And, by no means director  Chen can convince me that the king of Zhao would kill all of Zhao's  children just because he didn't want them to be Qing's people and those  4,5yr olds would gladly commit suicide.Chen distorted human nature just for  a more shocking story,I dislike that. And, I must say, I don't like how  director Chen values things.In his eyes, unifying China is the most  important thing, so this is a wonderful reason for the character of king of  Qing to win so much sympathy.But I think freedom is more important than  that.After the king of Qing conqured the whole mainland of China, he burned  all of books except medical and agricultural ones and buried thousands of  scholars alive.I don't think describing him as a deeply hurted idealist  (also, having a terrible childhood !)is a good idea.very creative, though.
