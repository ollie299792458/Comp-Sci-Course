What could be more American than Mom, apple pie, and weed in the grow house?!  I started watching this gem of a show because of Mary Louise-Parker.  I've continued watching because of the fine ensemble acting, stellar writing, and general shock and awe fun of it all.  What more can happen to 'Lacy LaPlante'?  If ever there was a living, breathing example of Murphy's Law in action, it is Weeds.
Season One, episode one got me hooked....um....addicted....um....made me a fan.  Season Two just strengthened my addiction....my love/hate affair with Agresstic and all the characters who stream on and off camera.  Season Three got me fired up and anxiously awaiting the buzz of season four.
Whether or not you have ever been in that life or known anyone in that life or even like people in that life, the superb direction, the phenomenal scripts, and the amazing cast make this a character study for even the most straight-laced right-wingers.  The look gets better, the stories get better, and if season three is any indication of where this is going, I plan to be onboard.
