Overall this is an excellent film. It's 1943 and the tide has turned against the Germans on the Russian Front. When the film was released in 1977, Cross of Iron was ahead of its time in its depiction of the gritty conditions on the eastern front from the German viewpoint. Visually the film is a stunner, particularly when the Red Army attacks with waves of infantry supported by T34 tanks. The uniforms, equipment, entrenchments, etc. all look accurate. Unfortunately, there are a couple of things I can't get past that detract from the film. First and formost is James Coburn as Corporal Steiner. As an old, grey, wrinkled man he might be more convincing playing a soldier in the volkssturm (home guard)defending Berlin in 1945. Is this the only American star this Anglo-German production could get? Secondly is the hair. Most of the German soldiers look like former extras from the musical Hair. Yes, a lot of German soldiers in the field had longer hair on top but they kept it close-cropped on the sides. The "defeatist" Regimental Adjutant, Captain Keisler, looks like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. The overgrown, unkempt hair just screams 1970's and has no "period" feel to it. Again, despite its faults, the film is excellent overall and is a worthy addition to your WWII DVD collection.
