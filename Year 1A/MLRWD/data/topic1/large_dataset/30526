Light, fun, colorful, much like the 40's and 50's era romantic comedies. Both George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones always look fantastic (or comedically awful), always speak with glittering words, and always know they will wind up together. This, however, doesn't stop them from creating obstacles for themselves. 
While they plot each other's financial doom, it soon becomes apparent that these plots are excuses to be near each other. Because Clooney needs to search Zeta-Jones's house, he invites her to dinner under romantic pretenses. As Zeta-Jones uses Clooney for her own machinations, he admits that she "fascinates him" with adoration for her treachery and for her. 
Assisting the two stars as the grapple with each other is a small universe of scene-stealing characters: Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy who is well... the Baron, "the hammer" Gus Petch, hapless attorney Freddy Bender, Texas A&amp;M alumnus Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil, and the dangerously medicated Wheezy Joe. 
Since this is a romantic comedy, the end result is predictable and enjoyable the entire ride.
