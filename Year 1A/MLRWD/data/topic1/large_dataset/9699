OK, Das Boot must be the greatest submarine movie ever made if you're going to stick strictly within the genre.  However, this film is a close second.  The depiction of life in a diesel-powered fleet sub in WWII is unmatched; the grime, the sweating pipes, the creepy, slowly-going-psycho crew members (my old man was on an aircraft carrier and my uncle on a destroyer, and they both told me that the sub crews were all mostly certifiable), and the officers trying to maintain some discipline and decorum.  If nothing else, get this film for the comments the crew members make as they pass the scuttlebutt forward about the three new people on the boat, newly rescued from a lifeboat - "two teabags and a brillo pad...."

When you add a possible malevolent ghost to the mix the film gets really interesting.  This movie is essentially a haunted house story on a sub.  One of the problems with that genre is, in the back of your mind you're always thinking 'Why don't they just leave?'  Well, there's no escaping the ghost(s) in this movie!  It's a B movie, yeah, but it's a genius B movie!
