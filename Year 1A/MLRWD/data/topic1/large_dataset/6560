Listen People, I never, in my 42 years, thought it possible for something this powerful to appear on network television. Here is a program with meaning and depth. It is produced with such honest vitality and creative skill that I was swept up in virtually every scene of every episode. I can not say enough about the power of this series. It addresses the complexities of our human (and American) condition in real ways. The actors inhabit their characters so completely, its scary. The writing is not at all trite or simplified. Its asks the viewer to consider things thoughtfully, without spoon-feeding the viewer a moral buffet. Let me finish by saying that I have known my wife for 8 years, and she has always HATED football. No more. Because of the humanizing way this show portrays the sport and the lives of each of the young players, my wife understands more about football, how it is played, and the kinds of men that play and coach the game. So guys, if you want your wives to let you watch more football, get her hooked on this. You can stream it on Netflix. You will thank me later.
