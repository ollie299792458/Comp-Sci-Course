I originally thought this was a remake of the 1985 classic as they are remaking every classic zombie munchfest these days. But it turns out it's the 4th installment. Well, that right there should be reason enough to avoid this. I chose to check it out and it is, next to Day of the Dead:Contagium the WORST horror remake I've ever seen and I've seen plenty! This one has more mistakes than an abortion clinic seriously. Don't even mention the horrendous acting and plot. I mean, the 1985 original "Return of the Living Dead" had pretty lousy acting but gosh darn it had Mr.Pathmark!!! That's a plus in my book, not to mention it's actually a GOOD movie. This is horrible in every which way, in the beginning of this flick a zombie can only be airholed by the famous shot to the head. A few zombies take body shots only to keep trudging forth. BUT all of a sudden towards the middle, they start dropping like flies when shot anywhere BUT the head. That did it for me. It just got cheesier as the movie went on and on. The ONLY reason it gets 2 stars is that the special effects are actually pretty good, pretty authentic compated to others. And there are a few scenes that showcase these efx, like a steamroller squashing a head into raspberry jam! Other than that, stick to the 4 star winners like "Dawn of the Dead", "Day of the Dead" and of course the granpappy of them all, "NIGHt of the Living Dead." In other words, if it ain't Romero it ain't right!! There are exceptions to the rule, but this ain't one of them!! Darn at LEAST they coulda brought back Joe Pathmark!!!
