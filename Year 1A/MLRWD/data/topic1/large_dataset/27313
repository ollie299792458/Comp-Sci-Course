This movie describes the Sufi master and disciple relationship convincingly and entertainingly. It reveals that labels have no meaning if one discovers the essence of things, which is one. The local Arab grocer (Omar Sharif as Ibrahim) is not really an Arab, just as Jewish Moses (portrayed by Pierre Boulanger), is not the "local Arab grocer" identity he assumes in the last few moments of the movie. In their trip to Turkey, Ibrahim's points out to Moses or Momo (short-form for Mohammed?) that the Orthodox Church, Christian Church and a mosque are differentiated only by the scents wafting from the places. The prostitutes have a purer heart than the "innocent" girl that Moses falls in love with as she two-times him. Sufism unveils the inner truth, which is not bound by legal dogma or outward practices, but transcends all labels, similar to other spiritual practices. It is not a sect of Islam but just a mystical branch of the religion.

One gets the first hint of Ibrahim's Sufi sheikh or spiritual master approach when he "reads" Moses's mind by telling the boy that he is not an Arab, contrary to what was on Momo's mind. This intuitive knowledge is depicted throughout the movie, where Ibrahim seems to dispense advice and guide Moses at the right moment and emphasis. The lights of their hearts communicated on an intuitive and spiritual plane, requiring few words but registering complete understanding. Wisdom from Ibrahim's heart shines upon the pure, receptive and sincere love Moses has for his adopted father to maintain the Sufi-like bond of mystical love. The sheikh leaves when the disciple is ready to grow on his own.
