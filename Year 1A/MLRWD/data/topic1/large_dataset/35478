With all due respect to some of the other reviewers, they are obviously not writing about the Full Moon Edition BD, which was issued in 2009.  I'm writing about this specific BD version.

I also own the HD-DVD version and it is quite good.  In fact, several of the extras that are on this BD issue were also on the HD-DVD version.  But with the BD you also get an additional interview with Rick Baker as he talks about his experiences from the making of the movie, plus a documentary titled "Beware the Moon".  This latter feature is worth the price of the BD by itself.

So, how's the quality of the transfer?  Pretty darned good, I'd say.  Certainly the best that's ever been available.  It is noticeably better than the HD-DVD transfer and the sound has either been remixed or improved in some way.  The DTS 5.1 sound is perhaps not as good as some films, but it's a lot better than it was on the HD-DVD or standard DVD.

As for the film itself...what can I say?  This continues to be one heck of a ride for the viewer.  Everytime I mention this film to someone, they describe an experience they had when they first viewed it.  (When I received this BD edition from Amazon, I showed it to one of my younger co-workers.  Without any prompting he said, "I couldn't sleep for two weeks after I saw that on TV.")

What it will probably boil down to is, should you go ahead and buy this Full Moon Edition BD to replace your old HD-DVD or DVD?  Heck, yeah!  What are you waiting for?  It's worth every penny.
