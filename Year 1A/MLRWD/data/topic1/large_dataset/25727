I watched all The Avengers way back when, and own all of them now. As John Steed and Emma Peel, Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg are and probably always be irreplaceable and unsurpassable.

Should you watch/get this movie? Depends. Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)

This will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show. Then, if you haven't, watch McNee and Rigg too. And if you have, watch them again, after some well-spent time with Fiennes and Thurman.
