I fell in love with Deanna Durbin when I was about ten years old watching her movies on television. Viewing this colletion of her work confirmed that 40 years later I'm still in love with her! This collection begins with her second film in 1936 and ends with her second last film in 1947 and it is wonderful to watch the cute faced headstrong young girl mature into a beautiful woman. Deanna's ability to sing from opera to popular songs of the era is clearly illustrated in this collection and it is also interesting to hear her voice change from the bubbling sounds of youth in "Three Smart Girls" to the richer mature quality in "Can't Help Singing". Along with Deanna Durbin there are great appearances by other stars such as Donald O'Connor, Charles Laughton, Robert Cummings, Edward Everett Horton and Robert Stack not to mention a cameo appearance by opera star Jan Peerce. If you want to enjoy one of the most beautiful voices ever to be recorded on film then this Deanna Durbin anthology is a must.
