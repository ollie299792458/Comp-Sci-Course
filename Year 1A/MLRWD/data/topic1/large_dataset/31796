I loved this movie from the moment I saw it on the big screen. At first I thought it was gonna be a let down after seeing those pathetic excuses for X-Men movies. But after I saw the preview in which we see Johnny Storm "flame on" with the missile chasing him, I decided to see it afterall. I was definitly not let down and was releaved to see Marvel didn't choke again like they did with X-Men.(Spider-man was awesome!) This movie was sooo much fun and nothing was cheesy or lame. My only complaint was Dr. Doom was at first not very incriminating like he is in the comics. But he slowly got better towards the end. My sisters loved it too. And comments about the rip-off Incredibles being better are complete BS! I was bored with that movie and barely ever laughed. This movie: FF had me on the edge of my seat during the fight scenes and whenever they used their powers. The graphics I thought were good, maybe not the best out there but good enough that there shouldn't be complaints. The actors were well chosen(Jessica Alba not so much, but she did a pretty good job) and did wonderful. Anyways I highly recommend this movie, and it's the second best Marvel comic-based movie to come out so far(Spider-man is #1 of course). And I think it's pathetic that people say this movie is terrible and then recommend a piece of junk like X-Men, which is so butchered how can you even call it X-Men? So ignore comments that X-Men is better because it is soooo not! FF is by a HUGE landslide!
