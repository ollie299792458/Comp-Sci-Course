There has been much criticism by other reviewers with regards to this movie and I want to start of my review by saying that I found this movie to be truly inspiring.  Take away the true "cuteness" between Will Smith - the main  character - and his son, who is also his real life son.  Take away Smith's great acting skills (Note: he has come a far way from "The Prince of Bel-Air").  Take also away the good camera movement and the editing.  What you are left with is a story of a man who despite his social standing, his nonsupporting wife, his skin color, his education, his age and his lack of "luck" goes after what he wants.  And Smith's character does not just go after it, he pursues it.  He puts all his effort, all his time and all his strength into building a better life for himself and his son.

The story is obvious from the beginning, but nonetheless, the viewer is drawn in and is rooting for the underdog.  We applaud his persistence when he goes after the head of HR at a large company, demanding an in-person interview to be accepted into a apprenticeship position.  We are cheering at his ingenuity when instead of listening to his trainer to move from the bottom of a calling sheet, he immediately goes to the top.  We are amazed about his sincerity when he goes to someone's house to apologize for being late.

What is important to note is that Smith's character is rarely seen to use government services for help.  We never see him using food stamps and he only at the very end stays at a local shelter.  Smith's character is a man who uses his wits, his determination and his drive to move himself into a position that in the end will allow him to build the life that he envisions for himself and his son.

I highly recommend this movie for families with teenagers, who will benefit greatly from such an uplifting story.  The lesson here is that the American dream does not just have to be a dream, but that hard work and persistence will make it a reality.
