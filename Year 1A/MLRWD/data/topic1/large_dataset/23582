The Power Of One is the beutiful story of a young English boy that is growing up in South Africa in the time of predudice and hate which we know as aparthied, The story follows his life and illustrates this young boys passion and sense of justice it is not just a simple story about boxing!!!!, This story influences the viewer on many levels....The movie is great....HOWEVER if you even remotely enjoyed the film...you will LOVE the novel. The movie leaves out many important factors that the novel foccusses on, The novel speaks of the events that drive Peekay to fight for justice in South Africa and highlights the many important relationships that Peekay encounters through Life. If you've read the book and are planning to watch the film plan to be dissapointed it lacks depth and meaning compared to the novel, Howevre if you're watching the movie and have not read the novel prepared to be delighted by the poignant story of the power of one, that is full of meaninf and important themes (it just doesn't touch the surface of the books, but I think this is because only the reader can create the passion and feel the connection with the characters in their own mind....
