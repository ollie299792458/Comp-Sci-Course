Just because they are coming out with an Unrated Version of Scary Movie 3 doesnt mean anything really but added scenes and more bonus features. Nothin like nudity. More likely language will change up a notch to R rating material. I own alot of unrated movies and i was disappointed almost everytime with them not havin anything reaaly different. For example, Blade: Trinity, they just added some new scenes but nothin unrated about it. It's still rated R material just like the last 2 movies and the theatrical version of the film. When its rated R already then why make it an unrated version on dvd. makes no sense. I would see a pg-13 movie coming out on dvd and being unrated only if they added ra rated language and some nudity into. but an r rated movie goes to an unrated version just doesnt cut it. hopefully scary movie 3.5 will be alot different and alot funnier than the pg-13 version of the film. in which i have and i will still buy the unrated version just to see how different they are to each. well i hope this helps you all out.
