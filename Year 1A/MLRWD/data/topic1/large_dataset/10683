I really enjoyed the series when it was originally broadcast. I watched the repeats whenever I got the chance.

I think it is one of the best shows and could easily make it on any, "top 100 shows," list.

It is as entertaining, thought provoking and thoroughly engaging today, as it was back then.

The quality of the video and audio of this set, overall, is good.

The video does show signs of age, some dirt here and there. There were a few moments where the image was too dark.

They could have used a little remastering to clean up the flaws apparent throughout.

The audio is clear (5.1 or stereo) and English subtitles are optional.

A good choice for any casual or adoring fan of the series.

Note:

The packaging is very cheaply manufactured. The discs come in three plain book type, flip through style, DVD holders. The holders are held in a plastic book end type case with a flimsy cover.

There was no care nor style put into the design of the set or in the labeling of the discs. This is made apparent by the repeated use of the same image of one character spanning several discs in the collection.

Also, reading through the reviews, I can understand the complaints made about the packaging and the damage that might have occurred during shipping.

One of the holders was chipped on mine and I used some glue to repair it.
