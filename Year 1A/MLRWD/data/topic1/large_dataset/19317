I thought that the film was a very close representation of the novel.  It clearly depicted Fitzgerald's ideas.  The cahracters from the book were well represented by the actors.  Sam Waterson played Nick very well.  He remained simple but was helpful and a good friend.  The imperssion you got of Nick in the novel was the same in the film.  He was not overly judgmental and basically just an observer.  Robert Redford looked and played the part of Jay Gatsby.  His semi-deceitful demeanor was clear but not overemphasized.  It was interseting that there were some differences with his parts of the movie and the book.  They were obvious if you read the book.  As for Tom, Bruce Dern was sophisticated, stuck up, hypocritical, jealous, and posessive.  He was a perfect imitation of Mr. Buchanon.  Even his facial features and posture gave the air of superiority.  The actress who played Daisy did a good job of showing Fitzgerald's character's seeming flightiness but somewhat deceptive manner.  She was a key actress in the film.  Daisy was a very complicated character and would be hard playing her in the movie.  I was somewhat thrown off by Jordan's character, however.  She was nicer and more honest than I thought she would be.  I think that if F Scott Fitzgerald was casting the movie, he would have used the same cast.  They understood the character's in the novel and successfully transfered it on screen.  The task was hard because they had to put Fitzgerald's written analysis into dialogue throughout the movie.
