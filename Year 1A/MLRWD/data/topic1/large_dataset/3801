A lot of the negative reviews of this film seem to come from people who don't like arthouse cinema, and/or political art, and/or ambiguity, and/or subtitles.  Accordingly, a lot of people who appreciate some or all of those things might dismiss the negative reviews.  I dig all of the above, but I think critics have lavishly overpraised Cache.  The political subtext is too near the surface to tell us anything beyond Georges' brief but welcome account of the actual Oct. 17 massacre.  The characters are underdeveloped, and their relationship therefore isn't engaging; I don't get how anyone who has seen "Knife in the Water" or, hell, "Dead Calm" can consider this a great psychological thriller.  The oft-repeated notion that the film delivers "gasps" is laughable.  For good or ill, that isn't remotely this film's game.  I like the creepy evocation of voyeurism, especially in the film's gradual blurring of lines between its own narrative and the videotapes, but by the time the last scene dropped the big "Huh?," nothing about the story, themes, or emotional texture of Cache made me care to ponder for more than a few seconds what the hell had happened.  Based on the many great reviews by smart and thoughtful people, I expected a lot from this film.  I haven't been so disappointed in a long time.
