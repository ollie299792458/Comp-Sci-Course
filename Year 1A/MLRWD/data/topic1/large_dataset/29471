The other reviewers have prety much covered the angles to this story so there is not much to add. I'd just like to center on Anna. Both child actresses are very good but Anna Torrent is unforgetable. The capturing of the imagination of two children is a profound piece of work as accomplished by the director. Take a look at the cover of little Anna, those eyes , once you've seen the movie Anna will be with you forever, and that is a good thing. We remember the innocence of youth and most of us would love to capture the essence of that purity. A conscienceness that is unpolluted. Such was the case with Anna until she sees a haunting image that moves her so as to seek  in her own imagination that image that so impressed her. As adults we do the same. The images burned in our conscienceness is what possess us to seek everything we desire. Just like little Anna we imagine what we want. The movie is very good and unique. When Anna whispers to her sister on screen you want to whisper back to her, I love you Anna. I left this movie on after viewing it wondering what ever became of Anna Torrent. I can still hear Anna whispering her innocent questions. I still wonder about Anna, I wonder if she maintained her childhood innocence, I can still here her whispering, she is burned forever in my mind. You go away from the movie remembering your own childhood, and it seems so long ago, until you here Anna whispering that it wasn't that long ago when questions in the dark were part of going to bed. Thanks for the memories Anna. I think young children, those not impressioned yet, would really like this story. Highly recommended for those young at heart, who remember or want to remember their youth. It transcends language barriers, a parent can read the dialogue but a child knows.
