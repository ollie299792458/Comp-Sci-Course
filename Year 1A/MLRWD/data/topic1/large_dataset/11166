Ok... if you're a michael jackson fan, you know Sony has never been able to produce a quality video product (save the recent release of "This is It" which was reference quality Blu-ray release).

So, it was with much suprise that after 20 years Moonwalker comes out on DVD... by Warner... and its indeed pristine quality.  4/4 on the DVD Scale. (I should note, I purchased this disc from Toymanilla Collectibles [Phillippines], so I cant speak for every seller).

I wont go into the movie description since you're buying this as a fan I venture to guess.

This is just an update about the quality of the disc:

MPEG 2  Avg Bit rate was 5.40mbps total disc rate was 7.50mbps
Region was listed as "3", but the software reader tells me its actually regions 1,3, and 4. (It played on my region 1 laptop with no problems).
Sound quality was very good for a product so old. Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround only. 192 kbps. (It would have been nice to have PCM encode, but hey... can't complain.)

subtitles clear.

Sorry I don't have the other version listed as 2009 release. It appears to only have a different cover, but don't quote me on it. I dont own that one.

If you're a fan, lay hold of the MSi-Warner Version and you can't go wrong.
