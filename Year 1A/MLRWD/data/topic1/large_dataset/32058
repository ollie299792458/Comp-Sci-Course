Can you say GODAWFUL script - did the screenwriter (and I use the term loosely) even bother to read the book?  Certainly not the book I read.  Can you say GODAWFUL costumes?  Cheap, cheap, cheap...just shoot me now.  And how about that painted red sword, folks?  Can you say GODAWFUL casting?  Oddly enough, I thought Ed Speleers was pretty good, considering his overall lack of prior experience.  The camera loves him, he has a great voice, one you don't expect to come out of that beautiful face, and he'll learn.  Jeremy Irons, one of my favorite actors and arguably one of the best still living, would have been much better as Galbatorix.  Can you say GODAWFUL John Malkovich?  Did anybody notice his non-British/Scottish accent?  Djmon Hounsou, bad.  Robert Carlyle, another fabulous actor, miscast here I think.  And Rachel Weiz, a fine actress, was totally the wrong voice for Saphira.  Did they think they were making a cartoon?  And don't get me started on Fangmeir - he shouldn't be allowed to direct traffic.  And if he was a former "special effects" whiz, I have two words for him:  Weta Workshop.  Let's hope we all live long enough to see Peter Jackson do the remake.  All things considered, is it any wonder it died at the box office.  Poor Christopher Paolini.  He dreamed of Eragon as a film and what he (and we) got was a bad cartoon with no guts, heart or soul, all of which can be found abundantly in the books.  And for anyone who wonders what Saphira should sound like, try listening to the books on DVD or casette.  Not the same guy who does the Harry Potter books on tape, but still great and the definitive Saphira.

In the end, though I hate to repeat myself, it all comes down to the script.  And this one positively sucked.  Hopefully, with the bad box office showing, they won't want to make Eldest.  Or if they do, hopefully they (the producers, the cheap cretins) have PJ's cell phone number.

By the way, I only gave it one star because zero wasn't an option.
