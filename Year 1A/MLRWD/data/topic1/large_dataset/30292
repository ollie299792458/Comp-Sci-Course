Anchor Bay's release of the complete widescreen version of Deep Red is a true revelation. I had seen this film several times in the American VHS Pan and Scan, edited editions and was never really that impressed. To me the  film seemed an interesting but flawed work that had hints of the great work  that was to come from Argento in Suspira and Infurno. Last night when I put  the new DVD version in the player I was transfixed from the first scene. I  was seeing this work of cinematic art for the first time. It took hours to  watch the entire film because I kept rewinding to view certain scenes over  and over. The film is simply stunning in ways that the old transfers never  hinted at. The pacing, art direction and cinematography brought fully back  to life, make one realize how ahead of it's time this film was,it could  have been made yesterday. One can also see the influence of such masters as  Hithcock and Fellini in Dario's vision when one can view the entire frame  in all it's clarity. I could go on forever with details describing the  beauty and importance of this film. but just buy the DVD and see for your  self. If you have any interest in horror or foreign cinema you must check  out the restored Deep Red.
