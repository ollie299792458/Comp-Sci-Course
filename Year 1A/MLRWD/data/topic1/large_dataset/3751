This is it. The film that started the teen flick phenomenom. Granted, Sixteen Candles came before this, but it never made it like The Breakfast Club did. In years to come we'd see other great teen flicks like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink and the modern, gross out movies of the nineties, such as Road Trip and American Pie. But it was The Breakfast Club that started it all off. 
It's part of pop culture, influencing in many films and referenced in hundreds of others. If you only buy one movie this year, get a life. If you buy several, make sure this is one of them. It's a movie that needs to be in your collection. 
From Judd Nelson's sarcastic Bender, to Molly Ringwald's prom queen princess Claire, the cast are a shining example of the Brat Pack, and make the whole film flow together and make it easily watched. It's believable and has a great soundtrack. John Hughes did a bang up job of writing and directing (not to mention producing) this coming of age teen comedy drama. This movie is not to be missed. Go on, treat yourself.
