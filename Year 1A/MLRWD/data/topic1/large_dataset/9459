Sorry all you nice folks having to view an edited version of Season 3 episode THE BIG MOVE.  Warner's region 2 release of this episode is complete and unedited - featuring the preview  as usual before the opening credits roll - and also the two edited scenes from the syndicate print are included !  They only amount to about 2 minutes of missing footage : 1) Fred is accosted by his new snooty neighbours as he enters his hall. They think he's the hired help and ask him for all sorts of things
much to his annoyance.: 2) After being thrown into the swimming pool fred is at work glumly atop his brontosaurus, sniffling with a cold and bemoaning his fate in his new residence. He is joyful to see Barney and wishes he could move back again. There follows a touching scene with Barney.

If you have a multi region DVD player(you can get them very cheap nowadays)  order direct fom Amazon.Co.Uk. They stock season 3 at a very low price. (Currently only eight pounds) You wont have to pay tax on such a cheap import !  Please also note that the Region 2 release of this season is on 5 SINGLE SIDED dvd's each in its very own slipcase !

I can't vouch for whether Warner Bros have rectified the missing footage problem in their Region 1 release by now - only that the Region 2 version of this episode is totally complete.  I buy stuff from Amazon.co as well as Amazon.Com. It's easy and Amazon's bargain prices are wonderful !
Hope this helps !
