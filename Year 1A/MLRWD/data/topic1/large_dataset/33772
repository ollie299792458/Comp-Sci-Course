I saw "King of New York" ten years ago and was intrigued by the trailers for the film that I had seen during the weeks before. Although there are some good moments in the film, the story is ridiculously wrought with the absurdly unexplained. For instance, why would a high-profile prosecutor (Janet Julian) so openly cavort with the infamous Frank White who knows Pete Hamill on a first-name basis? And why is Dennis Gilley (David Caruso) SOOO obsesed with bringing dealer White down in a city where cabbies get their brains blown out and social workers get their necks slit for two dollars? Although the grandiose shootout on the Queensborough Bridge was somewhat exciting, I was troubled by the fact that trained officers could fire five zillion rounds with weapons that sound like cap-guns at White and Jump and not hit either of them a single time at often such close range. And Frank's affinity for kids overtly clashes with his casual willingness to hire those same kids to deal dope when they become a little older. And Victor Argo turning in a great performance as someone else here said? Please-I've seen telephone poles with more personality than him.
