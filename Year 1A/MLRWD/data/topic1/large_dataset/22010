I have not seen the studio cut of this movie, only the restored edition, so I have no reference point to the changes that had been made.
I enjoyed the ambiguity of the characters and how very subtly they are portrayed by the great cast.  I found it hard to believe Charlton Heston with unnaturally darkened skin as a Mexican, but this is one of his better overall performances.
The camera work is fantastic, some of the most original and effective I've seen.  The opening shot alone is, so to speak, worth the price of admission.  Sometimes the frame does seem a bit claustrophobic, which may have something to do with the wide screen format, but I can't be sure.
To be honest, I want to like this movie more than I do.  The story is really very compelling; however, it is awkwardly paced through the first half and the dialogue--although often brilliant--sometimes comes across stilted.
I have the feeling that Orson Welles would have approved of this cut of the film, but I also think he could have personally done a better job with it.
