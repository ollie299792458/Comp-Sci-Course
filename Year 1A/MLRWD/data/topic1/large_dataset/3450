Watching "King Solomon's Mines"again last weekend, I was, once again, struck by the beauty of Africa, and the amazing multitudes of animals. It is good to see this 60+ year old film, because the wild animals are being driven out of their natural habitats everywhere. A new superhighway has been built right across the Serengeti, obstructing the seasonal migrations of thousands upon thousands of animals. The populations of all African nations are encroaching upon the areas where animals, even in the 1950's, used to live unhindered. I realize that there is very little that can be done about this situation. But I, for one, feel nostalgic and sad by the demise of the African fauna. That is why "King Solomon's Mines" is special. It shows a world where wild animals could roam more or less freely, in huge numbers, even in the face of bloody safaris. We Americans should not be too judgmental, however. Remember the buffalo?
This beautiful animal was almost made extinct. The Passenger Pidgeon is gone forever: it used to darken the skies over our beautiful country. And time and again, there are attempts to cut down our gorgeous Sequoias and Redwoods. There is something extraordinarily sad about all this.
