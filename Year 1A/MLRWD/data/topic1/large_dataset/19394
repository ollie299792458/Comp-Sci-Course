There is not one single reason to pick up this film - not for the story, the acting, or the soundtrack.  It is what it is:  a clich&eacute;d story and bad acting all around filling in between a series of elaborately crafted fight scenes and chase sequences.  I won't even bother with a plot description here...trust me, you just won't care.

 But oh, those magnificent fights!!!

I am so in awe.  Tony Jaa is a supremely talented martial artist, and anybody that has anything more than a white belt will instantly recognize just how talented this guy has to be in order to pull off even half of what he does in Ong-Bak the Thai Warrior.  There's no sense in trying to describe him in motion with words, any more than the essence of a lightning storm could be captured in granite.

So, grab your remote and fast forward through the obligatory "plot" parts if you are short on patience and hungry for the action.  I count about 5 good extended action scenes altogether, which IMHO is not a bad return on investment.

If karate, kung fu, muay thai or *whatever* martial arts movies are your bag, then this is your film. Just see it (if only the once) to see who's giving Jackie Chan and Jet Li a run for their money.
