Ok let me just be the first to say I hated the AVP movies.  They were just flat out terrible in every single way and almost ruined my love of the predator ( if you can acutally love such a butt ugly thing).  I had lost all hope and when I heard about this movie I cringed.  But, I can happilly say I was wrong.

This movie is great, a very worthy addition to the predator movies.  I have had a big gripe with the pacing in recent movies, Clash of the Titans as an example. But Predators gets it done just right.  You get the right enough of the characters backgrounds to make you understand them and see where theyre coming from.  Though its not really hard, everyone's a ruthless killer, but still they get it done.  The acting was great and no one dragged the movie down.  Yes a couple people were a little flat and some were cliched, when we see Danny Trejo in a movie we know where he's gonna end up....

Some people could say the movie was complete fanservice. Referencing the first movie, adding an old school predator and a very nice "in with the old and out with the new" to the predator style.  But what can I say Rodriguez did it right and he knew who he was trying to target.  Predator samurai fight scene complete with wavy grass anyone?

If youre a predator fan, an action movie fan, or just like seeing what crazy role Topher Grace is in now.  Check this movie out I would be greatly suprised if anyone came out disapointed.
