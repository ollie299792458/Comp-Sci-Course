A Separate Peace is one of the most stirring novels I have read. I was quite excited to see a movie adaptation, but I found that it fell very short from the moving themes and emotions portrayed in the book. That said, the characters in the book, especially Finny and Leper, are pretty hard to act out. To me, Gene stood out as one of the better acted characters in a movie with not-exactly-stellar acting. However, too much emphasis is placed on the relationships of four friends: Gene, Finny, Leper, and Brinker, rather than that of Gene and Finny. This makes the emotional impact seem stretched rather thin at times. The pacing of the movie is quite slow, but at the end it seems that the scenes were crammed, trying to stuff as much emotion as they could in a period of time that could not possibly portray all this feeling. In addition, the music is incredibly weak. Interestingly enough, this movie is rated R for "brief strong language." I don't know about you, but a slap across the face and an astonishing 4 curse words isn't my idea of a R rated movie.
