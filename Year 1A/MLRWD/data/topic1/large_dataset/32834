Just finishing watching this DVD after having watched the First Season of Starz "Spartacus: Blood and Sand". Was feeling quite nostalgic, and as my girlfriend had never seen this old epic, as I had several times back when, and I decided to pick it up for a watch once again. It might seem quite tame by todays standards, but we found it quite enjoyable, and feel they did an awesome job in the transfer to DVD. As noted, it is fully restored and presented uncut. Only downside I could find (nit-pickin actually, lol), was the lack of a scene selection menu. So either you watch it through one sitting, or if you want to go back and find a particular scene in the movie, you have to use the fast-forward, or skip button to locate it. I won't bother reviewing the movie, or comment on it, as others have already done that here. I just found it a pleasure to watch the "original" as I remembered it, and would definitely recommend picking up this DVD if you are curious, or nostalgic to see Stanley Kubrick's Academy Awards (4) winning tale. Make some popcorn and Enjoy!
