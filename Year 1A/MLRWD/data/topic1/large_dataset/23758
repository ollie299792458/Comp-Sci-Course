I hate to see "wanton killing" in movies.  There's too much killing in this film as there is too much killing for real in the world. Other than the excessive killing, this is an excellent motion picture.

Among my favorite scenes is the "Civil War" sequence in which the Union captain tells "the good guy" and "the ugly guy" that his troops are confronting the Southern Troops at this place in the river because there is a bridge there.  If the bridge weren't there the two sides would disperse thus saving useless carnage on both sides.  So, of course you guessed it, the "good guy" and the "ugly guy" decide to blow up the bridge so the two armies can leave the area thus leaving the "the good guy" and "the ugly guy" free reign to look for the gold.  The bridge is blown up and the two armies leave...thus saving the lives of many men.  It's a beautiful sequence.

Yes, be prepared for alot of "shooting" and "killing" during most of the film but see this masterpiece just the same!  Recommended

Afterthought:  If I had been the director of this film, or of other films in which people are shot and killed, I think I'd consider using a technique that was twice actually used in this film:  At a certain point twice in the movie,  Clint Eastwood shoots at "townspeople"----What was depicted was Eastwood "shooting off their hats" (bang! bang! bang!)instead of killing them.  Perhaps this same "technique" of "shooting off hats" in place of plugging the people full of lead and watching them die in agony could have diminished the "killing sprees" in the film for the sake of "sensitive folk" possibly like you and me who dislike seeing people getting drilled with bullets and dying in agony with their blood all over the place!  Good idea?  :o) Email  boland7214@aol.co
