News is that the complete series (sadly short as it was)  including the pilot, a "making of" documentary and some cast and crew interviews will be available on Region 1 DVD in the second quarter of 2010. I watched this with my kids when it was new and we have wondered for years when it would be available on DVD. My daughter, now a grandmother herself, still shivers at the mention of the Anubis, thanks to an episode of this show and a brother, older by 19 months, who thought part of his job description was to terrify his little sister. Since it has already been released in Regions 2 and 4, it's nice to know that those of us with Region 1 players will be able to have it in the next 6 months or so. It may not be the greatest TV show ever, but it is far from the worst, and it has a steadfast group of fans. Those of us who chased it around the ABC schedule back in 1982-83 ( it started on Wednesday night from 8-9, then ABC moved it to Friday night from 10-11, then moved it back to Wednesday from 9-10) can surely wait a few more months for it. It's a little adventure, a little nostalgia, South Pacific islands, a Grumman Goose, a one-eyed dog, spies and schemers and, taken all together, it's just fun to watch.
