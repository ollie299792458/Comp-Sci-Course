I was very disappointed and disturbed by this film. It wasn't my choice, but as a fan of Robin Williams, I decided I would give it a chance. The first 45 minutes of the film is good.  The Martin's get the new  "Robot" who the Pepsi girl accidently names Andrew.  Andrew is a  unique, one of a kind robot who deep down really wants to be human and  mortal. Immortaliy stinks for him. The film moves through different periods  of the families' life, and brings us to almost 200 years later, and Andrew  is still trying to become more human.  he even falls in love with a human,  and she, although she knows it could never really work, falls in love with  him too.  well, she never really declares her love.  but they spend time  together, and this is where the film starts to disturb me, a machine and a  woman are just happily in love?  and people are watching this with their  children?  i would never watch this with children, or recommend it to  families.  This is just a strange story, with some real philosophical  questions being asked. I really wouldn't call this movie Science Fiction.  It's kind of a comedy in the beginning, and then it just turns to mush.  The acting couldn't even save this movie.  Robin Williams is the only star  in this waste of film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
