After reading a few reviews of this movie it is clear that it is a movie that you either love or hate. Personally, I love it. It is easily the best movie of 1999, and fully deserved its three Oscar nominations. John Cusack  is well cast as a struggling puppeteer whose life takes a strange turn when  he discovers a hidden door in his office. Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz  also put in fine performances. John Malkovich has a tough role to play but  pulls it off with conviction. If you are expecting a laugh-a-minute comedy  then this movie probably isn't for you. Although it has it's funny moments,  these are subtly played - like Cusack applying for a filing job on the  seven and a halfth floor, which has rather low ceilings (low overheads you  see, so the savings can be passed onto the customer...).  The overall  premise is pure fantasy and requires suspension of disbelief but if you are  prepared to go along with it, this movie is well worth seeing. It is very  thought-provoking. Finding a category for this movie would be a tough job,  but the best I can come up with is 'bizarre existentialist philosophical  comedy' (but don't let that put you off...). The DVD itself is very good.  Excellent picture and sound, and some extras although these are of  questionable quality. The 'interview' with director Spike Jonze is quite  frankly baffling. It takes place in a moving car and he ends up getting out  and vomiting. Whatever.  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this. It easily  slots into my top 10 movies. One of the most original movies I have ever  seen.
