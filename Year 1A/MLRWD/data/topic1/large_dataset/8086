Its really good to watch a Hepburn film where she's not playing a demure princess.And she displayed her good acting talent in this one.

  Audrey Hepburn palys a newly blind woman who was left in a house by her husband and who was being terrorized by a group of nasty men trying to retrieve a doll inside her house filled with drugs.Its up to her to save herself with a little help from a little girl next door.Richard Crenna's character pretends to be an authority trying to help her to get inside the house easier  but they somehow couldnt find the doll.The men inside her house seem to be acting strange (she hears somebody wiping the furniture all over the living room) then she realized theyre up to something.

  The highlight of the film is when she's trying to save herself (breaking all the light bulbs so they would be equal) from the killer Alan Arkin.

  I saw this one rainy day and it added to the suspense.This is one of the greatest suspense movies ive seen.
