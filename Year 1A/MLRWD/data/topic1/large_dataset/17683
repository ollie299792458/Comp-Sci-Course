I had never heard of this movie until about a month or so ago when it was mentioned in a "chat room".  How I missed this indi film I just can't imagine.  The acting, writing, directing, special effects .... what can I say, words just can't describe any of those things.

This is one of those movies you just have to watch for yourself to believe.

Now I don't know if amazon.com will allow what I am about to say in a review or not but here goes.  While I think everyone NEEDS to see this "film", I can't recommend an actual "PURCHASE".  Now if you watch it, and then "must needs" add it to your film library, good for you, but I personally won't tell you to buy it first.

OK here goes, if you have netflix it is available for streaming - granted unless you are watching on your big flat screen, with surround sound, you might not appreciate the genious, but even watching it on your computer will give you a "feel".  So don't believe those naysayers here with those poor reviews - keep an open mind (actually an intake of aahh how to say this, some mind enhancing substances - only legal ones - will probably add to the enjoyment of this film).  If you are a college student and can watch it with a group of  uhmm.....  again mind enchanced friends (legal of course) it will be an even more enjoyable experience.

So "load up" , sit back and enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EI2NMM">Birdemic: Shock and Terror</a>!  Two big thumbs up (oh wait, hell, I am seeing three thumbs ....... )
