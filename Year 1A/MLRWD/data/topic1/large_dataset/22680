The voice of Christmas Past in this fabulous cartoon version of Dickens' classic is performed by Joan Gardner, the same voice as that of Tiny Tim, and NOT by June "Rocky the Flying Squirrel" Foray; this is abundantly clear to any listener who pays attention.

Somehow, the June-Foray-as-Christmas-Past error is now being perpetuated via the internet, with even original producer Lee Orgel's son now joining the chorus of the uninformed.  Note that Ms. Foray's name does not appear on the closing credits of the original show; considering her fame as a voice artist at the time, she surely would have been listed if she had actually performed on the soundtrack.

Additionally, Morey Amsterdam (also a very popular name in 1962)appears only briefly on the soundtrack---as one of the businessmen that Scrooge meets on the street in the future ("When did he die?") and as the singing voice of Cratchit's oldest son (you clearly hear his voice during the words "And on the tree a star of shining Christmas gold.." in the song "the Lord's Bright Blessing").

It's important to get as many facts as possible CORRECT about this great Christmas classic.  Of course, WHOEVER owns the rights to "Magoo's Christmas Carol" could do its legions of fans a GREAT service by releasing a complete, thoroughly documented soundtrack on CD!
