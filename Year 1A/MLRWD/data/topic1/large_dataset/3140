I like werewolves. Out of all the horror creatures and monsters I've always enjoyed werewolves the most. I have watched just about any movie with a werewolf in the story or on the cover. Unfortunatley, most werewolf movies suck. Some notable exceptions are: "Ginger Snaps", "the Howling" "Wolfen" and of course "American Werewolf in London". I was hestitant to pick up Big Bad Wolf because I have been let down often in the past ("Bad Moon" and "Cursed" come to mind) but Big Bad Wolf delivered. I never expected the werewolf character to talk and deliver diabolical one-liners. And also didn't expect the werewolf to be a horny SOB that rapes his female victims. Fortunately both angles work well and make this werewolf story both unique and memorable.

Richard Tyson always plays an effective bad guy and does it again in this movie even though he is covered in a werewolf suit for some of the movie. The story ain't perfect but the effects are decent and all in all its a good movie thats a satisfying mix of horror and camp. I'm looking foward to more carnage, perversion and one-liners from the Big Bad Wolf in the future.
