I loved this movie, because in many ways I see my boyfriend and I. I love that she decided to keep herself and he didnt pressure her after meeting her. Although I am a virgin, my bf is not so I see both our struggles in this movie. I may not be rich, but I love how similar we are. I watch this movie over and over and dont feel that I will ever get tired of it. For those who say it was boring or not funny have weird taste in my opinion. I love the different characters and would watch this over any Tyler Perry movie any day. I don't think Our Family Wedding had anything on this either. Although I like Our Family Wedding and Tyler Perry movies, I just felt the realness of this movie. The chemistry and the love demonstrated were so obvious. The two different types of mothers demonstrated may have been over the top at times, but I think they represented many mothers and it added to the greatness of this movie. I loved all the praying and talking to God, which could be a reason that some people didnt like the movie also. But I want to give it 7 stars. Love, love, love this movie!
