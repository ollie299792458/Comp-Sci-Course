A Christmas story too as it was anchored around the birthday which was on Xmas day (December 25). That's probably why Sundance decided to make its TV debut around XMas. Not your typical Christmas story for sure...

The family portrayed has all sorts of personalities/(stereo)types:

* macho dad

* caring/nurturing mom

* rebel without a cause first-son

* Weezer/book-geek son

* hockey-playing son

* gay son

* youngest son of a big family

A well-done movie, realistic, grounded, emotional, even-keeled (given all the drama), quirky, funny at times, with 70s music (a lot of Pink Floyd). In french.

If you are tired of formulaic, fast-food like, disposable, predictable, mass-market movies with recycled plots and jokes, give this one a try!

(Was there a not-so-subtle homage to Pink Floyd by the director/producer? The prism painted on his bedroom wall was very similar to a certain Pink Floyd album cover...)
