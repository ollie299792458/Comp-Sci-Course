While at first this movie starts out not long after the end of the first movie, but quickly jumps to 7 years after the events of the first movie.  Damien is now 12 years old, though not realizing who he really is, and though living with his Uncle Richard and his second wife in Chicago.  Although Damien doesn't know about his demonic powers, while at the same time someone at the military school that seem to know who Damien really is.  While Damien is at military school there are people once again trying to do what they can to warn Damien's, Uncle Richard to who his nephew really is and just like his brother doesn't truly believe that what he's hearing is true.  Throughout the movie, I have to say that they tried everything they can to make this movie a extension to tell more of the story where the first movie left off, and some of the effects in the movie I have to say are nicely done.  Even some of the deaths that occur mostly with the people that seem to threaten Damien in any way were good in how they tried to make it look like that they may have been possessed in any way.  Near the end his cousin Mark, as well as his uncle finds out who Damien really is, although one of them tries to do something about it.  Overall I give this movie 4 stars out of 5.
