If you don't like sad endings, you'll somehow manage to save a place in your heart for this spectacular tragedy. I'll tell you up front, it's a massacre of emotions at the end. You will cry. You will think yourself unable to bear watching this movie again.
And then you remember the cute little song at the beginning. You watch that. Then you skip forward to the powerhouse dance number, "Dhola Re". Then you catch the awesome dance just before the half-time intermission. And then... you start over and cry through it all one more time.
This movie will haunt you. Aishwarya Rai and Shah Rukh Khan start off powerfully enough, but then Madhuri Dixit starts hoofing and before you can say, "Didn't she play a prostitute in that movie?", you're whipping out your copy of Munna Bhai MBBS to check out the freshman hazing scene to see how they match up with Aishu and Madhuri.
BUY THIS DVD. It will kick your butt and paint you purple with pleasure. Way more than that Linkin Park CD you were considering purchasing as a doorstop. Worst case, you got an exotic Indian doorstop, but I think not. Get over it being in Hindi and BUY IT! Then buy all the other movies with Shah Rukh in 'em. Except Ye Lamhe Judaai Ke. That one reeked. How it got released is another story. THIS ONE IS AWESOME! FOCUS ON THIS MOVIE, FOOL MORTAL!
