Since the creation of the Blu Ray player, there is one movie I have begged, wished for, and lamented not being available in this format.  And now it is being released!  Yes, The Crow, the one and ONLY original will be released on October 18, 2011.  Blaise is doing the happy dance.  Even the idea that I will soon have in my hands the greatest movie of all time, in the best format ever created, makes me smile.

"I tell you when I used to think about the idea itself it put a big old smile on my face."

This is my favorite movie all over again!  It turned out even better than I thought it would, almost like really being on set.  We lost the "rain effect" so when they keep saying "it can't rain all the time" it looks a little weird but hey, small price to pay.  And I noticed things I had never seen before.  Like when Skank is driving the stolen car down the dead end alley it says "Happy" on the dead end wall.  Happy Ending, get it?  And the church!  In the scene when Top Dollar grabs Sarah, you can read "Demolished by Neglect" on the church. Seriously, if you a re a fan, this is as close to being there as you'll ever get!
