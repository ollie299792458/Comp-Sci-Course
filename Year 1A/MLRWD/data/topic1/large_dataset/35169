This could best be described as a very quiet and subtle film. It is extremely beautiful, in fact, all the Oscar nominations it received paid homage to that. Not many critics, however, seem to mention or notice that beauty lies not only in the scenery, but also in the plot. Maybe the reason I find the plot so clear and so appealing is that I read the book by Tracy Chevalier before I watched the movie. They are slightly different, but for the most part, the overall feeling is captured from book to movie and from movie to book.
This movie basically covers the realtionship Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer develops with his newly hired maid, who not only cleans his study, but also shares with him a passion and understanding for his work that his very wife cannot comprehend. He is not so much obssessed with Griet as he is captivated by the fact that she seems to just get him. It is this feeling that is meant to fuel the whole movie, but for some people it just doesn't. And I guess that's understandable. After all, it is a strange happening, a relationship that was unusual back then and that would still be unusual now, not because a master is getting on with his maid, but because he isn't.
