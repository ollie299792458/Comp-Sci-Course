Not really a "date film" unless you have a date with lifelong celibacy, this chintzy remake of the lovely &lt;i>Wings of Desire&lt;/i> plays like a bitter Gnostic parody of the original, in which the bumbling servant of an incompetent demiurge (played by Nicholas Cage with a kind of monosyllabic breathlessness,) gives up eternal life and the music of the sunset in order to participate in one of the most annoying sex scenes ever committed to film. After the indulgence (tacky in itself, but particularly grating when compared to the original film's treatment of the same event,) the occasion of his fall (the improbable Meg Ryan, as a heart surgeon with a peculiarly pointless straw-fiancee,) wastes no time in getting herself mowed down by a lumber truck. Our ex-angel then tries to convince himself that it was all worth it, as the audience is bombarded with evidence to the contrary. 
Creepily mechanistic plot devices and schlocky dialogue further contribute to the pain-- and it's an awful lot of pain to go through just to confirm the same sad half-truths about the tragedy of human embodiment. Watch it with the one you love, just before you break the news of your decision to enter religious orders.
