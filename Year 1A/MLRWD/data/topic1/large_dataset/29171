We all know by now about climate change and waste heat in cities, but Soylent Green was the first to show it. The alarm about population growth had been sounded by Dr. Paul Ehrlich, and during the eco-conscious seventies, people were taking it seriously. Several films (and many books) featured overpopulation themes, but few did it better than SG. The gap between rich and poor also seems more prescient now, with the rich living in fortresses and the poor scrambling as best they can. Given those conditions, it is not surprising that New York looks like Calcutta, or that the local constabulary is corrupt as a matter of course. The film barrels along with Charlton Heston playing his other stalwart (the Hero-Heel) and Edward G. Robinson stealing every scene he's in. The McGuffin is the murder of Joseph Cotten (we never do find out why) but the murder is just the trace of a plot to lead us through this society of divided classes, scarce resources, and social management amounting to mob control. The lack of high-tech stuff has been noted - they didn't anticipate the miniaturization of electronics - but the energy problem is right in front. Energy costs, and the poor ride their stationary bikes to charge up the batteries. (I've often wondered why Sears doesn't sell that arrangement.) In short, see it twice. The first time through, follow the plot and weep for Eddie. The second time, notice the scenery along the way. Fascinating.
