I really liked the first Underworld, so I expected a lot from this one; I wasn't disappointed. The movie picked up right from where the first one ended, and moved at a quick pace through each scene with nary slow parts. They achieved this very well because the story was expounded and progressed easily along with the action sequences. This is a vampire movie, so everything is dark, and they've filtered the colors with a blue tint, and this created an eerily beautiful effect. The character development is very thin, of course most of that was taken care of in the first film. This one was did seem very linear and predictable, relying on spectacular effects and action to carry the weight of the film. But, like I said, this doesn't really mean a lot because the first movie covered everything important. Remember in the 80s where every movie had a bunch of small battles culminating in one scene where the protagonist faced off with the "big boss"? Evolution was like an extended big boss scene, only with more revelation and a bigger boss. The ending did leave room for a sequel, but also concludes everything so if they made a sequel they would have to write a new story unrelated except featuring Kate and Scott's characters. I really enjoyed this movie. If you liked the first one, this one is a no-brainer.
