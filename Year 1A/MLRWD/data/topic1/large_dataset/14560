If you have any of the following skip it

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000085EEI">Mr. Bean - The Whole Bean (Complete Set)</a> ( I didn't have this but disc 1-3 on The Ultimate Collection appear to be this judging by the menu in which Mr. bean is poping out of a can that has The Whole Bean writen on the bottom) disc 1-3

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AJ1TJ">Mr. Bean The Animated Series, Vols. 1 & 2 (It's Not Easy Being Bean / Bean There Done That)</a> disc 4-5

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007AJF7">Bean: The Movie</a> disc 6

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WOQKCQ">Mr. Bean's Holiday (Widescreen Edition)</a> disc 7

I gave it 4 stars because I love Mr. Bean and since I didn't have any of this because I skipped The Whole Bean because of it missing scenes ( but I guess I got it anyway )

and finally in response to the review and questions i have seen on here

hate to be the bearer of bad news so far it appears that it is the edited ver. even more so it looks to me as the set is a rehash the seven disc break down like this Mr. bean: vol 1,2,3 ( 3 discs ( thats the t.v. series ( looks to be the the whole bean because of the menus ),then you have bean: the movie( 1 disc ), Mr. bean's holiday( 1 disc ), then you have two disc from the animated series bean there, done that ( 1 disc ) and it's not easy being bean ( 1 disc ) so far I watched some of this the main missing scenes that people talked about from the whole bean being missing are m.i.a here too where he fights with the old lady over the chair in "do-it yourself" and where he guess the weight of the turkey in "merry Christmas"

***Edit to point to the act that is rehash ever more so is vol 1-3 on this set have the same error in the order of episodes as The Whole Bean i am 99.9% sure that it is the whole bean but since I have never seen hat set myself I am still 00.1% not sure
