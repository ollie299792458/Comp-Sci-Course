This isn't a documentary about the man who wrote a fake autobiography about the legendary Howard Hughes.  It is the tale of the author, from the author's point of view.

The Hoax centers on Clifford Irving, a down on his luck writer, who brilliantly tricks McGraw Hill into publishing his autobiography.  Like most delusional writers, Irving finds himself more fascinating than Howard Hughes, the President (Nixon) and the time period itself.  He finds himself to be very clever and sees himself as a master puppeteer.  Richard Gere does a fine job portraying Irving's smooth arrogance and Alfred Molina is superb as his best friend and co-author.

It's impossible to root for anything other than justice in this film.  You won't secretly wish that Irving is successful and retires on a tropical island, but it is interesting to watch his perspective of these historical events.  It's fascinating to learn about the connection between Howard Hughes, The President and Watergate for those of us that aren't up on our history books.  And the DVD special features are full of facts and interesting information.

There are enough twists in the movie to keep it from falling flat in the third act, however those that are familiar with the true life story seem insulted that Irving is given a voice at all.  The movie does end with Clifford all but patting himself on his own back, but again, like it or not, it's his story and he was the slimy crook that lived it.
