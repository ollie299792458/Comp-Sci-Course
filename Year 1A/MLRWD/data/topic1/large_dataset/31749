What a fun movie! It's sexy, dorky, cool, hip, wild, fun and definitely worth seeing! Yes, it may be a tad corny at times, but it really is a well-done musical. This movie is probably enjoyed most by:

1) fans of Johnny Depp...if you consider yourself a true Johnny Depp fan, then you HAVE to see this movie. You won't regret it.

2) fans of Grease (although this movie is more of a satire of the 50s)

3) anyone who loves great music!

This movie will have you up out of your chair singing and dancing!! The music by far is the best part (besides Johnny). My favorite is the sultry "Please, Mr. Jailer." You'll be singing it all day. In addition to all the awesome songs, there's romance, action, comedy, and a bunch of kids who love bein bad cuz it sure feels good!

The plot of this movie is basically the Squares (good kids) versus the Drapes (bad kids). Allison is a square, but she can't help but have feelings for the ultra-cool, ultra-hip, ultra-adorable Cry Baby Walker (Johnny), who is known for his ability to cry one single teardrop. Allison finds herself having a wonderful time with Cry Baby and his gang (Hatchet-Face is my favorite character...you have to see her to believe it), but the other Squares can't stand to see Allison become a Drape. This leads to the ultimate battle between the nerds and the cool kids. Later Cry Baby winds up in jail...can Allison convince the judge that he is innocent?

You'll have to buy it to find out. So, if you're 15 or older (it does include the F word, and a LOT of intense and sloppy tongue-kissing), you LOVE Johnny Depp, you love great 50s music, or you just adore having fun, then this movie is undoubtedly for you.
