PROOF must have demonstrated higher power in its successful Broadway run than in the mild drama on view here.  The acting can't be faulted, exactly (although a case could certainly be made for Paltrow's nasal whine as the most irritating star voice since Liz Taylor's breathless baby-doll gurgle of the 60's and 70's -- surely her unquestionable ability's not well served by roles like this, or SYLVIA, where she has to complain endlessly).  The problem's the script.  By now, the central situation's probably known to most audiences going in, which leaves a long, static first act of exposition to arrive at a singularly unsurprising curtain line.  Once the conflict's established, the action plods like clockwork to an entirely predictable conclusion.  No incidental felicities of soaring language or intriguing character tics to provide interest along the way.  Despite the star power on display, and pedigree of the script, PROOF plays like a Lifetime movie-of-the-week, with slighly higher production values.  A major disappointment.
