Rented this before buying it to make sure my girls (2 & 5) liked it...WOW. I did not expect to cry!  This movie is so great and with such a touching ending, I don't even think I could explain it without giving the ending away.
There was some language that I had to explain to my daughters that while they aren't dirty words, they are words I do not expect to come out of their mouths; words such as IDIOT, MORON, and DUMMY.  Those words are not said in our home and I don't think they were necessary to ad to this movie, however, now-a-days, its pretty hard to find a good family movie without curse words, so I let it slide.
There were also some dark, scary parts to the movie where some other kids I know who watched it were crying and terrified...knowing this ahead of time I did tell my children to please remember its just a movie and cartoons always end happy, so don't be scared. Neither were.

The last 10 minutes of the movie, make the entire movie worth watching over and over.  Hit me on so many levels, that the 5 times we watched it before sending it back, I cried each and every time.

My two year old was very mad at me for returning the movie (had to, it was rented!) so I told Santa that they really wanted it and I"m sure they won't be disappointed come Christmas morning.

A must have if you or your child is a Toy Story Fan.  This one was our favorite.
