I cannot say how many times my family has watched this movie because it is so good! It is a great family movie especially if you are adopting or dealing with infertility. It is an outdated adoption story but never the less the same feelings are there about adoption and infertility. Times are different now and I am sure if this movie remade it would be made very different and not so sugary. But that is what was so great about movies from this era it helps you escape from some of reality. Cary Grant is at his best! He is a true man in every sense of the word in this movie as father and husband. Irene Dunn and Cary Grant had great screen chemistry. I love the part where the baby wakes up and he stubbs his toe little things in this movie makes it cute. It is both endearing and sad. The time when they make mommy a birthday dinner, the Christmas program. When Cary Grant (Roger) goes before the judge to keep his baby because he lost his job, now that was a great preformance! But the movie is very sad when little Trina dies only to try to save their marriage while they grieve for the little daughter. It is an amazing story especially the end which you was slightly unrealistic but very wonderful. I love the man who plays AppleJack he was on Leave It To Beaver too. :) I highly recommend this video it will touch your heart! I do wish they would digitally remaster this movie it is worth it!
