In comes Roger Moore in 'Live And Let Die', sophisticated, suave and with the best delivery of the line 'Bond, James Bond' to date. Roger Moore's performance is avant garde, filled with biting wit and delicious sarcasm. You can tell in his behaviour, just by the looks he throws in different situations, that this Bond is always thinking, analyzing and reacting. Bond is the character not the actor. But when an actor portrays the essence of a character through his acting and not just his physicality, he is more successful. Through careful analysis, Roger Moore is the more interesting Bond, so far and the funniest in a subtle and effective way.  This makes a difference in the world of entertainment; Moore entertains. The film itself is well paced and has lots of wit and humour but Hamilton has lost the modern edge with 'Diamonds Are Forever' and now with 'Live And Let Die'. This does not make the film fall short of being entertaining and engaging. It also serves up plenty of inventive action and very interesting character actors with great performances. The story is as sharp as the re-master!
