This is a film in the spirt of American Beauty, in that they are both films about a mans mid-life crisis.  This film takes a look at the life of a reluctant hit man who is dominated by his father, and is looking to have an affiar not for love or lust, just for the simple fact that it makes him feel something.  
  The streagth of this film is in its strong characters, great acting and interesting relationships.  William H. Macy gives a great performance in the lead character, convicingly protraying the kind of quiet desperation that he is so well noted for.  But what makes this film rise above the average is the array of supporting characters that are shockingly well written and well acted.  Nev Campell gives a strog performance as the younger better looking half of the affair and manages to create a solid character that has more motivation that the standard sex pot mistress.  Donald Sutherland manages to create a truly distubing charcter as a father who will go the extra mile to keep his family business alive.  
  These characters make the basis for a very solid movie.  My only problem was the fact that this movie never quite got all the through to me.  Somehow the payoff for this movie didn't satisfy me totally, but it was still easily worth the time.
