It is very difficult to find happy, upbeat gay themed films that leave you feeling positive about life.
This music in this musical film is well written, and well sung and choreographed.
The film is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's "A MidSummer Night's Dream". Simply stated is is the story of Timothy, the sole out gay student at an elite boy's prep-school. His drama class plans a senior play, "A MidSummer Night's Dream", and as the story progresses his life begins to parallel the play. The lead is a beautiful young man who can sing. The drama teacher is a fabulous woman who any gay man would love. Timothy's divorced mother is strugling to support herself, Timothy, and pay his private school tuition. Like most mothers, she must deal with Timothy being openly gay and being honest about his sexuality. But, she does not reject her gay son: she just has difficulty dealing with it with the usual fears about the consequences of her son being openly gay and being comfortable with his relationships.
The plot is not convoluted or unrealistic, but there are times that you have to suspend disbelief: people do not break out in song to express themselves, but it is a musical.
I do not want to include a spoiler, but I can say that this is a happy film in which people confront their obstacles without any one dying of AIDS or ending up single and lonely.
When you are feeling down, this is a great film to watch to lift your spirits.
