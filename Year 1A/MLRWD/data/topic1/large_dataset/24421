I saw THE WAR OF THE WORLDS when it was first released in 1953. It was an extraordinary experience. Other 1950's science fiction movies are notorious for their cheesy special effects and predictable plots. But this movie, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, and FORBIDDEN PLANET stand out as powerful exceptions to this rule. Its real strength does not reside in its outstanding special effects or excellent acting. It resides in its plot. The underlying idea being: we are the most technologically advanced species on Earth, but this notion fails beyond Earth. It is best summed up when Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene Barry) says: "We know now that we can't beat their (the Martians') machines. We must beat them." The Martians are not defeated by Human intelligence. They are defeated by Human spiritual qualities that invite divine intervention.
The DVD does have one weakness; its special features are limited to a theatrical trailer. This flaw is forgivable, because the movie itself is perfect.
