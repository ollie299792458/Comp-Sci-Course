Puss in Boots is an animated movie that makes me believe that a pussy cat and an egg can be best friends. Antonio Banderas provides the voice of Puss. Zach Galifianakis is the voice of Humpty Dumpty. They are two characters who grew up together in the film. Their bond of friendship is fun to watch develop in the movie. The story of Puss in Boots is actually based on a French fairy tale about a cat with a talent for stealing things.  The plot of the movie centers around Puss and Humpty searching for magic beans.  These magic beans grow into a bean stalk that leads to a giant's castle.  Inside the castle is a goose that lays golden eggs.  Nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill are the villains in the film. Only the movie makers of Dream Works can breathe life and personality into these two characters.  I love the creative license of the animators.  There are two things about the movie that make it special.  The animation and music are excellent. My favorite scene has Puss sword  fighting and dancing with a female cat named Kitty Soft Paws.  She is voiced by Selma Hayek.  This scene in the movie is very funny.  I love the simple scenes of the movie.  One scene has Puss riding a horse in the back drop of a setting sun.  The film is scored by composer Henry Jackman.  His music gives the movie a sensual latin flair. There is a track of music in the film entitled "The Puss Suite".  This piece of music sounds so uplifting and heroic.  Rodrigo Y Gabriela are two latin guitar musicians.  They perform a track entitled "Diablo Rojo" in the film.  This instrumental  is upbeat and beautiful to listen to. Puss In Boots is a very entertaining animated film.  I like every aspect of it.
