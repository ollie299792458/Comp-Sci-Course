This has been compared to Tender Mercies but the two movies could not be more dissimilar. Tender Mercies was original & believable on every level and had tremendous depth. Crazy Heart was a formulaic Hollywood product. The child actor in Crazy Heart was one of its big flaws; he was never believable and pretty much destroyed the realism of every scene he was in. The movie presented a basically tired story and told it in a fairly tired way, with an extremely lame "AA" moment, wherein Jeff Briges character stands up and makes his big AA admission -- a moment we've seen in a hundred other movies and tv shows. That was the movie's lowest point, and it was pretty bad!

On the positive side, some of the music was nice and it was nicely integrated into the movie. Other than that, this was forgetable Hollywood junk. Jeff Bridges was good in some parts of it but the character was repetitive more so than interesting. Get the CD if you like country music, but if you're looking for a good, well told story, don't waste your time on the DVD.
