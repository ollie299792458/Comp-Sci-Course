Especially in the face of ST: First Contact, Insurrection comes across as a bitter disappointment. Many of Star Trek's greatest weaknesses shine through all too plainly in this latest rendition. The space battles suffer from the "last-ditch effort that ends up completely annihiliating the  enemies" syndrome, the regulars are far more goofy than warranted, and  the almost hubric human-centric foundation of the show is worse than ever.  (aliens once again look _just_ like humans, and Picard seems shocked when  Worf doesn't know who Gilbert and Sullivan are -- how much does Picard know  of 20th century Klingon satiric operatists? Not that the term "20th  century" isn't in and of itself a human-centric term...). The climax  is unsatisfying and smacks too strongly of the ones in a large portion of  Star Trek episodes. Nothing original, nothing innovative. Just same old,  same old, and that's just not good enough for me anymore.
Now that I've  got that out of the way, let me talk about the DVD. The video transfer is  only adequate in this film -- I still see some grain and the colors seem a  bit washed out all throughout, especially in the outdoor scenes. The audio  is mediocre as well, with little punch and a general sense of muting all  through the film. And as far as extras go, the "featurette"  included is a joke -- merely a glorified commercial telling you how great  this movie is.
Yeah, go ahead and get it if you're a Star Trek collector,  but I'd caution against it, at least not without a rental first.
