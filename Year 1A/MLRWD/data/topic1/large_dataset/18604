After seeing this movie for my Latin American History and Culture class, I thought hey - pretty good for an historical film.  It has a great cast (kind of odd to see DeNiro in a role like this one) and the cinematography is excellent.  The general plot is the fight for the right to land and liberty between Guarani Indians, missionaries (who supposedly want to "help" them) and the Europeans.  It makes the Guarani people out to be easily trainable savages and the missionaries to be selfless helpers.  But were they really?  The way events occur in this movie are pretty questionable.  I think it's really necessary to take a closer look at the racism and control issues going on in the real history before you believe everything this movie says.  The way in which the Guarani were portrayed is definitely racist, giving way too much credit to Europeans.  Other than that, (I hope I didn't discourage anyone - it's not that off) the movie was pretty good.  It gives the American audience a good general insight to what goes on in South America, because often we are a bit egotistical (if that's the word) and think that people only get pushed around in the United States.  But really it happens everywhere.  If you have any desire to know what goes on down there, take a look at "The Mission."
