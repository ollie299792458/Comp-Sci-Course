Ocean's Eleven... refering to the 11 people that make up this delightfully cast gang of criminals headed by Danny Ocean(George Clooney.)
This is a thouroughly entertaining movie. It has action and comedy and a dash of romance.  But what makes it even better is that the action is not kill-em-all action of some of the more recent movies. It has entertaining action sequences where the action means "movement" and some explosions.  And the comedy is not the slapstick and innuendo comedy, but the more sophisticated irony and coincidence. And the romance is not the "I must kill myself because I WAAANNTTT you" romance.  It's a romance about trust.
If you liked Ocean's Eleven with George Clooney and this kind of humor, try "O' Brother Where Art Thou?".
Little did I know that this is a "remake" of a 1960s Ocean's 11.  Hmm...
The other characters were also wonderfully well cast.  My favorite was the old man who's name I can't spell right now played by Carl Reiner.  His wonderful character transitions to and from the European whos emeralds must be put in the vault and his Retired Con-man's pessimistic personality.  That was very entertaining!(This statement coming from someone who is an amature actress)
The movie never let my attention wander, there was so much I didn't want to miss.
