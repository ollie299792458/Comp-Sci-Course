I didn't expect much from a remake and I liked the original better. However, I did not dislike this version.

The first part of the movie showing society sinking into chaos are simply excellent. Some of the best footage of the modern action side of horror movies was done in those first 15 minutes. Looks like a lot of reviewers have beat me to the punch here, so I won't spend time on this.

The middle part is pretty good, too. Featuring Ving Rhames (The New Kojak, Pulp Fiction) as a shotgun toting cop. The movie brings a little something extra to the zombie claustrophobia lore with Andy the gunshop owner trapped in a building next door. Andy has to communicate with the main cast with signs. Ving and Andy exchange news, jokes, and play chess by posting each other's moves.  The interaction and silent friendship built up was good characterization.

On the downside, I think the plethora of surplus characters in the main cast contributed to a lack of story towards the end.  Good story and social commentary makes a pretty good horror movie excellent and this remake ran out of it towards the end. A few of the supporting cast turned in good performances though, including Ty Burrell, and Michael Kelly.

Dawn 2004 follows the Rabid, 28 days, style of fast moving, arcade style zombies instead of the Romero classic, awkward moving style. I don't think they should be called zombies if they move quicker and better than humans. I am thinking ghouls may be a better term for these new movie undead.

This is a far better remake than the slew of bad ones we have seen in the last few years, e.g. Rollerball's dismal remake. Doesn't replace Dawn '78, but it's pretty good. Nothing wrong with making a pretty good movie.
