First off: I'm a libertarian and I hated Bush and Kerry pretty evenly.

when I sat down to watch this dvd I had a pad of paper with me.  I was going to write down each valid reason the movie gave to vote for Kerry over Bush.  I could have used a post-it note.

The beauty of this documentary is that Bush won and so you can look at people's fear of 4 more years of Bush and see that they aren't valid.  One lady said she had to vote for Kerry because Bush would take away her social security.  Didn't happen.  Eddie Vetter and another musician hinted that Bush would use the draft.  Didn't happen.  Al Gore won the popular vote.  Irrelevant.  They talked about how Bush is immoral while trying to get people to vote for a VP who had multiple affairs while his wife was suffering from cancer.

The complaints about the war and the national debt were the only valid arguments made against Bush.  Of course using these two arguments to convince people to vote for Kerry is pointless.

The movie says Kerry lost by only 100,000 votes but he lost by over 3,000,000.  But I guess if you were looking for accurate information you wouldn't watch a michael morre movie.

It's just sad to see people get fired up about how crappy government is and then put that momentum into supporting someone like Kerry.  If you want something different you need to vote for someone different.  Again, I was indifferent to either Bush or Kerry but as you watch the movie and listen to the idiotic Michael Moore drones with their che guevera t'shirts it makes you feel good that they failed.

on a side note: Is michael moore so fat that he demands special recliners on every stage for him to sit on?
