I will not comment the story, everyone should know it by now /my opinion:nr.2 is the best of all 3 movies/, let us get to the packaging of this book, I found the design of the first one better, but this second one has a voice chip integrated into the left eye, activated by poking the eye, than a scream comes out at you /similar thing to what Shrek2 had as a Spec.Ed.dvd/. The first book had a pvc seethrough cover with a paper top with description on it, second one comes only in wholesize paper cover, with no seethrough cover.

Both books together are scheduled for release Novem./

Decemb.2005 in one paper package /same paper pack. as the second book/ as a gift set edition.

I also recommend you to get a bootleg /30minutes/ of the original short movie WITHIN THE WOODS starring THE CHIN himself Mr.BRUCE CAMPBELL, I got it, the quality of vhs/dvd transfer was poor of course, but still a major thing for the hard deadite fans.

The 2005 region2 /United Kingdom/ re - edition of The EVIL DEAD 1 /1982/ - BOOK OF THE DEAD1 was released as a 2dvd set including an extra dvd put alongside with the booklet with a film starring B.Campbell called Running Time /1998/, it had English DD2.0+DD5.1+DTS5.1,no extras.

So keep your fingers crossed for The EVIL DEAD 4, Campbell,Tapert and RAIMI should reunite again for this movie, and now Sam Raimi being a Hollywood big shot because of a Spiderman1+2 succes, he should be able to come with a budget that could deliver The BIGGEST Evil Dead EXTRAVAGANZA ever, I would very much like to see a rating on that movie, probably a new classification would be needed. So long ASH fans, enjoy this BOOK OF THE DEAD 2 as it is written on the cover, it is definitely worth buying. One word subscribes it best:GROOVY.
