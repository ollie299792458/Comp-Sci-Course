It is awesome masterpiece. There are no words to be adequate of quality of this magnificent performance. I'm 35 old, and thanks to this one I've realizes some things about me. The actors, yes, the actors, because I cannot say that they're singers only are on their top form. The music quality and recording quality make you freezing and detaching out of everything. What can I say? I run on my lunch time to home (I work next to home), for only reason to watch again "Bella filia del amore" and Rigolleto's song!!!!
I even can't say that somebody here is better! All are better! I thing it is really pearl in opera's history.
If someone will capture like this in the future? First thing I will disagree with some cameraman who cut out Wixel's hands during his highly emotional song. As well in the same area, later they cut out heads of duke's court people. In the "bella filia" Pavarotti face is out of focus for Gilda's emotions, but Pavarotti's face at the moment is reach by emotions as well: both of them should appear sharp in my opinion.
Finally it is one of the glorious and exciting operas on DVD. Here is nothing mediocre about it: just story of perfection and talent.
