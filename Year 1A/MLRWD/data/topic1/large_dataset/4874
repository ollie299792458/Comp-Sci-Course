Okay folks, don't get your fruit-of-the-loom in a bunch about the plot, storyline or try to review this movie from a Shakespearean angle.  It's a Jet Li movie for crying out loud.  I thought the universe jumping renegade idea was unique and the people who brought you this movie put a lot of effort in it.  The DVD extras shows this and you can't help but be impress.  Now back to the movie, I found it really entertaining from an action junkie's point of view.  It's a  thrill watching Jet handcuff half a dozen Los Angeles Sheriff's officers like he was knitting a sweater. The finally fight is awesome with the good versus evil Jet Li's. He moves so effortlessly that it makes sense that he's not very tall and not very muscular. He easily runs circles around much taller and more muscular opponents. He looks great in this movie. The space age, high tech background to his martials arts was kinda different and it keeps Jet fresh and interesting to his devoted fans, but I can also imagine him winning a few Trekkie fans with this movie. Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo as Multiuniverse policemen was also a nice touch.  Statham did a pretty decent job with the American accent and Jet spoke more words in English than his previous American movies. He sounded better than I expected. Carla Gugino, the mom from Spy Kids, appears breifly as Jet's loving wife.  Their relationship adds a human side to this story, but I thought it could have been more physical and she could have played a bigger role.  I often wonder why Jet never kissed any of his leading ladies, even though he is able to convey a certain romatic  side on screen as evident in "Romeo Must Die".  Whenever the script calls for a love interest, the relationship is presented in a subtle way, but Jet's face is so expressive that maybe that's all that is needed.  With this movie, I've difinetly became a solid Jet Li fan.
