An evil gremlin wanders onto the Deagle estate and reads the sign in front of the house saying, "Deeeaggle, Deagle, Deagle, Deagle".  The gremlin enters the house and spots a Pepsi can on the kitchen table saying, "Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi".  The gremlin then makes a move to grab the beverage.  All of a sudden, Mrs. Deagle comes haphazardly into the kitchen and grabs the can without noticing the gremlins presence.  As Mrs. Deagle pops the can open and drinks she heads back to her electric chairlift to elevate to the top floor the Gremlin looks at her with a vengeful scowl on the face thinking, 'it's payback time old hag'.  The gremlin dashes to fuss with the chairlifts wiring system.  As Mrs. Deagle sits on the chair she pushes the button and the circuitry goes haywire launching her at top speed through the window and she hits the ground with both feet in the air.  The camera then shows a pack of gremlins with Pepsi cans in their hands singing fa cha cha cha cha cha with big smiles on their faces.  Pepsi...let's talk about this.
