I wanted to create a quick review of this workout even though I have had this dvd for years.  Recently, I got injured pretty badly and have been unable to workout for weeks.  During that time, I realized that my workouts were probably too intense and that I needed to slow things down a bit.  Enter my old Denise Austin videos!  I had forgotten how much fun Denise's workouts are and they are very safe and effective for losing weight and getting fit.  I have to admit, after tackling some really intense workouts (TurboFire, Calorie Explosion), this workout seemed like a breath of fresh air, if not a bit silly for one at my advanced level.  But you know what?  It works.  I felt refreshed and energized after doing this and the entire workout is equivalent to a 3 mile walk.  That burns a significant amount of calories.  I am definitely going to switch up my workouts and incorporate some easier, more fun routines.  I'm so glad that I have rediscovered Denise Austin -- I know people complain about her perky attitude, But I love it.  She has a new workout coming out and I am def. going to buy it.
