Kiki's Delivery Service, by my favorite anime creator Hayao Miyazaki, is excellent and perfect for carrying a hidden message underneath the light weight action and drama. Kiki is a thirteen year old witch-in-training. As is customs, she is sent to live by herself in a city. Kiki chooses a delightful European city bustling with buzz. She makes an impression on the townfolk by blowing in with a broomstick, along with her wisecracking cat, Gigi. She searches for a job, and finds one as a delivery girl for a local bakery. Kiki encounters what all teenagers go through: insecurity, loneliness, boredom, and eventually loses her greatest talent--flying. From that experience, she learns from a former struggling artist that you need to do what you love from the heart.
Voice acting is brilliant. Kirsten Dunst sounds believable as Kiki, and Phil Hartman is hilarious as Gigi. Unlike other animes, the voices aren't too squeaky or sound really stupid.
Also, there is a great message, as I mentioned earlier, underneath this movie. There are wonderful role models and rememberable characters that will stay in your heart, whether you like it, or not.
