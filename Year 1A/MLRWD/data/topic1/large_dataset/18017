Yoga so easy even men can do it! I kid, I kid. But like a lot of men, my flexibility is less than great.

And by easy I mean you're not bending yourself into a pretzel or straining. I exercise fairly hard and I'm used to pushing myself, so I was skeptical when I started what seemed like an overly easy 21 minute session.

By the time it was over, however, my spine was much more aligned and my muscles relaxed.

The relaxing nature of the session makes it great to ease into your morning, or get relaxed in the evening. I never dread doing it, I look forward to it.

I didn't know what to expect from Gary Kraftsow, but he really takes a practical approach. I'm sure you can find out more by looking him up.

This stuff works. I've had several back injuries and this is improving my posture, strength and flexibility, while decreasing my pain and making me generally less stressed.

There's a 21 minute Upper Back and Neck Therapy session, a 32 minute Neck and Shoulder Therapy session, and 41 minute Strength and Stability session. I like them all, but the 21 minute session alone is sufficient to keep me feeling good.
