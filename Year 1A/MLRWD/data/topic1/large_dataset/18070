This was one of the first anime movies which hit America. It can be called an 80's slasher pic. But it is so much more than that. After Akira took American anime audiences by storm, they wanted more. That's where Vampire Hunter D entered the picture, with the right amount of sexiness, violence and humour, this movie held it's own, and was really popular.
 Watching it for the first time, 14 years after it's release, I was not dissapointed. My favourite character is the hero's talking hand. I want one of them for christmas..

 Anyone who enjoys gorey slasher type flicks, and is a fan of Anime will enjoy this one. I recommend Blood to you, if you just like gorey stuff with an electirc atmosphere, but if you would like a good story line, this movie is for you.
 A girl's life is in jeopardy, after being bitten by a vampire. A vampire who's taken a liking to her. The only solution involves the death of the vampire. Enter Mr.D, the vampire hunter. Dissapointingly enough, he doesn't talk a lot at the beginning of the movie, which is a shame, because he has a rather cool voice. However it does add to the mystery surrounding him. 
 The plot isn't really amazing, and it's all been done, but the sheer coolness of D and this movie earnes it a 4/5. Watch it, it's a part of anime history.
