I've been doing my own reading and retrospective on vampires over the last couple of weeks after seeing "I am Legend" with Will Smith. So I decided to go back to the iconic source. Having not read Dracula in years, I decided to read it again and began by comparing it to the contemporary (1992) movie version...Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" starring Gary Oldman. When I initially read the story as a child, I focused more on my stereotyped "Dracula as performed by Bella Lugosi" and not Stoker's original version. Reading Stoker in the original again I was charmed by the writing style and mores of the times. It holds up well. I then watched Coppola's movie which was tarted up and sexualized for today's audience. While Oldman's over the top performance is great fun to watch, the book is so much better. And if I were Stoker, I would be turning in my grave since the movie version barely follows the book and yet is "Bram Stoker's Dracula".

I then dragged Blade out of my movie collection.  It is great campy fun.  The first club scene is absolutely classic and really sets the mood for the rest of the movie.  This is my favorite Wesley Snipes movie and he really delivers.  And I love Kris Kristofferson's dissipated, whiskey voiced as Blade's compadre.  The action drags a little bit in the middle, but the end is satisfying, and the bad guy really radiates "evil bad".  So you are cheering Blade to the end.  Yes, I know this is a B movie, and it has nothing to do with the iconic original dracula.  But if you love vampire movies, I recommend this highly.  It holds up well even though it it a decade old.
