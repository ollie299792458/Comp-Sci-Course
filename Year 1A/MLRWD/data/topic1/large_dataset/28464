Let's face it, Independence Day was a whole load of hype.  The movie itself wasn't too bad, it just wasn't that very good either.  All the hype gave this movie a lot of popularity and made the movie a lot of money.  Thank God Fox decided to release the movie in such a nice DVD package, I mean we should expect these kind of DVD's from Fox, they gave us hit DVD's such as Fight Club and The Abyss.  They came through again, realeasing a great DVD package that will boost this movie up sci-fi charts.  Another two-disc set from Fox, the first disc contains the feature.  Great picture and an excellent new Dolby 5.1 mix are just the beginning.  From the menu, you can choose to play the theatrical version, or the new Special Edition which has 9 minutes of additional footage(nothing too special though).  The movie also has two audio commentary tracks.  One from director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, and another from Oscar-winning special effects supervisors Volker Engel and Doug Smith.  That's only the beginning.  The second disc is loaded with features.  3 documentaries!!!  One is a 30-minute documentary on making ID4, the second is a 22-minute mockumentary that is quite entertaining, and the third is the 30-minute HBO First Look documentary.  The disc also has the original ending to the movie(thank God they didn't stay with it), Storyboards, artwork, and production stills.  Disc also has a DVD-ROM game and a DVD-ROM weblink.  Some trailers and tv-spots also appear.  Even if you did not like ID4, but want to give it another try, go with this excellent DVD package, it might change your mind.  Thanks again Fox!
