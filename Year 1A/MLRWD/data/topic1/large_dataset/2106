First, the DVD itself.  The print is a good one, but unfortunately, it's a cropped print, the cut for television kind, so we lose about 15 percent of the shot on either side.  Having said that, there is no letterbox version available yet, so this is as good as it gets.  And it really is a great DVD for two obvious reasons.  First, the film remains strong thirty odd years later.  Secondly, it's worth buying just to hear the director's commentary.  Who, for instance, knew that Herzog wrote the script in two and half days on a soccer tour, and would have been finished a little quicker had his drunken goalkeeper not vomited over his manuscript?  If that's where good movies come from, bring on the beer.  The film has many strengths.  Shot entirely with one camera, it gives off a sense of realism and intimacy that epics can only strive for.  Herzog has taken many liberties with the story of Lope de Aguirre, but it's simply not important.  What you do get is an inspired vision of meglomania and delusion, transmitted in small visual details that show how powerful film can be in the right hands.  A boat stuck fifty feet up in a tree, a group of chattering monkeys boarding the doomed raft, an outhouse poised above the running waters.  It helps that Kinski is at the top of his game, ie, looking several cards short of a full deck.  You can watch another thousand films and never see an actor better cast.
