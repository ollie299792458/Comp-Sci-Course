On watching the first half of this film you'd be forgiven for thinking it's one of those grisly 'rape n' murder' horrors we get all the time nowadays - except for the occasional dream sequence thrown in (sometimes done well but there is some pointless cgi here)
I was shocked by some of the films content as I'm more used to his earlier work (daft slashers with great art direction) and hadn't seen anything by Argento post-'terror at the opera'. However, It was worth sitting through

What struck me the most was how moving I found the second half of this film. You really care for the characters - even the seemingly insignificant support characters - and at the films climax (although totally predictable) I actually weeped like a little girl

That could just be me though

But seriously, Argento has actually gone up in my estimation - There are some truly original moments and themes explored that you wont get in any other genre horror movie - this is a surreal psycological thriller more than anything. Perhaps not as enjoyable as Suspira, Tenebrae or Profondo Rosso - but definitly worth a look if you want to see a different side to Argento's work
