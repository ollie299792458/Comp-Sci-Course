I bought this DVD because I couldn't finish watching the movie on TV, and I was very curious. I had really liked the about 30 min. I actually watched, so I decided to give it a shot (and the good reviews helped a great deal!). I was not disappointed, this movie is very entertaining. Even though I read a review that says that it gives the wrong message (about lying to your parents, which of course isn't good), I think it approaches that touchy subject in a very natural way... who hasn't lied to their parents sometime? It doesn't, in my opinion, try to deliver the message that it's ok, it just portraits an adolescent's point of view, how they sometimes have to struggle (if they live in a foreign country and come from a very rigorous culture, like in this case). And the message that it actually delivers, again in my opinion, is that you should always do what you love if you want to be happy. That doesn't mean you have to lie, but fight for your dreams.

All in all this is a highly entertaining movie, great for all ages. It's very colorful too, and we get a glimpse of Indian culture and traditions. Obviously we westerners think some of them are far off, but for them, it's what they are! It also makes us aware of the importance of tolerance and open mindedness. I'm sure you'll enjoy it... I did! I highly recommend it!
