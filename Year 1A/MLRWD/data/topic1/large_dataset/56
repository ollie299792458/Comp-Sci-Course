I often think of who are the greatest sitcom stars of all time: Lucy Ricardo, Ralph Kramden, the Fonz, George Constanza, etc.  Without question, Alex P. Keaton is at the top of that list.  No other sitcom star came out of nowhere and just blew America away with impeccable comic wit and irresistable charm.  Even when he was being sarcastic and obnoxious, you just loved him.  Remember the Christmas episode which parodied A Christmas Carol?  Alex is shown as a ruthless older man who doesn't care that his family is poor and without food and clothing.  But what upsets Alex most about that dream - the fact that he's bald!!  Or how about this exchange between Alex and his mom, played by Meredith Baxter Birney:

Elyse Keaton (to Steven Keaton): Alex was offended by our political magazines and ripped them up.

Alex P. Keaton: You have no proof.

Elyse Keaton: Yes we do. We found your rattle on the floor next to the evidence.

Alex P. Keaton: It could have Mallory's.

Elyse Keaton: It was your Nixon rattle.
