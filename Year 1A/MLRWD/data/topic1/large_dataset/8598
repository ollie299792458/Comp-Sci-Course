This movie has some of the funniest moments and lines ever put on film. This is the movie that defines John Cusak as an actor. When you watch it you will see a young actor who with his dead pan delivery and sarcastic  demeanor was undoubtedly to be a star. John Cusak became this star from his  portrayal of Lane Meyer, a love sick ,  obsessed, confused (as if none of  us were) ,cynical, and very unusual teenager in the mid to late  eighties.
His girlfriend leaves him and his thoughts go to how to  terminate his life. But his neighbor and a foriegn exchange student ( as  well as some very funny attempts) change his attitude towards death.
This  movie has now become a staple of the comedy channel and can often be seen  on TBS but it really needs to be seen in its original format.
I dont want  to say any more less I ruin the great laughs that you are sure to encounter  from this film. I will leave you with this one thought "Gee Im real  sorry your mom blew up Ricky. The doctor says she'll be alright, she just  cant eat any spicy foods for a while."
Enjoy.
