In the annals of American action films this one definately deserves a spot at the top up alongside the Die Hard films though maybe a small step below something like the Terminator.  Some will say this is just a Segal propaganda piece showcasing him in all his glory instead of an action film but if you've seen the rest of his films you'll know that the self-gratification and machoism found here is tame by Segal standards.  There isn't all the usual inuendos about what an incredibly 'large' man Steven is, or the thinly veiled sexual assaults on weaker men you'll find in On Deadly Ground or Fire Down Below.  This is just a straight-up cop-on-a-rampage-constitutional-rights-thrown-out-the-window type of movie.  Rights are for pansies anyways.

This was back when Segal actually fought in his films instead of just shooting a bunch of people.  Oh, there's plenty of that but there's some great aikido, great hand-to-hand combat mixed in there as well.  Of course he's squinting up a storm and running like a duck with it's head chopped off in the midst of all this carnage, but hey, it's Segal!  He doesn't live by our rules.

The plot?  Who cares!  I'm too busy watching Segal force a United States Senator to undress, destroy an entire grocery shop, and empty a clip into the face of an unarmed criminal at point blank range.  I think there was some stuff in there about him wanting to bring down a CIA led drug cartel.  All around I would say that this was Segal's most compelling movie.

Most important lesson to take from this film: It's common protocol in the CIA to use local bar owners to take out other agents.
