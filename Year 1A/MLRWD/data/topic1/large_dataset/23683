It's hard to explain why this series is so good without spoiling things that I was happily shocked by while watching.
This is one of the most engrossing shows I've ever seen, and still ranks in my top 5.

Urasawa has created a thriller like no other, but you can find yourself comparing it to a lot of things because he's combined the best parts of other stories without actually copying them.  There's an innocent man on the run, and on the hunt.  There's an obsessed cop, but he's not just Javert or Gerard.  There's a killer who is unexplainable.  Seriously.  If you try to get into it the conversation doesn't end because the twists and traps never end.

On top of this, there are secondary characters who continually cross the line with being the major role, and new characters come into play from the most unlikely sources.  They don't get stale or lost, which can be easy in a longer series.

It's a psychological thriller, and the psychology is intense.

If you found this because of the tags for Anita Blake -  If you ever wanted to see Edward brought to life, just give it a shot.
