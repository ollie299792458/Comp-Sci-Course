First off, I believe that filmmakers can never be charged with plagiarism because movies are highly influenced by everything in our lives including the movies we see. So when I hear someone say that DePalma has stolen this shot off Hitchcock or that scene from a Hitchcock story, I always say that it isnt stealing....more like paying homage to a great master. As with the work of Tarantino...cinefiles can study and investigate every second of the film almost to where it becomes second nature to try and figure out what has influenced this scene and what film has influenced that scene. Personally "The Fury" is one of my favourite films by director Brian Depalma. His classic Hitchcockian touches are in every scene of the movie,  and usual fine cast of great characters. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning...many sequences in the film are so beautifully choreographed it is almost balletic at times. And it can be very violent and bloody at times...definatly one of the most disturbing endings to a film that I have seen. But, definalty worth checking out!
