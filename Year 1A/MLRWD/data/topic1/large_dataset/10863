Even more than Rick from _Casablanca_, Bogart, at the end of his career, recalled Joe Gunn as his favorite role. Everything comes together in this movie: a great cast, a well-written script (okay, kinda cribbed from the Russians, but if you've got to crib from someone's literature, Russia's a great place to start!), and wonderful performances.  Rex Ingram, famous for being very selective in his roles--he refused to do any demeaning or racist roles--gives us a dignified and heroic Tambul; Carroll Naish does such an over-the-top Italian that even Italians like myself can't help but love him.

The bad guys are mustache-twistingly evil--stabbing each other in the back, glaring with supercilious contempt at everything--the good guys are your international melting pot of Just Plain Folks.  It's not a 'historical' war picture; it's really more of a morality play, where God just happens to be on the side of the Allies. Sure, it's simplistic, and to audiences familiar with modern war films (in which the military is seen variously as corrupt or incompetent or both), this might seem a bit...jingoistic.  It was released, after all, during the war, and under the auspices of the War Department's agreement with Hollywood to produce motivating films. Propaganda? You bet.  Entertaining? Absolutely!  It's cheezy like a good bowl of nachos.  Yum!

Military buffs may be upset that some of the equipment isn't authentic. Yeah, well, Korda had his crew paint sand dunes.  He was trying, but there was a war on, so the German plane is really a repainted American one, and the parachute footage is cobbled together from some grainy stock footage.  What can you do?

If you see only one mid-war WWII film, this should be the one! (If you want to see two, see _Bataan_ as well, which is a historicaly pic with a very different ending).
