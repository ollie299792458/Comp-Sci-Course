I own the Hullabaloo yes I do, but beware which Hullabaloo you buy, for there is more than one, there are four -or five.

Well maybe not four or five but certainly more than one.  It seems all have two discs but some have a live disc with only one disc being b-sides.  I have downloaded all variations of Hullabaloo and the ones with two discs of all b-sides is the more fantastic buy for sure; not that their live stuff isn't any good but quite the contrary.  I have been to over 100 concerts in my life seeing hundreds of bands and artists and I concluded a long time ago that Muse was the most pheonomenal, although not my favorite band.  If you want to hear their live stuff I recommend getting Haarp with the dvd and you'll SEE what I mean... or just go see them live (hint hint).

The best b-sides on here in my opinion are definitely Recess, Hyperchondriac Music, Gallery, Shrinking Universe and In Your World.  It's ashame this wasn't released after Absolution with the amazing b-sides it produced like Fury and the cover of House of the Rising Sun.  But this is an awesome b-sides collection nevertheless, however I'm unsure where some of these other songs I have came from as they weren't on this album or any other official release.  If you already have the Hullabaloo you should check out the b-sides from their albums Absolution and Blackholes and Revelations.
