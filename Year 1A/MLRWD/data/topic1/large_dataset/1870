Okay, granted.  The terrorists are genetically altered mako sharks.  The holiday revelers are a team of scientists; the flown-in "hero" is their corporate sponsor.  And instead of shooting you, the "bad  guys" want to have you for brunch.  But the premise feels very  familiar -- and there are some really cool explosions....  So if you're  looking for a thrilling way to spend 105 minutes, I recommend this film  highly.
On the other hand, if you're the type who appreciates  well-crafted dialogue, excellent acting, and "fresh" storyline,  don't get your hopes up.  If you've seen a few  action-thriller/sci-fi/horror flicks, you'll be more than able to annoy  your sofamates with a score of predictions and forebodings -- most of which  will indeed prove true.  And the special effects, for all of the director's  boasting in the DVD's "Making Of" section, are not without their  flaws.
Samuel L. Jackson seems to have been poorly matched with his  scripted character; at times I wonder whom screenwriters Kennedy, Powers,  and Powers had in mind for the character, and whether a line couldn't have  been "tweaked" to allow Jackson's finesse to be better displayed.  L.L. Cool J, perhaps handed the light end of the film's burden, shines as  the witty, quasi-spiritual, entirely believable "brother" who  provides both comedy and sub-plot diversion.  (Do check out the deleted  scenes in the DVD version; they provide for many of the characters a depth  that I miss in the "finished" product.)
Bottom line: Fun?  Definitely.  A Breakthrough Triumph in Modern Filmmaking?  Not quite.
