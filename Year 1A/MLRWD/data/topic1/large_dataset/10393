This is really a great movie and now that the DVD is selling so cheaply (I bought mine for 6.99) how can you possibly pass it up. The special effects aren't all that but the costumes and scenery are amazing, and the storyline  though not always the best explained in this movie (though well know to  watchers of the TV show and people interested in the mythos) is still very  intriguing and one of the most original sci-fi/fantasy stories in recent  history. Sean Connery's performance is really enough to justify purchasing  this movie despite the fact that he isn't in it for more than half an hour.  Christopher Lambert isn't bad though and the swordfighting is truly  incredible. I must admit maybe it's my old age but I'm starting to find the  Queen soundtrack a little cheesy and very 80's in its style, but if you can  overlook that I would definitely recommend this movie. However be  forewarned the DVD version isn't much better than the VHS version it  appears the transfer just wasn't done that well. The sound often has to be  turned up to hear background vocals. If you don't have this movie it is  still worth buying the DVD over the VHS if for no other reason for all the  extras you get, but if you already have it on VHS it's your call whether  it's worth buying again I probably wouldn't (though it has been extremely  cheap).
