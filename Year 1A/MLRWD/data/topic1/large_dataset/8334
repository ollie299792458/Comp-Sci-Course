As a graduate of 1977, this movie has a lot of memories for me, being the same age as the Dazed and Confused gang here.
After watching the movie and relating to everything, except the girls' hazing, I realized that I had to buy the movie, which I did, the criterion collection.
Seeing the antics, getting a buzz behind the school, the party in the woods, and especially the clothes, brought me back to a great and fun time in my life, that I THOUGHT I wouldn't miss, but I do.
 The music is pretty awesome ( except for Peter Frampton ), it really clicks with the movie.

 I watch this movie about every couple of months or so, and still crack up at Slater. So many people I knew that was just like him.
The criterion collection has that extra dvd that has the typical behind the scenes type of clips, such as deleted scenes, the actors tryouts for the part, interviews, Richard Linkletter's comments and interview, the reunion ( which there isn't much to speak of ) and so on.
It also comes with a book that was put together pretty well as  far as bringing the characters to life if you will.
The criterion collection wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be, but I'm glad I got it just the same. To me it's worth having as an extra to watch once in a blue moon.
This movie has become a cult classic for almost everyone, especially for the "kids" that have reached their late forties to early fifties.
