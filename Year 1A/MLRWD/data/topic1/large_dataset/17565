Come on!!! Instead of treating of an interesting subject in an intelligent manner, the writer tries to demonize a relatively normal reaction, i.e. having difficulty accepting your child has a genetic defect (which is legitimate if we're being realistic). Okay, so the guy has BIG problems accepting it, and the baby suffers from it. I agree totally, and yes, he should definitely see a psychologist. But hey, if you're the wife (who's unrealistically too "perfect" really), how about not screwing around with the shamelessly opportunist midget twin brother of the man you just recently married and loved? I was just ANGRY in the end!!! Is there even one person who liked that ending!? Are we supposed to be like "oh what a nice couple!" or "the ex-husband just gets what he deserves", or even "Okay everybody, at the signal, let's screw our brother's girl, he probably deserves it!!! By the way, let's put something clear here: kissing your husband's brother (out of pitty or for whatever reason) is just NOT okay! I dunno, filmmakers seem to like that, thinking it's cute or noble. Human nature says it's NOT!
