I started using this DVD  right after Christmas. I took my measurements and stepped on the scale on January 1st wanting to commit to making this year the year I adopt a consistent workout schedule. Since experts say a new habit can be formed in 21-28 days I opted to follow Coach Nicole's 28 Day Bootcamp plan.

A few minutes into my first 'warmup'..I realized just how out of shape I was! Even though she said this was 'not the exercise portion but ONLY a warmup, it felt like a full exercise session to me! Still, I pressed on and completed Day one and made up my mind to complete the entire 28 Days Bootcamp.

In addition to Coach Nicole who I assume is doing an 'intermediate' level workout, there are two other ladies you can choose to follow. One is doing modified steps and exercises and the other ADVANCED!....Well, I had to modify things even further to keep up at times but this is what I like about this program. You can easily simply march in place if you are unable to follow steps or do a certain exercise then jump back in when you can.

There are any number of ways to personalize this program and it has the added bonus of online support at Sparkpeople.com!

I plan to keep using this DVD at least until I am able to complete a full 28 day cycle keeping up with Coach Nicole. I highly recommend this to anyone at any fitness level!

P.S. Since Jan 1, I have lost 4 lbs and 5 inches overall!!!

* FYI - I received this DVD for free from SparkPeople and did not receive any form of payment for my review.
