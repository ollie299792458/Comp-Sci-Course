There were great expectations with this movie, ten years after the latest Coppola movie.The result, however, seems very disappointing. There's no doubt that the photography is gorgeous; but that's all about its merits. Actually, there's about 8 to 10 movies in here and none makes complete sense. The first plot about a 70 year-old linguist who is literally hit by a thunderbolt and regains youth takes you to another one and then another and then another, with thin (or none)substantial relation between them, being its pretentiousness the only linking root. Crowded with bizarre characters, the confusing story depicts - besides the hero - a wise scientist, a bunch of nazis trying to kidnap the linguist, a girl with memories of lost love, spies, more nazis and many more. The intriguing anecdotes take you from Rumania to India, Malta and Switzerland, but actually the movie goes nowhere. I's hard to make much sense out of such a muddle. And it's also hard to believe that this pretentious, over-plotted, awfully boring and sometimes ludicrous hotch potch belongs to the same creator who gave such masterpieces like THE GODFATHER TRILOGY or APOCALYPSE NOW.
