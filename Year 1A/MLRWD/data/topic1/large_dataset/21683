Rory's music was his Religion.  Every Rory fan will have their favourite song,cd,live performance etc., Rory played straight-up blues, loud Rock n' Roll, amazing acoustic blues, underrated slide(electric or acoustic), beautiful ballads,just listen to " I'll Admit You're Gone ", mandolin, mouth harp, sax and more.  Read the reviews and you will have an encyclopedia's worth of info about him.  Buy this collection of Live performances and the Rockpalast set and you be the judge.  If you want to know what made him tick buy the book, " Riding Shotgun " by his long time bass player Gerry Mcavoy.  You will laugh and you will cry, guaranteed.
I personally love his blusier stuff, Garbage Man, Off the Handle, Could've had Religion and many more.  All of his songs have something special about them.  Check out " Moonchild " or " A Million Miles Away ".
Enough said, you will watch these performances and be smiling on the outside and crying on the inside knowing that Rory passed away too soon.  He left a massive collection of musical performances for generations to come.  Not to leave out his band mates over the years, they were all amazing.
