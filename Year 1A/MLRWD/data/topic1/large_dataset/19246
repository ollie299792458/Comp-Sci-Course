In the strong, and at times graphic, movie Burn, the Englishman Sir William Walker tries to encourage the African descendants that live in the small island, Burn, to begin a resistance against the Portuguese colonizers.  Sir William Walker befriends an African descendant, named Jose Dolores, who becomes the black leader of this revolution.  When the revolution ends, the "hero" Walker leaves Burn, but after the island's citizens experience freedom for awhile, he returns...but this time he doesn't want to help the blacks nor does he want to visit his "friend," Jose Dolores.  Now, Walker pays his attention to controlling the sugar and the island in general.  Many of the black citizens even helped him to do this by becoming soldiers, but Dolores keeps fighting for the true revolution.

  At the beginning of this movie, there are pictures of a revolution, and the colors red and orange flash on the screen, reminding me of blood and fire.  Also, there is a song, called Abolition, which plays once in awhile throughout the whole movie.  It's really interesting to see when this song comes in.  When seeing this movie, it's important to pay attention to everything because there are many very clever, but hidden, things that help to give us the strong message.  And this message becomes even stronger when one realizes the historical context of this movie...it was made during the fight for civil rights and the Vietnam war.

  Even though the movie is a bit old, it's important to see it because it shows us that, at times, we have to defend the rights of humanity.  Above everything, Burn is a movie of betrayal and revolution that will leave you feeling enlightened, and possibly even empowered.
