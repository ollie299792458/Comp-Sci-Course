Hehe. I just saw this movie for the first time a week or two ago. And man was I surprised, never have I seen a movie like it. So the story goes: Alicia Silverstone stars in this romantic, comedy, as young Cher Horowitz. Shes got everything, good looks, good grades, and good friends. So now she starts thinking of helping other people improve their life. After playing matchmaker with one of her close friends, Tai Fraiser (Brittany Murphy), a new man enters her life, Christian Stovitz (Justin Walker). In the next few days everything seems to go wrong with her decisons, and she finally comes up with the conclusion that when it comes to love she is well.... clueless. Directed by my favorite directer, Amy Heckerling. Defently a movie worth renting, if not buying.
Roles were also played by Stacey Dash, Paul Rudd, and finally Breckin Meyer.
