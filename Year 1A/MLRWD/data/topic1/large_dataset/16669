While Christian McKay's pantomime of Welles is excellent, and in many places the portrayal is accurate, nonetheless this movie merely propagates the Old Welles Myth; that he was a downright egotist, with no consideration for his actors, no empathy -- viz., that Orson Welles = Charles Foster Kane.  In fact, I think McKay's portrayal was really of Kane more than Welles.

What is even worse is the portrayal of Joseph Cotten.  I seriously doubt he was nearly as much of a womanizer as they made him out to be, especially considering his two long marriages.  Similarly I don't think Cotten would ever have made such remarks about Welles as this character made, e.g., that he was a bastard and a "coward."  The real Jo Cotten in fact said that he couldn't understand why people always said Orson was so "hard to get along with," and that Welles was the "easiest, most inspiring" person he ever worked with.

If you want an idea of what Welles was "really like," read THIS IS ORSON WELLES, watch interviews and/or "The Orson Welles Sketchbook" on youtube, and watch F FOR FAKE.

I think this movie is, overall, a very frustrating offense against a great man and one of the most brilliant artists of the twentieth century.
