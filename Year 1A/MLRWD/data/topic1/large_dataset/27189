Is M. Night Shyamalan the only writer/director out there who is putting out original stories?

I just got home from seeing Lady In The Water--and WOW is just about all I could say as I walked out of the theater.  I went into it expecting to be scared out of my wits like I was when I first saw Signs (heck, I still get scared when I watch Signs and I know what's coming!).  However, aside from a couple of purposeful "make you jump" moments, this is a much gentler story with a ton of humor.

One of the things that I adore about Shyamalan's films is the way he works faith into the story.  Not quite so overtly in this one as with Signs, but faith is still discussed.

Lady In The Water is simply a fairy tale.  If you've seen or heard any of the interviews Shyamalan has been doing, you'll know that this movie grew out of a bedtime story he made up for his children.  One of the things he did differently with this movie than the previous four is that he didn't give it a "surprise" ending.  The theater I was in wasn't too full, and just like me, I could hear others around me working out who all of the special characters were when the fairy tale began to take shape, and that's one of the most fun things about this film--trying to figure it out right along with Cleveland Heep.

Although his last film, The Village, was disappointing as he changed stream about halfway through and never went back to fix problems with the beginning of it, Lady In The Water delivers a heart-touching, funny, poignant story of one man finding his purpose in life through a series of extrordinary events.
