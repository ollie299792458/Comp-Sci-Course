Heard about that film for a long time.  Was never into "Capra's" bundles or collections.  This version is excellent, considering that many parts of this movie were lost or badly damaged. Producing a acceptable complete digital remake of this was a more than 10 years undertaking.  Most of the images are quite perfect, some, relying on the best material they found, are less enticing but still let you stay in the story and appreciate the intent of "Lost Horizon".

Very amazing ideas, considering the 30's mindset, or what we thought it was !!

Strange to see a very very young and sexy Jane Wyatt.  Very good actors, very good scenario, very well realized.  Yes, it is Capra, but it is not the guy from "a wonderful life".  It is more a questioning one, still advocating simplicity and the value of human life and experience.  Interestingly, there is a brother story, again.  The photography is very good, the athmosphere very efficient and penetrating.  You get the point !  You see people, societies, history, the effect of technology, and the eternal wondering about justice, meaning, life and pleasure.

Great Capra !  One of his best !
