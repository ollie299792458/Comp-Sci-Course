On its own, this is an ok film. Funny, unpredictable, a bit odd, with a rather forced ending. However, after watching the older movie adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel, I appreciate this adaptation more. Not that the other is worse; they both have weaknesses, in different areas. First off, I thought the casting and acting in this version were overall much better, especially the lead - Sophie Thompson did a really great job. Maybe it's me, but Helena Bonham-Carter's acting in the other version felt wooden and was generally unconvincing. The exception is George - I thought George was cast much better in the 1980s adaptation. He has much more character, and seems more like an actual person than a caricature (which is how George Emerson-this-version came across - he's just a little too random).
The other downside of this version: the way the story was told didn't do much for me. The chemistry between George and Lucy is pretty much non-existant, and the tacked-on ending feels clumsy and strained. Where did the scriptwriters get that ending, anyway??
Put briefly, my ideal adaptation would have the cast from this version (except for George) and the storyline/most of the script from the other.
