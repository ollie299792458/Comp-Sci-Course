Philadelphia deals with a big, big tacky theme. It's about homosexuality, homophobia, AIDS, justice and death. Before that scares you off, though, it's handled in such a manner that even those with the most delicate senses won't be offended. 
Philadelphia chooses to forgive instead of judge (Which is ironical, since it's basically a court-room drama.) It chooses to include instead of exclude, and the theme of tolerance works without being sappy. I'm not a homophobe but I'm not a liberal, either. Still, with the exceptional screen writing and extraordinary acting by Hanks and Washington, I could see from homosexuals' viewpoints without judging or disliking them in the least. I have to say this movie changed my perception quite a bit. 
Oh, and that scene with Tom Hanks and the opera... I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I was so completely caught up in this character, I felt a pain in my heart like a twisting knife. If you've ever lost someone you love prematurely, you'll know what I mean. 
Every aspect of the movie worked just fine. Especially the delicate juggling between the accepted homophobic viewpoint of the times, and the struggle gays and lesbians have to make to simply live and love. 
Emotional catharsis, impact, entertainment, whatever you're aiming for, I can promise you that Philadelphia won't fail.
