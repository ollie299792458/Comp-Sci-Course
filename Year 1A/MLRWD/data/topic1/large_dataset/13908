When three teens, on a whim, decide to break and enter the home of a rich accountant (Kevin Pollak) and his two kids, they get more than they bargained for.  For this accountant has some very desperate clients, who don't mind sacrificing the hostages in order to get something they want that's inside the house.

Stuck in the middle is Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), a suburban police chief (and, coincidently enough, a former police negotiator), whose own family has been taken hostage by the accountant's mysterious client.  With the help of the accountant's son (a credible, if a bit over-the-top, performance by young Jimmy Bennett), Talley must work to satisfy TWO parties of murderers...before time runs out.  Because (of course) there is a clock ticking away...

Fortunately, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Willis gives one of his best performances in years (I'd almost given up on him), Pollak is enjoyable to watch as always, and the other performances are at least tolerable.  But of course, the thing that draws attention to a film like this is the tension...and there's a lot of it.  "Hostage" is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a while.  It races along, and takes you with it.  There are a few minor flaws: the style of the opening credits, for example, has nothing to do with the rest of the film (watch it and you'll understand), and some of the camera work seems iffy.  Yet (note the five stars) this is a darn good action/suspense flick, and you'll probably want to watch it the next time you need a two-hour adrenaline rush.
