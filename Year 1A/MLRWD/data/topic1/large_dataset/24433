In Siamese collectivistic culture, especially at that time of period (1862), I suppose one of the biggest damaging cultural stereotypes is about Thais having conservative views. The movie artistically uses its scenes to show us this cultural stereotype. The scene in which King's children are being taught geography is a good example for this damaging stereotype of Thai culture at that time. Ethnocentrism, parochialism, and the lack of scientific knowledge of Siamese people are all shown with the map and the lecture of the Siamese lady (an unscientific map and the comparison between the King of Siam and the King of Burma): "Siam is the biggest and richest country in the world". However, it doesn't mean that Siamese people can't be scientific or they can't learn sciences. The hierarchy in Asian country doesn't give the people freedom, but on the other hand, it makes the country, politics, and culture follow the traditional value. In fact, the true historical King Rama IV who was really a man of Renaissance, he knew several Western languages and studied political science, hard sciences, western cultures, and colonialism. He wanted to bring Siam into the Modern world. In this situation, there appeared an advantage in Siamese culture. It is that the hierarchy in Siam played a very important role to keep the country's society and its political situation stable for Thailand to modernize. In general, I think beside the love story and the music, cultural issues are also interesting aspects of the movie.
