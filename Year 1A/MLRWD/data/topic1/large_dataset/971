The New Guilded Age is an outgrowth of global counter-revolution againt social citzenship. The result of a massive, naked application of state power to raise the rate of profit for crony groups, billionaire gansters, and the rich in general. The central role of state power was massive privitization of public assets. It is redistributive NOT generative.
 Against the backdrop of a highly civilized Japanese society this invisible wave catches the film's finely drawn, acted & directed characters and washes a cognitive dissonance foam over their lives. In the end they must pick themselves up and settle for less, so that a tiny few may continue to play Kings & Queens.
This production, what the the film protrays, is brought to you by the puppets of a highly organized privitized banking global monopoly.
 This is the expansive backdrop frame from which to view this beautiful gem, as it plays itself out.

 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!
