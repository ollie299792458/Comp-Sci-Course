"The 'Bishops' Wife" is a wonderful film... (it's the original film for the remake done with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston a few years back called "The 'Preachers' Wife" - which was was ok but seemed like a rushed Hollywood remake and failed to capture that innocent quaint magic of this original}.  Cary Grant infused a smooth suaveness into his role as the Angel that Denzel just didn't quite seem to bring to his.

In this original film, Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven capture the essence, the 'wonderment' and that magical 'something' that touches a cord deep down inside of you.  From the snowball fight, to the angel on ice, to the wine bottle that never empties, you will be chuckling and smiling as it takes you on a fun journey to its unpredictable ending.

The special effects are nothing spectacular compared to today's standards, but for the time period in which this B&W was made, it invites your attention and as it unravels to allow you (and your chidren) to double-take with amazement... and if you dare to let go and loose yourself in this film, you will marvel, and believe that angels do walk amongst us, and that seemingly normal, sometimes odd inexplicable occurances in our everyday lives today often do reflect the magic of Christmas time.

You'll be adding this to your list of Christmas classics (like "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Miracle On 34th Street").  A GREAT movie to watch with that special someone, or the kids....

So grab a cup of hot chocolate, some apple cider (or even a hot-toddy ;-) on a cold evening and snuggle in to enjoy this feature...and by the time it's over, ...that good feeling you have? ...well that's just an added bonus (that I bet you didn't count on being included for free with the cost of this film ;-).

Enjoy!
