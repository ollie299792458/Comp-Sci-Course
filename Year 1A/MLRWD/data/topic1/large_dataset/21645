"The Grudge (2004)" is based on the Japanese horror film "Ju-on (The Grudge.)" Japanese Director Takashi Shimizu directed both films.

"The Grudge (2004)" is filmed with American actors. Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, Clea Duvall (Currently in Carnivale.) and Grace Zabriski were sent off to Tokyo to work with Takashi Shimizu. Sarah Michelle Gellar is used as the cover popularity, recognized name, but plays a supporting part to the haunted house. A never-ending curse is thrust upon this house because of what happened there. Do not step inside this house!

Takashi Shimizu utilizes time segments to develop this film into an ending climax. The film starts out in the middle, then procedures to go back and forth from present to past.  I enjoyed this horror film. This film is a break from all special effects movies that Hollywood seems to force upon us. Yes a movie can still be made without them! Was I scared? Sure. The director does take the viewers point of view in mind. I just can't get that scream and little boy creature out of my mind.

This horror film takes you back to the old days of filming horror films. No CGI special effects here. Everything you see in the film is real. Okay, I found this out by viewing the bonus features. I strongly recommend viewing the bonus features for filming techniques and technical applications applied. American horror films and Japanese horror films are completely polar opposites. An American haunted house is totally different than a Japanese haunted house. I don't want to give away too much, but the Japanese haunted house is ruthless and relentless.
