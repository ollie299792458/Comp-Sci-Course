OK, you've seen the film so I won't elaborate on the story we all know and love. But the blu-ray disc DOES look and sound amazing. Thanks Anchor Bay! I get the impression that you appreciate Mr. Barker's work almost as much as I do. So, when is Hellraisrer 2 going to be released on blu-ray, hmm? IMO any of the Hellraiser films after #2 aren't even worth talking about as Mr. Barker had little, if anything, to do with them so you can keep those.

Now, for those of you who have not actually read "The Hellbound Heart", the novella on which Hellraiser is based, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. The film is great but the book is so much better! For example, the scene in which Frank first summons the Cenobites is quite chilling and very detailed. The kinds of details you just can't touch on in a film (at least not 20 years ago) and it HINTS at an explanation of the Cenobites (what they are/where they're from) but still leaves them shrouded in mystery, as they should be. But I admit, I'm a much bigger fan of Mr. Barker's writing than the films based on his work. Sorry, but I had to plug the book too :).
