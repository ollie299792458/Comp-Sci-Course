This collection  finishes the parade of Donald's starring cartoons. I just read the bonus features and here is what they have to offer.

"Donald Goes To Press", "The Unseen Donald Duck:Trouble Shooters",Two Audio Commentary's. 'Working For Peanuts' and 'Grand Canyonscope' both with Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck and Mousework Cartoons.

I was hoping the three Chip and Dale cartoons would be released in this collection, but I guess the people at the marketing department had other ideas. These bonus features sound nice although I'm a little disappointed that what I requested is not being put on, but, as I mentioned before, beggers can't be choosers. Besides, there's always next year. This set was not bad, but it could of been better. I noticed in 'Bee on Guard' the finale scene where the guard bee winks his eye after the second hip hip hooray (after he's been welcomed back after he win a battle with Donald and saves his colony) was deleted. Also (but not surprisingly) we have another From the Vault with an intro from Leonard that can not be skipped. I doubt Songs of the South will be on DVD without an intro from him.
