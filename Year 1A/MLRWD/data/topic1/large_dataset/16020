I think working with Jean Claude Van Damme had some negative side effects on John Woo.  Either that, or simply working in Hollywood screwed him up.  Granted, FACE OFF had some interesting ideas with a man facing his enemy,  but the enemy is him, but its not, and so on.  THIS movie though: can  anything be more blatant?  Does everything need a close up or a zoom in to  clarify things?  I can accept a movie that's unbelieveable at time, since  that's all movies in general, but the patronizing is too much.  Here are  two men on motorcycles.  Kill them.  It's easy because they have no other  weapon besides the motorcycle itself.  Conveniently, there are two bikes so  bad guy gets on one, and tom cruise (aka, James Bond) gets on the other.  Chase.  Bad guy puts bullet in cruise's cycle (close up: SEE)  A brutal  fight beyond human capacity for pain follows on a beach.  Gun, the only way  to end this agony, knocked out of hand (close up: SEE.  Its in the sand).  Blah, blah... And the dove?  was that necessary...again?  Keep Woo away  from soft focus.
