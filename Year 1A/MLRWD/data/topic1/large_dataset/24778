I've been a serial fan since I saw the 1943 Batman serial in 1966.  Bought this one because I was curious.  Without the wartime setting, this one seems much less compelling story wise.  Also, Robert Lowery, although a good actor, seems bored and slightly embarassed in this one.  The less said about Johnny Duncan the better.  Some of the situations Batman and Robin find themselves in are downright hilarious, such as Batman pulling a full size blow torch from god knows were to cut his way out of a locked vault. Or, when Batman is punched in the face by a thug, commenting "that hurt" then coldcocking the guy. The costumes are ok except for the glaringly oversize nose piece on Batman's cowl,which just destroys the entire effect of the whole outfit.  I found it annoying and distracting throughout the entire film and coming in at about four hours, that quite a lot of annoyance and distraction. Lyle Talbot, Ponie Adams and the rest of the cast are all solid pros but the rambling story and ultra cheap production values (no Batmoble in sight, just a nondiscript tan colored sedan)I think three starts might be pushing it a little.  Overall, it looked like Batman and Robin wandered onto the set of a Three Stooges short.  Still, If you enjoy Batman, or low budget films from the period, give it a look.
