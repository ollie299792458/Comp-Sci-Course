The Killing is an old film noir that reminds me greatly of Ocean's 11. The film is about a desperate gang of thieves that plot to rob a racetrack. The crime is cleverly thought and laid out, and they all believe that nothing could go wrong.

  One aspect of a film noir is the femme fatale. In The Killing the femme fatale, Sherry, is married to one of the men involved in the whole scheme. Sherry is disappointed with him-he isn't providing enough for her. She finds out about the racetrack plan and she decides to interfere out of her own greed.

 The film was shot in black and white. It has sharp contrast and complex compositions that add to the effect of the film noir. Stanley Kubrick also has a unique way of telling the story. Rather than having the film go straight through, step-by-step, it is broken down with flashbacks and goes a bit out of order.

 The heist ends up not going as planned. While everything seemed to go just perfectly, in the end there is a bad case of karma. Whatever goes around comes around...
