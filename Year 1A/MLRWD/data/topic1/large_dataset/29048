I bought this DVD after missing the movie in theaters.  The previews I saw made it look like one incredibly funny movie, so I was more than happy to shell out the money for it.  And I'm the type of person that is easily amused by most comedies.  The movie definitely has it's funny moments, and the Broken Lizard guys certainly have potential, but overall it fails to satisfy.  I never found myself laughing uncontrollably during this movie, and a lot of times just wondered what the heck was going on.  I watched the movie three times before watching it with the directors commentary.  With the cast/crew commentary, you start to understand that many of the parts of the movie are based on inside jokes from their college days that didn't really translate well to a wide audience.  It made a bit more sense at that point, but the second rule of comedy is if the joke has to be explained, it's not funny.  Since this is a drug comedy, I guess it also violates the third rule of comdey: If you have to be high to think it's funny, it's not funny.  Given the amount of drug comedies out there like the Cheech and Chong movies, Half Baked, and even Dazed and Confused, this one fails to be as funny as any of them.  To be honest, most Adam Sandler films are far funnier than this, and that's pretty bad.
With that being said, I'd definitely keep an eye out for the Broken Lizard guys in the future.  These guys aren't quite the "not ready for prime-time" players that the original SNL cast were, but with honed comedic skills they could do a lot better than the [stuff] that goes for comedy out there now.  Unfortunately that [stuff] includes this film as well.
