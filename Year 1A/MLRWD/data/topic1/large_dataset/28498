"Flight of The Phoenix" is a terrific, old-fashioned action-adventure film, with an all-male (but for a mirage) cast led by James Stewart.

He plays a weathered pilot who crash lands a rickety plane, filled with the standard mixed-bag cast of characters, into the center of a vast Arabic desert.

As plots go, the plane happens to be filled with a killer set of tools AND an aerospace engineer.

These guys have to build a plane out of the wreckage, and fly out of the desert.

The cast is filled with great faces: Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch, Ernest Borgnine, Hardy Kruger, Ian Bannen, George Kennedy, Dan Duryea...

...and the opening has a nice bit of "24"-ish sudden death surprises.

The direction is brisk, with the occasional artistic indulgence; the screenplay is a bit weak...there's lots of plain, old, cringe-worthy lines, saved by the cast's formidable talent.

The transfer is probably as good as it's ever gonna get...the few flashes of color (like reds...) mixed in with the dreary desert palette pop off the screen.

No extras to speak of.

It's a great way to spend an afternoon, especially if, as I did, you have fond memories of this film from watching it on TV as a child.
