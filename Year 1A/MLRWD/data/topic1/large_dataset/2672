Seriously, if you like either sci-fi or action movies, I can't really give you a reason not to like this movie. i think people who rate this movie below a 3 are really either not fans of either genre of film mentioned above or really really stupid. Great action scenes, great special effects(for the time) and great pacing. Listen, they already did the suspense portion of the story. You already seen the alien so it makes sense to put you face to face with it. What better way of doing that then space marines. What, are they going to send scientist or another mining crew? Then you have the same movie over again. So, we finally get a bigger picture of who the "company" really is, and what they will do to secure said alien. What that means to us action fans is a lot, and I mean LOT, of firepower. The action scenes are a delightful mixture of frenetic helmet camera shots and pretty good solid camera work. The camera does not bounce from shot to shot as much as 90 percent of action movies from that era. Oh for the sci-fi fans, we have wonderfully detailed aliens here. The designs are top notch and the way we see how they live and hunt as a pack would scare you out of your skin if you were one of those marines. I loved how this movie played out. To me, it was fast enough that I never got bored, yet seemed to take it's time to let fans of the original get involved in new plot lines and newcomers get a understanding of the alien mythos. I don't know what else to say except, I love this movie.
