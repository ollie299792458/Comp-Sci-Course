I love a good foreign film and this is one that does not disappoint. When the tale begins, it is so colorful and candy coated... Little red hearts and roses dance all over the screen in the films opening credits. I thought with a smile, that I was in for a bit of fluffy romance. The lead female character Angelique was adorable and I just loved her on sight. Audrey Tautou played her perfectly and when things started to not go her way in the love affiar, I thought that she was a bit naive, but I genuinely felt bad for her....however, halfway into the movie, the entire story folds in on itself and rewinds to the opening scene only to follow her lover the cardiologist instead of Angelique,whom we stayed with the entire first half of the movie.
What an eye opener.
Suddenly, everything that you have belived is not so clear anymore and I found my self feeling more and more revolted as things came to light.
I dont want to give too much away, because it would surely spoil it for those who have yet to see it. All in all, this was a very clever and entertaining story that I would definitely recommend watching. I would watch it again myself in a heartbeat.
