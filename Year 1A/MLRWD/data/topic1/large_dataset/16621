If like me you were born in the 50s and liked science fiction and fantasy movies, you'll undoubtedly remember these two fun creature features. In the early 60s the atomic end to World War Two was still fresh in the country's memory and the Cold War was underway. For kids, the atomic menace manifested itself in the form of duck-and-cover drills at school and the thought that at any moment we could be running to a bomb shelter. Add to that the thought of irradiated dinosaurs and ants terrorizing the city and country side and it's no wonder we all loved these movies so much. Both movies feature actors who went on to bigger and better things and the special effects were state-of-the-art for the time. Today the ants in Them look pretty silly and although Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur is cool, it's still crude compared to what is being accomplished in 2010; it will be hard for anyone but fans of the craft and science fiction fans in the 50-60 year old bracket to embrace it. For those of us who were there (so to speak) The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Them are a great trip down memory lane to a time when things were a little simpler, this kind of scary was all new and a big bear in the east was banging his shoe on the podium, something that was a whole lot scarier than giant ants.
