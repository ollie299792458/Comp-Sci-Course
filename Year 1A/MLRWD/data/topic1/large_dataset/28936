The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has done it again with their film adaptation of the classic Lovecraft novel "The Whisperer In Darkness".  Remaining faithful to Lovecraft's tales is extremely difficult and has been infinitely expounded upon elsewhere, but this intrepid group of film makers continues to raise the bar for the genre in this the latest of their films.

The "Call of Cthulhu" silent movie was an astonishing period piece and well executed, but this film remains even more ambitious.  It's use of "Mythoscope", period set pieces, costumes, and especially the props and vehicles (including a beautiful gramophone and Rolls) add an air of authenticity to the suspenseful proceedings, allowing a natural segue from the depiction of the events of Lovecraft's novel to an adaptation that, while continuing in the same vein, displays a refreshing tale of horror not seen since the days of Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.

When considering a Lovecraft movie, I seek well-written and faithful adaptations that still have the ability to invoke concern for the characters, suspense, and horror, even though I am familiar with the tales.  HPLHS has not disappointed with either of their ventures, and heartfelt congratulations are in order for their supreme efforts.  There are many well-done Lovecraftian movies, but few well-done Lovecraft movies, and the films of HPLHS top that very short list.  If you are an aficianado of period pieces, horror movies, Lovecraftian tales, and good old-fashioned independent film-making outside the box, you will certainly find something to appreciate here.
