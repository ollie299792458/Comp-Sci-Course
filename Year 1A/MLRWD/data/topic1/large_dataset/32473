Milla Jovovich is probably best known for the "Resident Evil" trilogy, "Ultra-Violet" or "The Fifth Element."  She also a rather high profile model.

Still, these are rather lacking in showcasing an underrated talent.  I've had the pleasure of seeing Jovovich in some relatively obscure films where she proves she can actually ACT.  She has a particular gift for taking roles that could easily be "over-acted," instead showing a masterful moderation, and gives fairly nuanced performances--even in something like a mediocre rom-com.

The plot involves sort of a classic "who will kill who?" thriller set on the gorgeous backdrop of Kaua'i, perhaps Hawaii's best kept secret (gorgeous island, much less touristy than Maui or Honolulu, etc.)

Like any good thriller there are plenty of twists and a grand twist, but this film never cheapens them.  When it does finally put all of the cards on the table, it does so in a brilliant 20 min. (give or take) sequence that not only makes it credible, but it adds an emotional depth that is succinct, memorable, and dare I say a bit heart-breaking?

The main downside is that some of the red-herrings are a bit obvious, but these flaws are mitigated largely by the aforementioned sequence and its careful foreshadowing.  One final downer: lackluster extras.  (Simply, an alternate ending.)  Still, the Blu-Ray trumps the DVD (for those of you making a choice) because the visuals and scenery are absolutely stunning in gorgeous widescreen HD.
