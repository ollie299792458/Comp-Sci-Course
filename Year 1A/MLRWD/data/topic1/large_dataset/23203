Directed by Danis Tanovic, and starring one of the most popular Bosnian actors, Branko Djuric, a veteran of Yugoslavian cinema Filip Sovagovic, and Rene Bitorajac, "No Man's Land" ("Nicija Zemlja") is a great insight not only into the war in Bosnia, but also into the irony of it, as well as into the typical ex-Yugoslavian form of cinema.  Danis Tanovic truly showed the Balkans in a nutshell.

Two Bosnian Muslims and two Bosnian Serbs are caught in a trench between enemy lines - in no man's land.  The area is off limits to all warring parties, meaning that neither party is prepared to officially investigate the matter.  Enter the United Nations, popularly known in Bosnia as the Smurfs (due to blue helmets and the fact they had absolutely no power in Bosnia, in fact, they were the national laughing stock).  Lulled by constantly being ignored and by constantly saying "no", the UN is confused as to what to do, especially as they come into a situation in which one of the occupants of the trench might die.  Originally turning their back on the entire situation, one UN peacekeeper's morals force the higher-ups into dealing with the situation through the involvement of the international media.

Excellent in its entirety, the movie is comical and tragic at the same time, educational and frustrating, hopeful and without hope.  The only critique I have is that Tanovic picked Sovagovic (a Croat) to play a veteran Serb, and Sovagovic's Croatian accent is unmistakable and out of place throughout.

I highly recommend this film to everyone, period.  I will end with a great quote from the film - a French peacekeeper tells a British journalist:"Not doing anything IS taking sides."  Enjoy the movie.
