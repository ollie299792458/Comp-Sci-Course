Although we are treated to the much-loved AIP English dub from the 1960's, the poor quality control of the transfer makes it almost pointless. The first five minutes alone, my personal favorite section of the movie which introduced me to the pantheon of Toho's monsters as a kid, stutters and cuts out as if the projector wasn't threaded correctly. This is a simple error that should never have made it to store shelves. This is definitely not a digital error isolated to my copy as other buyers have posted this same issue on Media Blasters' Facebook page. Media Blasters' explanation is that, although they are aware of the problem, they couldn't find a better copy.This is poor excuse that says nothing more than they simply didn't care to look for a better one or to fix a mistake during the transfer. There are a number of private collections that would allow them a bevy of both digital and 35mm sources that would have easily fixed any trouble spots.

The commentary, although incredibly informative, is barely audible. The volume must be raised considerably to hear it, thus making the menu music ear-blastingly loud by comparison.

This disc is worth the money for the commentary and the extras, but if you are looking for the AIP dub, there are plenty of DVD vendors online who didn't seem to have any problems finding better copies.
