What can I say about a movie that is so touching to me inside and out. I have gotten tingles from it. It is slow it is fast it varies in so many different directions and each time the romance is something different to me. I have watched more movies than I can recollect and know that this movie shows a direct understanding of what a relationship really is. Falling in love may be an 'at-first-glance' thing but in most cases it is something that develops over time. This movie portrays that and most definately the reality of what can happen between two people over time. It gives a sense to how things should be and certainly how I would want them. I mean really how many days are spent in life by oneself. I felt it really capture the sense of alone that most people get in their lives at one point or another. I know I am only 23 and have barely only begun to feel that over the course of mine. I have indulged myself many times with a deck of cards as Billy Crystal does and certainly have attempted to feel as he does. This movie is long but well worth the wait and certainly with the combination of humour and sorrow and reality in life it presents itself as a favorite in my collection. I can't wait till the DVD comes out and I can see the 11 extra minutes.
