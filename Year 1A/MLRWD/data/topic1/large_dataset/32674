I personally liked this movie despite the negative reviews it was nice to watch a horror film with an entirely different and sinister story line. I surely would not take it to church and watch it either folks but this is not about religion it is only entertainment nothing is to be taken out of context from movies, games, or music really people should not view these things as tools to influence others because they really do not have that intent with the exception of a documentary or reality type TV people must not take things as serious as they do. I think the problem with this world is that someone says or does something without the intent to cause any harm mentally and then some person takes it to heart a bit too much and this causes triggers a violent reaction. I can not stress enough it is only entertainment if you watch a horror movie it is not the intent to worship the devil it is just the intent to be scared or entertained no different then riding that roller coaster at an amusement park. And this movie is a good entertaining horror flick maybe not what you would expect but I think that's what provided me the good vibe for this movie was the fact that it was totally different then what I had expected and the effects were rather interesting.
