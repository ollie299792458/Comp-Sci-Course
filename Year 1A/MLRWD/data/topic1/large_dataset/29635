Not a simple action film (although the action scenes are excellent) but more a psychological profile of an professional assassin. Charles Bronson plays Arthur Bishop, a hitman or "mechanic". Bishop isn't a sociopath as much as he is an pure existentialist. Extremely self-aware, he lives outside society in accordance with his own, very strict, rules; "It has to do with standing outside of it all...on your own.". Besides being a very well trained killer, he's a sophisticated and cultured man with a nice house on Mulholland drive and a taste for wine, art and antique weapons. He's a disciplined connoisseur in his assassinations as well, which are all meticulously planned and executed.

Where the film is unusually smart for an action movie is that it shows the price Bishop has to pay for living such an isolated existence. With his prescription pills and his anxiety attacks, he comes to realize that he could become incapacitated if he doesn't make a change in the way he lives. At this point in his life any real intimacy with other people is out of the question, so his solution is to take on a protege, Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent), the equally self-aware son of a mobster Bishop killed. Steve, who really is a sociopath, wants to "dig the scene" and the rest of the movie is about how it all works out.

The movie has some nice touches:

When Steve first first walks into Bishop's house he looks around and comments "So, this is what it looks like inside your mind".

A wax ball Bishop is always squeezing for hand strength because "sometimes you have to hold the mark".

A scene at the L.A. zoo starts with a shot of a sign that reads "Turtles" then pans down to show Bishop, a man who lives almost entirely in a his own shell.

An action movie for thinking people, I recommend "The Mechanic" to anyone who's looking for something smart and different.
