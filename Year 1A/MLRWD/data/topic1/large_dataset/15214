I went and seen Freddy Vs. Jason last night on it's debut night and it was definatly the best out of either series!!It had enough blood and gore to keep me happy and made me jump on a few occasions.....although very funny at parts,it wasn't trying to have all the humor that Jason X had (which is what made Jason X not as good as it should have been)The main plot of the movie is that Freddy poses as Jason's mom and resurects him to get him to kill a few kids on Elm street so they think it was Freddy so Freddy can come back....His plan works but then Jason (being the psycho that he is) won't stop killing so Freddy decides to get rid of him.....They fight twice....Once in "dream world" and go to Crystal Lake for the final round......I had my money on Jason the whole time.I have to admit though that Freddy did rock in this movie....They laid the smack down on each other....I'm not going to give away the ending but I will say it has a surprise twist ending.......The bottom line.....Dish out 10 bucks and go see this movie.....It is WELL worth the money
