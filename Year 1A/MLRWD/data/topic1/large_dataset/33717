The movie is great.  If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend it.  This one is directed by Apatow himself; so, you you know it's one of the better ones that carries his "brand"...unlike some of those cheeseball movies with Will Ferrel.  More to the point, you get the sense that he made this movie for himself or his family.  For example, his wife in real life is Leslie Mann, and his daughters play his and Leslie's daughters in the movie.  But enough about a review of the content...I assume that if you're considering the Blu-Ray release of Knocked Up, you've seen the movie before.

I don't know about you, but when I am considering purchasing a Blu-Ray, what I want to know is (in order of importance) 1) How good does it look?  2) How good does it sound?  3) What special features distinguish it from the DVD version that I might possibly own already.  The picture quality is good but not amazing.  I have yet to find a BD that has worse picture quality than its DVD counterpart, but we're not expecting minor improvements from the BD.  Considering a dual layer BD can hold 50 GB compared to a DVD-9 that can hold 8.5 GB, we expect A LOT more from Blu-Ray...and rightfully so!  The audio is fine, but my expectations for a comedy are much lower as I tend to be more interested in content than technical achievements and fidelity; whereas, action movies force me to be a more discerning critic.  That said, I don't find anything particularly impressive or irritating about the audio on this disc.

Lastly, the special features are good but nothing, IMO, that warrants buying this disc if you already own the DVD.  Again, if you're like me, you're only going to watch the special features so many times.  The audio and video quality of the main title are what I am most interested in, and I am unwilling to pay $20 for the BD version at this time.  If Amazon takes it down to $15, I'll take the plunge but not before.
