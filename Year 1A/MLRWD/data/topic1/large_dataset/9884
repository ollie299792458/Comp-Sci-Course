Let me start by saying I had never seen the Fantasticks before I saw this on television.
I recently watched Les Miserables 25th anniversary performance on television and loved LOVED it. When I heard that this was another musical I thought it would be just as lovely. It seemed lighter and sweeter that Les Miserables in the commercial advertisements. A story about two young people falling in love with a fantastic carnival and a charming Ring master in the background. My sister and I eagerly watched it.
It sucked.
The Ring master guy (I forgot his name) was our favorite character. He was the only one, besides the girl's father, that was remotely interesting. The songs all sucked, completely and I've forgotten all of them, unlike other musicals whose melodies linger in your head long after you watch them.
I didn't hate it but I found myself dying with laughter at the sheer ridiculous nature of the plot and the characters. When the girl suddenly proclaimed her love to the ring master guy I was like, "What the hell?" It was all confusing. Even with better singers and better songs it would have sucked because the plot is sugary sweet without any depth. Maybe the broadway play is better? Maybe.
