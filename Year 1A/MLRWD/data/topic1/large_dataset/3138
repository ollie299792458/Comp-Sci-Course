Tora Tora Tora is one of the best films on the Pacific War that I have seen. I have seen other good films but none that have covered the bombing of Pearl Harbor from both American and Japanese sides and with careful  attention to detail.  A lot of money was spent on this film, but it was not  wasted because it takes you through the entire planning and political phase  as well as the final bombing of Pearl. This movie is definetly better than  Midway. Although Midway had a interesting story the Sinking of the Japanese  fleet carriers it lacked in accuracy in relation to warplanes and it's  budget for special effects must have been not any because it used old war  footage to try to substitute for action.  By the way about Midway the paint  schemes on those Japanese planes as interesting as they were are  historicaly inacurate. Tora! Tora! Tora! Pearl told as it actually  happened. One of my critics of Tora Tora Tora would be about the Japanese  delgates as embarrased as they must have been. I think it was overdone with  the weakness of there characters and the whole thing just stunk of old  stereotypes about people of asian descent. Other than that thumbs up
