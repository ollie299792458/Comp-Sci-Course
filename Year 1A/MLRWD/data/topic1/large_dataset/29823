Unfortunately, I found this movie predictable and trite. My 14-year-old walked out in the middle because it was boring, we knew what the ending would be and the acting and script were not compelling.
The movie was also anachronistic (ie historically inaccurate). If you know anything about the pioneer period of American history you will find this low-budget film grating.  The producers/directors did not bother to get anything correct- costumes, cabin props, barn construction, language and role of women/children in the period.  Again, it was so blatant that my 14-year-old also found the historical inaccuracies so intolerable that we spent more time noting these than watching the story line.  One minor example of the history issues- the main character is wearing a modern bra with a shoulder clip clearly visible when her blouse (also not historical costume) gets wet.
I am all for the idea of family-friendly stories and I love the stories of pioneer America.  But this knowledge and love for true pioneer stories is why I could not appreciate this movie-- I know too much about the period to have this phony imitation of a pioneer situation ring true.
