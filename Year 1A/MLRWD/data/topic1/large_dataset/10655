......you have to sit through 4 minutes of ads for other movies.  There isn't even a way to get through them like on many other dvds such as pushing the skip chapter or fast forward buttons....  I was hoping that they would not pop up again after watching them once or something like that.....but nope......and I just can't get over it.....I paid for this movie......I should have the right not to be FORCED to watch 4 minutes of ads when I want to go and watch one special feature on this disc.... 
As for the movie....  The movie is great and very funny.....yet, it isn't funny every second as the Ace Ventura movies were.....but when it isn't funny....it's just one of those good ole fashioned fun to watch movies.  The extra features are fun to watch, but I wish that the "Inside the creative mind of jim" extra feature had more "examples of the inside of his creative mind" in it....
So... It's a great movie and the extra features are fun to watch, but there are 4 extremely annoying minutes that you have to sit through every time before the menu pops up, but that should not stop you from buying this movie at all.
