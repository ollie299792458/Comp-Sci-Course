I originally saw this film about 5 years ago on video, and was somewhat surprised that I had managed to miss the cinema release! The quality of acting is strong by Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman. In particular though, Jean Reno is most impressive, with often subtle, understated acting, which is emphasised in the additional footage.
Although another reviewer refers to this version as "The European Version," I hadn't seen the additional footage, which suggests the original release was cut for both American and British audiences. The added 24 minutes do change the feel of the film considerably, by placing more detail on Mathilda and Leon's relationship. The relationship no longer leads the audience to believe protection is the primary motive for Leon's `adoption' of Mathilda, love becomes the true reason, and although it considers a paedophilic angle, it brings into focus interesting questions about what - in particular non-sexual - relationships are permissible in our society, and between whom.
Apart from the additional footage the DVD is pretty short on special features, with just a handful of trailers, release posters and a quick bio of Reno, Oldman and Portman (and why isn't True Romance mentioned amongst Oldman's filmography?).
