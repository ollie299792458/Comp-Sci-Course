The cinematography and imagery of these dreams are so "perfect" for the message(s), that the viewer is immediately drawn into the film.  That the film is Japanese is not a barrier.  Rather, the film successfully presents the imagery in a manner that allows an outside (Westerner) to understand the images and inuitively grasp the mythology and culture behind the film.

Two dreams "Mount Fuji in Red" and "The Weeping Demon" do not make the historical leap, however.  They are interesting "period pieces."  "Mount Fuji in Red," an anti-nuclear piece, is mired strident views of its time - not rising to the more universal threat.  Note, however, that "The Tunnel", an anti-war piece does continues to powerfully express its views.

"Crows" which is based on Vincent Van Gogh's work, shows Kurosawa adapting Western imagery to his Japanese work.  This is a wonderful piece that illustrates how cultural divisions can be bridged by film, film relying primarily on visual (rather than verbal) material.

Fear, loneliness, death, joy, environmental concerns, peace and warfare, otherness ... many of the major themes of life are explored beautifully in this film.  Highly recommended.
