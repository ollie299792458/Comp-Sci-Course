I've never read the book but have wanted to see this movie for some time. I watched it today on tv. It ran 2 hours with no commercials so I don't know if anything was edited out. I watched The Tudors tv series and subsequently have read quite a bit about that era. I know the Tudors was somewhat inaccurate - especially with the portrayal of Henry as a young viril man well into his 40s- but it was far superior to this movie. Of course, it is easier to develop characters, plots and timelines over the course of a 4 year series than in a 2 hour movie. However, the major events of the story are barely touched upon in TOBG. The timeline is wrong. It has Henry hating Anne almost on their wedding day, when actually his disappointment in her didn't occur until after Elizabeth was born. And at the end, Mary takes Elizabeth to raise. Elizabeth is portrayed as an infant when we know that she was 3 when Anne died. Plus, there is nothing I've read to indicate that Mary actually raised Elizabeth. Many other reviews have already pointed out the many other historical inaccuracies so I will not repeat. Just let it be said that this movie was a major disappointment.
