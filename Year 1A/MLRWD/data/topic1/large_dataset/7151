Saw this film originally on a University movie channel, I turned it on expecting just another sci-fi monster movie.  I was actually very surprised.  While it has the prerequisite dazzling special effects (believe me, I like these too), it had something I haven't seen in a good long while.  The characters actually act... human?  They don't "kill all the big bad monsters" like unlikely super heroes, they run away (honestly what I, and I would hazard the guess, most anyone would do).
Furthermore, I liked the character development which is RARE in any action/horror film now days.  Riddick's (Diesel) development has been noted to be a bit overdone at the last, and I'll admit the final scene might just be a tad sappy, but I'm not complaining.  Fry's (Mitchell) development should not be overlooked, however, and she really impressed me at the end by being the hero, without losing the "real person" image.
Scary for anyone who was afraid of the dark as a kid, and with enough twists to make the plot deep enough to be interesting even while the credits roll and you finish off the popcorn.  Enjoy!
