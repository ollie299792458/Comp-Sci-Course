I have never read any C.S. Lewis books and knew nothing of Narnia. I had tears in my eyes several times in this movie. It was so touching and great. Was it because I am a Christian? Yes definitely. I did not need the book to understand this movie. It is beyond words. To me, I can't wait for the DVD. I am also going to see this again in the theaters. My 17 year old daughter saw it with me and my 18 year old and The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is now there favorite movie of all time.  Even passing the Lord of the Rings!
They just understand it better and are more child like in their understanding. I can't really explain it, But I can't get enough of this movie. It is the best! No Blood! No bad language, just a great story that was well presented.
Go see it!
By The Way, There seems to be a lot of reference to Disney like, Disney did this and Disney did that!
People, Disney had absolutely nothing to do with this movie being made. They paid for advertising and released and distributed it. It was made by Walden Media. Controlled by C.S. Lewis's stepson to be faithful to the book. C.S. Lewis's grandson is satisfied with the movie. If Disney had made this, the Christian allegory would have been toned way down and then The movie would not have been made. Nuff Said
