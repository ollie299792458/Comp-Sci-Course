I was not sure about this one at first.  I was so disappointed in the 2nd movie of the series that I didn't bother seeing this at the show.  When I watched it at home, I was amazed at exactly how much I enjoyed it.  The original movie I've seen, geez, I don't know how many times.  The second, as previously indicated, was a disappointment.  However, everyone has more than redeemed themselves with this superb suspense thriller.

At the time this movie came out, I don't recall hearing that much about it.  I think it was released about the same time as the last (please God) Indiana Jones which was all anyone seemed to be able to talk about (it, in my opinion, was a dud--but I digress).

The fact that this third in the Mummy series takes place in China did not bother me as it appears to have some.  The action is, literally, non stop and the movie did a terrific job in its recreation of time and place (1940s).  Brandon Fraser is a great action hero and never fails to charm.  The actress who plays his wife was every bit as good as Rachel Weitz.  Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh round out this superb cast.

Bravo. Highly recommended.
