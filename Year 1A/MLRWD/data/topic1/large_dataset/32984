This is a charming and beautifully  produced little romantic-comedy melodrama, with  a bitter sweet taste. It is a simple tale , a kind of Italian  version of H. G. Wells', The History of Mr. Polly, except the Italian Signora  "Polly" (so to speak) finds her happiness among the picturesque slums of outer Venice and turns  her back on the comfortable horrors of suburbanite Rome and its hyper markets. The little tale also has its "For want of a  horseshoe nail the battle was lost "theme. The heroine's escape would simply not have happened but for her trying to fish a fallen earring out of a bus rest stop toilet bowl on the way back to Rome from  a family holiday  in the Greco-Italian  south. Unbelievably the bus, plus husband and kids, leaves without her. It would spoil the story to tell you the rest. This is a very visual movie where you have to watch  all the details very carefully (rather than  to pay much attention to the dialogue). I first watched the DVD without the sub-titles, although my knowledge of Italian is minimal and yet I was able to follow the  story without much difficulty. The photography focuses less on the overall grand beauty of the tourist's Venice but more on the still life details that a Renaissance artist wood have appreciated, for example the  half a loaf of country bread on the kitchen table, a broken ornament, a baroque street light or the  petals slowly falling off the  cut tulips in a vase as the suicidal Icelander sits  drinking his Chartreuse in despair. The movie deservedly  won nine Italian academy awards for 2000, plus five silver ribbon of Italian Film Critics as well as several Golden Globe awards
