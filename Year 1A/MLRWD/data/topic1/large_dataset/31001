I thought this movie was great in every sense of the word great.  Before I even saw the movie on its opening night I thought with the cast of Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank with the direction of Christopher Nolan of Memento fame would make for an outstanding movie.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Some these other "amateur reviewers" make such a big deal about it being a remake and not being "fresh" piece of work.  Some times these remakes really work and this it certainly is a case in point.  {for instances a not-so-good remake is Vanilla Sky, of the top of my head) As for as acting gods go, Al Pacino is definitely Mount Rushmore in my book. His turn here as a fatigued, two-faced detective with rather auspicious methods is absolutely pitch perfect and will get him on the Best Actor short list.  Ditto for Robin Williams.  His performance here continues to confirm his ever-increasing reputation as a considerable dramatic actor of grand proportions.  Hillary Swank's turn here stands up well to the other two quite outstanding performances.  With this movie, Christopher Nolan has offically arrived in the modern filmmaking era proving that Memento was no fluke or flash in the pan.  The only slight problem with his movies are the release dates on them.  Last year Memento was released way early and may have been mostly forgotten by Oscar time.  This year Insomnia is again early and is also competing against the cash cows Spider Man and the latest Star Wars movie that will make for a tough run at the box office.  If you enjoy smart well-acted movies, this is a sure bet.
