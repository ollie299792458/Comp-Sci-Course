My first (real) introduction to Superstar was when our local theater did a production of it.  Both of my brothers were in it, and my father and uncle were part of the band (my dad and uncle were both in a band when younger and played around the local area, so they could do rock and roll).  It intrigued me enough to pick up the album version of JCS.  So, I compare all vocals to the album (which may or may not be fair).  The movie adaptation is very well done.  I like how they approached it.  I thought Jesus was a bit weak as a vocalist, but I am used to the album.  I thought Judas was a tad "different".  Not really weak, but his timing seemed different.  Yes, I realize they both played the same parts in the Broadway production, but I guess it is my familiarity with the album's singers that makes me a tad biased.  Having said all this, they are not bad by any means.  The main thing is, if you're only exposure is the originally released album, you may be slightly disappointed by some of the singing, but all in all it is a good adaptation.  Sit back and enjoy.
