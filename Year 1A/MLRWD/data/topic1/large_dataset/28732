If it weren't for The Replacements, I would never have believed it possible to enjoy football.  Indeed, this movie is the ONLY way I can enjoy football.  The Replacements is not a brilliantly acted film that will leave you with some with deep, meaningful insight.  It is, however, engaging & enjoyable--a big "warm-fuzzy" of a sports film.  The acting isn't great, but the cast of characters are well-written and portrayed in a way that really made like them and want them to succeed--while naturally hoping that the striking players would get what was coming to them.

Gene Hackman's acting can be a little "over-the-top", but it really worked for his role as the Coach--in fact, compared to the likes of Denny Crum, Gene's portrayal was downright sedate.  And Keanu Reeves?  He always gets such gets a bad rap because of his somewhat, er, "mellow" approach to acting, but in The Replacements his portrayal of QB Shane Falco came across as very warm & personable (of course, it doesn't hurt that he's just so darn pretty) and he's very believable as a football player.  As for the rest of the cast:  Brooke Langton is really sweet as the head cheerleader/love interest.  Brett Cullen may be a nice guy in real life, but you sure wouldn't know it based on his portrayal of striking QB Eddie Martel.  Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans and all the other Sentinel "Replacements" are hilarious--Orlando Jones doesn't even have to say anything:  he's just that funny.  I love the dance scene at the jail--yes, suspension of belief is required, but, hey...it's cute guys dancing.
