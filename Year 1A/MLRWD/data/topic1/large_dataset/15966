Barely a 2 and I won't be buying it.  OK, where do I start?  First and foremost, I believe that this movie gave very little technical realism to the military side of the equation.  Once again, we're portrayed as macho idiots (or lambs) that are saluting smartly and doing the bidding of senseless Republican war-mongers who do "whatever it takes."  The technical aspects of the military mission were laughable.  Anyone that falls or jumps out of a helicopter 100 feet above mountainous terrain is going to DIE.  Yet, one of our college heroes falls out and the other jumps out so that "no man is left behind" and they survive the fall into a snow bank on a flat part of the mountain pass.  Next, Hollywood shows us that we can see our good guys with the bad guy "Talies" approaching via satellite imagery through a blinding snow storm at night...right.  So, we watch our intrepid heroes fight off some of the advance of some 20-30 enemy while having little or no terrain as cover.  Why are our heroes not killed outright?....We are told that the Taliban want to take them alive.  OK, maybe plausible, but unlikely.  Next, our A-10 support arrives and bombs the crap out of the FLOT (forward line of troops) at least two or three times.  Initially our heroes hope that all have been vanquished, but then suffer further small arms fire from the dark only yards away.  What do they decide?  Do they decide to try to hold on for what everyone knows will be the rescue attempt?  NOOOOOO.  Damn it.  They stand up and go out in a suicide blaze of fire because they believe all is lost.  CRAP!  Seconds later the remaining Taliban are exterminated in the final A-10 pass and the rescue helicopter only a couple of minutes away.  I was so angry I could spit.  The rest of the movie is what you would expect from Robert Redford, another lecture on his view of American politics and right wing wrongs.  Where do these people get their military technical consultation, the Salvation Army?
