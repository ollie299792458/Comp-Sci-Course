This film was actually very entertaining surprisingly. For asylum fans only! This films lives up to what it's supposedly meant to be. Director and star of this film Shane van dyke (grandson of Dick van dyke) gives his best. Is it as good as Dicaprio's performance? Of course not! But it's still a very fun film. I don't know about you, but who would get on a ship called titanic 2? The effects are asylum good, probably at it's best, the acting is pretty good considering. The story was predictable, obviously, but still well done. Our protaginist is rich in this one, by the way. Our couple in this film is Hayden & Amy. That's right I like crappy films, but that's just me, I don't think it's bad despite what all the reviews say.

I love the first film, of course It's not better, but as an asylum fan, I love it.

If you're all about acting and you truly love the first film, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!! But if you're the kind of guy who is pleased with anything, like me, then you got something good coming for you!
