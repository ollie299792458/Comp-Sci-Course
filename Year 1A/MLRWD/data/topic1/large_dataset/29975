(1970) An exceptional movie, a film noir &agrave; la fran√ßaise simply amazing of minimalism and master. This movie is probably after Le Samourai, from the same director Jean Pierre Melville (used this alias because was in love with the Moby Dick book) on the most influential movie on contemporary film making. Jim Jarmush (Ghost Dog), John Woo (The Killer) and many more, loudly claim their admiration for Melville's work and Le Cercle Rouge. John Woo recently announced his will to remake Le Cercle rouge along with three other french film noirs (all featuring Alain Delon).

Andre Bourvil is amazing of sobriety (knowing that he used to be a stand up comic and comedian) as Commissaire Mattei aging cop, decided to do anything to arrest Vogel (Gian Maria Volonte) who escaped from him at the begining of the movie, this role would be the last one for Bourvil, he died just right after the shooting. Lino ventura was Melville's first choice. Alain Delon (After Le Samourai in 1967) plays a small crook, getting out a of jail (set in Marseille) heading to Paris for a heist (idea given to him by one of the wardens), when he encounters Gian Maria Volonte character (Some may have seen him in Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More in 1965). Yves Montand is probably the best character, playing an alcoholic ex cop, taking part of the heist by will of redemption (the scene where he is hallucinating is purely amazing), Melville was gonna use Jean Paul Belmondo for the role. Guns are here pure accessories only used for the final shotdown. Great tribute to the original film noir era, slow movie but never boring, great character description are what makes Le Cercle Rouge this masterpiece which continues to fascinate every movie fan round the world.
