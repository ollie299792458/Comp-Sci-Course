Toto is still the perfectionist group it always was, even if Simon Phillips' hairdo makes him look like Harpo Marx at the drumset.

I can overlook a few mistakes on the song labeling of the DVD box, but the overall sound of the DVD is terribly imbalanced. Simon Phillips mixed down the concert tapes for release, which is apparently why I hear the drums best of all. The bass and guitars you can hear pretty well, and the keyboards too. But the vocals, especially Kimball's leads, sound like they were recorded off ambient room reverb.

And why do we never see the second keyboardist on camera, except for when he's introduced to the audience?  It's a little weird to hear seven musicians playing all the time, and only see six!

Toto is my favorite existing band -- I think only the Beatles outdid them -- and they did a great job of pasting together some really neat medleys and different arrangements of some of their old tunes. The lousy sound mix is what disappoints me with this DVD. But if you dig Toto, buy it.
