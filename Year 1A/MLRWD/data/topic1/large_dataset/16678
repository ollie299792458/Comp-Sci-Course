This is an old favorite. I watched it again the other night. It's
been over twenty years since I saw it last, and it's still as
good today as it was back then. The first half of the movie
plays heavily on plot and character development,which serves well
during the later action scenes. This development is not boring,
it is intermingled with sequences of international intrigue,
murder, and betrayal. Hoffman plays a history student who also
happens to be a wanna-be marathon runner obsessed with the death
of his father. Without giving too much away, Laurence Olivier
gives an excellent and chilling performance as a Nazi with a
knack for dental instruments. This is one of those "I don't
know who I can trust" movies. Unlike most movies with this
premise, it creates a believable scenario,instead of relying on
the same old tired "I can't remember" trick that so many lesser
movies cheat their audience with. Once this movie kicks into
overdrive, it moves along at a fever pitch with twists and turns
around every corner. The suspense will have you on the edge of
your seat.
Thanks and enjoy,
Tom
