This movie is terribly offensive. Did the people who made this movie actually believe in this movie or did they just make it for a quick buck because they knew a few people would be fooled into watching it since Dracula 2000 was such a hit? I'm offended because I was fooled into this since I liked Dracula 2000 and was hoping this would have somewhat the good acting and scenes as 2000 did but 3000 had nothing like that. This movie is a disgrace. And all they asked in the beginning was 'what is a vampire?' are you telling me no one will know in the future what a vampire is even if the myth has reached great fame in our time in the media? Please. This movie was a joke.

Is this how modern vampire films are ending up like- a good sounding plot that ends up crumbling in the first twenty minutes with a few lousy jokes about sex and drugs to keep us awake in disgust? This movie could not have been taken seriously when being made and that's a shame because the plot sounded interesting and if taken seriously it could have been a good film possibly but obviously nowadays vampire films are seen as just more film to add in sex jokes and lame actors who need money fast. How sad. Good vampire films are hard to come by these days...
