Clearly Mariann has far too much time on her hands. She could me more usefully employed training rabbits to swim or something. Me? I enjoyed this cracking camp romp through the desert. Having spent large tracts of my childhood watching my socks and sandals father puring boiling water from an old grey whistling kettel (cf. Basil Brush - The Whistling Kettle and the something Cat - anyone? Somebody/ Somewhere? No. just me and Lazzwell and Dazzwell under the mystic spell of the singing fox and his liquid gold tonsils then) on winged ants on the one day of the year when they sprung from the cracked concrete yard in our home, I have always had a soft spot for termites and so was drawn to the film before I'd seen a frame of its deliciously unwholesome horror pop shots. My children squealed with pleasure beside me while we watched it, but that's another story. A thoroughly enjoyable way to spend your time : I have seen this film three times now and thought the porducer was so hot I married her. Live a little? Live a lotto? take the plunge with Bonesnatcher : it's a grower, it's a growler, it's a groover. So long Mariann.
