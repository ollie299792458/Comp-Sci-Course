A film about blind justice and family loyalty, based on an interesting true story. Kenny (played skillfully by Sam Rockwell) is arrested for the murder of a local woman in rural Massachusetts, and his sister Betty Ann (Swank) devotes her life to learning law so that she can prove his innocence

I enjoyed the film, but there were three faults I would give it: 1.) the music at times turned to those straining, generic-drama strings that I feel detract from the emotional potential of the scene, 2.) the writing/direction is pretty contrived; many scenes play out as you would expect them to, 3.) there is a heart-breaking detail to the real Kenny's life that they decided to ignore, but I feel would have really made it an exceptional film. I wont say what it is, lest I give too much away, but it has to do with his death. Watch the film first, then look it up, you'll see what I mean.

Despite those complaints, there is one thing which makes this absolutely worth seeing: performances. Sam Rockwell is a tremendous talent, and seems to just get better and better. Watching his transformation in this movie, as he goes from care-free new dad to hopeless and depressed inmate was fascinating. I am convinced the man could play any role. Hilary Swank I was ambivalent about before, but she really impressed me here. Minnie Driver, Juliette Lewis and Peter Gallagher make a great supporting cast (poor Lewis though, she seems to always play the trashy character). My girlfriend laughed at first at the Eastern Mass. accents, but Ive spent time in Boston and I assured her, they werent exaggerating. Overall a good film, if a tad prosaic in its execution. Amazing story plus amazing performances equals a win.
