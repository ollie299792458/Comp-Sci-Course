After watching CGI werewolves in American Werewolf in Paris and Twilight's versions which were just very large dogs Dog Soldiers makes a refreshing change. The werewolves here are made up from excellent makeup, animatronics and actors in superb costumes. They are the most realistic werewolves I can remember. I would recommend viewers to watch the making of in the extras and be impressed with how the writer/ director, Neil Marshal, put this all together. As a bonus the fasr paced edge of the seat storyline was very well written with excellent characters and actors. Sean Pertwee (the son of the original Dr Who} is one of those jobbing actors who never turns in a bad performance. The rest of the cast support his effort. The editing and cinematography is all good. There is humor but it comes through the characters and never suffers from the usual gross out teenage humor portrayed in many horror movies today. The humor is British but don't let that put you off. It is all relevant to the characters and in moving the story along. Sit back and enjoy.
