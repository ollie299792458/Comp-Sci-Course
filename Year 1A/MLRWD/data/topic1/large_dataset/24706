Douglas Trumbull was given, along with a few other 'new talents,' a million dollars and no strings to make a movie in the early 1970s. This was an 'experiment' by the studios to see if an indie movie could produce big revenue. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002O7XWC">Easy Rider (35th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)</a> was what got this going. Trumbull had been the special effects supervisor on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001 - A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059POY">Candy</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008438U">The Andromeda Strain</a>.

Trumbull hired a decommissioned Air Craft Carrier from the Navy, a small group of actors, his father, and some friends and made this mini-classic. It is often called a 'cult' film, but it is much more than that. This was a 'message' movie that still resonates. Bruce Dern was given the opportunity to break out of his 'bad guy' persona here and really excels.

This is not the best SciFi movie ever made, but it is head and shoulders above the average. Interestingly enough despite the critical success of this film, Trumbull was rarely given an opportunity to direct again. He did do 'Brainstorm' in the early 1980s, but is mostly known for interactive 'rides' for which he has received little credit.
