For those of you who know Clint Eastwood primarily for his role as Dirty Harry, here is your chance to see him at his absolute finest as an actor and as a director.  Even if you're not necessarily a huge fan of westerns (can't say that I am either), this best of the best is a "must see".  I think the reason westerns were so popular in Hollywood is that the lawless anarchy of the wild west gives a truer glimpse into man's soul. Eastwood's character strolls into town in surreal fashion on horseback in a scene that kind of reminds me of Omar Sharif riding into view on a camel in Lawrence of Arabia. He saves a town spineless, self serving people that he disdains only to settle an old score. The layers of the plot are slowly pealed away throughout the film, keeping your attention until the very end.  The casting of characters is also outstanding, especially the bad guys and the newly anointed sheriff.  In typical Clint Eastwood style, the film also has plenty of memorable one line zingers.  Pop a big bag of popcorn and enjoy!
