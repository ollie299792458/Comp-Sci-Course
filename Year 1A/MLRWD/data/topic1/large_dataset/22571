Vin Diesel (Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black and A Man Apart) plays a sports junkie in this modern day James Bond Action Movie. When I say that Vin Diesel and James bond have alot in common in this movie I mean it. First of all we have the Gadget guy, there are so many weopons in that movie that are off James Bond, we have the girls (which James Bond is most Famous for), then we have the chief played by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction and Sephere)
This movie takes place when a group of terrorists called Anarchy 99 create a bomb called silent night, that is one of the most deadly bombs on the planet. It is up to Vin Diesel and his female sidekick to save the day.
Now If you enjoy James Bond movies then you will enjoy this movie. Parental Warning this movie contains a sex scene that is not that detailed and it runs for about 15 seconds and you just see this girl in her underwear dance on the bed then Vin Diesel come and slip her one. (Again just like James bond) then the action contains unrealistic stunts and non stop violence. I suggest this movie for any one over 12.
