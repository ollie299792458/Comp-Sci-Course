"Shall We Dance?" (2004) is a remake of the superb Japanese musical dance comedy which was released in the U.S. in 1997. This new version stars Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci. There's not a chance in the universe that this new version will be better than the Japanese classic, which was just about as perfect as any film has ever been, ever. But I'll definitely go to see the new one, only because it probably will be very enjoyable to compare the two versions, and any dance film is better than none. Plus I think I'll really enjoy the new one--it's just that I KNOW it could never approach the Japanese original, for many reasons. Sure, they'll try to adapt the screenplay to American customs and vernaculars, but many charming nuances of the original will be lost because it will not take place in Japan, and the original was really about how the Japanese are relating to something very Western and alien, ballroom dance. If you want, you can go to Hollywood.com and watch the preview to the new version. Just type in Shall We Dance? in the Search field. The preview is pretty good. I will enjoy the film, but I strongly urge you to buy a copy of the original "Shall We Dance?" here on Amazon, and also go to the "Shall We Dance?"(Japan) Amazon DVD page and vote to have it released on DVD. It's a crime this hasn't happened yet! (I gave this American version 4 stars, because I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, also based on the preview I saw).
