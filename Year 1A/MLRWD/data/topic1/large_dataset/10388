This movie is a true gem. What's amazing about it is its ability to attract and engage viewers with different cinematic preferences: from cinemaphils (those like "thinking" movies) to those who like movies that just offer a respite from constant thinking and analyzing or just don't feel the internal need to watch meaningful, non-formulaic films (99% of everything made in Hollywood), this movie packs a punch. Having said that, this movie would be more appealing to the first category of viewers due to the fact that its visuals and aesthetic are completely anti-Hollywood, not to mention that the movies comes with subtitles.
Most and foremost, it's a piercing psychological drama: a relatively young Czech couple who cannot have a baby go out of town for some summer rest where the husband while chopping wood makes a "doll" out of a tree stump that vaguely looks like a human baby. The man's wife develops maternal feelings for the stump and soon thinks it's her son, she names him Otik.

I don't want to give much of the plot out as it's something you have to see for yourself but I'll just say that soon supernatural comes into play (this is the point when the movie would also be of interest to general audience).

This film is a deeply psychological, surrealist work unlike anything you have seen before. I can almost guarantee that everyone who likes New Wave (French or Czech) and "thinking" movies is going to love this film.
