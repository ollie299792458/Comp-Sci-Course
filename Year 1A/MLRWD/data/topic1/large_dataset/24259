This film is about how the societal norms of the 1950's era at the Roman Catholic Church School 14 year old Ralph Walker attends continuously place obstacles and road blocks in the way in attempts to keep Ralph's spirit from his quest.  The topic of the film is universal and goes well beyond being another sports film.  Ralph goes against all of the obstacles put in front of him to achieve his desired goal of performing a miracle to get his mother out of a coma, or so he believes.  He begins running and eventually sets himself the goal of winning the Boston Marathon with only five to six months of training.  He not only inspires himself, but all of those around him, including the jaded Father Hibbert who becomes his coach.  He also inspires his friends, his classmates, and even the curmudgeonly Father Fitzpatrick.  This is a wonderful, touching film that engrosses you from beginning to end.

Along the way to Ralph Walker's goal, he experiences all of the little things that a typical 14 year old experiences when going from being a boy to a young man, including his "accident" in the pool, his first kiss, and other "venal" sins. He believing that, no matter what is in the way, the possibility of achieving his goal is to him ever present and ever possible.

Ralph is played by newcomer Adam Butcher, a young Canadian actor from Ontario.  He gives a commanding performance for this being his first film.  The ensemble cast works so smoothly together that one begins to forget that the story is fictional.  Kudos to a wonderful, inspiring film.
