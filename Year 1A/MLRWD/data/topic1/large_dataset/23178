This movie is just plain stupid--it's poorly written, makes no logical sense, doesn't know if it's a comedy or drama, and destroys the memory of a beloved classic (The Graduate). The premise is so wrong--that a woman will drop everything because her fiance questions why she was born 8 months after her parents married--that it's an insult to the viewer. Then they have the woman have sex at her first meeting with the man she thinks slept with her mom and grandma--hilarious!

There is nothing funny about this. The tone of the film flips back and forth like a light switch from syrupy love story to overplayed broad comedy, with a really bad music score trying to tell us when the serious parts are. To see the great acting talent wasted makes it even more of a crime.

This movie has no connection to The Graduate other than to misuse the characters and have them do things that make no sense in relation to the first film. It's a giant mess. Blame Rob Reiner for directing it, but most of the blame goes to the writer, who actually got paid for a movie that's basically one big misguided family sex joke.
