Ballykissangle is a series that follows the ups and down of a small beautiful town in Ireland. This series focuses on the final conclusion of Peter and Assumpta relationship and unfortunately it leaves much to be desired. Thank goodness for the supporting cast who delivers to the fullest in each episode which leave viewers who love the series wanting more and looking forward to series four? Episode eleven and twelve between Peter and Assumpta was poorly written and not to give away the plot, but after the drama that builds up from the previous episodes and series one and two (Which are excellent); the final conclusion was rushed and quite simply unmoving due to the fact that it leaves the viewers unfulfilled. From the research I have conducted the final plot was Dervla Kirwan inspiration. I speculate if there are any regrets on her part or that of Stephen Tompkinson. However, with Tina Kellegher, Tony Doyle, Peter Hanley, Gary Whelan, and Deirdre Donnelly is quite enough to make the purchase of this DVD and with anticipation series four, five and six, worthwhile!
