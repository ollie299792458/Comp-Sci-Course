First off, for fans of Raimi's Evil Dead films this is a must own. The sound and picture quality is excellent, so the film itself is well presented. What is lacking in the Blu-ray is suplimental material:
1) Digital Copy- I'm sure someone out there appreciates digital copy, but I don't have a use for it. I'm not going to watch a full movie on my ipod, and when watching a movie on my laptop it is just as easy to watch it on Blu-ray.
2) Production Video Diaries- It's about half an hour of brief behind the scenes moments. A more thorough doc would have been nice.
All that I ask for is a commentary and maybe a few deleted scenes. I guess we will have to wait for the anniversary edition.
As for the "Unrated" version, it only differs from the theatrical cut in alternate versions of two scenes.  **Spoiler: Christine's nose bleed becomes a bloody projectile regurgitation and her animal sacrifice also receives some extra blood. ** I assume that the versions of these scenes in the theatrical version were shot specifically to avoid R-rated territory. Fortunately, both versions of the film are presented here.
Final Words: The film gets an excellent HD treatment, and although it is lacking in supplemental material it would make a great addition to any Blu-ray collection.
