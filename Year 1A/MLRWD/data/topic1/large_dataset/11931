In an age when Hollywood can seem to do nothing original, and the Silver Screen is awash with remakes, it's nice to go back and revisit the artistry of which the film industry has made hash.

A tense psychological thriller, Play Misty for Me is the template from which the likes of Fatal Attraction sprang.

Clint Eastwood plays a terminally cool yet sensitive late night jazz DJ who, while estranged from girlfriend Donna Mills, has a one night stand with Jessica Walter.

As Walter's obsession with Eastwood grows, her violent emotions manifest themselves first against herself in a manipulative suicide attempt, and then against the others in Eastwood's life.

Edgy, hard, and oh, so seventies, the tension ramps smoothly with Walter's character's escalating psychosis until the final scene.

Eastwood's girlfriend tied up by Walters, the local police detective lying on the driveway with a pair of scissors stuck between his ribs, and a darkened cliffside house.  Eastwood is constantly attacked by Walters with a knife to the accompaniment of her maddened, and maddeningly effective, screams.

Finally, bloodied and exhausted, and in perhaps his least Eastwood-esque solution, he sends her through the french doors, and over the edge of the balcony to fall to the cold Pacific hundreds of feet below with a single punch.

Clint Eastwood as actor and director does a good job of making the characters believable and sympathetic.  Bravo.  Scenery and cinematography; Carmel at it's most beautiful.

Jim Bob says - Check it out; it's worth a night in a darkened living room with a bowl of popcorn, wondering whether or not your ex-girlfriend really meant what she said when you dumped her.
