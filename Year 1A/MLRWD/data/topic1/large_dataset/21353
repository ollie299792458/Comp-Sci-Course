Hellraiser, is a movie that you wouldnt wanna bring home for your kids to watch. It would give them nightmares for days. The 1st 2 were the best ones but after that it all just went down the drain. Clive Barker also went down there. He use to have good movies and books. Frank and Juila's parts werent so great though knowing that Frank had no skin then Juila had no skin in the second one. The second one the graphics were wrose, but the acting was still good. The second one should of been the 1st cause it tells how Pinhead got his pins and shows how they all use to be humans. The ending made no sense though it just threw me off. The part with the doctor and crazy man was very disterbuting to me. The little girl looked like a younger Fabio, but it was mean what the doctor made her do. Pinhead was known as one of the scariest horror people of all times. With only 6 hours of doing his makeup he became famous. the rest werent so know as famous though. The box also helped the movie become famous.
