Much to my suprise, I thought Robots was just going to be good. But, it's much more than that. It's a wild and crazy adventure through Rodney Copperbottom's trip to Robot City.

Ewen Mcgregor was good. He wasn't the best one, but he was good. I think he played Rodney a little too dramatic in the Big Weld scene, and that's what threw me off a bit with him.

Robin Williams, however, was a hoot as Fender! He, as always, probably improvised with a lot of things. He did such a great job when he was "singing in the oil". Not to mention, he sang for help two times. Now that kicks!

Amanda Bynes was very cute as the little sister, Piper. She sounded so relaxed, and that was what made her character shine.

The animation was just like any other CGI film, except for two amazing scenes. The scene where Rodney and Fender are in that bubble type car just is amazing! It looks like it could be a ride itself! And, the Big Weld domino scene was really cool too. It made the shape of Big Weld, and not to mention, it looked like an ocean, and it sure was!

I really enjoyed this movie. Every single character played a funny role, which I liked. Some minor role point-outs were Al Roker as the mailbox, and Paul Giamatti as Tim, the gate guard of Big Weld Industries. All in all, I'd give this a solid B+. After all this praising you may ask, why did she give a B+? Well, I thought The Incredibles kicked butt, so I guess it's down there with Ice Age and stuff.

By the way, this to the kid who judged the movie on its bad poster and trailer: YOU probably look bad too! Oh let's see..the horrible shoes, the shirt! Ugh! (Heh heh)
