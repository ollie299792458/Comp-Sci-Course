This is a really good little film. It had an incredibly limited release in the cinema here so I missed it. A big shame as it would have only made it better. It is an excellent movie & I highly recommend it. America tends to ruin a lot of horror movies and goes for the same old tired story lines. Thank god for foreign produced films. This is a brilliant quirky film about an Evil Santa. A group of Americans go to Finland where they believe the actual Santa Claus is buried & of course they want to dig him up. What could possibly go wrong???

This was a very interesting take on a Christmas tale. The ending however was totally brilliant and I practically fell off my chair. I LOVED IT. Very cheeky!! American movies never have anything this original happening at the end, they would ruin it by rehashing the same old schlocky crap as always. This was the best ending to a horror film I have seen in ages.

This is not the type of horror film that has monsters with fangs constantly jumping out at everyone and constant blood baths. This has a lot of suspense and drama slowly building up and it is very well done. When the monsters in the film do come out, it is worth the wait.

Do yourself a favour and get it now!!!
