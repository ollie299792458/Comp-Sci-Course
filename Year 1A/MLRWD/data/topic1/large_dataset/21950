This movie is a must see if you want to see the best two tap dancers that have ever lived. Very good story with lots of interesting skits. Fred Astaire & Elanor Powell are just incredible! She is very often called the queen of tap dancers. The rehearsals these two went through are a legend alone. Remember there was no digital editing back in the years when these movies were filmed. If you made a mistake, you did it until it was right!

I saw my first Fred Astaire movie Holiday Inn and was hooked. Elanor Powell was the only tap dancer that could ever equal Fred.

Do yourself a favor and watch this gem! The floor that they danced on for the finale had to be built by MGM. No other contractor thought it could be built. It encompassed almost 5,000 square feet, and was made entirely of black glass.

Black and white was just made for this movie. It would never compare if it was in color!!

Fred Astaire had some other wonderful partners, Cyd Charise, Rita Hayworth, Leslie Caron, and of course Ginger Rogers.

Lost of wonderful Cole Porter songs. Hope you enjoy this Gem!!
