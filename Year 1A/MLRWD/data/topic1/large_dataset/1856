This should be required viewing for anyone who appreciates animation as an art.  The hand-drawn work put into this would be astounding in any age, and is more so in our age of over-hyped 3D spectaculars.  Add to that a very well choreographed sound track.  Some critics fault the lack of plot development and character development, but I feel it is just fine the way it is.  In the end its all about the race to the finish.  The rest can be left to one's imagination to determine what motivates them / why they are there.

The main reason I posted this review is to recommend that my fellow english speakers NEED to see the dubbed version.  Many english-speaking anime fans I know can be very purist with their attitude toward sub-titled versus dubbed viewing.  I must agree I've heard some awful dubbed work, and some can be down-right painful to listen too.  Also the differences between subs and dubs can be quite funny.  That said, the dub of Red Line is well done in my opinion.  I'm not the quickest reader in the world, but I was amazed after watching the dub how much detail I had missed the first time viewing the sub because I was too busy reading.  This movie is a visual feast.  Some might find it a stretch of a comparison, but I was reminded of the first time I saw Heavy Metal.

So get it, pop some popcorn, kick back, shut your brain off and enjoy. :)
