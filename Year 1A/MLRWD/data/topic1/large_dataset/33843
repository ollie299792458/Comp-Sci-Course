This film is simply the greatest masterpiece EVER of surrealist cinema. Among the admirers of this great work of art are Picasso, Jung, Dali.

The film raises the question: What is beauty?

The answer suggested is the artist's eternal response -- beauty is inseparable from the imagination of its proponent and its recipient, which makes it a moral as well as an aesthetic quality. Hence, the three sources of the Beast's magic power in the movie: the rose (his love), the mirror (the "canvas" of the screen/camera), and the white horse (the imagination that transports the creative artist and audience members to an alternate reality -- which is the work of art).

In the end, the "Beast" is not only the most truly beautiful character of all, but the determining power in this cinematic world, for his magic is the total power of the imagination. The film director, then, plays the same role for the audience as the "Beast" does for "Beauty." The role of "Beauty" is, in fact, played by the viewer of this film. The viewer is seduced by the director's dreams and images that he or she is asked to share -- and thereby, to alter, as the darkened cinema becomes the Beast's enchanted castle.

This movie was the inspiration for Disney's less successful animated effort. Don't miss it.
