Today, I went out to the local video store and purchased GREASE on DVD at a very low price and yours truly is now delighted to own this long awaited film on DVD.
I was delighted and disappointed by the films release on DVD.  First off, this film is just a rehash of the 1998 VHS release which was the disappointment.  ....
Despite the disappointments, there are many delightful things to say about the DVD release.  I love the packaging.  This film is available in Widescreen (2.35:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) editions...  This film is packaged like a book (like the Panic Room) with the disc inside with a GREASE Songbook, which I though was a real hoot.  I have always wanted the lyrics to all ot most of the songs from the film....
With this film being finally available on DVD, the menu board and scene selction and audio options are quite basic.  The film on Widescreen or Fullscreen are presented in top notch sound and picture quality with not much dirt or dust to be found.  The sound could have been better cause it was a bit loud and scratchy at times when it didn't need to be.  There are cast and cast interviews originally contained in the 1998 VHS release and of course, the theatrical trailer which was exciting to watch.
In conclusion, GREASE is greatly welcomed on DVD with its great packaging and available feautures but this DVD deserved much more extra feautures than what was put in here.  Otherwise, run out and get your copy of GREASE today.
GREASE is forever the word !!!
