i started using this tape when i was in highschool and the results are amazing. this is the period when most of us girls wanna lose our "babyfat" and this workout not only does that but it energizes you and really tones your body. i admit that this workout looks easy at first but when you actually do it you'll really feel your whole body being worked to the max!! i hear alot of bad review about this tape being unsafe and dangerous to your body parts but like any exercise you do if you don't do it properly or you exceed your physical capabilites than you'll get injured just the same. trust me it's not her moves you just have to do it right! bottom line i highly recommend this for anyone looking to lose weight and keeping it off, toning problem areas or just to be in shape. i am now in my last year of college and recently bought the dvd version of the next challenge because i love it that much! trust me just turn the tv down and put your own  music on once you know whats coming up and you won't get tired of it.  it's one of the few workouts out there that really challenge you everytime you do it.  Just try it you'll love it!!
