i would just like to say that this a epic grim world fairy

tale.  Set in a world of people seeming to do everything to

 survive. There are only a few that must follow what  ever they

 belive in even if it means there own death (like one of the

biggest John Wayne Fans ever).  this journey of one man and a

russian boy is is the most twisted thing i have ever seen.  I

would like to pointout that it is twisted in a good way.  It

seems that tons of the scenes are so gory and over the top that

the director wants you to watch them with one eye closed.  It

is cinamatically brillant with its rewinds and look backs it

seems like we are always getting more than we bargin for.  Alot

of people are saying that all Wayne Kramer does is use evey

cheap trick in the book but i beg to differ to me it seems as

if he reinvents them. Tou can tell he loves movies and has

giant respect for them.  That is why i was dissapointed at the

extras.  It seems like they put all there time into the movie.

I will personally wait for the special edition which i can only

hope will be breathtaking.  I also am getting mad at the people

comparing him to Quetin Tarantio.  While he does great work

also it is like comparing apples to oranges or comparing this

to the cooler.  Another Must see by the way.  So all in all

this is a must by but you should wait for the special edition
