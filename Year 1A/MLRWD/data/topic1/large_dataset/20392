Woolf's Orlando is the story of a young nobleman  of the Elizabethan Age, who by a mysterious quirk  of Fate is allowed to experience the pains and privileges of both genders.  The fascinating story is at times poetic, at times verbose, but always fascinating.  The reader witnesses Orlando's transformation from a sixteenth-century man to a twentieth-century woman; by employing the stream-of-consciousness  technique, the androgynous protagonist's secret dilemmas and longings are clearly enunciated.  By the conclusion of the novel, Woolf's stance on the matter of gender is obvious: whether the trappings  of Orlando be taffeta or leather, the personality is the same.
 Woolf wrote during a period which did much to shun the traditional sex-barriers; rather than joining  the hoardes of suffragettes or their opposing army of conservatives, she crafted a philosophy which  effortlessly combined the two.  Women are not superior to men, nor are they weaker; both sexes are inherently equal; more than that, one cannot differentiate between the two.  We are the same.  We are all members of humanity, and that bond is enough to surpass the  role played by gender.  Woolf is begging us not to  label our neighbor as a "man" (complete with all that  word connotes), for to do so would be to divide mankind with an imaginary line.  Look to yourself and your friends merely as a person, for the soul can never change.
