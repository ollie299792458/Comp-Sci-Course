There's no question about it.  Paul Brownstein is the best producer of DVD boxed sets in the industry and he's proved it once again with PERRY MASON: THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which includes twelve episodes (featuring future stars like Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, James Coburn, and Burt Reynolds) and is loaded with special features that, on their own, are well worth the purchase price. The extras include the original audition/screen tests for Hamilton Burger and Perry Mason, two Charlie Rose interviews with Raymond Burr, and a late 1950s episode of "Person to Person" in which Burr gives viewers a tour of his L.A. home. As if that wasn't enough, they've also got interviews, featurettes, and the "Perry Mason Returns" TV movie (I wish they'd included an episode from "The New Perry Mason," starring Monte Markham) If you you're a TV geek like me, you're going to love it.  I also strongly recommend his amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUYI">Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection, Volumes 1 & 2</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WFY4S">The Dick Van Dyke Show - The Complete Series</a>  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ERVJKO">The Wild Wild West - The Complete First Season</a>.
