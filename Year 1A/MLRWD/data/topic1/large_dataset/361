I have two topics to mention: The "special features" and the "image quality".

It is worth noting that I own the both the original Gattaca DVD and Super-Bit version for comparison.

1) Special Features:
While maintaining the original DVD's ugly menu system, this edition contains a 22 featurette on the making of Gattaca with interviews of Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and a number of the production crew.  I enjoyed this addition.  There is also a new clip on gene manipulation (history, current, and future) which was somewhat interesting.

2) Image Quality:
The original DVD was only a single layer 4.5gb disk, which resulted in a grainy image with a slightly blue tint.  The Super-Bit disk was disappointingly mastered, with visible dust and hair in the copy.  The Super-Bit version took on a more natural tone but suffered from over-saturated browns and greens.

Finally, this reproduction seems to have a good balance between color and image quality, although some scenes are a little grainy and the movie overall seems darker.

Conclusion:
Is it worth buying this edition if you have one of the others?  Probably not, but with the HD format wars over, I might be inclined to splurge on a Blu-Ray player to give the new Blu-Ray Gattaca disk a spin.
