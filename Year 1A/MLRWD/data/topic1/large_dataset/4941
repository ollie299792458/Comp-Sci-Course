I have the 2003 Kino restoration and absolutely love it.  The 2010 Kino restoration is to include additional footage found in 2008.  It's a very symbolic silent film that is so applicable to today - the "haves" and "have nots," the working man, the corporate bosses, and so on.  I saw a version of Metropolis on cable (USA) and that version was supposed to have the original orchestral score with it.  It makes a world of difference in watching it.  I've looked long and hard to find this version because other versions had the wrong music - some about listening to "happy, cheerful" music and watching a serious scene just doesn't cut it - or was just a poor quality.  The Kino restoration has the original score.  The effects used were pretty good considering the time.  Sure it's not CGI, but I'm not sure CGI would have the same impact if it was used.  The latest restoration will not be available until later this year and, yes, I will be getting that version.  That version is being show around the country now.  Go to the Kino website for details.
