This is a good well acted fun suspense movie with a scarily real message, "be careful who you trust" I dont just mean on foreign soil but ANYWHERE your not familiar with, as people can have ulterior motive anytime, anywhere. Thats the message of this movie I believe and its presented in a chilling and at times ( although NOTING like Hostel etc) brutal way. What we have here is a group of likeable fun characters who just want to have fun, fighting to survive against a macabre set up by some locals in the area they have happened upon. This movie in no way dserves so many one star reviews, I mean a movies sole purpose is to entertain..this movie entertained... so much so you want your group of characters to survive and get home safely, rather than create people so unlikeable you're praying for that machete to fall asap! Im glad I decided to ignore the trashing of this movie and go with my gut feeling which was : with a beautiful scenary, great actors and actresses ( melissa George, always a pleasure) and a chillingly plausible plot, that a good movie was sure to come out of it. And...it did. i'd give it a go...although gore hounds expecting a HOSTEL rerun, please think again, its not the director, actor or writers fault that this movie was presented to theatres and marketed in such a way!!!!!!!!!!
