I've heard 'Life As A House' called a pathetic attempt at recreating classics like American Beauty and Terms of Endearment but in all honesty I must say I cannot see it. This is a beautiful movie and the acting is incredible. I've always been a fan of Kevin Kline and his incredible versatility but he earns my respect and admiration in the role of George. A middle aged retrenched architect who has discovered he has little time to live. In an effort to make amends with his estranged son before his death he takes him for the summer in hopes that while building a house together they might also build a relationship. 
Kline shines in this role, a very different role but worthy of recognition. His sarcastic, yet touching delivery creates a wonderful and relatable character that appeals to the senses. But the real star is Hayden Christensen. A bit of a dissapointment in star wars I adored him in this film. Perhaps the stifling role of the man who would become Darth Vader and the pressure of living up to Fan Expectations has diminished his ability to make the role his own. But there is no such stigma in house. His work is honest fresh and appealing. The raw emotion and hurt of his character is believable and heart breaking. I must confess to being in tears for at least an hour during this film. The absolute chemistry between Kline and Christensen and also Christensen and much matured Jena Malone makles this an enjoyable film for anyone and I highly recommend it.
