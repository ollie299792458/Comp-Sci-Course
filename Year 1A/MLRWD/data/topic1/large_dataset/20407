Do not get me wrong, the matches in this dvd are EXCELLENT. When I first saw the match listing, I noticed a rather glaring omission of The Sandman and New Jack, 2 ECW Legends. Why wouldn't people like that be on the dvd..........

THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR THE MUSIC RIGHTS!

That's right! I noticed something terribly off with the music while watching it and it hit me last night. They put other music over the wrestlers' normal entrance tunes. So with that approach, you will never get all the matches you should on a dvd like this. The WWE needs to not be so cheap and do a PROPER ECW dvd. Since I've noticed that, it totally killed the experience for me. I want RVD coming out to "Walk" not whatever crap they put over it. I want New Jack throwing a garbage can full of weapons in the ring with "Natural Born Killers" blasting. I want The Sandman stumbling to the ring with "Enter Sandman" blaring the whole time. This is sacrilegious to ECW's legacy giving it this treatment. It, and the fans, deserve much better.
