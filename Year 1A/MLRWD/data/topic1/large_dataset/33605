I saw the movie in theaters when it was originally released(I'm 38). When I bought the initial Blu-ray release, I was hugely disappointed with the picture quality. The film grain was ridiculous and I honestly don't remember it being that bad even those many years ago when I saw it in the theater. The colors seemed washed out, nothing stood out to me that it was "high def". It seemed more like a badly upscaled dvd. The grain was so much of a distraction that once I viewed the entire movie I promptly sold it to a local mom and pop video store.

Bought the Ultimate Hunter Edition at Walmart tonight for $15. Now this is a huge improvement imo of the picture quality. I can see beads of sweat, skin pores, details on leaves, individual whiskers, everything is crisp and crystal clear with deep colors and no more annoying film grain. The jungle scenes are detailed and crisp. Nothing seems "off" with the picture to my eyes(beyond 20/20 vision )

It all comes down to a matter of taste obviously. I'm happy with my purchase. Your mileage may vary.

Hey and I got a $10 movie money voucher good towards "Predators" as well.
