After I ran out of zombie movies to watch and review, I decided to watch Stake Land.
I loved it.  Good camera work, good scenery, good acting and the movie flowed.
We have a vampire hunter called Mister who is teaching a teenage boy how to survive
in a world that has been over-run with vampires that are slow and stupid for the most part.
The sun kills them, stakes kill them, and the really bad ones have to be spiked in the brain.
The gore factor was high and realistic looking.  The pair are traveling to a place in Canada called
"New Eden" where rumors tell of a settlement of survivors living well.  They pick up others on
their way to New Eden. Some really bad people called "The Brotherhood" have a large territory
our team has to drive through and survive.  These guys are worse than the vampires!
I am not going to spoil the movie for you.  If you like zombie movies, you will find that this
movie about vampire undead is a new twist on a vampire saga.  If you like the Twilight series, you
may find this movie disappointing because the vampires are stupid and savage.  Our hero team do
not have Buffy powers, either.  Enjoy!
