I'll make this brief.  This is one of the best biographical

movies I've ever seen, on the large or small screen!  Very well

written, engrossing, uplifting, sad, funny and just plain great.

All of the actors portraying the Tempts are fantastic, including

the "original five" and then Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, etc.

The musical numbers are very well performed and directed with

lots of verve.  Some of the songs are the original recordings,

some are new recordings that sound very very much like the

real group.  I was particularly moved by the actor who played

Melvin Franklin, who seemed like the real "softie" of the group.

He appears to have had a huge heart and a real spirit.  Also

amazing was Leon as David Ruffin.  Just a blazing performance.

But all of the guys were wonderful.  If you are remotely inter-

ested in what we used to call Soul Music and its origins, I

highly recommend this colorful, engaging film.  ONE NOTE:  If

you saw this on TV and were concerned that some footage was cut

for the DVD, fear not.  It is complete and in tact.  The box

says "150 minutes", but it's actually around 175 minutes, just

short of 3 hours.  ENJOY!
