Savannah is lush and plush. I used to hang out at the clubs, parks, Greyhound Station and cemetery during my overnight layovers when I was a Train Attendant on Amtrak's "Palmetto" from Washington, DC to Savannah in the late 80's and early 90's. There was an active male prostitute and drug business in the beautiful squares after dark. Drunk students from the art college weaved in and out of the downtown clubs and gangs of horny black gay brothers were always cruising about. The best bar-b-q and fried fish were sold at a greasy spoon near the Howard Johnson Lodge where the train crew stayed...and the naughty projects were close by. I was devastated when a new contract moved us out of the city into a highway motel catering to truckers. At least there was a Piggly Wiggly Supermarket - which taxed grits and grocery - in a nearby strip mall. I used to jog through another housing project across the street.

Many of the scenes in this movie are familiar, but there should have been more - like SCAD and the old Central of Georgia train station which hosted the legendary "Nancy Hanks" streamliner Miss Charlotte rode to and from Atlanta. I can just see her sipping a mint julep in the all-white segregated parlour car as the train breeezes by black bodies hanging from the poplar trees. Savannah - like Charleston and New Orleans - is a true Southern Belle.

Is Kevin Spacey gay? Spacey looks and acts so much like his gay character (Jim Williams) that my gaydar blows up during all his scenes. Jim's eyes light up like a Christmas tree whenever John Cusack appears. Is Spacey merely in character or is he simply overcome by Cusack's boyish beauty? Cusack is no great actor but he possesses a cute baby face and a matin&eacute;e idol appeal that celebrity worshipers adore. His naive appeal obviously turns Lady Chablis on.  In fact, Cusak and Miss Thang make a perfectly odd beautiful couple as they stroll out of the black d&eacute;butante ball - arm in arm - "for a drink" at "her" place.
