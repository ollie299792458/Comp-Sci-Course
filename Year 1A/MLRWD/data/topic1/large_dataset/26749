A surprisingly smart film on the subject of romance and sexual desire, and one featuring some of the most honest conversations on the subjects thereof. With appreciable elements of Louie Malle's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WLMOLE">My Dinner with Andre: The Criterion Collection</a>" and Whit Stillman's three interconnected works from the mid-1990s, (including "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C8Q9KK">Metropolitan: The Criterion Collection</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y71N">Barcelona</a>", and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AFX53M">The Last Days of Disco: The Criterion Collection</a>"), Mike Nichols' "Carnal Knowledge" is a film that seems to trust its audience; and, when released theatrically in 1971, was willing to gamble that audiences were ready to enjoy extended scenes of intimate conversation that would play in lieu of intimate action. Nichol's was right, and though the film was not a commercial success, it lives this day as a film one may view alone, or with several members from the Metropolitan Opera's production of Verdi's "La Gazza Ladra."

Lost, forgotten, or a victim of disinterest, this film has been unfairly overlooked among the fine works of The Mike Nichols Collection for too long. And fouler the insult, "Carnal Knowledge" truly owns some of the finest moments of acting, short in length though they may be, that I have ever seen. These moments are sometimes quiet . . often very intimate. They consisting of frank and earnest discussions of vastly varying volumes concerning what it is that ignites the fire that so well begins a passionate relationship, and what it might be that slowly corrupts and turns this wonderful, maddening passion into cruelty and contempt.

On some less fundamentally important perspectives, Ann Margaret has never looked more beautiful--in fact, the notion of feminine beauty, the rationale for copulation, has never been more explicable, than here, in this film. If you are apt to appreciate the early works of author Milan Kundera, this film will fit you rather well, and if you're a fan of Mike Nichols' earlier work, "Carnal Knowledge" might--might--offer some answers as to why a pair the likes of George and Martha of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045HCJ94">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</a>" ever found one another.

"Carnal Knowledge" is a smart and sexy film, featuring an ensemble of clever people speaking with other clever people about things that matter. The film first stirs your attention, and then draw you in. With remarkable performances by Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen; and one transcendent performance by Ann-Margret, you come to care for these characters; you wish, for reasons various and, on occasion, unmentionable, to be part of the sensational and stirring action. This film is unlike any American films being made today; and that fact, together with its inherent greatness, makes this film so very precious, and such a joy to watch.
