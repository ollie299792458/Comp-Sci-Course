Imagine my surprise to find that no one has posted a review on what has to be one of the best Vampire movies ever made!  Gasp choke HACK!  Argh all better!  Near Dark. First of all, its got a great cast, which ranges from "Wild" Bill Paxton and Lance Henrickson to the very creepy Joshua Miller. Some of the other actors are not as lively, but all give a good run. There is a prize for spotting the police officer who has a bit of a walk on (Warning: Prize may not actually exist.)

Overall, this movie delivers. At times its so dark that you can feel your skin moving, and in others its funny enough to make you spray popcorn into your drink. Some really good one-liners add zest to some excellent quality dialogue. For all the Interview with the vampires fans out there, check out the close similiarity between the "old man" and Claudia. One is much creepier than the other!

The only down side of the movie is the ending.  I will not spoil it for those who might be persuaded to enjoy this movie, but it is a little silly. Overall, it does not ruin the movie, just stopped it from getting more stars.  Certain things to look out for are, the fire scene, nightclub fun with spurs and the vampire method of car improvement.

There is very little I can say that is bad about this movie. Its got great violent scenes, with heaps of blood and bits, and the characters never head into that whole "immortality is so draining, I feel the urge to get all pale and interesting and hang out in art galleries." Not all vampires are new age homo erotic types with a goth fixation. Some just travel around killing to survive and having lots of fun! This is the sort of gun toting vampires who would make Dracula give up Mina to go on the road in America!
