I own this movie on the 4-disc Director's Cut DVD and loved it so much that I had to own the Blu-ray edition. Though it has no special features, the movie rocks! Inserted the disc into my PS3 connected on my Samsung 63" plasma and watched it on full HD 1080p running @ 60fps, meanwhile kicking the audio on my Bose Lifestyle 12, 5.1 Dolby Digital system. The clarity of the picture and sound is way beyond the experience of watching the same on a DVD format.

I know some people have taken off stars for stating that this movie is inaccurate. In my opinion, this movie does not portray all Crusades as savages. The storyline though centered at Balian, offers much more depth between the other characters of the movie. Saladin is portrayed as merciful and powerful king but then King Baldwin is also shown as a powerul yet peaceful ruler  who tried to hold peace and harmony within the Holy land, even if it means punishing christian radicals by death. The terms between the two kings after the battle at hattin is one of the best parts of the movie. The directors cut does offer much more than the theatrical release hence gives the viewer more understanding and depth of the whole movie.

If I was to have my top 5 epic movies, this is definitely on top of the list followed by:

2. Braveheart
3. Gladiator
4. Troy
5. King Arthur/300

Again, can't say more about this movie, give this one a chance if you were disappointed by the theatrical release. And if you have blu-ray, this one is definitely one to go on a collection at a great price.

Thanks Amazon!
