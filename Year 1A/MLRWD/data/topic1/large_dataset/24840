Oh my, this was funny, sad, thought provoking and an all around great movie. Take four couples who have totally different styles of marriage, throw them together for a weekend in the mountains and watch the work begin. Even though there are big name actors/actresses in this movie, I didn't see them as that, I saw four couples working hard to stay connected (well, actually it was three couples, but don't want to spoil the story). Seeing the different interactions made me realize that relationships are unique and no one has the right to judge whether a couple should be together or not. Only the two people in the relationship can determine that. I truly appreciated how the story line showed that being together requires respect, hard work, laughter, forgiveness and honest communication. The fact that each of these people were able to look beyond the outside of their partner and see the person inside was heartening.  Highly recommend this movie especially to anyone in a serious relationship. Well done Mr. Perry.
