Yes, Alan Reed, the voice behind Fred Flinstone plays the convict that Holly sees on a regular basis. This is the only movie I know of where Mr. Reed has a part, though probably there are others. I finally got to watch this movie a few months ago when my wife rented it from the library. Had always wondered what the big deal was about, especially since I grew up in NYC during the 1960's and never really saw an Audrey Hepburn flick before. Also have always like composer Henry Mancini's "Moon River". This movie was also mentioned on Seinfeld, the episode where George tried to cheat on his book club by watching the video instead at some strange family's house. The NYC locations, dress, look and feel of that era bought back memories of my own childhood. Being of Asian descent, I am deeply offended by the Mickey Rooney character, Holly's Japanese landlord , a negative totally not PC stereotype with his beady eyes, coke bottle glasses, bucked teeth and phony Asian accent who adds nothing to the story and film. If not for this demeaning, senseless, and insulting character I would have given this movie 5 stars and given it as a gift to my older sister. Hepburn does justice to all the acclaims and George Peppard looks really great in his pre "The A Team" days. Other than that I would also have to say that the wild party is the best part of the movie. The ending scene with the cab ride, Paul, Holly, her cat and the rain is also touching and very warm.
