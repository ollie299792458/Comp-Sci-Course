Every once in awhile there comes a movie that touches you and makes you feel good for having seen it. For me that movie is Little Women. I have never read the book before and I had never seen some sort of other movie adaptation. So when I approached Little Women I was a little skeptical of it being a sappy "chick flick" that I would hate. Of course it was a "chick flick" but I didn't really hate it. In fact I enjoyed it but there were things that annoyed me. Mostly it was the character of Jo (Winona Ryder). From what I have read she is supposed to be "fiery", but I think she came off as whiney and annoying. Winona played Jo well but I think that the character is lame. The other actors did a great job playing their parts but I thought that the young Amy (Kirsten Dunst) was a little unrealistic at some points. The movie is basically about the growing up of a small New England family during the Civil War period. It shows the characters from when they are about teens until they grow up and get married. Of course during this time period many things happen that test the will of all of the characters and threatens to split everyone up. I would hate to give anything away since this movie is great. It isn't difficult to follow and the characters (for the most part) are loveable. You feel all of the happiness and sadness as they go through their lives. This is a great movie, but there are some small flaws here and there that hinder it quite a bit. I would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.
