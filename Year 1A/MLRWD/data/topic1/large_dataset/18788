This movie really brought the series to a new phase. The documentary idea was great. What is Freddy Krueger is real? This film was great showing many New Line Cinema employees, past cast members like Tuesday Knight(Nightmares 4 and 5, and original members like Nick Corri and John Saxton. This movie would be nothing without Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp and the addition of Miko Hughes. Miko played "Dylan" very well. Also past negative reviews on this page say that there was not enough gore, well this film was not intended for a high body count. If ther was a high amount of gore, the film would have not been good and would be labalized as another Freddy pointless plot killing spree. I don't think that is what Wes Craven was after. I think he wanted to focus on adults that as teens grew up with the original "Nightmare", but are now adults and Parents now. Overall this movie was the second scariest of the set, just behind the original. I suggest this film to everyone. Thank you Wes Craven.
