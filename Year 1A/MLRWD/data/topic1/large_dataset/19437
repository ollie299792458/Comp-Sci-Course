This movie is actually pretty good for a [Disney] sequel i know that usually the sequel has to be vast more better than it's predecessor... this one isn't but it is still good. I personally hate Disney sequels and i had no intention of even watching this one; but my stepdad bought it for my little sister and i swear she watched it at least 5 times a day! and she watched it so much i learned the lines to this movie by just hearing it accross the room! so last night i finally asked her to let me watch her peter pan movie with her and she got really happy i was blown away with:
 -----how they pick up were they left off on Peter Pan
 -----the animation is pretty good compared to other disney sequels (i.e. return of jafar)
 -----the music is pretty good (jonatha brooke) C' mon someone complained about the music here but it is 2002 and the first was in the 1950's so we have to be up to date w/ our music soundtracks
 ----- all of the characters almost have the same voices i personally did not find a voice that didn't match.
 ----- the plot dosen't suck compared to the other poor excuse disney sequels, that's why i guess it was released in theatres
the only think that left me bugged was the inexplicable disapearence of the tick tock crocodile?..... but fear not he was repleaced by a super funny "tick tock" octopus that i personally found really hilarious!
so above all this is a very nice movie for all ages, very clean and descent for a sequel (again) i reccomend it if you wonder what ever happened after peter pan left wendy and the boys at their window...
so i am going to buy this movie before it is too late (jan 31 is the last shipment) and add it to my Disney DVD collection!
