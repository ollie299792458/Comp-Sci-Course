One of the things I love about this franchise is the evil and darkness surrounding the legacy of the box. The first few films effortlessly captured this premise but after the 3rd Installment " Hell On Earth" the films lost their momentum. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Hellraiser fan and Deader does have some amazing moments, but overall it was a disappointment. I was hoping to see more of Pinhead and the Cenobites but he only shows up for a total of three brief scenes. Doug Bradley is just phenomenal as Pinhead and I just feel like this movie doesn't give him justice at all being the amazing actor he is!!

Anyway, the acting and dialogue were pretty good in the movie and the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie was truly amazing! I loved the train-turned-club scene and Pinhead captivated me as always.

  But the story lacks the depth and consistency of the earlier installments that made me fall in the love with Hellraiser. Not to mention that the ending is absolutely DREADFUL! Overall though, it makes for a good watch.  But if you're a die-hard Hellraiser fan, prepare to be disappointed...

Other than that...check it out!!!
