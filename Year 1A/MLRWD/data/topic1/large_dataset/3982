Arnold Schwarzenegger hasn't made many films much better than this one. Neither has John McTiernan. Yes it's stupid, but it's fun. Sit back and let the bullets fly and the blood flow in an orgy of male machismo. Deft one-liners and nice 80's action movie clich&eacute;s are in abundance, but we shouldn't knock it, sometimes that's all we want from a movie.
If you don't know the story, then I would like to be the first to welcome you back from whatever planet it is you have been on (I don't mean that in a cruel way, but come on, everyone has seen this!) anyway, a crack squad of soldiers is sent in to retrieve a diplomat from the South American jungle and they end up being stalked by some kind of... Predator. I'm sure you'll read the other reviews and synopsis so I won't go any further.
In conclusion, this film is really fun, and the disc is adequate, if you are looking solely for sound quality and picture quality. If, however, you are after special features then I recommend a visit to Amazon.co.uk (but only worth a look if you can play region 2 DVD's) and you will be able to pick up the special edition (a 2-disc set with special features!)
