HBO has produced an excellent film that will have staying power for years to come.  I wish there could be more output of this quality on TV, rather than garbage like "The Five People You Meet in Heaven."  Films do not require violence to be good (is anyone listening at the studios??)

  Alan Rickman transforms himself from a Brit to a Southerner without a hitch, and we are all the luckier for it.  This excellent actor manages to walk that fine line between the admiration for a black colleague's abilities and the accepted racism of the time.  Rickman's Alfred Blaylock is neither a villain nor a saint.  He is a brilliant doctor whose motives are focused solely on the benefit of the patient.  Mos Def also does an excellent job of portraying Vivian Thomas, a man with hopes and aspirations who, like Blaylock, is well aware of the restrictions of the era.  The two of them make the most of their working relationship in spite of the black/white issues in the 1930s-1960s.  Thank goodness these two, along with Dr. Taussig, managed to break down barriers to save blue babies.  This is a top-quality film, and you'll do well to have it in your collection.  It's a film for the thinking person.
