The beautiful Leelee Sobieski will steal your heart early in this cinematic epic. The compassion and forcefulness she portrays as Joan of Arc is unmatched. This film moves along well, its integrated continuity of suspense and action will not let you leave your seat, and the dramatic intensity of the story will take you back in time. Even though you know how the story ends, you will find yourself yearning for, and even hoping, that the last minute rescue attempt succeeds.

A Featurette on the DVD about the making of the film explains the extraordinary care and in-depth research by the screenwriters to ensure historical accuracy. Filmed by choice in the Czech Republic for its geographic similarity to medieval France, filming took place in several medieval castles. This cinematic version of "Joan of Arc" is the kind you will want to watch again and again. Lastly, you will want to have a box of tissues on hand before viewing.
