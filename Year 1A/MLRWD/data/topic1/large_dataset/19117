I saw the movie on DVD and really enjoyed it.  I was reminded of a similar film, _Haunted Summer_, which portrays the meeting of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron.  I guess I thought Wordsworth and Coleridge were more friendly than this (and maybe they were) in reality.  The film sure is biased towards Coleridge.  Wordsworth comes off very badly--he gives up on his revolutionary principles, marries a shrewish wife, and seems only interested in how he will be viewed by posterity.  Wordsworth goes to visit Coleridge and to collaborate with him, but can't seem to put a single word to paper.  Then, suddenly, _Lyrical Ballads_ is finished and published and filled with Wordsworth's poetry!
  
The performances are excellent, particularly Linus Roache as Coleridge and Emily Woof as Dorothy Wordsworth.  The film is a bit odd at times, with jet trails moving across the skies of the 18th century, but it does a great job of getting at the creative impulse, showing the feverish bouts of imagination that gave rise to Coleridge's _Rime of the Ancient Mariner_ and the fragment _Kubla Khan_ (interesting that it shows an interruption by Wordsworth as the cause of STC losing his train of thought).  Also, the scene with frost forming on the window while Coleridge cares for his son Hartley, leading to one of his more memorable early poems, is a standout.  This film is well worth your time and isn't the boring, stodgy take on biography that some might be fearing.
