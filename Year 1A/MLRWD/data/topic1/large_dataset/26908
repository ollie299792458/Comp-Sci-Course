The Resident Evil series is one of the most famous video game sagas in existance, right up there with Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Madden, Mario, etc. The stories are full of twists and dark secrets, and the games are nothing but fun, especially lately with Resident Evil 4 winning game of they year many times over and Resident Evil 5 looking amazing.

That being said, the movies are disappointing. I wouldn't call them bad, and they definately aren't good, but disappointing they are. I personally liked the first movie. It had style and environment, and that made up for the fact that it had absolutely nothing to do with they game. However, as the trilogy went on, the lack of the real story really hurt the series and ultimately doomed it.

While better than the mess that was the second movie, Resident Evil Road Warrior (i.e. Extinction) still comes up short of both the environment and style of the first movie as well as the whole premise of the video games which made Resident Evil cool in the first place.
