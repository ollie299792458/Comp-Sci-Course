I'm sure anyone who has ever heard of Rocky Horror has heard about it's strange cult following.  Why, you ask?  The Rocky Horror Picture Show is  truly one of a kind.  I have seen the movie at least twenty times in my  lifetime (that's not a lot, compared to true fans), and surprisingly, it  has never once bored me.  Upon one viewing, I decided that I was too tired  to really watch, so I was going to fast forward through parts of it.  By  the first song, "Science Fiction Double Feature", with those big,  red lips up on the screen, I was hooked.  The songs are very catchy, with  funny lyrics that will stay in your head for weeks to come (a mixed  blessing to some).  Tim Curry gives his all as Frank-n-Furter, a  scientist from another planet who has strange parties in the middle of the  night.  This part showcases his great voice, and his over-the-top acting.  Also recommended for fans of Susan Sarandon.  This is one of her earlier  works, and you can tell that to this day, she is a little embarassed about  it.  If for nothing else than a pop culture reference, The Rocky  Horror Picture Show is a must-see.  Obviously, some people will not like  this film, but it's their loss.
