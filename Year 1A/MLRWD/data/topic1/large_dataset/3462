I remember as a child falling asleep at the Skyway Drive-in trying to make it through "El Cid." And now some 40 years later I find myself falling asleep on the couch trying to get through the wooden acting of Charlton Heston, the lamentable miscasting of Sophia Loren and the dreadful overacting of a mediocre supporting cast, all failing to bring life to the preachy, melodramatic script.

The greatest epic ever filmed? I don't think so. That label belongs to the one and only "Lawrence of Arabia." It's war scenes are better; it's cast impeccable; and it's script literate and human. Even David Lean's misfire "Ryan's Daughter" is a much satisfyling film than "El Cid."

I haven't been impressed by Scorcese's films in the past decade and think he has constantly miscast Leonardo di Caprio. "The Departed" was a rip-off of the last dozen films of Clint Eastwood.

Marty, go back to making films and stop concentrating on being the high guru of film history. If you were impressed by "El Cid" when you were a boy, you must have been terribly deprived. When I lived in New York, there was certainly more drama on the streets than in this insufferably boring film.

The restoration of "El Cid" is certainly noteworthy.
