This has always been one of my favorite movies. A true story retold with outstanding visuals and drama.  Having this on Blue-Ray allowed me to re-experience the movie in incredible detail, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

I dropped one-star however, because while the movie itself is fabulous, the Blue-Ray disc doesn't include ANY extras other than the movie itself.  This may be due to the length of the movie, but I have become accustomed to the various extras included with DVD's, and I usually enjoy being able to go beyond the movie into the details of the story, script, director's comments, outtakes, and deleted scenes... NONE of which are included on the Blue-Ray disc.  I would strongly suggest to the studios, that if they can't put those extras on a single Blue-Ray disc, that they at least include a standard DVD(cheap) with the BR disc that includes all the extras we have come to expect of movies in this class.

Overall, a GREAT movie, and very happy with my purchase.
