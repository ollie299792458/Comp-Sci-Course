If I were to rate this movie on its own I would give it four stars, mainly  because its not a movie that sticks with me, its just fun to watch once in  awhile. This limited edition package is really quite nice. When you take  the wrapping off you will notice the case isn't like anything else. If  anything, its originality is similar to the Fight Club's packaging. It  opens up much like a book, which I think is really cool. As for the  contents on the DVD's themselves, Disc One contains both a fullscreen and  widescreen version of the movie, and Disc Two holds all the goodies. There  is a feature where you get to watch two scenes being broken down from the  first storyboards to the final cut. That is interesting to watch. Another  original feature is a scene editing workshop, that lets you "try"  and be and editor. This feature took a little while to figure out how to  use, but once I tried it out, I realized how bad I would be at editing a  movie :) Overall, this is a nice dvd to have, although it is anywhere from  $5-10 more than the regular version, so it is a bit pricey. My suggestion  would be only spend the extra money if you really like this movie.
