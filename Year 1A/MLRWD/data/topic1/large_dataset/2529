Abel Ferrara's "King of New York" is a dynamite film that pulls no punches; its "in your face" style hits you head on.  The "King" is Frank White, played with cold-blooded aplomb by Christopher Walken, a paroled gangster with ice in his veins who wants to be the baddest of the bad-... drug lords in the city.  He'll win respect and the backing of social bigwigs by rescuing a city hospital from privatization, but his real interest is the bottom line supplied by the lucrative drug trade.  To this end, he's ready, willing and able to wipe out the competition from Italian, Latino and Chinese interests.  Frank is as white as his surname but his henchman are almost all black.  Out to get Frank and stop his criminal interests are a group of New York's Finest who, in their zeal to fight fire with fire, come across as being almost as bad as the thugs they want to put away.  There are some really excellent performances in this film; besides Walken, the standouts are Laurence Fishburne as White's right-hand man Jimmy Jump, David Caruso as the overzealous cop who destroys himself trying to destroy White, and Wesley Snipes, as the black cop who is scorned by White's black thugs as a traitor and a wannabe; even his name, Flanigan, emphasizes this.  I especially liked Teresa Randle as White's sometime girl friend, Raye, as beautiful as she is deadly with a machine gun.  There is plenty of violence in this film, blood and bullets flying all over the place, and Ferrara's direction, the cinematography, and the terrific score (check out Schooly D's "Am I Black Enough?") underline the dark tone of the film.  It's not a film for everyone, but if you're into a movie that shows the gritty underbelly of New York to chilling effect, this movie may be for you.
