This movie was great.  Alot of people have said that it couldn't decide weather it was funny or serious but that's actually what makes it so  good--and a romantic comedy!
It gets laughs by exaggerating gay and  lesbian sterotypes (in a non-offensive way), making fun of those 'gay  rehab' places, at homophobia, and at itself.  There are also a lot of  "inside jokes" in there--pay attention!  ("raging  bulldyke", "it's time to wake mary")!
The romantic part is  truly sweet and is in classic love/hate relationship format.  You walk out  just feeling happy!  :) This is the first movie that I've seen that doesn't  portray lesbians as either: man-hating super-butches, leather bound  kink-freaks, psychotic killers, or soft-core porn icons to please the  straight males in the crowd.  That's really important for all us young  lesbians who don't fall into one of those categories and it is a sign of  society's (or at least the film industry's) changing attitude towards  lesbainism!
That being said,this movie is for EVERYONE--highly enjoyable  for all.  My (straight as an arrow, happily married) mother went with me  and there were quite a few straight couples there on dates.  Everyone was  laughing out loud and clapping at the end--something that doesn't seem to  happen much at movies!
In case you can't tell, I highly recommend this  movie!
