The Ronald Colman 1935 film version of Charles Dickens' 1859 novel 'A Tale of Two Cities' is the best known and most popular of at least 15 film and TV movies with the same title.  A best picture Oscar nominee in 1937, this version has one of Hollywood's most popular leading men ever in the staring role of dissolute lawyer Sydney Carton, who goes to the guillotine in place of the husband of a woman Carton loves.

The very popular book is famous for both its opening words ("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....") and its final words ("It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.")  The film keeps these words.

The secondary characters are particularly memorable.  Jerry Cruncher is a "go for" for a London bank and a grave robber for medical research.  Miss Pross is the highly devoted governess to the leading female character (Lucie Manette), and she is a very strong character.  Over the years, Madame Defarge knits into her shawls the identities of people who should go to the guillotine when the French Revolution comes to Paris--which is the main setting of the action of the film, shared with London (the two cities in the title).

Like most films made from excellent novels, this one suffers primarily from the need for abridgment--and possibly the absence of color, as it was filmed in black and white just about the time color was first used successfully in movies.  IMDB's voters give this film 7.9 out of 10 points--high praise, indeed.
