Quite simply one of the finest zombie movies ever filmed. George Romero brought zombies to vivid un-life and scared... well the life out of us. While not the first zombie movie Mr. Romero redefined the zombie genre. Ironically the word "zombie" is never used in the movie. The plotline is simple. A group of seven people hide from flesh-eating zombies in a farmhouse. We get pieces of the story from radio broadcasts. The radiation of a detonated satellite returning from Venus is theorized to be the cause of the recently deceased to reanimate and seek the living to use as food though the actual cause is never determined. The scares come in the form of massive, relentless, slow moving hordes of zombies. The sheer number roaming the country side are numerous and growing. The only way to stop them is a blow to the head. This film rightly earned its place as a cult classic which spawned three sequels two re-makes and who knows how many rip-offs. Who hasn't quoted Johnny's best line? "They're coming to get you, Barbara, there's one of them now!" Zombies have made a huge comeback over the last several years. They've showed up in books, video games, movies (Romero's latest installment `Land of the dead') and in the form of Rob Zombie's music. So remember "Kill the brain, and you kill the ghoul".
