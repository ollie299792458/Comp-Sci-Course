Jean-Jacques Annaud's film is a little too long, and parts of it are more evocative of a National Geographic Special than a movie with a plot, but all the same there are more than a few positive things about "Seven Years in Tibet." Heinrich Harrer, whose Nazi past lent an element of controversy to the film around the time it opened, apparently had a genuinely warm relationship with the present Dalai Lama, and this friendship is nicely depicted onscreen. Brad Pitt, in the role of Harrer, drew much criticism for his Austrian accent, but it's really not too bad (certainly no worse than the accents attempted by Gregory Peck and other American actors) and his performance, particularly in the second half of the film, is quite good. David Thewlis does fine work as Harrer's colleague, Peter Aufschnaiter, and it's nice to have (mostly) Tibetan actors actually portraying Tibetan individuals. Oddly, there is little development in the character played by B.D. Wong, in spite of the fact that he supposedly plays a key role in the fall of Lhasa to the invading Chinese forces. (That's not Mr. Wong's fault, but the script writer's.) It is interesting to see Mako (a Japanese-American whose lengthy career as a film and stage actor spans decades) in his few brief appearances as one of Harrer's Tibetan benefactors. The scenery is spectacular, and sets and costumes are well done. Unfortunately, the murky images of Chinese soldiers running rampant through Tibetan villages don't have enough emotional punch, and tell us little about the mass destruction perpetrated in the first years of the occupation. We are also left in the dark as to how Harrer made his way back to Austria. However, the conclusion of the film, in which Harrer pays a visit to the son he never knew, is moving, and one is left with the sense that one has viewed something worthwhile--not a masterpiece, but relevant.
