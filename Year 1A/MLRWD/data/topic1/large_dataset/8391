The Emperor's Club is a movie of man's dedication to oneself, to his family and honour of teacher and school.  A distinguished, privated boys boarding school revels in discipline and making sure that young boys turn into great men.  One of the teachers, Mr. Herdunt was able to mold his young breed by lecturing them on the Ancient Civilization from Caeser to Socratos...
  Revolving around this one teacher...and four students:  the exchange student from India, the boy who is to live up to the expectations of his father (Martin), the good boy and lastly, the intolerant, underdisciplined boy. The latter boy, Belle, needs to be worked with and Herdunt is able to do that for him.  Encouraging him and assuring him of his smartness he does work and does do well. Each year at this school, a competition is held to find out who can reign for the year as Mr. Julius Caeser.  The competition is based on history of the ancient world.  Like in a spelling bee, whomever is left over wins the crown of leaves and earns the title of Mr. Julius Caeser.  Three of the four boys mentioned above are in the final competition.
  25 years after graduation, where Herdunt proclaims he failed Belle as a teacher, there is a reunion.  And a rematch of the Julius Caeser competition, with the same three boys.
  I admit, this is not a movie I would have gone to if I had only seen a trailer.  But, when you have a preview ticket, who would give it up?  I assure you, you will not be disappointed.  The commrodity of student/teacher and student/student is amazing.  It makes you want to wish all schools were like this.  A fabulous movie that will live your heart uplifted and a new, wonderful look toward teachers.
