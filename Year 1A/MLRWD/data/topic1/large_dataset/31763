I grew up just a few years younger than the young men and women who were being sent to Viet Nam to fight.  Seeing this movie takes me back to that time, when here in America there was truly alot of prosperity and peace, or  so we thought.  The Viet Nam war was pretty much kept behind the scenes by  government and media.  I feel guilty now, when I look back and realize what  a great time the rest of us were having here, while these young guys were  having their whole lives destroyed for nothing!  I wish I could go back,  and have made a difference, I wish I could have eased just a little of the  suffering.  I think most of the reviews here must have been written by  people of a later generation.  They just cannot understand the innocence  that was lost during that period of time in America.  They see the  aftermath, and accept it as the was it has always been, but that is not the  case.  Cruise's character said it best when after fighting in the  wheelchairs and falling down the hill, he talks to Charlie about the was it  used to be, well, that is the way it used to be.  The war changed so much  about our country, it took the innocence forever.
