This is the best remake that I have seen.  The premise remains basically the same: army guys captured in an ambush, brain-washed, one remembers the real incident while another is on the verge of making his shrewish mother powerful.  This time the enemy is not the communists, but rather big-business, which can support either Republicans or Democrats.  This film does not label the political party, much like the original, which is very good since the "Manchurian" Party can be any party in U.S. politics.

The ending has been changed since John Iselin's character has been completely omitted from the film, but at least the premise is the same: what if one of the candidates for the presidency was actually controlled by foreign or domestic powers?  If one man can be controlled by another, then why not all of mankind be likewise become puppets?

This is by far the second major contendor for Best Picture to come out this year, first being Kill Bill Vol.2.

The acting is superb and I would not be surprised if Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber are nominated for oscars for acting and Jonathan Demme for directing.

However, this is still not as good as the original Frank Sinatra film, but it does come close.
