I still remember the first time I saw this movie. That was the night I laughed myself to tears and a stomach cramp. Nearly every single minute of Kung Pow! packed to the brim with hilarity. There is a talking tongue, a clumsy one-boobed chick, a Kung-Fu cow, and tons of other insane, abstract nonsense including various parodies.

It absolutely blows my mind that there are people who thought that this had no laughs. It must not have been their type. After all, this is one incredibly goofy, wacky movie. So if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767824571">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXS7">Dude, Where's My Car?</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UVBQI">Kung Fu Hustle (Full Screen Edition)</a> are not your type of movies then stay away from this one. Everyone else, BUY IT!! This is a comedy masterpiece of zany-ness with a COLOSSAL replay value. I'v seen this thing at least 8 times over the course of 1 year and it NEVER gets old!

at the end of the movie, there is a trailer for Kung Pow! 2: Tongue of Fury, but almost 10 years later, and it is still nowhere to be found... I am highly anticipating the sequel! I simply cannot wait to buy it, if it ever gets released, that is...
