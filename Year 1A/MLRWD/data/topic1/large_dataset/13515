I believe this is proof that America has real talent out side the US Border also(FYI America it's after all a continent and USA is just part of it, basic geography people study more so don't look that much of an ignorant) The story is compelling and with a soul it doesn't really try to tone it down, war is violence and we need to be aware that war is cruel it's not a picnic people get's killed and the movie does a great job how a vision of a man can make them do things that other people don't even considered of doing. The Villain in this movie it's a complete [...] but you see he's human side you see part of it's nature this guy could be anyone out there it's not so fictional to me. then we see Ofelia the little kid who is the incarnation of the princess of the fairy world but needs to work her way back and deal with situation that normal kids don't have but yet again she is expose to war many kids in the world are expose to that.

This is not a movie for kids and for other reviews that I read... it's nor for some "adult" either. I do believe that this is an example of what an imagination can create not only visually but emotional also.

For those people are who are not bilingual I believe that reading is something that you guys can do. Experience this in the language it was born. There is no emotion that can be translated.
