Three words: Oh. My. God. This movie is just incredible. It's not that often that you come across a film that can pull you straight into it, hold you there and leave you breathless at the end, but this one does. 
Okay, let's start at the beginning. Corky (Gina Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who has just got out of prison. She moves into an apartment next door to Ceasar (Joe Pantoliano), a money launderer for the mob, and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). 
Violet, who is perhaps not quite as heterosexual as Ceasar would like her to be, soon embarks on a fiery relationship with Corky. Gershon and Tilly have chemistry to burn; they play the sex scenes in a wonderful tongue-in-cheek manner, going for the 'fun' aspect of it. 
This is all out of the way fairly quickly. We've established that they're a secret couple, and now the fun begins. Ceasar has $2 million dollars in his apartment which is being picked up the following day. Violet wants out and the money, and to get it she needs Corky's help. They hatch a plan and get a-thinking, but as always something goes wrong. This time? Ceasar is more intelligent than they gave him credit for.
Not only is the twisting plot ingenius and witty, but the whole movie is beautifully shot. Recognise Corky's gun? If the ending doesn't leave you with a huge smile on your face, nothing will. And in the end, how could anyone not love a lesbian-themed movie with the song "I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)" on the soundtrack?
