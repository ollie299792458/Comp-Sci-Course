Rise and shine, everyone! The Xena Season 3 DVD is about to release! Excitement reaches its peak as all the charts show that this season is the most beloved among the Xenites.
  Be sure that your boots are laced, because now you are going to experience the most breathtaking adventures!
  You'll be rushed by the powerfull wave of Tsunamy right in the heat of a battle and stand One Against An Army! But beware the Furies in your head, that could drive you insane and convince you in seeing another Xena - look - alike! Be ready for your life to throw you far East for paying your Debts, and then Deliver to Rome, after what you'll be Forgiven but not Forgotten! Show your Maternal Instinct & try to stay clean from the Dirty Half Dozen.:)) Be careful in dealing with King Con as he can perform a Vanishing Act. See how Gabby does her bard thing and then looses her blood innocence... And I Hope you'll not be Sacrificed or killed by the King of Assasins (who's resemblance with Joxer is *absolutely accidental*:))) But... have you ever thought that the world you are living in is Illusia? I bet you never seen singing Ares or dancing Callisto before! It's uncomparable and just unique! And after the great journey be sure to say "Been There Done That"!
  The DVD cries: "Come and get me!" Thet's not an offer... it's a statement of fact!
  What more cam be said.. ding - dong..:))
  "No. No. Yes. No. Tried that. Yes, both ways. No, I don't know. No, again. Are there any questions? Good."
  Now go! Go buy it and enjoy!!!
