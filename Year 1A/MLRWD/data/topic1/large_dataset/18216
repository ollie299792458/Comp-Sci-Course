Braveheart is a very impressive movie that has earned a spot in the upper echelon of movie greatness.  Mel Gibson totally embraces his role as William Wallace and delivers an immaculate performance throughout the film. This motion picture is nothing short of a masterpiece.
Initially what grabbed me about this movie were the world-class scenery shots.  From their, the movie explodes with brilliance as an amazing story unfolds and you are taken directly into the heart of a highly hostile, historical confrontation between the Brits and Scots.  The battle scenes set a new standard in exellence and the love story doesn't get too overdrawn out and boring.  Along with some timely humor, a few suprise twists and a great ending, Braveheart comes together to create a fabulous adventure.
The only complaint I have heard about this movie is that there are a few historical inaccuracies...honestly no body cares and we all love the kilts.  If for some reason you have not already seen Braveheart, make it a priority in the very near future.  I cannot recommend this movie enough, it has become one of my all-time favorites and I know I don't stand alone.
