I attended Graduate School at the University of Colorado a fewyears back and was pleasantly surprised to find this film to be one of the focal points of a management/organizational behavior class.  I've watched it on numerous occasions since I was a kid gluing together old Monogram 'Forts and pretending to be General Savage piloting the "Picadilly Lilly". The film has held together remarkedly well over the years with its central precipts: the terror of war; group dynamics; and the burdens of command still ringing true. Upon reflection, it is indeed odd that King, Peck, Jagger and company were able to successfully convey all of that with comparatively little "action." If remade today, we no doubt would be treated to endless simulated- green screen - battle sequences wherein... would attempt to underscore the same subtle points that make the original so compelling to watch.  Lastly, Peck's performance has never really received its due.  Alternatively passionate and subtle, he fleshes out Savage's character beyond its largely marrionette-like roots and humanizes it to the point where his latent desire to be accepted as "one of the boys" eventually proves to be his own little Waterloo - just like his predecessor! 
Whew, imagine getting this analytical about something more contemporary like "The Patriot"!
