Purchased Hunter season 1 for the low price of $8.49. Started watching the dvd's and noticed that the last episode on disc 1 and last two episodes on each of discs 2 & 3 would freeze up constantly while watching. The other episodes on the discs played fine. I emailed Mill Creek Entertainment who dristributed this and advised them of the issue. I received a quick response from them stating that they would replace the faulty discs. They told me that I did not have to send back the faulty discs to them and upon receipt of the replacement discs to just throw away the bad ones. Two days after contacting Mill Creek Entertainment, I received in the mail, a replacement Hunter Season 1 boxed set, also included was Season 2 boxed set (which is not scheduled to be released for 6 more days), and a boxed set called "Cobra" the complete series. Hopefully the replacement Season 1 DVD will play correctly and not freeze up. Other than the constant freezing up of the episodes, the DVD's are good quality, good picture, and good audio. The only downfall I can see other than the freezing up is that there are no closed captions (Subtitles).
