Awesome film.  I pretty much buy anything that Seymour Hoffman sells (Boogie Nights, 25th Hour, Before the Devil...), but am not very familiar with the much more popular, commercially accepted Streep.  Clearly, she's a class-act, as her scenes with Hoffman burn up the screen.  Intriguing story, beautiful shots, use of color and light.  Thought-provoking.  I am always interested by the way directors portray NYC, and Shanley's depiction puts the viewer right there in mid-60's Bronx.  The juxtoposation of the nuns and male members of the church were stark and very telling.  The film exposes many norms of Traditional Catholicism to those who may not be familiar, but it doesn't try to shape or influence your views, however controversial the topic at hand may be.  Extremely controversial, given that the character of a suspected child molester is more likeable and personable than a nun.

If you like thoughtful, emotional drama that is superbly directed and acted and based upon a great story, don't doubt "Doubt."
