It is so difficult today to find a movie that will entertain the entire family -- children and adults alike -- without either innuendo that plays over the kids' understandings or a plot that plays below the adults. The Spiderwick Chronicles is a movie that will satisfy the entire family.

My wife and I enjoyed the movie at least as much as my 5 year old son and 2-1/2 year old daughter (she was probably too young to really enjoy it, but she watched anyway). The movie follows a family who has moved into an inherited home that protects the secrets of the world all around us. When the troublesome Jared stumbles upon his great-great uncle's field guide and ignores the warning not to read the book, he finds himself and his family surrounded by goblins and other fantastical creatures that no one else can see.

We join Jared and his brother and sister as they try to convince their mother of the dangers around them, only to be confronted face to face by an evil ogre trying to get his hands on the field guide. If the ogre succeeds, everyone will die.

Spiderwick is full of incredible special effects, the actors deliver a believable performance, and the story created just enough suspense to keep the entire family on the edges of our seats.

Looking for a movie the entire family can enjoy without the worry of innuendo, inappropriate language, or outright adult content? Spiderwick promises to deliver!
