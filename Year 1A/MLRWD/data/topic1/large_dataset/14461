Requiem For A Dream is the most beautiful, eye-opening, and hurtful movie that I have and probably ever will experience.  I went through every possible emotion watching this film.  Hate, Sadness, Anger, Happiness, Jealousy, Lust..... It can go on and on and on.  But the main point of this film is to show what a life of drugs can do to us.  How it will grip us, and not let you, pulling you into situations you dont want to be in..... until it is to late.  
You feel so bad for these characters, you want to help them, and tell them to stop, but all you can do is sit, watch, and let the tears roll down your face.  It is that powerful.  Other than the story that is a major eye-opener, the movie is filmed wonderfully, from the director of "Pi".  I dont believe that I saw one single bad camera view in this whole movie.  And much of the film is showing as if the character is standing still, while the world around them is in fast forward.  The camera work of this flick is great, and any fan of great filmed movies will drool over this work, that is after they cry from the story.
If this film does not open your eyes to the harms of drugs (especially heroin) to your body, mind, lovelife, and just plain life, you are crazy.  This is the biggest eye opening movie since "KIDS" and will leave you hurt days, even weeks after viewing.  But that is the objective.  We should feel this way, why?  I guarentee you will not touch drugs after this film.
