This movie is one of the greatest i have ever seen and it has really hott guys in it like Nathan West and Huntley Ritter! The movie is about Torrance(Dunst), who is the new captain of her cheerleading squad.  On the very first practice one of her best girls is injured and she must find a replacement.Missy(Duska) is a transfer student from L.A., and is also a very serious(and very good) gymnast.  She is accepted into the squad by Torrance. As well as her Brother Cliff(Bradford)who becomes Torrances new love intrest in a hilarious romance.  
To her astonishment Torrance finds out that the former captain, Big Red,(Sloane) stole all of the cheers and routines from the inner city squad in East Compton. This year the clovers(East Compton) are going to Regionals lead by their new captain Iris(Union) and of course if the Clovers are going to do their routine what routine will the Toros do? 
Other great characters in this movie are: Jan(West), a straight male cheerleader(and a really hot one), and Les(Ritter), a gay male cheerleader(also really hot!).
To find out what happens to Torrance and her squad buy "Bring It On" a movie about a girl and her cheerleading squad trying to over come all odds, guy cheerleaders trying to defend their sexuality and inner city squad that can make it on their own. Bring It On is filled with Hot guy cheerleaders, awesome, hilarious cheers, ex-boyfriends, new loves and SPIRIT FINGERS!!
