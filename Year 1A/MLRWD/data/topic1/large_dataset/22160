After watching the advert on TV my son wanted me to purchase this DVD and I thought it was a good idea too. The amazon price was a bit higher than what was on the manufacturer's website. But amazon was giving free shipping on this item which is why I bought it.
It is a very fast paced show, my son found it funny and it seemed nicely planned, at first. But as a parent, I think it would have been better if the producers paid more attention to getting the message across rather than being funny. I suppose the intention was not to make it scary for the kids or too serious, but sometimes, they could have toned down the funny parts a bit to emphasize to kids that it is NOT funny when it comes to dealing with strangers/people who can hurt them. Some important scenes, like when the strangers are trying to talk to the kids or take them away, were paused and interjected with little reminders and questions by the safe side chick, which breaks the child's attention and distracts them from the main scene. Several times, I had to draw my son's attention to what was happening BEFORE the safe side chick interrupted because things happen so quickly, he can't seem to keep pace.
This DVD might be too aggressive or upbeat for some kids, who don't like all the background noises, too much fast music and loud/too much fast talking. But it is well worth sitting with the child and watching it if you can, as it is a very helpful DVD and the kids are going to learn from it one way or the other.The concept is excellent for this DVD and I do hope they have a newer version in time to come. I have no regrets with this purchase.
