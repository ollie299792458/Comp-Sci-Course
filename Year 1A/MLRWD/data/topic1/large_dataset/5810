What can I say?  Steve Martin has proved himself to be one of the wittiest, savviest and funniest writers to come along in the movies.  Also, Frank Oz has established himself as THE comedy director in my opinion.  He's helmed such comic masterpieces as "What About Bob?",  "Housesitter", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and his other  most recent film, "In and Out".  The performances and writing in  these films are the best in terms of comedy.
Eddie Murphy gives the  performance of a lifetime.  Not since his earlier days at "Saturday  Night Live" has he had a better chance to ham it up with great comic  chracters.  His Kit is vile and vulgar while his Jiff is sweet, lovable and  a complete innocent.  It's a testament to Murphy's acting ability where he  has NO prothetics whatsoever, yet he looks like a DIFFERENT person (he does  wear braces, though).
Getting back to the writing, Martin KNOWS comedy.  His comedy isn't like the comedy alot of people like.  You wont find toilet  humor or blatent obscenities here.  Martin goes for honest laughs.  His  style is graceful and hysterical.
For those of you who liked "Big  Daddy", "Austin Powers", "Waterboy" etc. . .you'll  most likely be bored here.  For those of us who love great comedy. .  .You've come to the right place.
