Yellow Submarine is a perfect movie for all ages. It's not to complicating for kids and not to silly for adults.With easy sing-along tunes that are easyly stuck in your head,it's no wonder why it's loved by so many.Many  have grown to love the Beatles, including me. The Beatles are one of my  favorite bands.I have taught myself to play "Yellow Submarine" on  both my trumpet and piano. Yellow Submarine teaches us a very important  lesson; DON'T LET PEOPLE TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHTS &amp; MUSIC! I think Yellow  Sub and the Beatles are making a come back.More&amp;more people are  listening to Yellow Sub and saying; "You know,the Beatles aren't so  bad after all." I admire this movie for a few reasons: First,they  didn't use the Beatle's voices, it was 4 Liverpoolions doing the voices of  them,It was a cartoon, most movies during the 6o's never had cartoons,It is  funny as well as silly, It makes me laugh, they have a social problem tied  into a fantasy/comedy and the songs rule!I feel Yellow Sub will always be  one of the best movies in American Movie History.I hope the Beatle's  influence will never fade in this generation or the next. If people are  willing to listen and watch Yellow Submarine, maybe they will understand  there's more to the song than 4 guys wasting all their money on drugs and  living in a green conversion van, maybe they will understand the true  meaning behind Yellow Submarine.
