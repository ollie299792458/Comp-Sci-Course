Bernie is a wonderful character study of the effect that a very different and original  character has on a Texas town.  Jack Black is splendid as Bernie.  This actor just gets better. In fact the whole cast gives five star performances. It is good to see Shirley McLaine in a film again.  She gives just the right of crankiness to her mean, old lady character without going over the top.  Another reviewer complained that the residents of Carthage Texas were stereotypes.  I did not find that to be the case.  One of the chief attractions of this story is the use of real citizens to tell the story.  They are not portrayed as  dumb hicks.  Nor are they shown as gun toting blood thirsty people who want to fry criminals in the electric chair.  I do not want to give away any of the scenes or ruin the plot of this story for anyone so I will just tell you to watch and judge for yourself.  I am ready, like the town folk, to forgive Bernie for his transgressions. This film was recommended by the Filmspotting podcast on iTunes.  I have to plug them because their reviews lead me to films I might have missed.
