Generally speaking this video has great historical values.  I find the following problems about it:
1. Many pieces are played only as a small fragmant (sometimes only a few seconds).  It could be disappointing in some places (even though some pieces are played in their entirety).  The unimpressive Beethoven Concerto was shown 3 times.  On the other hand, the most exciting part of the Tschaichovsky Concerto is not aired (I mean the opening melody).
2. The people interviewed in the documentary are badly chosen.  With exceptions (like Daniel Barenboim), many interviewees are uncharasmatic, ugly people who do not even speak English well.  What a detraction that would be.  Kissin speaks as if he had no tonge.  
3. The group of pianists chosen is also not very representative.  Many uninteresting ones are included while good ones might have been omitted.  
Despite these weaknesses, the follwing is the highlight of the video:
1. Gilels playing the Rachmaninof Prelude on the high platform at the warfront airbase.  What a scene that was.
2. Richter playing the revolutionary etude in its entirety (he finished it 30 secondes before most pianists would perform it).
3. A film shot from "moonlight sonata", where Paderewski played LIst's Hungarian Rhaphsidy.
