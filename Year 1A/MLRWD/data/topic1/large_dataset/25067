If you ever, I mean, ever want to see Beauty and The Beast, forget disney completely, this version is the only one worth watching.

This movie is absolutely sublime. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. Jean Marais, playing three roles, the beast/the prince/ Avenat (Beauty's suitor) is so amazing, you have to read the credits to realize that it is the same actor, his performance is almost pulling on Freud's personality theory. Josette Day, is in addition to being beautiful, plays Beauty perfectly. She is the one who navigates between the world of her family and the Beast's castle, well done.

I love that is in black and white, I think color would ruin the movie completely. It's a very subtle movie, full of metaphors that can only be discovered upon multiple viewings.  The morality tale is there, as it is the most faithful to the author's vision, but it is build upon, that is goes beyond a simple fairy tale.

I wouldn't reccomend it for young children, let them think they know Beauty and the Beast. When they are old enough, they'll learn the truth.
