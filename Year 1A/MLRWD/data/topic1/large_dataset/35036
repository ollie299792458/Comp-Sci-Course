Tim Robbins presents in his movie "Dead Man Walking" the subject capital punishment. But compared to many other directors who have also dealed with this matter Tim Robbins does not give the audience a didactic message. By using flashbacks and changes of perspectives he presents every side of the crime Poncelet commited. Showing the cruelty of the crime and the grief of the victim's families on the one hand and the development of Matt Poncelet and the sorrow of his family after the execution on the other hand makes the viewer contemplate. Do you have to atone for a murder by another murder?! These are the major aspects which make the viewer think. Think about his own opinion concerning the death penalty.
The main reason why I gave this movie four stars is that Tim Robbins provides changes of perspective and does not try to push the audience in one direction. Consequently every viewer of the film gets the chance to change his opinion about the death penalty. Besides the great performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon the film is worth seeing because it gives you the opportunity to see the matter capital punishment with other eyes.
