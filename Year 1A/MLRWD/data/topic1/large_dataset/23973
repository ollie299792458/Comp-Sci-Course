I was NOT planning on seeing this movie because...I'm a guy.  I figured it was your basic "chick flick."  However, this evening it was the only thing available so I decided to get it, figuring that at least Cameron Diaz is hot, and I'm glad I did.  The script is excellent.  An interesting drama with interesting characters, but with comedy moments that really bring laughs.  Complimenting the great story are the performances...they are superb.  Shirley Maclaine has been playing goofy stereotypical characters for quite awhile now, so it's nice to see her in a movie where she is playing a "real" person, and she does it very effectively.  Toni Collette is great as the ugly sister and surprisingly, Cameron Diaz is not only hot as the pretty sister, but she turns in a very strong performance too.  I was totally engrossed in the story because the performances were that good.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the movie was just a little too long.  I think they could have trimmed some fat and had just as good a movie.  One more thing: much of the movie was shot in a retirement community in Florida.  The director used the residents in the movie and gave some of them speaking parts.  There is a bonus featurette in which the old folks who have cameos in the movie are interviewed and it is really adorable.  If you're a guy, DON'T think you won't like this.  You will.  Oh, and you do get to see several scenes of Cameron Diaz scantily clad.
