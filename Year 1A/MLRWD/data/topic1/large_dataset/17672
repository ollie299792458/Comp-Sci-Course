Andrei Tarkovsky is not only capably of making an excellent thriller, but he very closely examines his characters and the way they react to different things, as well as providing some incredible images.  Tarkovsky is known  for saying that a good movie should not be entertaining.  This may hold  true to "The Sacrifice" or "The Mirror," but this is a  brilliant science fiction masterpiece that is good AND entertaining.  The  acting is flawless and the script is very well written, allowing for some  close examination of each individual cosmonaut on board Solaris.
For any  who are unfamilair with the plot, it involves a group of cosmonauts who are  in orbit above a planet consisting completely of water.  The water seems to  be alive and is manifesting hallucinations of what the crew is thinking  about, or people from their past.  The people react with fear and  compassion to these different occurences, and try to figure out how to stop  this, or if they even want to.
Fans of "2001: A Space Odyssey"  should not miss this, and once viewing this masterpiece you will realize  how many films have been influenced by this one ("Event Horizon,"  for example).
