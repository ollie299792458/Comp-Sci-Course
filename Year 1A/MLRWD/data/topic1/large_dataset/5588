How to lose a guy in 10 days is a great movie with a great story about Andie, Benjamin and their love. Andie (Kate Hudson) is a 'How-To-Girl' at a magazine and one day she has to make a story, How to lose aguy in 10 days. She will start dating a man and then drive him away, in 10 days, with things, that women usually do, that man don't like. Benjamin (Matthew McConaughey) works in advertising. One day he makes a bet with two of his co-workers. He will get the most important work, if he will bring a woman, which will be totally in love with him, to a party 10 days from that day. And his co-workers choose, which woman will that be. They, knowing what Andie is about to do, choose her, but do not tell Ben. So, the problem occurs in their relationship. One wants to make it last at least 10 days, but the other wants to end it before the 10 days are gone by. So through series of comic events the 10th day comes. So on the party, they both find out about another one's lying and they break up. But it wouldn't be a romantic comedy, if they wouldn't end up together.
How to lose a guy in 10 days is one of the most romantic comedies in my opinion. Also the actors are really good. I mean, Matthew is an ok actor, he can be funny from time to time. But Kate Hudson was the one that I really loved in that movie. She's a great actress. She is also really beautiful and charming and is just the right person for this movie. Besides that, the chemistry between then is just awesome.
