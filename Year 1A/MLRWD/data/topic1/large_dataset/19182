I know that a lot of people come on to amazon and write reviews for comedies (such as Mystery Men) and call them: stupid, puerile, juvenile, and poorly acted.  I would like to ask these people what exactly they would  like a comedy to be.  It would certainly be fine to critizice a movie for  these flaws if it were brought out to be a semi serious comedy, however  mystery men is not.  What mystery men provides is an amusing little break  in reality that has many good one-liners, and slap stick humor.  True, it  will never win an oscar, for best film/director/actor but it does  entertain. And really when I set out for a quick comedy movie to watch  thats all I expect. If I want a thought provoking movie I'll watch  Metropolis, or Schindlers list, or Saving Private Ryan.  Honestly though  sometimes the movie did lag in certain spots, but other than that it was  fun and funny.  I wouldn't suggest buying this if you are stuck up about  movies and will only buy something criticly acclaimed, but if you are  normal, than this is for you.
