This movie takes the characters from the first movie on an even grander journey! For those of you who hated "THE MUMMY", you're not getting either. Both movies are supposed to be simple. They're a throwback to "Raiders of the Lost Ark", that kind of thrill-a-minute action/adventure stuff that Saturday morning serials were made of. Each bit of action is 'supposed' to lead to the next, meaning: In the scene where Evie is stabbed by Meela/Anck-su-na-mun, that was supposed to be then end of one chapter of the serial which would lead to the next chapter. Rick, the hero, is supposed to then do what he can to resurrect his beloved, just like Imhotep from the first film. Oded Fehr playing 'Ardeth Bey' is clearly a 'good guy'. GO BACK AND WATCH THE FIRST MOVIE!!! These characters are flawed (a refreshing change). Jonathan (John Hannah) is 'supposed' to be the foulup he is (think Marcus Brody 'Raiders'). For me, both films reawakened my belief in movies. A good cast with wonderful characters to cheer for or boo at. My hope is for a third installment to wrap everything up as did 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. These movies are better than the Karloff pictures taking the old dried out 1932 movies to a new level. My kudos to all involved!!! For all who hated it, what is your idea of a good movie, 'Independence Day'? Or 'Air Force One' that should have stopped before the Mig fighters began attacking the plane!!! Both 'THE MUMMY' &amp; 'THE MUMMY RETURNS' are just good clean fun!!!
