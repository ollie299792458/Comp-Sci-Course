The Movie:
After loving the heck out of Casino Royale, it was pretty much assured that I was going to see the inevitable and sequel but I was not prepared for what I saw. This was not the Bond I wanted to see after CR.

It all starts off with one of the worst car chase action scenes I've ever seen. Thanks to the shooting style, it's incoherent and annoying to watch. The movie tries so hard to be a new Bourne-style spy romp mixed with some very bad elements of older Bond movies; such as globetrotting around the world on the most convenient pretexts. CR put Bond in his own, more realistic but not real, world. This movie tries too hard to place him in the real world and be Bourne and it fails miserably. It's pretty long and mostly boring. The action also tries too hard to be Bourne, extensively utilizing poorly-done shaky cam. My girlfriend and I did not enjoy this and one of my friends began slamming his head on his knees after about 30 mins.

Blu-ray:
Picture and audio are excellent. Barely much to mention in the bonus features department. It's very safe to expect a double dip when the next bond movie hits theaters.
