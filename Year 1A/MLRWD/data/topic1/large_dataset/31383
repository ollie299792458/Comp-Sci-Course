There are several reasons why I would recommend buying this dvd. For one it helps support the show and if a lot of bronies do their part and buy this it will hopefully encourage Hasbro to give us the season box sets that we so desperately want.

Secondly, because the last roundup contains Derpy's original scene that by itself is worth the cost of the dvd.

Also the extended theme, which I have to say is pretty epic, would make the dvd worth buying even if it didn't contain any of the best episodes.

About the episodes themselves Hearths warming eve and over a barrel are not my favorites but I still like them. There's only one episode I don't like and that's only because of the message. I still like it a bit because it's MLP. But that's irrelevant anyway because that episode isn't on this dvd. The first two are necessary because it introduces the characters and sets up for the series, and the last roundup in my opinion is one of the best episodes starring Applejack. Plus it's got Derpy what more could you ask for? I mean aside from season box sets.

Overall, I would highly recommend buying this dvd. If for no other reason than to support the show.
