First and foremost this is a GREAT movie. I first saw this movie when it came out in 1987. The two main things I remembered at the time, the ending was a something I nevered would have guessed  and Lisa Bonet's (Denise Huxtable of The Cosby Show) scenes were hot (yeah I was a thirsty teenager at the time). If I remember correctly, the scenes were so "controversial" ie sexual it got her (Lisa Bonet)kicked off of The Cosby Show for a while. Fast foward 24 years, Lisa Bonet's scenes are still hot with the exception that Mickey Rourke (the love interest)now looks like a pervert because of the age difference between the two (among other things)and the plot, acting, directing etc is even better because once you see the ending all the little things going on throughout the film make even more sense. This movie definitely stands the test of time.
I love and collect movies and this movie is one of my favorites.
