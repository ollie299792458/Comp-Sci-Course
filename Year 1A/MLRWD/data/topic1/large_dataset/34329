Surprisingly, nobody here has made that joke yet, so I sort of felt obliged to.

Not a bad little thriller: there's an emphasis on suspense and story development (and some unexpected turns), which is good.  Also, it's a fairly small number of people who actually get "whacked" --and even fewer get the full-on wax treatment, which is sort of surprising, given the title, --and sort of a relief, when you consider how cruel this movie is in its minute details.

The really disappointing thing is that the movie never really succeeds in getting under your skin the way that GREAT horror movies do, because it never smartly addresses the odd, psycho-sexual reasons for THIS PARTICULAR kind of murder and mayhem.  There's a lot of standard-issue "slasher"-style hunting and killing (sorry, but that comes under a totally different 'psycho' category -- read your textbooks, people!)  Why a house of wax?, except that it's already been done before, so the filmmakers can play it safe with a ready-made title?  I mean, it's *always* creepy to get stalked and killed by a masked, limping nutcase -- but what is it about the whole 'preserved-in-wax' thing that is creepy in the particulars?  The movie never gives a good explanation, so you keep thinking, 'what was THAT all about?'.

There's lots of better scary movies out there, and there's lots worse... I just wish they'd take a little more time to discover that there's different ways to be afraid, and different reasons for it.

Plus, what is with all these reviewers chortling over the death of Paris Hilton?  Yeah, maybe you don't like her, but that's kind of a tasteless sentiment to indulge.  Grow a bit of humanity, folks!
