When one thinks of great movies there are a few that come to mind:  Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Godfather, and so on.  What never fails to amaze me is that Executive Decision is usually left out of this list.  What it lacks in plot it heavily makes up for in cast and character development.  Joseph Caanen and Orson Wells step aside; Kurt Russel and Steven Seagal are on the move.  If you want to talk about true chemistry amongst actors then I suggest you look no further than the "WERE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!"  "YOU ARE!" scene.  Lets just say that the ageold craft of theatre just got a tune up.  NINJA STYLE!  I don't like to judge others, but if your heart isnt racing faster than you love life itself by the last scene then you probably have little left to live for cause this movie is A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I am still in the process of appealing the Academys 1996 decision [pun not unintentional] to give Best Picture to the English Patient.  And trust me you, we will not be that patient with them.  Regardless, if you are looking for a classic then reach for the nearest DVD copy of Executive Decision!
