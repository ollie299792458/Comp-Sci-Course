i have to say i found the conceit of this program repulsive. most women i know are not "size queens" and having a "big fat one" is no guarantee that ANY  real woman  would be cajoled into PAYING for the giant weenie fun ride. fictional characters notwithstanding, most women crave understanding, intimacy, and respect. 3 things you cannot find in a prostitute. (esp a male one)  i found this program sort of offensive on principle and tediously slow-paced and trying way too hard upon viewing. i can suspend my disbelief- but not as far as it requires me to insult my gender. you know-there ARE many "female chauvinist pigs," too-- they cater to male notions of sexuality (in truth, men are far more obsessed w/ penis size than women) and flaunt them  in order to achieve status and success in a male -dominated world. this is why i am not surprised there was a "woman writer/producer" on board for this disaster. the divorced, down- on- his- luck dad with the heart -of -gold i wasn't buying either. i don't know-nothing rang "true" about this series. in order for dramas to be effective, you have to find something for the audience to connect to- and i'm afraid this "female poet" (ahem, ME) found nothing. i agree with another reviewer, thomas jane deserved better. this seemed like a sad attempt on HBO to compete with showtime's more tawdry fare. better luck next time cause i'm pretty sure this didn't get renewed.
