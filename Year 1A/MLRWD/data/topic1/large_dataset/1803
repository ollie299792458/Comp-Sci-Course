If you watch this movie with zero expectations, then you're gonna enjoy yourself! 
I saw this movie with my parents and my three younger brothers and we could totally relate to this movie! There are some funny bits at first, but the movie gets emotional after the first hour. It's basically about the children feeling neglected by their parents, who are both reaching for their own personal dreams. 
I wanted to see this movie because i was impressed with the list of stars involved. Steve Martin, Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher. Except for Steve Martin, the rest of them just make and appearance or two in the movie. No doubt they were included in the movie as a crowd-puller. 
The young actors were the ones fully involved with the movie.They were cute and naughty but i have to say, that twelve is TOO BIG a number! I didn't really get to know the characters, so none of them were memorable to me. 
Anyway, it's an entertaining movie to watch. Watch it with your whole family!
