"Reservoir Dogs" was Quentin Tarantino's low-budget heist movie that wasn't about a heist at all.  With his knack for picking unique yet logical situations and exploding them onto the screen, he deftly takes us through the events that occur immediately after a failed heist.
There's a rule about Quentin Tarantino films: the first time you watch them, you stay off-balance the entire time, never sure what's going to happen or who's going to die.  The second time, you sit back to savor the dialogue and the details.  Both elements are crafted with equal fervor in this film as in all of his others--a suspenseful, off-kilter plot coupled with masterful (and unique) execution.
Of course, being so low-budget, this film is small in scale.  The locations are few, and the fact that all of the really important events occur on one set gives the movie a very 'tiny' feel.  It doesn't feel as detailed and comprehensive as "Pulp Fiction", or as sweeping and free-roving as "Kill Bill", but it has its own charm nonetheless.
Memorable moments include Michael Madsen dancing enthusiastically as he brutalizes a young cop, Tarantino himself analyzing Madonna's music, and the stunning Hamlet-esque conclusion which leaves you with a decidedly bent mind.
Despite its smaller scale, this is still a fine Tarantino picture and well worth the price.  Highly recommended.
