For photgraphy I would totally give it 5 stars PLUS! But I am so VERY thankful the day I took my two kids,age 2 and 7 to go see the movie about the Polar Bear family- WHICH IT WAS MARKETED FOR- the theater had quit showing it.

THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN or even animal loving Children/tweens!

Luckily I rented it on DVD and the beloved "families" that you are introduced to lose family memers... and you watch it. It isn't outrageously graphic, but then again it is hard to tell when you have a sobbing child wrapped around your face.

I would have appreciated a "Viewer discretion Advised" warning, simply so I would have had a heads up. Sure it is a nature movie- and the food chain prevails in nature. I get that... but why build up these families only to slaughter them?! Granted I could have pre-viewed it before I let my kids watch it. And I admit that was a gross oversight on my part. BUT WOW.

Read the other reviews- especially the ones with 1-3 stars. No one will argue the photography isn't amazing, but Disney marketed this for kids in my opinion and then horrifies them.

NOT APPRECIATED, Disney.
