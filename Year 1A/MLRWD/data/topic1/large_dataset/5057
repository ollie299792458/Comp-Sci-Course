This movie is an excellent Jackie Chan film, with owen wilson to lend a hand in the comic relief department. Jackie chan is a brilliant asian actor/director/writer/stuntman/e.t.c... He has over 50 films to his credit...  As of late Jackie's movies have moved into the U.S. marketplace with a vengence...This movie is very typical of the new genre. Understand that the differences in filming a U.S. film, and an Asian film are relevant to anyone's review of this film. It's easy to sit back and critic this film for it's lack of all the martial arts, and stunt sequences that we've become accustomed to in a "Jackie Chan" movie. However, realize that in America Jackie has to film within certain rules and guidelines that aren't present in Asia.  There are no nets, ropes, harnesses, standins, bluescreens, computer effect,e.t.c. in Asian filmaking(especially in any Jackie Chan movie) To pull off these films, Jackie has to really do it. He "IS" the special effect. In America, they do not allow him to film in this manner. Safety regulations and such. So you will not be seeing alot of the harrowing stunts you are accustomed to in this film. I thought the movie was a success, it was a comedy, and it did give me quite a laugh.  We should all remember, it is easy to sit back and critic those who entertain us. But we forget the main objective-"To be Entertained- And I was, I love this film, I hope Jackie keeps on entertaining me as he has for 20+ years now.  *Also, anyone who will ever critisize jackie's incredible stunts, or martial arts skills..."Ask yourself, could I do that?" -I did't think so!!!!-  *Bravo Jackie,Bravo!!!!*
