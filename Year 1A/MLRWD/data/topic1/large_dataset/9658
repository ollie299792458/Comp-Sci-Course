Now I have nothing against kids movies, especially those that send a message. Back in the 80's and 90's kids movies used to be enjoyable. This movie, however was more annoying than enjoying. The thing that I hate about kids movies now adays is that they are ssooooo corny!

Jumanji was not corny at all. It had realistic dialogue, action scenes, the scenes simply flow and the fact it had robbin williams in it put it on top. Im not saying that it was the best movie ever but it did have all he elements that make movies enjoyable. Heartwarming, action, realistic dialogue, and robin williams(he he). But most of all it was enganging.

This movie was not engaging. It was boring. On top of that it was corny. Oh and no action. In jumanji there was action. Stampedes, lions, monsoons, vine swinging... In this movie all you see is one kid running from point A to point B, then back to point A and then back to point B while the other kid watches. And then they switch turns. Boring and predictable.

Also, unlike jumanji, ther was no real danger here. Oh sure there were robots, aliens, and meteors but robot was stupid and slow he couldnt eve run as fast as the 10 year old. The aliens were also stupid and they had terrible aim. It was hard to tell whether they were trying to destroy the kids or the house because with all its "advanced technology" it still could not hit the kids worth crap. I know that I am supposed to give this movie a break since it is a "kids" movie but uh, no, Im not gonna give it any break. This movie was terrible. I couldnt even watch it all the way through it was so bad.

The main thing that I didnt like about this movie was the fact none of the characters were likable. None of them. I liked all the characters in jumanji. None of the were annoying brats. But whatever, if you want see this movie for yourself go ahead. I wouldnt recommend it to any one.
