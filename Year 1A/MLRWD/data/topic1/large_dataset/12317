I remember growing up as a child, sitting in front of the television on Saturday mornings watching these cartoons. I loved it back then and I still do now! The electrifying musical score under the supervision of Paul DeKorte and the direction of Hoyt Curtin prepared you for what was about to take place, as well as the narration voice-over from Stanley Jones. It was an amazing feat to gather 13 villians to go up against the Super Friends! I think William Hanna and Joseph Barbera did well and the show really reflected the time, which was 1978. Yes, there are a few blunders in the animation, but the scripts are well-written, although you will find that some of the dialogue, again reflected the time in which it was made. All in all, it is a very good show.
My favourite episodes are " The Time Trap, The Monolith Of Evil, Secret Origins Of The Super Friends, Swamp Of The Living Dead, Fairy Tales Of Doom, Super Friends: Rest In Peace and History Of Doom."
The transfers and the audio are quite good for the time and the age(1978) of the prints, although Warner Brothers should have done some restoration work on this collection. The audio should at least be in 2.0, but they gave us 1.0 with this collection. The special features are good, espically "Saturday, Sleeping Bags & Super Friends: A Retrospective."
All in all, it is a very good collection. I will never forget my memories of watching these cartoons growing up as a child. These were my Super Heros and i am so happy that they have finally been released on DVD!
