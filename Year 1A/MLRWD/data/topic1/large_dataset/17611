If you're looking for a definitive version of this classic, AVOID THIS VERSION! I cannot begin to express my disgust and contempt for Executive Producer Joseph Wolf, the studio, and all involved for adding amateurish 'new footage' and a new score to one of the most terrifying films of all time. This is now worse than the worst of the Sci-Fi Channel; it's not even good enough for public access. What an abomination.
I cannot believe that these hacks thought they had the right to exhume the best parts of this film and tack cheesy embellishments upon it; it's like putting salt on an ice cream sundae. I hope the dead do arise and attack John A. Russo and Joseph Wolf- but then again, I wouldn't want them living on. 
I implore ANYONE interested in obtaining the 'definite' version of this film on DVD to wait- hopefully Criterion will release a worthwhile version, as they did with "Carnival of Souls".
I've heard the Elite Entertainment version is closer to the original; all I know is, I'm returning this ASAP.  What a disappointment.
