I love ABBA and their music very much, and I wish I could rate this musical movie a 5 star rating, but I can't. I have no other choice but to give this movie 2 stars.

When I first watched this movie, I was kinda confused or I couldn't quite make out what the dialogue was talking about. Now that I've watched it a few more times and read some of the other reviews here helped me get a better perspective. Now, I have mixed feelings about this movie.

First the positive, I enjoyed the scenery and orchestrated dancing and performing near the pretty blue waters. I was surprised to see Benny appearing for 2 seconds in the song "dancing queen" and Bjorn appearing at the end as a Greek God. Although I've heard of most of the songs before this movie, but I was introduced to "slipping through my fingers", which is the only song I don't have on any of my ABBA CD's. Lastly, I feel the need to talk about this but, for a PG-13 rating that this movie didn't have any of the F-word, S-word, or the B-word, which was wonderful.

Now to the negative, the songs sung by Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan didn't exactly get my attention. I mean the only ones who can sing ABBA's songs is ABBA personally. Furthermore, I wasn't too thrilled in some of the sexual comments on the movie. Plus, I was kind of disappointed at all the finger-pointing, borderline feminism, rejection, and crude houndlike behavior coming from both male and female so-called companions. And we wonder why there's people in the world who have been known to avoid relationships.

So what is my expressed opinion for Mamma Mia? I would have to say Average, or Fair.
