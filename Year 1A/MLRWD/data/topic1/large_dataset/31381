I have avoided seeing this movie for the past two years because I was under the impression it was about UFO's, telekinesis, and the like.  When a friend recommended it to me recently, I reluctantly watched it.
I found  it to be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in years.  The  "magical" events do not dominate the story as I thought they  would.  Instead, we see the reaction that  heightened peceptivity and  sensibility provoke in the general population when they appear in one  special person.  
Travolta's abilities appear magical, but there is a  rational reason for them, and that plays a key role in the movie.  (I do  not want to give the plot away).  I noticed a key bit of dialogue involving  D.H. Lawrence and "Lady Chatterly's Lover," making me aware that  the writer was very familiar with the essence of the novel.  In fact, the  movie reminded me of the perceptivity of D.H.L. and the reception his  novels, poems, and essays got from the general public. His sensitivity, I  am sure, was enhanced by his struggle with the dire circumstances of his  life, as is Travolta's.
The story is enhanced by the pairing of two  people who are hurting from the blows life has dealt them.  In a pleasant  change from the habit modern movies have of having lovers couple "in  the first reel" so to speak, this couple has first to work through  their problems and hesitations before they can become intimate. To me their  progress in getting to know each other slowly and trustingly was realistic  and inspiring.
Spectacular UFO effects and mind-bending tricks do not  dominate this video; in fact, they scarcely enter. What we have is a  fascinating study of a "different" human being and his convoluted  interactions with conventional society.
