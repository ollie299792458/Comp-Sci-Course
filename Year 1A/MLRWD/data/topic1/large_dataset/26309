I have been a huge fan of Twilight Zone for many years.  I decided, after watching SyFy's New Year Marathon on the 1st to go ahead and give myself a late Christmas gift and purchase the set.  The website suggested it should arrive on the 5th, which was sad because I wouldn't be there to receive it.  In true Twilight twist, it arrived on the 3rd.  Also, Amazon still has the tracking information with it sitting in Pennsylvania awaiting shipping.  Spooky!

You cannot go wrong purchasing this set.  They are nicely packaged DVD's with a nice insert card that gives you a brief synopsis of each episode. It includes the never aired pilot version and several interviews with stars who either lent their talented careers to further Twilight Zone or started their rise to fame as unknowns on this well respected show.  They say that you knew you'd made it big when you were asked to star in a Twilight Zone episode!  The morals and stories may age, but the lessons are as valid today as they were then.  My advice?  Buy it and skip watching it on TV.  You won't get a better deal.
