Walter Matthau had this strange streak where he was making good movies...REALLY GOOD MOVIES like Hopscotch and Charley Varrick and A New Leaf...and then he came to senses and went back to co-starring with Meg  Ryan and her ilk. So god bless the man who green-lighted this movie.  Perhaps the finest action film of the 1970's, Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 has it  all...races against time, gunfights in subway tunnels, guys in big pimp  coats, screaming children, sickly mayors and Walter Matthau as a transit  cop.
Best are the movies where the unlikely are heroic. 
Jam-packed  with great actors (Matthau, Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam, Earl Hindman) and  character actors galore. Perfectly written. Lovingly filmed. This is the  New York you always wanted to visit but are now forced to lament. Filled  with ha ha and oh geesh and wow and gasp....you should turn off your  computer and run like a emu to get it. If they don't have it, scream until  they get it. 
I cannot properly express in words just how divine an act  this film is. It never hits an off key at all...it just soars and soars and  does cartwheels in the sky above our heads while we stare up and squint at  it, our faces warm with sunlight and happiness.
