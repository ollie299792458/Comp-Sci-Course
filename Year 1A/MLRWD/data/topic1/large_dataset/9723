This film was made for Chinese citizens as much as,if not moreso than for foreign viewing. China today is full of disparities and with modern technological advances lack of education can and will cripple any chances for a comfortable future. In the film, the small schoolhouse might have served its purpose 75 years ago but in the developed areas like in the "special economic zones" where high tech is the norm they need to be reminded that rural areas need help. In the U.S. we had the "Rural Electrification Program" in the 1930's and for decades under the old Bell telephone system business users paid a higher rate to subsidize the cost of running telephone lines to rural homeowners. China must catch up to the West in so many areas. The youth are the key and this film shows that such shockingly primitive schools where even chalk is precious are not to be tolerated in a country that is sending men into space.

  The acting is true to chinese character.My wife grew up in rural Xinjiang in a small town named 148 Farm. I have visited relatives in small towns and big cities. The struggle to get out of dead end rural areas into modern cities has changed China. This film will bring up strong emotions and leave the viewer wanting to do something to help. That is why it was made. I reccomend it as a fine piece of art - something that makes you think.
