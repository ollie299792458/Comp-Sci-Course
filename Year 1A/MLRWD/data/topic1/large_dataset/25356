Our family has loved Baby Einstein since my daughter (now 18 months) was born. The format is educationally sound and the use of classical music, puppets and real life examples is just genius. I have to say though that the format of this Baby Newton is not in line with the others.  When we played it for the first time and heard the obnoxious, cheesy intro song, I actually thought I was sent the wrong DVD.  The stupid animated clown, and pop style singing (yuck) is so out of character for Baby Einstein.  There are fewer puppets (which are my daughter's favorite part!) and we hardly hear Julie Clark's lovable voice at all.  On the bright side, there is still SOME puppetry and toy action, classical music and at least some children's voices.  Otherwise though, the attempt to "modernize" and make this video more up to date was just messing with a good thing.  The change really came across like Disney was "trying too hard."  Simplicity and class is Baby Einstein's strong suit.  Don't buy Baby Newton. Stick with all the other great ones.
