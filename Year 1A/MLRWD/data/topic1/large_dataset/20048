(...)wat can I say about this movie btu greatest movie ever.
Sara Trolley wakes up one day and sees a young next door neighbor tearing a chunk out of her bundle of luvs neck. He falls to the bad blood spryin everywhere. She therows the girl out of the room and frantically tries to call the police. Of course the SOB isnt wokring. Her husband then stands up and chases her into the bathroom. she puts her ear up to the door and he bursts through the door, with his eyes rolled into the back of his head and lettin out the loudest scream u could ever imagine. She gets out, a guy gets hit by an ambulence and a car is flung by another car into a gas station.
My friends, the first five minutes. THis movie starts off with a bang, every1 dying, the world in utter chaos. Im not afraid to admit that it scared the hell out of me. Then the credits cum up and show people across the world dying. Playing sum great music in the background.

Now IIv heard a lot of people complain about the ending. I think its a great ending. So it might not end up very good but things in life don't always have a happy ending and i think that is wat the director meant to get across, sum people say it was  like that (...)movie titanic DOES THAT MOVIE SUDDENLY OWN EVERY BAD ENDING! Do bad endings make people feel good? no. Should bad endings be in movies? YES! This is life people. If u dont like it, go to Canada (erg erg)
overall, the best movie i have ever seen. Its a horror movie that is not afraid to have a few slo parts and sum good laughs.
