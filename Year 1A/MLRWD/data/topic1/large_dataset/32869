Having picked this movie up solely for the fact that it won 'Best Picture', I can say that going into it I hadn't the foggiest as to what it was about, where the story came from or any basis it had in reality. It seems, if some complaints are indicative of general consensus, that my clean slate approach was preferable.

Saying that, I found the movie to be engaging and intelligent and the story completely immersive with Russell Crowe playing an incredible character, flaws and all. It wasn't until the final moments that I came to to the fact that the film was based off of an actual person's life. And you know what? All the better for it. I was able to appreciate the story and its events, and Crowe's portrayal without considering it conforming to the strictures of the real world. For me, film has always been a medium that embodied an escape from the world that we inhabit day in and out; on account of that, I don't mind creative licensing in the least in effort to best tell a story. A film, or at least a biographical one, is in its nature a flawed reconstruction of reality, if and only if one places those expectations on the film in the first place. On the other hand, if you can accept the fact that a film is more a director's vision than anyone else's, than you're in a much greater position to appreciate the movie.

Ron Howard and all involved did a fantastic job, I recommend the movie to all interested in a good story; and would like to encourage everyone to go into the picture not expecting a true to form biographical account of a man's life, but a film, and it's an excellent one at that.
