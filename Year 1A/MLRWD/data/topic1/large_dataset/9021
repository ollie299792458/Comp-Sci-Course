This show is a classic.

Although plagued from the beginning by threats of lawsuits, time slot tinkering by ABC and a flap over the show's hero, Ralph Hinkley, sharing a last name with would be Reagan (...) John Hinckley, "The Greatest American Hero" is an underrated gem and one of the most imaginative TV series of the last 30 years.

The show has held up well and watching it now as an adult, I find that the series was both well acted and well written. Legendary TV producer Stephen J. Cannell was in fine form for this underappreciated series.

Highlights include the chemistry between the show's three leads, the fine performance of Robert Culp as gung ho FBI agent Bill Maxwell and Joey Scarbury's infectious title song, "Believe It Or Not."

Anchor Bay Entertainment has done a fantastic job mastering the program for DVD. The episodes look great! Also well worth viewing are the new interviews with Cannell, Culp, William Katt, Connie Sellica and Michael Pare.

Believe it or not, Ralph Hinkley and company are still walking on air. This show is a true delight!
