"Triplets of Beleville" is absolutely a treasure from the French director Sylvain Chomet.  The details, story, humor, character development, the relationship between the characters, and the pure delight rivals that of the great Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki's works.  It is absolutely a pleasure watching this almost speechless story unfold all the way to the final scene. Most of the dialogue, if any, is in French, but no subtitles.  And that is intentional: you don't need it.  Now that takes some good story-telling to achieve.  And this film achieves in leaps and bounds.  Chomet clearly has a different philosophy than the American animations going into his art.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that Disney or Pixar works are not good, "Triplets" is just one of the most outstanding and different in story telling and the use of the medium that I have ever seen for a long time in an animated work.  They say the devil is in the details.  Well, then this is what makes this movie.  I almost drowned in the images on the screen.  The heart-felt story and just the way the story was eccentrically told stayed with me for a long long time after i left the theatre.  Not since a Studio Ghibli (Miyazaki-Takahata) masterpiece have made me feel this way.  Just for the details alone I could watch this over and over again.  Therefore I can't wait to buy the DVD so I can make this story mine.  I recommend this to all Miyazaki fans to check it out.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy.  You will.
