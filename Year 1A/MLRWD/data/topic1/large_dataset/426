I see all this raving about Richard Williams un-finished masterpiece and how this version is an abomination, well I'm here to set the record straight! Yeah Miramax cut scenes, but they were scenes that were very redundant and dragged on for way too long. This includes the destruction of the war machine that lasts about I don't know 20 minutes in the workprint. Also, major plot points aren't introduced until almost half way through, and until then you're wondering what's the point? What little story there is in this version, there is no more story in the original workprint. Miramax cut scenes to speed up the pacing. Also, originally, Tack and The Thief didn't say a word, which means over half the movie was silent! And while the Thief is still funny not talking, it makes his scenes drag on longer and it gets boring. While Jonathan Winters dialogue seems more like Rifftrax, it's funny and helps speed up the pace again! Also, how can we get invested in Tack's character if he doesn't speak? There were also no songs in the original. This is the only problem I have with Miramax's cut. But, while the songs are generic and forgettable, they're not terrible and the singing voices are at least good. So watch the "Re-Cobbled" cut if you wish, and while the animation and detail is brilliant, most scenes drag on for way too long and some scenes just get boring without any dialogue. But besides the added songs and dubbed dialogue, this version isn't that different from Wiliams workprint. This just speeds up pace and adds a little more humor.
