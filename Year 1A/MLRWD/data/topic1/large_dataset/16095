It is of considerable (psychological) interest to me how broadly distributed across the spectrum reactions to this season have been. Here is my reaction, for what it is worth.

This is the best season of BSG so far. Individual shows suffer from individual weaknesses, but as a whole *I* was unable to "put it down."
(1) "I" -- this is my more or less subjective opinion, and,
(2) It is a DVD and not a book ...

One of the strengths of the season was that the sexual violence was diminished while the psychological dysphasia was amplified. Character development was given some *SERIOUS* attention. And for all of his flaws -- in more than a few instances, because of them -- Colonel Tigh is something of a personal hero to me. After spending much of season 3 delaminating, he gets one of the best lines of the series in the final episode of this season. Of course, noble sentiment can often be a setup to an even greater fall -- this is BSG.

As noted, a few individual episodes were not as strong as others. But my biggest complaint against the *season* is that the writers/directors once again chose to end on a cliff-hanger. This seems rather sophmoric  on their parts; they evidently do not trust their audience to return after the break to see the 4th (and evidently final) season.

The DVD's are still worth owning. The stories are good and many of them are exceptional; while the acting, camera work, lighting and sets are consistently rich in that BSG sort of way.
