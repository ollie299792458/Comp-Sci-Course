This is the most boring movie I've ever watched. (SPOILER INCLUDED IN REVIEW). The director is big on silence, close-up shots, and long shots of nothing but black. It could have been saved with some kind of resolution, but it ends abruptly with no rhyme or reason. An abandoned mother can't support her two small girls (seven and four?) and after being kicked out of their apartment, Mom leaves the girls with her sister-in-law while going off to find her husband. The treatment of the older girl is very realistic, showing her anger, hurt and confusion. The magical aspect of the piggy bank has been covered elsewhere, and the scenes of the girls waiting at the bus stop are heart-breaking. Then sister-in-law gets a letter from Mom saying things haven't worked out with husband, and Mom can't take care of girls, so please take them to Mom's parents' farm. The girls are duly dropped off at the farm, where grandmother is kind and loving. They all go out to the forest to look for wood and other things, then we see a field, then the girls, hand-in-hand are climbing a hill and singing a folksong, and then the credits roll, leaving one with the feeling that surely there's more to the ending than this.

If you're teaching a class on how not to make a film, buy this one. If you want a good Korean movie, buy "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring." Also atmospheric, but not pretentious, like this one.
