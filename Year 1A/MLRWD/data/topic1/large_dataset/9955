I'm sorry, but i completely disagree with the review by foganime, (btw, calling it a cartoon-network level anime isn't really an insult. they show cowboy bebop, trigun, wolf's rain, and many more popular anime, what's wrong with those?) Sorry, back on topic. This anime not only delivers mind blowing graphics, but it brings back the questions of our minds and souls that the movie asked us. Be prepared to re-enter the world of Ghost in the Shell, but with different character designs (which are better in my opinion). Major Matoko Kusanagi is not only just as bad ass as before, but her design isn't as manly as in the movie. Batou now has longer hair, pulled back, and Togusa also looks better. The anime introduces new characters, including the Tachikoma, an intelligent mechanical being that have "cute" children voices that are in complete contrast to their mechanical features that would other-wise seem scary. This series really has nothing to do with the movie, since the movie didn't follow the manga and was pretty much made up outside the manga. The story has a great plot! They are tracking down the "laughing man", whose symbol is a smiley face with a hat and surrounded by the phrase "I thought what I'd do was pretend to be one of those deaf-mutes". I don't want to tell too much and spoil anything. I was amazed with all of it, and completely tranced! I've recently started watching the second season, and I'm already taken away with it as well! Please check it out, it's really excellent!
