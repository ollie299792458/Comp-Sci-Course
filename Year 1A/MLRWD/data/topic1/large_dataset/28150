I can remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. Actually there were about 7,500 Greek warriors at the pass.  Once the Greeks had found out that the Persians had found a way around the pass and were about to surround the Greek forces, Leonidas the Spartan king ordered all but his personal bodyguards (300), to retreat to fight another day.  The Persians who numbered 2,000,000 according to historians (200,000 is probably closer to the truth) were held for at bay for 5 days.  
When they finally surrounded the Spartans and saw that there were only 300, they asked for the Greek weapons.  "Molon Levee" ("Come and get them") was the answer.  The Persian army consisted of Persians, Egyptians, Jews, Assyrians, Nubians, Indians and even some defeated Greek states to name a few.  The Persian commander retorted "We have so many archerers that if each one shoots an arrow at the same time, they will block the sun".  Leonidas answered "Good, then we shall fight in the shade." This is in the movie if I remember correctly.  
The Spartans lost the battle but bought enough time for the Greek forces to rally and defeat the Persian army and navy within one year.  With Athens and her population safe, democracy flurished
Wait for the next movie about this battle with George Clooney and Bruce Willis(?) "Gates of Fire" .  Production should begin in the next year or so.
