Look I have seen some people diapprove of interracial relationships but not like this. I mean in this film the way Spike lee show's people being against these two people being together is as if's the End of the world or someting. And I remember the first time I saw this movie it was on TV But I sure as Hell didn'd buy it so I decided to bowor it from the library and there was some seens that was to strong for me to watch. Please Take my advice if you want to see a movie about interracial relationships then please don't buy this garbage. Instead get the movie called Far from heaven now that movie makes more sense. And let me tell I am so aganist Racism as a matter of fact I'm a Bible Believing Christian and Racism goes against my christian beliefs. And I can tell this that the Day is coming when we are all going to meet God on Judgment Day and People will be in either Heaven or Hell Which place we you end up in will depend on the decision you make about the lor Jesus Christ. I can tell you another thing their will be no such thing as Segregation of the races in Heaven or Hell. So you now have a Choich to make If you accept the lord Jesus christ as your lord and Savior and turn away from your sins and let him be the lord of your life then you will be saved if not then you will spend Eternity in Hell.
