Let's quit worrying about "poor" John Grisham and how Hollywood has done him wrong. IF Grisham was worried about his work being presented with integrity and staying within the plot , etc he has written, he's rich enough to buy his own studio and make movies of his own books. Bad old cigarette manufacturers are last years news. People (children) getting killed by guns is today's news.
Now to the movie - I truly enjoyed the little guy playing the game and winning out over the big guy. I'm also enthralled with American jurisprudence, jury selection , voir dire, etc. I'm becoming a John Cusack fan with every movie I've seen him in. And he gives a fine performance in The Runaway Jury. Gene Hackman - the ultimate arrogant, guy you love to hate - what a perfect pick for his role in this movie. The subtle manipulations in the jury room are just engrossing and ...well, fun to see.
There hasn't been a movie to compare to the classic "Twelve Angry Men". And Runaway Jury isn't even close, but still an entertaining movie. Forget about protecting poor little John Grisham from mean old Hollywood. Sit down and enjoy this movie!
