I'm not gon say much but this film is so inspirational since I seen over and over. I think it was the 1st jazz film I ever watched on Charlie "Bird" Parker. Yeah Forest Whitaker does a good job on this movie which win him a award for best film or supportive actor.

I'm happy I bought it on DVD instead on VHS which I didn't want.

It goes to tell all the details on what's behind Bird's life on how he got involved in music, how he got addicted by drugs, how he died, when did he became a legend in the jazz era, etc.

I recommend this along w/ Ray (which I like 'cuz it features Jamie Foxx which won him a whole load of accolades), Jazz-A Film by Ken Burns, The Miles Davis Story, Lush Life, Tupac: Resurrection, Let's Get Lost (the documentary on Chet Baker), Gil Evans and his Orch., Louie Bellson and His Big Band, Marsalis on Music (all volumes), just to name a few.

If u love jazz or if u love Bird, you must love this movie, it'll take u inside on being the best jazz player or best jazz listener yet.
