He was a man who was in need of an inspiration and they were a family who were in need of a fatherly figure, someone who would care for them.  It was a chance encounter and it was the one that created Peter Pan.  Inspired by true events, this story tells of J.M. Barrie, a famous playwritght, who was losing his creativity until he met the Lewellin family, a mother with four children who lost her husband to a jaw cancer.  She herself is not well and is often overcome by convulsive coughs.  Her family is falling apart, particularly Peter (the second youngest of the four) who has not been the same since his father's death and who is constantly concerned for his mother's health.  J.M Barrie brings life back into their family and hope while they, in turn inspire him to write a play that he will most be remembered for.  Underneath the main plot, J.M Barrie is also strugling with his failing marriage as he spends more and more time with the Lewellin family and eventually, his wife leaves him.  The only thing that seems to keep him afloat is Neverland, a place he created in his mind while a child.  He passes on that dream and hope to the Lewellin family as well.
  It is a beautifully written story with wonderful acting by Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, and the kids.  It's a love story of different kind, an inspiring story that is both sad and happy.  It truly is a jewel and a must see, for it is never too late to get in touch with your inner kid again.
