I am a huge Harry Potter fan and literally jumped to order the DVD the week before it came out. I have read all of the books and love them! With that said, read Book 4 first, or else you may find yourself a little bit confused on some things throughout the movie, some of the characters, and some of the plot points...BUT this film is a VISUAL FEAST! The effects, the sounds, the characters....SUPERB! If you've seen the other three films, you will love watching the how the young actors have grown up, and following their coming of age.

The actors have grown in age and acting ability as well.

You'll love the film (even if you haven't read Book 4) if you love a great adventure story, though you won't be clued in as to what a lot of things mean. For Harry Potter insiders, you will be on the edge of your seat with giddyness, eager to see how they transfer the beloved images in your head onto the silver screen ( I know I was), but you will also be a little perturbed at some of the things that they cut out! Winky the house-elf's part in the story in particular (which I think was relevant) and other aspects as well. But as the films do seem to change directors for every movie, this may be the reason...Each director's vision is different, as well as the screen writers...

Any Harry Potter movie will always be a winner...Pick it up today..
