The 1957, Bridge On The River Kwai, is a W.W.II film loosely based on a novel written about true life events. William Holden, as Major Shears, has escaped from a Japanese POW camp where Alec Guinness, as Colonel Nicholson, is the ranking British officer.  The cruel and fanatical Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been put in charge of constructing a railroad bridge over a river important to the Japanese.  Saito and Nicholson struggle over using officers to help build the bridge. Saito uses vicious and brutal punishment in an attempt to break Nicholson, but the colonel never gives in. A compromise is reached and Nicholson persuades his men to build the bridge is a very short time.  Meanwhile, Major Shears makes his way through the jungle and back to a base. He provides information about the bridge, but he truly wants to go home. He is forced into volunteering to guide a mission back into the camp to destroy the bridge.  The leader is Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who is very gun ho. When the two story lines mess, there is an exciting climax. Director David Lean uses the jungle scenery of Sri Lanka to appeal to the peace behind the madness of war. This film portrays the psychological effect of war on men and seems to place all men on the same level, regardless of country. It nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, in 1957.  A truly gripping story with beautiful scenery, it&#8217;s a classic epic that is a pleasure to watch.
