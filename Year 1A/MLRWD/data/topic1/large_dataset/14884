I was declared completely infertile by not one, but two fertility doctors. My FSH is 19 and AT BEST, they said I had a 3 to 5 percent chance on my own. They told me a donor egg was the only way to go and likened my ability of getting pregnant to a "false glimmer of hope".  I could not afford a donor egg at this time, so in preparation to receive a donor egg, I changed my diet, quit caffeine, processed foods, all sugars and decided to "eat clean".  I bought this cd,(and was kind of pissed off at the price) but figured, what the hell, Ive spent way more on infertility treatments.  I did the yoga everyday, read books about women who overcame the odds, journaled, did hypnosis and acupuncture.  I did this for 3 weeks after my last period, I am now 5 weeks pregnant, tomorrow marks 6 weeks, and my first prenatal appointment.  DO NOT LET the corny allopathic medical world tell you and your ovaries what you can and cannot do. You CAN do it!  Be kind to yourself, love yourself and tell yourself everyday your body is ready to welcome new life. Good Luck everyone, and Namaste ;)
