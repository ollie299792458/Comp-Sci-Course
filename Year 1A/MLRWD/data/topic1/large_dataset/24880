As stated in other reviews here, the movie is excellent in many dimensions - characters, historic realism, action. I would like to discuss an aspect not covered elsewhere.

One of the main themes of the movie is the conflict between Stachel's personal ambition and the squadron's cohesion as a fighting unit. Stachel is (with the possible exception of Willie Klugermann) the best pilot, but he's newcomer to the air war, and he realizes he has only a short time to prove it. He's starting out with zero kills and he needs to catch up.

The interesting thing is that Stachel's ambition leads to various decisions that enhance his reputation as a pilot, but hurt the goals of his squadron. The tragic flaw is that he's too able a pilot to be forced to leave, and his value as a propaganda weapon only gives him more opportunity to hurt the squadron. This leads to a predicament where they can't court-marshall him when he obviously deserves it (in fact they are forced to reward him with the Blue Max), and this leads to the squadron commander's resignation - thus has Stachel's ambition damaged the squadron's integrety.

This individual vs. group conflict is well dramatized in this movie.
