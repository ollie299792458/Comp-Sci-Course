OK... from the outset, for those of you who grew up knowing that Peter Sellers developed the magnificent character of Inspector Clouseau it's hard to accept anyone else in the role.  However, when I was watching this movie, I tried my best to put my own personal biases aside.

Steve Martin tries to act in the role of bumbling inspector, but he just doesn't seem to be putting his heart into the task.  His "acting" is little more than a poor French accent and some very bad martial arts moves (Sellars did so much better).

The jokes often fell flat.  They just were not funny and laboured the point.

Hollywood seems to be trying to re-do many older movies for a new audience (Freaky Friday; Yours, Mine, Ours; etc.) and now the Pink Panther (I loved the Freaky Friday remake).

This Pink Panther was little more than a "stink" panther.

There are some fantastic new release movies out there that deserve your time and money.  This is NOT one of them.
