It's too bad this set is not what it says it is. In other words, the movies are not "un-cut." Yes, the movie contents are not cut but each and every film in this set features the films where both sides of the frame are literally chopped off for no acceptable reason. The results are quite terrible considering the fact that many scenes obviously lack one of the duelists missing from the frame which totally disturbs the viewer and spoils the atmosphere. If you're willing to truely enjoy the movies to their maximum entertainment potentials, I would recommend buying the Japanese issued versions that should have the films in their original ratios though they cost tons more and come in different region codes.

"New Comments"
I have to appologize to everyone who took my previous upper review literally but after getting a new region-all/free DVD player (or it could have been the new TV, I don't know) I can say that, YES, you can watch ALL the movies on this set as it was originally shot. In other words, the movies are totally uncut. Again, My appologies to everyone! Get this set while it lasts!!!
