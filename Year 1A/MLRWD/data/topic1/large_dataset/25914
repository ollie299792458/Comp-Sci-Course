Well, can't say much more than the above reviewer about the actual movie itself. I am going to go into a bit more detail about the actual product though.
The double pack (Blu-Ray + DVD) is nice for me, as I sometimes watch movies in the bedroom where I only have a standard DVD player. Not much can be said about the DVD, it's just, a DVD really.

How many of you have loved a movie, and can't wait to watch it in HD? Well I think we have all had good AND bad experiences with this. Sometimes colors are left behind, frame rates are messy, and my favorite-terrible sound quality... Not something we want to see/hear when paying top dollar for the newest and "best" format. Then there are the jaw-droppers. You just can't believe your eyes and ears. Are you sure we aren't in the theater? Now that's what we want!

Okay, enough rambling on about Blu-Rays in general. Lets cut to the chase. The Grinch on Blu-Ray is good. Not horrible, not spectacular. You will be impressed, but not blown away. Is the Grinch one of your holiday favorites, like the above reviewer? Then GET THIS BLU-RAY! Is it just "another movie" that you like to have around and might only watch once in a blue moon? Then stick with (or just rent) the DVD version.

Well, that's all I've got to say about Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas [Blu-ray]
