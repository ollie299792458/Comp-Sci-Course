"The Incredibles" deserves every accolade it has received.  It is quality family entertainment!  A mid-life crisis has NEVER been this entertaining.  Helen Parr/Mrs. Incredible has REDEFINED the word "Supermom".  What a woman!  All the characters showed great courage, and I think it translates to the children watching the movie better than in more recent G- and PG-rated studio efforts.  And, of course the lesson about being special or average was not lost. This movie was never predictable or cliche in any way at any time (well, except for two seconds at the end when Mr. Incredible pulls his shirt open to reveal his supersuit underneath, but that one gets a pass).

I purchased this movie on DVD the day it was released, and now I think we're grinding grooves into it from watching it so much.  The two-disc set is more than worth the price, whatever you pay for it!

If PIXAR's quality was ever becoming questionable, then they have officially eliminated any ambiguity.  "The Incredibles" confirms PIXAR's place at the top of the heap for computer animation; the movie is a stroke of SHEER GENIUS!
