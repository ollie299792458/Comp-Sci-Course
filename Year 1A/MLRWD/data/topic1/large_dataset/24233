I will start out by saying that I do not like Jackie Chan movies at all.  I have NEVER been a fan of martial art movies, so when this came out, I really had no desire to see this either.  BUT, I love Owen Wilson, he's a great actor, so for his sake, I watched this, fully expecting to hate every second of it.  Did I forget to mention that normally I hate "buddy action flicks" also?  Well, wasn't I surprised!!!  Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan have a great chemistry together, and I have a newfound respect for Jackie Chan that I didn't have before.  He is a great comedic talent as well as a fine martial artist.  I was wowed by the fact that he does his own stunts.  I knew that before, but since I never saw any of his movies, I didn't realize how great they are.  The stunts, I mean.  I still don't like his other movies, but this is great, and Shanghai Knights was funny as well, although not as funny as this.  I'm glad I gave it a shot and I'm glad that it's part of my DVD collection.  I highly recommend this fun film.
