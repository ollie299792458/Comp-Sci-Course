This is Dane Cook as funny as he can possibly be just by acting as the seemingly hurt and kinda shy schoolboy persona after receiving a curse as child while playing spin the bottle with a group of other kids. When the bottle points to a Wendy Adams look-alike both her and Chuck are locked into a closet to supposedly make-out. But when both her dark demeanor and silly actions she learned from reading articles about love from magazines scares the little Chuck to death, he decides he's had enough and gets thrown from the closet from the little gal scorned. She then in her anger decides to visit a curse on Chuck basically condeming him to a life where he's the gateway for women to go through and be with sexually so they can then move on to find their true love. Then cut to where both he and his still overweight and obnoxious best friend are now grown up and trying the dating world and the fun really begins. Or should I say fun for us the viewers, because the now fully grown Chuck goes through dating hell on earth until he meets up with the beautiful but virtually non-acting Jessica Alba of whom he falls madly in love with after several feudal attempts to get her to go out with him, then finally succeding. It's at this point in the film that the movie really takes off and the laughs keep coming between his bad luck curse and his one true love being the biggest female klutz on the planet.
