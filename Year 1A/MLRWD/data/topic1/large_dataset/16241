James Franco's The Broken Tower is at once a brilliant telling of the life and works of poet Hart Crane and also an extremely difficult film for an average audience. I am not saying that one has to be an intellectual to "get" what the filmmaker is doing, but rather he must let himself be swept away with the sound of Crane and the images of Franco. Where else would one get a ten minute segment of a poem reading? You have to be able to go with this and not see it as static, but rather as an extremely moving bit of filmmaking. Franco, who wrote, directed and starred in he film, holds up a very real middle finger to those who will see his work as pretentious, even as he wears his heart on his sleeve(No pun intended!) This film is a labor of love that moves to the rhythms of Crane's work. It is both tough and tender at the same time and we are left, at the end,with a tremendous sense of loss as a great literary figure disappears under the waves of  rejection and disapproval. Congratulations Mr. Franco. You had the balls to make this film and you succeeded brilliantly.
