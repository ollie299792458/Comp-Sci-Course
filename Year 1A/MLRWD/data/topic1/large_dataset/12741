Johnny Depp is a great actor, we all know that. This movie shows skills we don't get to see in his other films. He's even quirkier in this one than usual but that side of him is put to it's best use as the character Sam. 
Mary Stuart Masterson does a good job playing a mentally imbalanced person and Adian Quinn is believable as the brother who 'needs her to be sick'. 
I watched this movie the first time years ago with my older brother. The sweetness made him cry... and he was embarrassed but loved it anyway. I've watched countless times since. 
It is the story of a mentally ill girl, Joon (Masterson), and her co-dependant older brother, Benny (Quinn), who losses a card game and has to take in the eccentric cousin of a friend. This is Sam (Depp). Sam and Joon enter into a relationship that threatens Bennie's control of Joon. It is more about the brother/sister relationship than Sam and Joon. It is complex if you pay close attention, but the comedy performance Depp gives makes it worth watching even if you don't.
