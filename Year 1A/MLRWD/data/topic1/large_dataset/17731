This film is a rude, crude and very funny romantic comedy focusing on the differences between the sexes. The female lead is a somewhat stereotypical career woman with a laundry list of requirements in a mate so impossible to fill that the only man in her life is a cat. The male lead is an outrageous television "relationship expert" who is blunt in the extreme about his cynical assessment about what men want from women. Needless to say, when the two first come together the fireworks aren't at all the romantic sort.

Through the course of the film, however, Abby and Mike gradually develop a grudging respect for each other. She allows him to use her to prove his theories about landing a suitable man, while he in turn finds himself attracted to a woman for reasons other than her breasts and other physical charms. When each has revealed his or her personal vulnerabilities, they see each other honestly and discover that the truth about what they really want in a relationship matches up much better than it seemed.
