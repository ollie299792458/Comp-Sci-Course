my opinion on this movie is that it was hard to beleive that none of the "heroes" were fatally shot or killed. They must have been shot at 50000 times for each of them and they were not even killed. They should rename this movie ,"The Invincible Four". I really find it hard to beleive that the wild west was like that. I look for a movie to stick to the boundaries it was given for ex. if this movie was set on boundaries like the Matrix .. where you can fly, dodge bullets, jump on horses, jump in the air and shoot people.. then it would have made more sense but it was not set on those boundaries making it a stupid , hollywood film that really was just .. terrible. Also you all know that Jake screws around too much and would have been shot.. Mal with his stupid two shotguns fighting 6 people in a bar and winning was absurd.. Emmet getting trampled on by horses and not seeming to break any ribs.. Paden messing around with all the females and not getting hiv.. it was very bad.
