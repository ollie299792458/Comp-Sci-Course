I guess I shouldn't have one into the movie anticipating it to be this totally awesome movie, but unfortunately I did.  In my opinion, it was kind of a "sleeper" in the beginning, just kind of dragging along.  Once Robin Williams character appeared (or should I say was heard), then it started getting better and I didn't feel like taking a nap.  The scenery in this film was fantastic, quite a sight for the eyes to see and behold!  I did chuckle quite a bit when Williams' character kept calling Pacino and referring to the daylight during night, and how he should get some sleep, etc.  Pacino did a great job in the movie, though I must say, he's got to do something about all the bruises under his finger nails, either that, or the camera shouldn't have focused on them so much.  And I have to say that Robin Williams did not disappoint me in the fact that he played a character so unlike the humorous characters he's play in years past.  He did a fantastic job!!!  
Though it's nice to see movies on the big screen, in my opinion I'd save your money and wait until it comes out on video and DVD to rent it.  If nothing else, the cinematography, views of Alaska and Robin Williams' performance was worth it.  
But again, this is just my opinion.  There seems to be other's on here who differ, which is why this country is so great as we are all entitled to our opinions.  Thanks for reading! :o)
