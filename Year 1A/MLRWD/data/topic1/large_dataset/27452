I think Pixar/Disney really hit the nail on the head in this 3rd addition to the Toy Story Series.  I truly believe that this is one of the best series (that wasn't originally written as a series) out there.

When Toy Story 2 came out, I remember being so worried that they were really going to blow it! Most sequel movies - especially cartoon sequels - are terrible!  When I went to see it I loved it!  It definitely matched the greatness and creativity of the first.

Then 10 years down the road I hear about a 3rd installment to the series.  I had a bitter sweet feeling in my stomach!  I was excited to be able to relieve the Toy Story magic yet again... but once again I was wrought with the fear of this being a big mistake.  I was so worried that Toy Story 3 wouldn't be able to measure up, but I held out hope.  And to my very great surprise it was every bit as good as I could've ever hoped for!  I laughed!  I Cried!  I was completely gripped by the story!

And the best part of all... was the way they decided to not take you back to Toy Story 2... rather than tag onto the work that was done so long ago, they made the story more believable by making all the characters older (as if the story never really ended - we just never saw what happened the years between 2 and 3).  I especially loved it, because it matched me in so many ways.  When Toy Story came out I was probably old enough to be about 3 or 4 years older than what Andy is portrayed... and here we are with Andy going to college, and me just graduating from college!  They really make you build that connection that makes the story seem that much more realistic.  I give this movie 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who loves a great story.
