This is without a doubt the best batman movie ever made, and one of Tim Burton's best. The story outline and the cast are better than perfect. When i saw the original Batman (1989) in theaters, it was superb with Tim Burton's signature right on it. Three years later, after his fabilous Edward Scissorhands (1990) i sat and watch Batman Returns (1992), which is by far my favorite Tim Burton movie. The make-up work for the penguin is unbelievebale, the music score was even better than the first, and the eerie dark background of it all is just spectacular.

  Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), both of them i sat through in theaters and couldn't stand it, basically sucked. Hopefully Batman Begins (2005) will turn up good.

How disappointing though are the dvds. The only thing you get are producting notes, every Batman movie deserves to be in a special edition dvd format; with theatrical trailers, tv spots, behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentaries and more. it sucks to see other movies that aren't even have as good as these to be loaded with special features.

  Well, anyway hopefully 'Warner Bros. we'll release these Batman gems into special edition dvd format they we're meant to be in someday. I'd highly recommend this movie to any 'Tim Burton or 'Batman fan.
