(This is a review of the 2012 Director's Cut of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.) I have been waiting for this Director's Cut for over 25 years. That it has appeared in 2012 is a minor miracle. Who knew anyone still cared? Who knew anyone still remembered that there was an original cut ending to LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS? And that the original (intended) and far superior ending is so well preserved and perfectly presented is ANOTHER minor miracle indeed. The restored ending looks just like the rest of the film - polished, professional, perfect. The biggest and best accolades must go to Richard Conway whose "miniature" work for the cut original ending is the best that I have ever seen. And I have seen them all - especially the films featuring miniatures, stop-motion and claymation from the 1950s through the 1980s! If only today's films that rely so completely on CGI and Green Screen but have NO REAL IMPACT whatsoever on the eyes, the senses or the emotions could be as effective as this little film's "special effects." And that's just it - there are no "special effects" here in LITTLE SHOP - the effects are real and they are "happening" right before your eyes not programmed by several hundred geeks hunched over several hundred computer keyboards. Here the plants seem present because they are present! AVATAR never reached that level of immediacy (and I liked AVATAR a lot, didn't we all?) but it's no LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. Hard to believe, I know, just buy this thing and try to prove me wrong. Thank you to everyone involved in bringing this Director's Cut to life. Thanks so much. It is thrilling!
