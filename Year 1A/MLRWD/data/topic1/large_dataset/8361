My first viewing of this film took place on a trans-continental TWA night flight, from LA to NYC, just prior to its being released in 1964.  The occasion for this "Sneak Preview" was brought about by the fact that the author of the original best selling novel, Eugene Burdick, was also on board this flight and TWA had obtained special permission for its viewing in his honor.  This particular flying experience was memorable for me for two reasons:  one; I was seated in first class next to the actress Jill St. John, who remained wrapped and lifeless in her mink coat until we touched down at Idlewild (JFK) airport, and two; just at the moment in the film when New York City is about to be wiped off the face of the earth by a Russian nuclear weapon, our jet became wrapped in a violent patch of air turbulence, which in no small way contributed to the events taking place in the film at that moment when the city is being obliterated in a blinding flash of light.

This film holds up quite well and still provides a thought-provoking and nail-biting experience - even without the turbulence.  The acting and overall production values are excellent and the black and white format only adds to the feeling of doom and desparation.  This early Sidney Lumet directorial  effort is a perfectly realized depiction of the events portrayed in the book this film is based on.  Highly recommended.
