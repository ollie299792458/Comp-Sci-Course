I've loved this movie ever since I saw it in the theatres.  It's creepy without being gross or vulgar.  Spoilers ahead, so if you've not seen the movie, stop here.  I love the way it starts out slow, with just a few minor creepy details, such as sliding across the kitchen floor, or the "TV people".  Who could ever forget the creepy tree or clown (YIKES!)?  Then it picks up with the disappearance of Carol-Ann.  Who could forget the classic lines, "There, here!" and, "Go into the light, Carol-Ann."?  Also, how many scary movies are out there that are well-done where no one dies?  "Watcher in the Woods" is another great example of creepy without vulgarity or death.  The sequels are cheesy, leave out the character of Dana (the actress was murdered after this movie was made), and betray the plotline of this movie.  So, as far as I'm concerned, this was the only poltergeist movie.  This movie's timeless, and the special effects are still good by today's standards. Nice effects without CGI; well-done indeed.
