I just purchased the "Strong Body, Ageless Body" fitness video in March 2009, and I love it. I am turning 40 this year and thought it was time to add strength training to my weekly activities.

Erin O'Brien works out at home by herself in regular workout clothes with minimal props - yoga mat and hand weights. You don't even need the yoga mat if you are on carpet. Her instruction is clear and motivating without being over the top crazy. She emphasizes correct posture and shows you the proper way to stand and position your body for each move. The pace is great! She keeps up a medium to fast pace with no distracting loud music or extra talking. A few pop up windows appear throughout the routine in the upper right corner to show you more advanced moves, but they are not distracting at all.

The video is set up in chapters, so you can play the entire routine (approx. 40 minutes) or play a chapter at a time depending on what you want to work on or how much time you have. She starts out with a very quick cardio warmup, then goes into 30 minutes of weight exercises, then slows down a bit on the floor and ends with a stretch. Erin's routine focuses on building all over body strength and she uses six pound hand weights. I am using four pound weights, which is the perfect weight for me. I encourage beginners to start with two or three pound hand weights.

I love Erin's mature style and this video is a very intelligent workout!
