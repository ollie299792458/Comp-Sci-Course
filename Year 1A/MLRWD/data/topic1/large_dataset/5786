Il Postino is a beautiful story of relationships. A postman develops a friendship with Pablo Neruda, a famed poet, and acquires a love for poetry. With light humor, Mario uses his new poetic talents and the help of Neruda  to gain the love of women, Beatriz in particular. Neruda deeply influences  the life of Mario and helps him to appreciate the metaphors of life. The  story of Il Postino is timeless and effectively demonstrates how one person  can change the life of another. Neruda becomes a father-figure to Mario and  Mario looks up to Neruda with awe and respect. Anyone who has had a special  effect on another human being's life or whose life has been positively  influenced can appreciate this story. 
From England, Michael Radford is  the Director of Il Postino which was filmed in Italy and based on a Chilean  novel. He does an extraordinary job incorporating a few historical and  political references into the story, as it develops during the 1950's and  communist revolts are occurring. Also, the friendship between Mario and  Neruda is accentuated by the references to poetry and metaphors throughout  the movie. There are many scenes where pure metaphorical conversation  dominates and the beauty of language is expressed. Even though English  subtitles are displayed, the charm of the Italian language is still heard.  I thoroughly enjoyed Il Postino's story of a meaningful friendship and an  expressive language of poetry and metaphors and I  recommend it to you!
