I'm a big fan of del Toro's films, film scripts and direction, not to mention his incredibly sensitive and gorgeous cinematography.  I love this movie but won't go into why here as this is a review of the 2-disk DVD.

I definitely recommend this set over the single disk theatrical release. Del Toro's discussion of the concepts he applies to his filmmaking and his fascinating alternative audio commentary alone are well worth the price of the extra disk, but additionally, the 2-disk set provides a great short in which the actors discuss their roles, with emphasis on the actor who plays both the faun and the Pale Man, along with the prosthetics and special makeup needed to make these bizarre creatures so believable. Very little CGI was used in the film, by the way. There's also a segment of the "Charlie Rose" show in which del Toro and two of his friends, fellow innovative directors and countrymen discuss their work and what it is they hope to achieve.

Luckily, there's not an English-dubbed version of the film on the 2-disk set, just a Spanish version with or without English subtitles. A version dubbed in English would be a desecration.  The extras are all in English except when the actors spoke Spanish, in which case English subtitles are provided.  Del Toro's excellent commentary and discussion are in English.

I even watched the film without sound or subtitles just for fun, and I saw so much more, despite the fact I've seen it several times already. So many levels so magnificently done! Bravo!
