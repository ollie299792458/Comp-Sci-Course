I'm thrilled to see this release!!!
Some other folks seem to be complaining about the choices for the movies on this set. I'm quite happy with them all things considered. First off realize virtually ALL of their movies are available to buy on DVD anyhow right now if you check E-Bay regularly EXCEPT these 3, The Big Store, Go West, & At The Circus. These are the only 3 to never have made it to ANY DVD release anywhere in the world to my knowledge. So this set completes their catalog to DVD you might say. Some are on the now deleted Image catalog and others are imports, (of which I might add are of very good quality). Certainly it would be nice to see another set or 2 released and get their entire catalog back out and currently available at the retail level, but this fills all the gaps. With the addition of the 3 I mentioned above I will now have all of their movies on DVD so I'm quite pleased even if this is all that gets reissued. I can dream and hope that they would remaster them all given some are looking very  poor, but unless a Criterion or some rich fan (Ted Turner please!) gets the bug to restore them this is the best we get. Cocoanuts is probably the worst one for it's overall condition.
