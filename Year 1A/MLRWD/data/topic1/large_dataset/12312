Generally I find that when I enjoy a certain celebrity, I tend to watch their older movies. In this instance, it was Keira Kinghtley and I was backtracking her older films and came across "The Hole."

 Upon watching this film, I found it quite enjoyable. The casting was well done, however Thora Birch looked like the only actress convincing as being about age 15...Keira looked about 19 or so, but oh well. The story was intriguing, leading to some second-guessing. If you've seen "Basic," this sorta the same type of pyschological thriller, just a different setting and different circumstances. Cinematography was alright, but nothing special. I did notice a few, minor no-no's for how actors were captured in close up shots, but it's negligable.

 Being a foreign film, it's obvious not too much can be expected in terms of the film's scope. The same musical piece was used a lot, and there was a lot of simplicity in things. Oh, and be aware that I guess British films aren't that stiff about nudity ratings like the US, so be prepared for a fair amount of nudity...a lil more than I was expecting, but I guess that goes to show you how strict the US rating system is, and thus what we've been raised upon... quite a shock.

 Overall, I was pleased with this film... quite solid and not too long. Had the film had a little bit larger scope and some more development of characters and such, I prolly would have given it a 5. Either way, a good movie.
