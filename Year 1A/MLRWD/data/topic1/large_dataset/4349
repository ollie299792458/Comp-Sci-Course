I certainly understand everyone's frustration about the original ending not appearing.  I too have been waiting YEARS to see this, and thought that we were finally going to actually see the footage with this DVD.  Alas, we get 12 minutes of Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer and Andrew McCarthy talking about the ending, why it didn't work, etc.  The only one who sticks up for the Duckman is Annie Potts!  Even Jon Cryer tells us all to move on!

Who knows - maybe one day we'll see it.  But while I'm disapponted in not seeing that original ending, I'm very excited about this DVD.  The featurettes are great, and are very informative.  I haven't listened to the whole commentary yet, but it was a little dull (what I heard so far), BUT I'll take that over no commentary at all.  And while a trailer would have been nice, as someone else said, for $10, you really shouldn't complain TOO much about this.  If there is one thing we've learned with DVDs, there never seems to be a "definitive" version - there is always another version lurking around the corner.  So maybe one day we'll see the original ending, but for now, I'm enjoying this DVD.

Plus, it's got MOLLY RINGWALD people!!  C'mon!  It's awesome!!
