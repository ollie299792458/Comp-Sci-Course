will she (Julia Roberts)win an oscar or not.Like a few others I know I can see her or not.This time I choose to see what a lot of people knew,that she can act.At first you think this is the usual story,girl with  heart,poor,single,alone.Enter man on bike called George,( Aaron  Eckhart).Then theres the laywer Ed Masry(Albert Finney).Gruff hard boiled  but again has a kind heart under that bull interior.Story true, little  people take on the large corperation this time a water company.Roberts give  something more than playing the part of this heroine,she shows herself.This  is her picture all the way and the surporting cast is execellent,although  you don't see Eckhart or Finney alot they suport Roberts though out this  film.Even though the water company is the villian, you have a smaller one  played by another fine actor name  who is ask to come in by Finney  and help take the case the rest of the way.Roberts is both excellent and  frustrated by this out landish plan.She shows that she may look a tart but  she really has no label on her.Those that are to yet get to watch this  amazing film should not wait for the video or dvd,pay the money and  enjoy.IF THE ACCADEMY want to give there oscar to the best acctress then  please let them give to Miss Julia Roberts.
