The first thing I would like to make clear is that this is one of those unique movies that won't please everyone. Your great Aunt Bessie probably won't make it through the first ten minutes. But if you have ever described one of your favorite movies that never made it big in the mainstream, as an "UNDERGROUND-CULT-CLASSIC", and watch it many times and recommend it to your friends that have never heard of it, then this flick is for you! This is part "black-comedy", part drama, part ridiculing some of the "phonies" in life that we all secretly despise, and even includes a "TALKING GOLDFISH" with perhaps the best line in the movie. It's true this film has a core setting much like OFFICE SPACE but the absolutely tremendous acting performance by Christian Slater creates some very real touching moments in the midst of the surreal bizarre story lines. A great acting job includes more ingredients than just dialogue. If you pay attention to the nuanced facial expressions that embody Christian's work I believe you will be very impressed. Elisha Cuthbert also shows her acting chops with most of her screen time spent in a wheel chair. There is also some unique attention grabbing camera work that adds to the gleam of a well-made movie. If you enjoy "cult-classics" this is a good movie for you.
