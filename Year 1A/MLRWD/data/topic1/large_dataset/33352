Great action movie, with well balanced action and suspense. Not too much "dramas" or other pseudo-emotional boring subplots that had been added to today's "action" movies making most of them a pain-in-the-guess-where... 
 If you haven't seen it, you should. You'll feel why it became a synonymous to the genre. 
 The 5 Star Edition DVD is simply top. Video transfer is very well done. DTS sound is amazing, shaking furniture on explosions and spinning around you under fire. 
 The extras have the first photo album I've known to be worth seeing: it's interactive opening the doors to many unused or deleted scenes. Other features are also interesting, but what really shines is the editing room. There you are allowed to edit three scenes being given lots of camera angles to choose from and construct it the way you prefer. At the end of the scene you can view it the way you mounted it and compare it to the movie's edition. There's also a sound edition feature that's also very intersting, but the editing room will entertain you for more hours. 
 Movie: great - action movie focused on... action! 
 DVD: even greater - top video, sound and extras. What more could you want?
