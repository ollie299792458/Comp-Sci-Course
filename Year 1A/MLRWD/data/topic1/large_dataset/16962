Forget that this isn't the movie that everyone hyped it to be. It's just a very solid horror movie. Something that we horror fans don't see much of. Most of the crap that hits theatres or our rental store's shelves aren't half this good. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the nostalgic use of the woods and music to take yourself back to movies like Swamp Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and The Evil Dead. The characters are very underrated as well. Joey Kern, from Super Troopers, plays a great typical, stoner boyfriend who surprises us all at the end. Dennis, the blonde mulleted boy outside the convinience store is somewhat of a standout in the film. His 'pancakes' scene is rib crackingly funny. The dialogue is, for the most part, entertaining if not hysterical. And Rider Strong aka(always known as) Sean Hunter made me forget his troubles with Mr. Feeny and focus on his drooling over Jordan Ladd. And how could you not like a movie that features two of the main stars of Detroit Rock City, Guiseppe Andrews and James Debello? Neither dissapoint here either. Some of the best lines come from these two; When asked to give one good reason to steal a Snickers bar, Debello replied "the nougat?" and Officer Winston may well be the best County Sherriff ever protrayed on film, "Everything is ok ma'am, just go inside and have yourself a nice 40oz". For all the gripers and groaners, give Cabin Fever a break. Eli Roth knows what he's doing and he is taking his time developing into one the best modern horror directors so he can endulge is fun movies like this. I hope Roth continues to deliver these campy, gorey movies I live for.
