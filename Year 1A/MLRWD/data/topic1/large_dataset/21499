Daniel Johnston is never going to be a big name.  Most people will only hear of him through Kurt Cobain and/ or Sonic Youth endorsements.  Many of these people will pretend to like Johnston, or will actually like him, but more for the story.  And Daniel Johnston's is a story like none other, and this is the most fitting documentary of his story.

I was trying to explain to my wife what, exactly, made Daniel Johnston a great talent.  Sure, he's obsessive and prolific.  But to many, the songs are still unlistenable.  The best way I can explain it is that the songwriting is strong, even though the singing/ guitar playing is not.  He is, however, a strong piano player.

Anyhow, this documentary will have you laugh and it has the potential to move you to tears be it from the oft sad occurences, his father's tear-jerking remembrances, or the uncertain fate of an American eccentric who is so dependent on other people.

Are the Brian Wilson references warrented?  Yes.  But Daniel Johnston is a budgeted, masking-tape Wilson.  This documentary shows that, no matter what the odds, the situation, Daniel will always persue art in one form or another (be it cartoon, paint, music, film, etc.)

This is a great documentary.  (Though I feel his new band is mildly exploitive).
