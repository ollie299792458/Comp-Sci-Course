Those of you who may be a fan of Robert Downey, Jr. from Iron Man and/or Tropic Thunder should see him in his greatest role as Charlie Chaplin.  Chaplin is a wonderfully nuanced portrayal of one of the true geniuses of cinema with an all-star cast which included Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd, Diane Lane, James Woods, Geraldine Chaplin (playing her actual grandmother), Marisa Tomei, a very young David Duchovny, and Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  But since he is at the center of essentially every frame, the movie's success rides on Downey's performance of perhaps the greatest movie icon ever, and Downey succeeds brilliantly.  Whether emulating Chaplin's physical pratfalls or showing his underlying passion and commitment to his art, to his compassion for humanity, to the real life pathos of his love life, Downey's performance is one for the ages.  The movie's memorable ending shows Chaplin's triumphant return to America in 1972 and being awarded an honorary Academy Award while showing Peter Bogdanovich's homage to the real Chaplin.
