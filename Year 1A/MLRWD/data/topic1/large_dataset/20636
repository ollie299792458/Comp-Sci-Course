I remember this movie from my teens. That being some 30+ years ago is why this movie is a good one to have in your library. Not for the cinematic exp.(There really isn't one) The acting and lighting and dialogue are all really bad, there is no reason from a technical
point to have this. The real reason is... Like most all of us 50 somethings on rainy Saturday afternoons you could find us in front of
the Tube watching Creature Double Feature or some similar type of format. Yes they had Godzilla and King Kong, Rodan, Monster X and so many others. Not a total waste of time on a Saturday? Me and my four brothers were all there watching it together (BTW we all thought that woman singing on the boat should have been eaten for the singing alone). It was family time when the world and life were very different. Fast forward to today, I don't think they would make a Movie like War of the Gargantua's today.
But just last month my brothers were all home with Mom and Dad a rare occurance with time so limited today and the logistical aspect of 5 families and all. We watched this movie again and the memories that came back were worth more than 100 times the movies cost. I'm glad I could find it on Amazon it was the only place that had it. So if you like cheesy Monster Movies and used to watch them with your brothers or sisters, friends, etc. That's where the magic comes in, no matter how bad the technical aspect may be, the time spent with family and friends and the memories and priceless!
