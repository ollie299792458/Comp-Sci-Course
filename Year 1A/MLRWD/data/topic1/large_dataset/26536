As you may have read from the other reviews, the plot revolves around a boy and a group of thieving dwarves who have stolen a time travelling/chronology map from God and go from one place to another. it is amusing, it has good special effects. When I first saw the movie I was a bit puzzled about some things I thought wrong: (1) Napoleon had a false metal hand which he tucked inside his shirt and he would not accept the surrender of an Italian city that he had defeated (2)Robin Hood had a tough guy punch each of the poor people that he gave wealth to (3) Agammemnon kills the minotaur. And, in the beginning, the boy's parents are watching a game show, wherein the contestants are being slowly killed.

SPOILER ALERT: it turns out that the "theft" was arranged by God all along in order to make a trial run. So the initial history of the human race was later changed to what we know today.

Now, what I found to be hypocritical. The film was made at the time that Western Europe and North America was going through an intense Luddite-like anti-technology obsession. The film's message is that technology is, in itself, evil. So . . . the director used the latest in film technology to drive the message home that technology was evil. Riiiiight.
