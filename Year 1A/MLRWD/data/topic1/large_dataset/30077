Pitch Black is a good Saturday night creature feature.  If you want deep science fiction see Blade Runner, Alien, or The Lathe of Heaven.  If you want thrills from wave after wave of vicious bugs, then Starship Troopers or Pitch Black fits the bill.  Neither one will make you scratch your head, but they're fun for an hour and a half.
Two minor complaints though.  1) They never really go into the ecology of the planet.  How can anything live in such a desolate place?  Were there large underground caverns teaming with life that could support these carnivores?  Or did the bugs subsist purely on a diet of scientists and crash-landed astronauts?  2) The eclipse was a little too convenient.  Ok, the two suns go into an extended eclipse once every 22 years.  The coincidence that our heroes (and one anti-hero) crash land right before this rare solar event was a touch distracting to me.
But I admit that I'm being nit-picky.  If you take it for what it is, Pitch Black is very worth the price of admission.
