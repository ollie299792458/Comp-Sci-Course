On the surface, Jumanji appears to be an actual child's game, meant for amusement purposes, with a surprising twist. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that Jumanji itself is NOT a game, but a metaphor for the difficulties our souls must face before we can confront our fears. At the beginning of the film, Alan Parish is burdened by his inability to confront his fears; a problem which may, in an almost Freudian manner, stem from a strained relationship with his own father. "Jumanji" is a physical representation of this burden, and since at the time he is unable to confront it, he is pulled into the jungle of his fears, unable to escape. He overcomes his flaws not only when he "beats the game", but, as we see thanks to both Van Pelt and Alan's father being played by the same actor, when he finally has the strength to confront his father. I did not care for the subplot involving jungle animals wreaking havoc on the city, but this is merely an unhelpful footnote in a powerful story of one boy's self-actualization.
