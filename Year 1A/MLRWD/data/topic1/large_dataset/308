I was five years old when Bonanza first came on the air back in 1959 and as far as I can remember, our family never missed an episode the entire 14 years it was on TV. Now that Pernell Roberts and David Dortort have recently passed away, we have lost all of the Cartwrights and their creator.  So it is wonderful to finally have in my hands the OFFICIAL first season of Bonanza, Volumes 1 & 2.  Unfortunately, legalities prevent the entire 14 seasons from being officially released in the US (although you can pick them up in Germany!)  Other than that, you can search for "Best of" releases, but the music we all know and love--the anthem of the Ponderosa--won't be on those discs because of copyright infringements.  And the quality of the picture won't be there either--they will seem like bootleg copies---probably because they pretty much are!  They are copied ad nauseum from public domain copies and you'll get grainy pictures--but not with THIS DVD collection!  No, the Theme Music is there and the sound is crisp and sharp!  The production values are perfect and the picture you'll see is also sharp as if it were the first time you ever saw the show!

I was misled by those who bought it before I did, that the set included certain television specials commemorating Michael Landon, but no---the extras are merely video tapes of David Dortort reminiscing about the actors and the show in general.  They are still interesting, but very brief clips.

Nevertheless, if you are a die-hard Bonanza fan, you will love the Official Bonanza DVD set.  All I can say is Hurry up and release the rest of the 14 seasons before we're too old and on fixed incomes!!!
