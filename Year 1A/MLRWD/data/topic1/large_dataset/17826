I would highly recommend this film to anyone.

I'm 25-years-old and have only just watched Out of Africa for the 1st time.  Yes believe it or not.  Of course I have seen glimpses of it before when advertised but somehow never got round to watching it.  I have heard the theme tune before by John Barry which was so beautiful and inspiring in itself, then again all his work is.

There are films which are ok and there are films which are epics.  This is one of the later and one that will be memorable throughtout your life.

I'm almost quite glad that I have not seen this film before and can really enjoy it now.

I love the setting and how it manages to capture a different time altogether.  The vastness of the plains which even as a cinema watcher, make your eyes drawn to the horizon and beyond.  The colours of Africa and the dawns stand out in my mind.  I think the storyline is progressive and you have to think and allow time to pass and you are captured by the characters and their interactions.  It's not laid out on a plate like other romances where it's clear to see why, how, where etc.  This is such a lovely romantic heart capturing film..........simple lines such as "don't move...........but I want to move" makes your heart race as fast as Linford Christie!!

It's a perfect film for any complete and utter old fashioned romantic.....................I'ld give it 10/10 every time.

I never expected to like it as much as I did.

The theme tune just continues the feeling you get from watching this feel.  It's exhilarating and thought provoking.  It's a film that cannot just be seen with the eyes but felt and heard with the heart.

Don't take my word for it, go out and rent it and you are guaranteed a most memorable night.

You will be left feeling so much appreciation for the work that went into the production of this film.
