An open letter to all techies out there, and I know you're out there:

You haven't seen anything until you have seen the potent combination of Blu-Ray technology and the new wide screen process called "Smilebox"

What is Smilebox, you say?

Smilebox is the best thing to happen to home video since letterbox.  And for a super wide screen movie like the superb How the West Was Won, it's a marriage made in heaven.

Smilebox takes regular letterbox and literally turns it on its head! Instead of a sharp right angle letterbox image, Smilebox curves the picture up at the top, and down at the bottom. Like a smile! It really conveys the feeling of watching a Cinerama movie in the theater!

This unique process is perfect for the ingenious Cinerama process, developed in 1952 to get people back to the movie theaters and away from the growing number of television sets. And boy did it!  This is Cinerama was actually the number one grossing movie of 1952, even though it played in only a handful of Cinerama equipped theaters! People often lined up around the block.

The 1962 Cinerama movie How the West was Won, featuring an all-star cast, 3 directors, and a socko surround sound system, was also one of the top grossing movies of its year, even though it also only played roadshow engagements in theaters properly equipped with the super-wide screeen process. It virtually gave a "3-D" effect without glasses.

Try watching this one in the dark! That will really blow your socks off!

With Smilebox, Blu-Ray realizes its full potential.
