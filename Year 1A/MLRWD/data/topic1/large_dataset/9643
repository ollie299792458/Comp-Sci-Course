Was this movie meant to be a parody of its predecessor?  No.  Did it turn out that way?  In my eyes, yes.  If you're looking for the same level of writing, directing and/or acting as "Donnie Darko", you'll be sorely disappointed.

The first thing the viewer should take note of--or rather, beware of--is the fact Elizabeth Berkley is billed near the top.  God bless her, I never thought she'd be able to top "Showgirls" as the worst movie she's been in..."S. Darko" definitely gives the formerly mentioned flop a run for its money.

Oh, and yes David J. Brown (most helpful customer reviewer), I did watch it all the way through.  I just don't happen to agree with your opinion of the quality entertainment this flick provides.  I won't bother with the plot: you can see other reviews for that, or, if you have the patience and can put up with the pain of wasting a couple hours you'll never get back, you can try to figure it out for yourself.

Do note, however, that I'm not totally slamming "S. Darko"--I did give it two stars: it deserves those for the special effects, sometimes interesting cinematography, and Ms Berkley's pretty face.
