"Poltergeist" is one of my favorite horror pictures and I just introduced my 18-yr-old niece to the film with this blu-ray edition.  She found it very scary and was stunned it was only rated PG (considering the year it was released).  The picture and audio quality of this edition are both wonderful but, as noted by other reviewers, there are no real extras.  Because of all the behind-the-scenes drama I have a feeling it will be a very long time before we see an edition which includes some really meaty extras.  The book was nice, and had a few facts I wasn't aware of (the change from an "R" rating and the use of real skeletons on set...eww!)

Be aware, however, that like all previous versions the really severe edit between the family kitchen and the neighbor's house is still there - I don't think there can be a clean copy anywhere in Hollywood if this is still going on.  I know it supposedly has something to do with Pizza Hut being dissed in the scene, but since it was one line I really think they could've muffled it and kept the complete scene instead of cutting a big chunk.

This is a classic, highly entertaining horror movie and well worth watching again.  If you have an older version of the dvd (or even the vhs tape), now is a good time to upgrade it to blu-ray.
