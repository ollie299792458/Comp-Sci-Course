Despite piecing together an entertaining film, Ben the director, unintentionally illustrates the very generational disconnect Jack disdains. Ben misses many opportunities to delve into the essence of this consummate newsman by getting lost in the minutia, because he - unknowingly - can not comprehend the dynamic of this brilliant man. I found myself mesmerized by his story and wanted to know more about why someone, with so much talent, left the news business to opt for a life of solitude. At one point, Ben forcefully attempts to ask what Jack perceives to be mundane and irrelevant questions to which Jack is annoyed by and says so. This is where Ben loses sight of his subject and exposes his complete apathy towards very real and dangerous events Jack points out. Ben goes on to suggest Jack is unbalanced for being exactly who he is - a journalist. This is where Ben's naivete shines and really drives home the point Jack has peppered throughout the film without Ben even realizing it.

Even though Ben is obliviously outwitted, there is a fatherly quality to the way Jack interacts with him. What I found the most entertaining, however, was how Jack's back-and-forth with the audience was so genuinely quick and funny. It made me wonder how someone who is so magnanimous and enlightened could go undetected for so long. I feel so cheated. He should have been right up there with the Murrow's and the Kronkites and I'm sad it took me this long to find him. I want to see more of him soon.

Thanks Ben, if you're reading, for putting this amazing movie together and I hope one day Jack finds it in his heart to do a podcast for us all. I'll be the first one in line to listen.
