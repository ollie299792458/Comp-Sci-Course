Like an absorbing book that you can't put down, this film is compelling. Usually I prefer to see films alone to be able to concentrate fully, but this film about a dysfunctional family captures complete attention even to the credits and beyond regardless of distractions.

Lasse hallstrom, the quiet achiever of directors has used his skills and chosen cast to produce another masterpiece of entertainment. It is a roller coaster of emotional involvement from bemused and even grotesque fascination of the very fat 500lb Mama to the inspirational admiration of the unselfish Gilbert Grape (Johhy Depp) who holds his family together and cares totally for Arnie, (Leonardo DiCaprio) his mentally handicapped brother.

DiCaprio certainly made a mockery of the Oscar voting system by not winning the Oscar after being nominated for his award winning portrayal of the unfortunate Arnie.

I am so pleased that I have had the opportunity to see this wonderful film and certainly recommend it to you.
