I'm loving these terrific twofers WB Home Video's been putting out recently. This ties with their HOUSE OF WAX/MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM double feature as my favorite dvd release of the past few months (and if you haven't picked up THAT puppy, boy are you missing out...MYSTERY's one of the most uniquely fascinating "Golden Age" horrors, and the dvd transfer is gorgeous...but I digress...)
Both JEKYLL AND HYDEs are excellent examples of "old school" horror at its finest, presented in ravishingly lovely crisp transfers, better than they've ever looked before on home video. But for me, the real treat of this edition is the commentary by Greg Mank, my personal favorite Golden Age Horror scholar (and isn't it about time somebody reprinted his "IT'S ALIVE! The Cinema Saga of Frankenstein"?). His commentary here is witty, gossipy, insanely informative, always entertaining. Much of the content  previously appeared in his splendid book HOLLYWOOD CAULDRON, but  so what? Having it synched-up to the actual movie is a kick....
Good job, WB folks! Now, how about a DR. X / RETURN OF DR. X double dvd....?
