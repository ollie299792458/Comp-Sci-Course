TOOTSIE is the tale of Michael Dorsey, a brilliant New YorkCity actor who is unemployable, because he is so disagreeable to work with. In a desperate act to get work he disguises himself as Dorothy Michaels, an older Southern woman, and lands a job in a soap opera. Soon he finds not only is he a better person as a woman, but he is falling in love with his costar, played by Jessica Lange.
TOOTSIE has a complex and superb script, and great performances all around. Bill Murray is a standout as Hoffman's writer/roomate, as is Sydney Pollack who cast himself as the troublesome actor's agent, who has to cope with his client's antics. Also, surprisingly, TOOTSIE's cinematography is very expressive and of a high quality.
The real highlight of TOOTSIE is not Dustin Hoffman in a dress, but rather the film's complex messages. One thing TOOTSIE comment's on is society's resentment of powerful or assertive women, and how meeker or more submissive women are often times used and taken advantage of. The film also relates how unattractive women are usually overlooked by men, because they are judged physically and not by their personalities.
TOOTSIE is a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of MRS. DOUBTFIRE, highly enjoyable, and very watchable too.  END
