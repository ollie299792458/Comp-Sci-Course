Being both a college debater and someone who was active in the civil rights movement in the 60s I was looking forward to seeing this film about an earlier time (the 1930s) when debate was more popular but civil rights were much less real.
I believe the film succeeded both in its portrayal of debate (both its sport and its elegance) and its portrayal of the struggles for minority rights. It is true that the debates pictured were much shorter than most real debates, but still some of the concepts of argument and evidence, etc. came through.
I was especially  impressed that Denzel Washington sent his debater actors to a debate school which he created for them where they could get some understanding of how real debating works. I learned this and also about Washington's insistence on historically authentic music in some of the excellent special features on this "collector's edition." I also was most impressed that Washington got  together with some of the individuals who had actually been involved at Wiley College in the debate season that brought them great national prominence. Some of his conversation with these individuals is included in "The Great Debaters: An Historical Perspective.
The movie had many outstanding actors and it provided many moments of excitement and also brought me to tears at times. It shows the tremendous courage of many almost unsung heroes of a time in our history which we need to remember.
