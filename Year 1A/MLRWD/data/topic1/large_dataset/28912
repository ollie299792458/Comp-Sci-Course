Kudos to Ridley Scott for this film that still holds its own after more than twenty years.  The set is incredibly done and still looks futuristic, especially the room where Dallas communicates with the ship's computer, Mother.  Creature effects are very well done, although when Ripley blows the alien into space at the end, it looks more like a man than a bloodthirsty animal.  It is still suspenseful and scary, as a face-hugging parasite attaches itself to Cain's face as he is surveying an ancient alien ship with thousands of egg pods lain in the bowels of the vessel.  Cain is brought back on board and later the facehugger detaches and dies.  During dinner, a vicious little creature bursts out of Cain's chest and runs away.  In a matter of hours, the alien grows to roughly a human's size and begins to pick off the rest of the crew members one by one.  It's now up to a handful of stalwart men and women to destroy what Ash classifies as the perfect organism.  To quote him, "I can't lie to you about your chances, but you have my sympathies."  Some complain that the film takes too long to get going, but if it moved at a non-stop pace, the audience would not get a chance to identify with the characters and grow to like them, or dislike them.  "Alien" is ideal for a patient person with a good attention span; it is people like that who will appreciate the film the most.  By the by, the Nostromo's explosion is still visually stunning and utterly fantastic.
