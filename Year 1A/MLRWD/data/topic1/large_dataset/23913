This is one of my favorite movies - and it certainly stars one of my favorite actors and actresses.  Burton and Taylor are expert in their delivery of Shakepeare's classic tale of the taming of Katarina, a woman with no desire to marry and certainly no desire to succumb to the wiles of any man.  The most modern of women characters from a time period when women either married or turned nun; the story shows not only the strength of a woman, but proves wrong the endurant misbelief that women are the weaker sex.

The disk sold thru Amazon is typical of this era film and release of such: nothing special about it, but nothing erred or wrong that I can relate.  I am purely happy to own a copy of this movie, and it could have arrived months late and half opened and I would still be happy.  Not a bad price, either, considering this is a wonderfully directed and acted film.  The sets, the costumes, the hair styles - the adaptation of the play to screenplay - it's a beautiful film that will have you laughing, even if you aren't a fan of the bard.
