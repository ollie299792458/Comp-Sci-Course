How can an eleven year old movie feel more dated than its decades older subject matter? When it chooses to concentrate the zeitgeist of a decade into a simple-minded "don't do drugs" morality tale. In addition, the film is cynical, naive, historically incomplete, borderline homophobic, and regionally offensive to both New Jersey and New York City! No plot point is fully explored, and some are just abandoned mid way through (the father?!). And despite the critical accolades, I thought Mike Myers portrayal of Steve Rubell was just another vampy facet of his Austin Powers or Cat in the Hat character. He played it as more of a klutzy impression than a living person with real flaws. Had any single uncomfortable scene with Rubell, and there were many, been given more than five minutes of screen time, it might have been a very different and effective film.

In the end, "54" doesn't have a leg to stand on. It can't successfully moralize against the supposed slick emptiness of disco because it is far emptier at its core, and the story it's trying to tell us is older than the hills. All this movie did was make me long for a time when everything wasn't so corporate and sanitized. My favorite character is probably the recreation of the giant half moon face, with the automated light up coke spoon, hung above the stage in the club. Just imagine telling your investors you want one of those today!
