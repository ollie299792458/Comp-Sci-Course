Granted, I am a Christopher Guest fan (although I liked Spinal Tap less than Guffman and Best In Show)  Granted, I am a former 60s folksinger who performed solo, as part of the duo of Cam and Randy and even a few weeks as a fill-in in the New Christy Minstrels.  But the fact is my wife and I LOVED Mighty Wind so much we went back to see it AGAIN in a different theatre just a week after seeing it the first time.  We loved the gentle humor, the wacky satire. ("I don't much care for folk music," says the PR guy.  "Me too!" enthuses the PR woman who thinks she "shares a brain" with her boss.)
The actors in this film have become like family to us since so many of them were in other Guest films. (Granted, I did work with Paul Dooley in the 1979 Robert Altman film, HEALTH.)
It was a delight to see how John Michael Higgins stepped up to the plate as a singer and an arranger this time.  Jane Lynch, whom I have admired ever since her bit in The Fugitive, perfectly nailed the "high on life" attitude of the New Christy... uh, sorry, the New Main Street Singers.
I admired the actors for learning to sing and play but it was still a pleasure to spot pro musicians like Joe Godfrey and Bruce Gaitsch.
But, aside from the wonderful humor, we were surprised to be sincerely moved (by the kiss in the rose song, for example) and we were delighted to find the music so entertaining in its own right.  (Yes, we actually marched right downstairs to Tower and purchased the soundtrack after we saw the film the first time.)
We found this film a wonderful alternative to the "cruel humor" so common on screen these days in films by ex-SNL folks and others.
In short - a little late for that, I guess - WE LOVED IT!
