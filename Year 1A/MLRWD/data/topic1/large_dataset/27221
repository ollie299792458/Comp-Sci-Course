THANK YOU for checking out my reviews. I recently have been looking into Tom Selleck's catalog of projects and have been pleased with the results. I am not a reader of the JS book series, so I had no idea what to expect. But after recently watching a Jesse Stone feature on CBC in 2009, I realized this was a series, and decided to go back and explore this product from the beginning. While 'NIGHT PASSAGE' is described as the official 'prequel' to the first JS movie and sets everything up (and is really a LOUSY title, so DON'T be deceived!), it wastes no time in pulling viewers into the characters world. Excellent production values, beautiful photography and exceptional acting compensate for what seem to be standard crime-noir thrillers where only slight surprises occur. The casts and characters in these stories seem to be limited, so by the end, it isn't too hard to figure out where the story is headed. But expect a small surprise or two with each chapter, as well as finely detailed character development and dialogue. Tom Selleck does an excellent SLOW BURN characterization here - unlike anything he's done so far in his varied career. The JESSE STONE series looks to be an exception adult modern-day alternative to the classic detective films of the 1940's and 1950's. They are the perfect compliment to a busy week, and make thoroughly entertaining viewing on a quiet Sunday afternoon or evening. Intelligent, thoughtful, moody and at times dryly funny, TOM SELLECK SCORES with this unique series. And at only $10. a title (sometimes even LESS!) these are great additions to your home DVD series.
