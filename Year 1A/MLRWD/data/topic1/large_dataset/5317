I have just watched the TCM 4 pack and watched a film I have never heard of or seen. Freaks was produced in 1931  and is the most extraordinary of the four films . In all the reviews I have read the attention seems to be primarily on Dr. Jeckle and Mr.Hyde. However after getting through the first ten minutes of freaks I for the first time in my 68 years, had a very intimate glimpse into the world of side show freaks and could feel for the first time the humanity of freaks who were billed in side show as non human. The selection of .many scenes really had the audience after the initial shock of seeing the freaks playing in the woods with a woman overseer. The way this woman felt the humanity of these freaks  brought the audience to stop  instantly and re examine their feeling toward these very disturbing looking people.  Prince Randy a self sufficient  and always gainfully employed  stars as the freak with no arms or legs  yet rolls his own cigarets and lights it. He lived to the ripe old age of 63  and performed  up to to and including the evening he died.Including siamese twins, legless , dwarfs the human skeleton, Johnny Eck half boy must be seen to be appreciated.
If you watch the entire film and all the special features provided which includes a lengthy interview of many and bio of the many  cast members of the film which provides many extraordinary stories of these people., you will want to watch it over and over. This is the best  film of the four pack and has been for me the most wonderful film experience in many years and it was produced in 1931.
The four pack is worth the price for this film alone. Don't miss this and don't get put off by the first five minutes stay with it and you will be most pleasantly surprised. Your life will not be quite the same again.
