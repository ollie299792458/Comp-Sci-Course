After making us wait an inordinate amount of time, "The Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr." have finally made an appearance...thank heavens! With the intentional combination of the western/sci-fi weekly black and white adventures of my childhood [the ones where you didn't mind the strings] this, imho, is a series that can be watched by the entire family...with an entire level of gentle humor for those above 13!

Briscoe County Jr. is a character who will do anything to avoid violence. And while most cartoons could be considered incredibly violent, Briscoe's fate was painful for his fans. While being voted one of the best new series on TV, it somehow was also voted the most violent by some group who counted each punch thrown during a "bar room brawl". So, during the hiatus from Season One to Season Two, it was abandonned by the powers that be...to be rarely picked up in reruns. THANK YOU for the DVD. Now, when we tire of television, we can watch Briscoe and Comet, the WonderHorse, and a wonderful assembly of characters [both good and BAD] in their weekly adventures as the 1890s move into the future of the 20th Century with all the new ideas and "coming things".

Bruce Campbell [Army of Darkness, Escape from San Francisco(?), Zena] is just perfect as Briscoe County Jr. He has been hired by a group of "respectable" men to find the "gang" who was responsible for the murder of his father, the great marshall Briscoe County, and who pose a great threat to advancing "civility" in the west. Add to that the supernatural powers of the "ORB" ['unidentified found object'] and you can see it's going to be a good ride!

A series like this comes along rarely! I'd wish it was on the air longer...but better to have had one series than to not have had any at all!
