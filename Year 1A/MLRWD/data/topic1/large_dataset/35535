Shakespeare is one of those enigmatic figures from history.  I've often found his writing difficult to understand. This video biography provides a context for understanding the times in which he lived and the true talent that he was.  So many of his plays were topical to issues of his times (and still to ours).  While coming from a Catholic family background, he managed to thrive at court in Elizabeth's Anglican England.

Having previously seen this series on PBS, we bought this video just after returning from a trip to England and a visit to Stratford upon Avon, including his childhood home and the Royal Shakespeare Company Theater.  On a previous trip we visited the new Globe Theater in London.  All are worth seeing, and this video is suggested watching before you go.

Also worth acquiring is Michael Shama's "A History of Great Britain" a 15 hour, 5 DVD set.  It was developed for the BBC and the History Channel some 10 years ago.  Multiple viewings are required to truly capture the long complex 5,000 year history of Great Britain.
