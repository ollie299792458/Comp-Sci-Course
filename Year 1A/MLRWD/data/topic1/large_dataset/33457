What an amazing little movie this one is. It opens up a little known aspect of the Second World War and succesfully creates a thrilling story that twists and turns in some rather unexpected ways.

How do you combine U-Boats with the Katyn Massacre, blend in code breaking and a fascinating love story?? Really quite an achievement. All these elements work together nearly flawlessly and keep you engaged throughout. The performances are engaging and keep you focused on an event that still disturbs us today.

Very little attention has ever been given to the Katyn Massacre and yet this movie succeeds in informing the viewer both of what occured and more importantly, about the political cover-up that followed until Gorbachev came to power in the former Soviet Union.

This gem of a movie covers some new and expansive territory and takes full advantage of the talented actors involved.

Wait for a rainy day, grab some Earl Grey and a flannel and engage in some code-breaking.
