I've seen the third Bourne movie three times now and I'm very much looking forward to it's video release so I can add it to the first two movies. Both of which are so well crafted - though by two different directors - that (with the additional of the third) they will make one of the most enduring movie trilogies (or series if we're so lucky as to get a fourth movie) ever created.

Matt Damon throughly inhabits the character. The casting is perfect down through the extra's. The director(s) use the locations to great advantage. The cutting moves the action along at a blistering pace, yet in repeat viewings there are plenty of delightful discoveries to make that reflect the care put into the production.

My only quibble is the excessive reliance on "shaky cam" (combat video) film-technique. Thankfully the effects of which are minimized on the small screen. While I think it adds excitement and energy, the flurry of camera movements distracts from the choreography of the martial arts in the second and third movies. Yes, it's a minor disappointment, but the fight scenes are very well-thought out and as carefully crafted as everything else in the production.

On days when my own life seems incoherent, I can always put one of the Bourne movies in the DVD and spend a couple of hours with someone who always knows what he should do next and has the resources to pull it off.
