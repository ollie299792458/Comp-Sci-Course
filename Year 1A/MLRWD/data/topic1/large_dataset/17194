I really wanted to like this movie, but it is terrible for SO many reasons.  I don't know where to begin so I'll just start randomly mentioning things:

- This movie is an embarassment to the gay community.  It portrays all gay men as shallow, stuck up, phoney, promiscuous, drug addicted and sex addicted.

- The movie is WAY too long.  They could have shaved off a good 30 or 45 minutes of unnecessary and bland footage.

- The plot is cheesy.  I won't give away the ending, but let me just say it's laughable because it's so ridiculous.

- The acting is TERRIBLE!  Oh boy, it was embarassing just watching these people try to act it was so bad.

- It looks like they filmed the movie with a handheld camcorder!  The entire film is grainy, the lighting is poor, and the sound is poor as well.  They should've been embarassed to even use whatever cheap equipment they used. smh.

All I can say is please don't spend too much money to watch this movie - either buy it used or rent it if possible, because I know I wish I never would've spent $22 on this garbage when it first came out.  I watched it once, and haven't watched it again since.
