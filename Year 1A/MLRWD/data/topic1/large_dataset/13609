As a child I saw "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" on PBS and at that point realized that film can be powerful and true art....then there is the standard American "forget it as soon as you leave the  theater" movie.  Children of Paradise ranks right there with movies  such as Citizen Kane.
I first saw "Les Enfants" in a large  screen theater when I was 14.  I was amazed by the film and understood many  levels of the first half of the film.  I saw the film again in a theater  when I was about 20 and understood the lessons of life found in the second  half of the film.
Although not always possible, if you have not seen the  film yet you should see it on the big screen rather than on your home  television screen.
I searched for years to obtain a video copy and found  that the legal ownership rights for video had yet to be determined but I  could rent a 16mm version of the film.  Only in say the last 7-8 years has  it been available in video.
There are a couple publications of the script  which can be very insightful if you don't speak French.  In the 16mm film  version some of the scenes are overexposed and the white subtitles become  impossible to read.
After all these years, it still is my favorite film.  It deals with personalities, philisophies, and of course love and love  lost.  You may find yourself relating to these French folk!  ;)
