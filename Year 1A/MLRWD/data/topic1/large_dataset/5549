To the prospective buyer: Reviews are subjective, so I suggest you rent it and make up your own mind. I wish I had.

If you're a die-hard Vin Diesel fan and think anything he utters is cool, then read no further and just buy this film.

I based my buying decision, in part, on what I remembered of Pitch Black (some of which I enjoyed) and some of the positive

reviews here. My mistake.

It's a shame because the opening narrative suggested an interesting film was about to follow:

&#34;...in normal times, evil would be fought by good, but in times like these, it should be fought by another kind of evil&#34;

&#60;Sigh&#62; The premise was interesting at least.

The movie in a nutshell:

Rip Vin Diesel's character out of Fast and Furious, plop him down on an alien planet, add some bad scripting, poor directing, Borg-like bad guys, along with some excellent special effects, and you have The Chronicles Of Riddick.

Rants ahead.

Some foolish moments (in no particular order):

Bad guy with dagger lodged in his back, doesn't notice. Neither do his buddies. But stab him anywhere in the front and he dies. Hmm, note to self...

Riddick can tame wild animals just by staring at them, after which, they like him. &#34;It's an animal thing&#34;, he says. Huh? Ok.

He can accurately measure distances, while lying down on a transport sled traveling at high speed, with some mercenary sitting on his chest. &#34;29.4 kilometers&#34;, he says when they stop. Wow, where do I get one of these for my car?

Bad guy jumps at him from a blind spot, our hero grabs him by the throat...all without looking. He's just too cool.

I could go on.

The movie apparently has appeal to some people, so go rent it. If you like it, buy it.

In the end, great special effects cannot compensate for one-dimensional throwaway characters with corny lines and acting that just doesn't make you care for any of them.
