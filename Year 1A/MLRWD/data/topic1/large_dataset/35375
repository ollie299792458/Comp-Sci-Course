This movie was very entertaining and scary at the same time.  This just happened to be one of the scariest movies of the 90's. Why? Because it didn't rip off a book to become a teen slasher film (I Know What You Did Last Summer), it didn't come up with a lame plot (Idle Hands), and it isn't a bad remake like Psycho.  All in all it's a great film with an entertaining and exiting plot.
Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) is a famous theme park owner with a very spoiled and snobby wife Evelyn (Famke Janssen).  After she demandes a birthday party from him, he decides to have it at the House on Haunted Hill.  Now, they both hate each other, so he decides to shred her guest list and invite his own friends.  But as it turns out the people that show up aren't the people he invited in the first place.  The people that do show up are, Dr. Blackburn(Peter Galleger), former pro baseball player Eddie (Taye Diggs), Television reporter Mellisa Marr (Bridgette Wilson), assistant reporter Sara (Ali Larter), and the house's owner Pritchett (Chris Kattan).Both husband and wife have no idea how these people got here, but don't really seem to care. 
After introductions, the glass skylight mysteriously falls almost killing Evelyn.  We soon find out that Price has rigged mysterious things to go off during the night, like the skylight. Price now tells all of his guests that there is a contest that they are now in.  If they make it through the night, without being killed, they win a million cool ones.  This would all be fine and dandy if the house didn't have a mind of it's own.  After Price has explained all of the this the house closes up (with huge metal plates) and all are trapped inside.  Now we just happen to find out that the house used to be an asylum for the criminal minded.  Now the fun begins, stabbings, ghosts, shootings, dismemberment and psychotic disturbance are around every corner. Evil Loves to Party...
