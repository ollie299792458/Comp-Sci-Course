when people write a bad review about an item, in this case a DVD, that they never should have purchased if they didn't like musicals, or bought it, watched it, and came back here to give it a bad review because they enjoyed a different version of the film that included actors they enjoyed more. I've never seen the Philadelphia Story, although I would like to do so one day. If I enjoy TPS more than "High Society," that doesn't automatically make HS worthless.

I've always loved this movie and decided to purchase it today. When I saw two 1-star ratings, I had to see if there was some kind of flaw in the actual DVD (cut scenes, etc.). The film is great to watch and includes cast of legendary actors singing and performing and singing an excellent score. How bad could it be to watch a film that includes these wonderful actors performing in their prime. It's enough for me just be able to watch Satchmo's great performance.

Everyone's entitled to their opinion, you now have mine.
