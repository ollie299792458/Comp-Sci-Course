which is why I didn't like this movie very much.  The music was fantastic, the acting was excellent, the photography was beautiful, the editing of the shots and the production were great, but the screenplay was just not believable.

Some things that ruined it for me:

The surest sign of a bush-league academic is to insist on being called "doctor".  Poor Lily did this over and over in the script. What was the problem? Did the screenwriter not do his/her homework, or were we supposed to think that perhaps Lily didn't deserve the promotion? The former seems more likely to me.

Lily was having an affair with one of her colleagues?  Well, certainly this happens, but it is not consistent with her character's other traits, unless as I wondered above, the screenwriter is trying to tell us that she isn't as independent and capable as she thinks she is.  I think it was just a bad idea that didn't get cut.

Is it really believable that Lily's sister would not have told a dear sister who studies ballads that her mountain girl assistant sings them.  I doubt it.

Would Lily really run through the woods tearing off her clothes in response to a superstition, or was this an excuse to have her uncorseted in preparation for the big sex scene?  I think the latter.

This movie deserved a more believable screenplay.
