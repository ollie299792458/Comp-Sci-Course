WOW!!  What a great documentary!  All those kids reminded me of how it felt to be that age.  Awkward and shy until coming into your own.  Really finding something you're good at, whether you felt like practicing or not.  It made me wonder what ever happened to the rest of the awkward kids.  Having a program of ballroom dancing should be available to 4th & 5th graders everywhere.  The confidence they develop is something they surely will not forget.  I learned a lot about the "heart" of a dancer, by watching these pre-teens.  They all tried and because of that, they all were winners.  But as with any competition, there is ultimately one winner.

Watch and see how these children develop.  Watch with your family.  Definitely watch if you are a teacher.  My only wish was that the DVD offered special features.  I would have liked to see a featurette on all the dances but teaching us (the viewer) instead.  The words they used to teach kids is much different and more fun.  It would have also been nice to include clips from the other schools, that were most certainly edited out for time.  The documentary follows 3 schools but several were involved, so it would be easy to include clips about them also, in the special features.

I also applaud the teachers.  They had so much heart.  They did well by showing us how to pep up "tired" kids.  So buy this movie.  You and your kids (if you have any) will watch this again and again.  There are so many kids to watch and each time, you will see something you missed.  Get up off the couch and dance with them!!  T....A...N-G-O!!
