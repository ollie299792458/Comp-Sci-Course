I have a fascination with astronomy, and I lap up facts and figures about the absolutely beautiful majesty of the universe.  Like most people who share an interest in this subject I have a working knowledge of all the planets in our Solar System, and the nature of stars and galaxies and nebulae.  Left-brain dominated mathematical types tend to lack imagination being so caught up in logical assumptions, and the accepted orthodoxy.  These assumptions become a creed that nobody with any sense or career ambition would ever question.  It takes a poet to express the beauty of the void beyond our own atmosphere.  In much the same was as a psychoanalyst is baffled by a patient who shows a glimmer of a personality - and tries to extinguish it; scientists will only believe in what they see or their instruments can detect.  There is no place for religious superstition in their universe.  This stunningly beautiful guide by Professor Brian Cox in Blu-ray is presented by a recognisable human being who has the soul of a poet with the logical curiosity of the enthusiast.  This is a very worthy addition to my growing Blu-ray collection.  Professor Cox is a Star!
