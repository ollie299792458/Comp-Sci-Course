This movie has been compared by previous reveiwers as another Taxi Driver. The only simularitys between the movies are that the main characters in each are combat veterans unable to reintegrate into society and the movies are psychological studies of sort, with an underlying plot. Other then those two simularitys, Harsh times is unique and definately holds it's own.

  I could relate with Christian Bales character in this film, and the stage of his life that he was going through. The stressful time of applying to various police departments, going through the application process, putting your life literaly on hold while you wait to hear from the recruitment office plus keeping your nose clean as you get drawn toward your old habits, can drive you crazy.

  You watch as this stress and Bale's characters traumatic experiance as an Army Ranger coupled with his life's dormant state drive him back into his old criminal habits and ultimately over the edge.

  Bale adds another psychotic character to his resume and pulls it off convincingly.

Kinda makes you wonder about him.
