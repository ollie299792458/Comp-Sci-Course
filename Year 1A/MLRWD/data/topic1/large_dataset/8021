There are movies out there which will never win any Oscars.
This is one of them.

But that does not mean that such movies are bad ones.

Flyboys will keep your whole family entertained.

The aerial fight scenes are wonderful and very realistic. You can expect plenty of blood and gore too.

This is the perfect kind of entertaining movie which will help you to unwind after a hard day's work in the office, which is precisely what it did for me.

Rough Synopsis (without spoilers):-
The movie was inspired by a true story.

American cowboy joins the French Aerial squadron as a volunteer during WWI.

Rises through the ranks.

Along the way, the viewer is introduced to other air force volunteers, all with quirky personalities (and rituals like pre-match soccer superstars) and personal reasons for enlisting.

Includes a romantic plot when the cowboy meets a nice French girl.

Things get personal when the cowboy's fellow buddies are killed by a German Ace.

All of which builds up to a dramatic showdown in the air, ala "High Noon" in the skies.

Be sure to get your pop-corn ready before you press play! :)

Blu-Ray Quality
