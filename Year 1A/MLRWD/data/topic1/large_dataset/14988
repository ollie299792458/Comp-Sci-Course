"Stacy" is from Japanese Words "Sute Isi" which means a "Stepping Stone".
 This movie (or the original novel written by Kenji Otsuki) is a metaphor.
 You know, in the 80's in Japan, there was a boom called 'the Band Boom.'
 There were many Rock'n'roll, Soul, Pop Bands of various styles.
 And After the fever gone, Japanese music scene went an unified, boring stage.

 In this movie, at the begining, the zombies terrified the whole world.
 But in the end, people leaned how to tame them.
 Kenji Otsuki was once a Rock'n'roll (or Heavy Metal) icon and had a very
big time and then he got losed. In other words, the 80's bands including
his band 'Kinniku shoujo tai' got overwhelmed by the commercialism of
Japanese music industrials.
 Thru' this experience he wrote this novel.
 He felt that his band and other bands were merely the stepping stones
('Sute Ishi' or 'Stacy') during the evolution (or degeneration) of Japanese music scene.

 So if u know the background like this, u'll find this movie is rather
cynical or critical metaphor and u'll find this movie more enjoyable!
