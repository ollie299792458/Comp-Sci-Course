An astounding cinemagraphic masterpiece with scenes ranging from the tiny huts in the lush forest of the nelwin village, crossing breathtaking canyons, through intricate medieval set designs at the battle of Tir  Azleen, action scenes on the snow covered tundra, riding through ice  caverns on the shield of a Nockmar soldier, climaxing at the precipice with  the manacing castle of the evil Queen Bavmorda.  Accompanied by a  brilliant musical score composed by James Horner that perfectly accompanies  each scene ranging from triumphal adventure themes to those of mystical  wonder.  Not to mention a great cast of characters, from miniature  brownies, to nelwins, to daikinis; all are clothed with amazing costume  design that perfectly complement the characters in this great adventure.  Action, adventure, comedy, romance...Willow has it all!  Expect nothing  less from this Lucasfilm production.  So what's taking so long with the  re-release on DVD?  Did Queen Bavmorda banish it to the deserted island  with Fin Razelle?
