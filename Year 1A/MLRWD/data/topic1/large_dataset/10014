Tosca, a beloved opera, from the time I first heard Maria Callas, Giuseppe Di Stefano, and Tito Gobbi's 1970 audio version back in the late `70's.  Those were rare, and gifted voices.  In 2007, I wanted a DVD version so I could really get in touch with the plot and the passion.  I am absolutely thrilled with this stunningly performed, magically captivating version of Tosca.  I have watched it, over and over again, many times, and I have fallen in love all over again.  Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna cannot be compared to other lovers in other productions, their love for each other is obvious.  It's magic.  The use of voice over, in one scene sent me into tears, as I realized they were talking to each other.  In other scenes, the villainous Scarpia is silently musing over his tactics, as he eye's Tosca, for you hear his thoughts, but his lips are not moving.  This DVD version is a buy of a lifetime, and I only wish all the other operas could be presented with the same studio quality voice and orchestra, and exquisitely realistic set.  The lip-syncing was not a distraction, but gave the production an ethereal quality.  Facial expressions were more realistic.  It's a wonderful diversion from other stage presentations where the audio is less than optimal, and the camera angles takes you to a stage set.  Military pilots might recognize this comparison: Maria Callas is an F-15 or an F-111 at maximum take-off power, while Angela Gheorghiu is an F-18 Super Hornet, and Renata Scotto is an F-106.  All first class defenders in their time in history.  Gheorghiu will knock your socks off.
