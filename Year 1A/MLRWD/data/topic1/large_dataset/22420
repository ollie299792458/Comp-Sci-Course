Ok...I'm in my late 30's. When I saw the preview for this film, it was just after seeing Gladiator(awesome 5-star movie), and I thought to myself...'let the ripoffs begin'. I was sure it would be a bad teen flick with a few decent action scenes, and frankly, wasn't even going to rent it...what a pleasant surprise.
I haven't smiled so much in a movie in a long time. Wonderful acting, directing, dialog...and the story moves along nicely but never bogs down or tries to be anything other than what it is...a FUN movie(with some nice emotional moments as well). Sure, you might say it has cliche's and such(the music blends in nicely btw), but the film is so entertaining and hits all the right notes that you won't care if you've 'seen it before'...and I can assure you, you have NEVER seen jousting like what's pulled off in this film.
Heath Ledger is as likable and capable an actor as your gonna find for this type of film, and he does a great job, as do the others, but Paul Bettany almost steals the film with his hilarious and shameless portrayal of Chaucer. I challenge anyone to sit through most of his scenes without a smile plastered across his/her face. I truely hope he gets nominated for an award(the deleted scene he has when he's pleading with the mob is really something to see as well).
This movie might be geared towards the younger audience in general, but don't let that fool you. It has something to offer everyone who wants to sit back and enjoy a Knights tale...I loved it.
