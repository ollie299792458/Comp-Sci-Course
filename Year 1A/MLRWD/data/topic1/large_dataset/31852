If I would describe this movie in one word, it would have to be "amazing."  My life was changed after viewing this film.  If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, then you know that this is by far his best writing and directing.  One reason I love this movie so much is the all star cast.  When you have a team that involves Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Travolta, Kietel, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, your not going to have a bad movie.  They way that these actors play their characters I think is brillant.  You really believe the conflict, and the peril they are going through.  From Jackson's thoughts on religion and retirment, to Willis' thoughts on his father's gold watch, the acting is great.

One thing that could turn people off in this movie is the graphic nature of it.  As i posted before, if you are a fan of Tarantino, then you will have no problem with this movie.  For those who are not used to Tarantino type films, it may come off as a shock.  I fell in love with the way that Tarantino directs and the way that he writes.  The way the movie jumps around back and fourth, and then at the end all comes together I think is genius.  If you want to see something like you have never seen before, give this movie a try, and if you are like me, it will give new meaning to the term "great movie".
