First Off the Book is my favorite work of fiction. The movie itself is entertaining but had several things about it that I didn't like. If you liked the book and have never seen the movie don't get your hopes up too much. To condense a book that's over 1100 pages long into a 6 hour series required them to strip away all elements of the story except those that were absolutely necessary to keep the story intact. The original story IS there, and the basic idea of the film is carried out enough so that the good vs evil story is presented and carried to it's conclusion. However many plot elements that gave the book such a broad range of story are not in the film. Sure what isn't there doesn't really take away from the story but in the book it added a huge depth to it. Things like Harold Lauder painting directions on the tops of barn roofs to tell travelers where he and Frannie are, Larry Underwood's lonely trip through New England, student riots in campuses, free zone committee meetings, Trashcan man's trip to Las Vegas and his encounter with the psychotic Kid. Things like that, that add a huge sense of character to the people in the book are not there. Now as a stand alone film it's great to watch and is enjoyable. The actor performances are great, especially at the film's climax. But Stephen King's works have always had a huge sense of story. This is in the film somewhat but not the way it is in the book. By itself it's a good film but not one that does the book justice. What would have been better was if it had been an HBO mini series. Perhaps that would have been better.
