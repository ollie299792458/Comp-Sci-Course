WOW WOW WOW is all I have to say about this film!  It portrayed a piece of Americana history so accurately and convincingly, it could have passed as a documentary (OK- not really, but you get the point).  I'm 48 now, but I can clearly remember the skateboarding scene back in the 70's, since my brother and I were afficionados.  Even back in the NYC area and Jersey, skateboarding caught on bigtime because of the media attention brought on by skate giants like Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta.  I can remember the many skateboard shops that opened up, even in music/head shops or bicycle shops as a 'side business'.  We then even built our own 'half pipes' in our backyards, and ate up every issue of 'Skateboarder' magazine.  We found out where skateboard parks opened up, and had our parents drive us there (before we were old enough to get a driver's license).  We pored over, and debated about Bahne, G&S, Alva, and Banzai boards.  Ditto regarding which wheels and trucks were the best (I liked Bennett, Tracker, Red Rider, Green Alligator, and Bonez).  I digress.  Anywho, major kudos to all involved in making this highly entertaining film, and thank you for transporting us back to that era and subculture!  GREAT JOB!
