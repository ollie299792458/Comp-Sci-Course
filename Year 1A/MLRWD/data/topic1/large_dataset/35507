"Capote" is the best film I've seen for many, many years. It's thought-provoking to the nth degree and fills in and/or illuminates some of the issues and questions raised by "In Cold Blood" (while raising and/or murkying others).  I like to come out of a film with my mind racing, and this film did just that.  Seymour is mesmerising. I had to keep reminding myself that he was *not* Truman Capote.  He pulls off - with deceptive ease - the incredibly difficult job of giving a fully-realised portrayal of a man who fashioned his own caricature. It's also wonderful to see that an almost shoe-string budget (by Hollywood standards) can produce such a compelling result. And hardly a CGI in sight!

A great central performance has to have great support. Chris Cooper as Dewey and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee are superb, as is Mark Pelligrino in the small but effective role of Dick Hickock. The only nigglette I have is about Collins Jr as Perry Smith. Smith must have been particularly difficult to cast; his physical appearance alone would have been hard to replicate.  But Collins Jr's Smith comes across as a misunderstood lad with `issues', rather than the deeply damaged, paranoid schizophrenic of the book. However, the 'ordinariness' of his description of the murders, contrasted with the brutal imagery and sound-track, was just right. Anyway, "In Cold Blood" itself raises all sorts of issues about the characters and motives of the `real' Smith and Hickock.

This is probably not a film that will be at the top of many people's `must see' list, which is tragic.  It demands attention and rewards concentration. I hope, after the Oscar success, more people will give it the attention is deserves.
