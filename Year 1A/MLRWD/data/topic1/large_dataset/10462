This is a great movie if your not looking for an in depth story line and character development.  It's basically another Jackie Chan action movie but it has a twist, this time Jackie's in the old west.  The action is wonderful (vintage Jackie Chan) and the comedy is also vintage Jackie so if your a Jackie Chan fan then you should find this movie entertaining.  
Owen Wilson also does a great job as the outlaw wanna be in this movie.  Wilson has a different comedical air to him which I happen to enjoy but which isn't for everyone.  If you liked him in Meet the Parents then you'll like him in this as well, basically the same type of comedy with a different roll.  
Lucy Liu's character really doesn't add anything to this movie.  She plays the princess kidnapped from China and brought to America which spawns Jackie coming to save her.  Although her part is crucial within the story it really is secondary and really doesn't add anything or allow Liu to shine. 
Basically if your a Jackie Chan fan or an Owen Wilson fan you won't be disappointed with this film.  It adds originality to Jackie's fight scenes and gives you his classic comedy combined with Wilson's unique style of comedy.  It's deffinately worth the money!
