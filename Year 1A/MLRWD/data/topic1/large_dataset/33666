For those of you who loved the first season, but were disappointed with the second & are asking yourself is it worth it to buy this movie? The answer is a definate YES. When I was looking for new anime a couple of years ago, The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya was one the a lot of people really seemed to like. After checking out a few episodes on-line(Okay maybe 3/4 of the series) I decided to buy the first season from Amazon & it turned out to be one of my favourites. Then came season 2, which got so repetitive that after awhile it got REALLY boring. It actually turned a lot of people off & I even read in some of these reviews that people have skipped the second season altogether. One question that I read on a lot of messageboards is whether or not you need to watch season 2 before watching this movie, I would say for the most part, No. The only episode you probably should watch is the first episode of the second season "Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody". Something that happens in the first episode is quite a major plot point in the movie so without seeing that episode I think most people would be kind of lost. Also something from one of the later episodes in season 2 (concerning Kyon's cat) creeps into the movie, but I really don't think if you miss the episode it will really make a difference. The whole look of the movie & the animation is A-One. The movie is over 2 hrs & 40 minutes long so you are definately getting your money's worth. So if you are a fan of Haruhi Suzumiya & you have't bought this DVD or Blu-Ray already, for Heaven's Sake, Please Do. You won't be disappointed.
