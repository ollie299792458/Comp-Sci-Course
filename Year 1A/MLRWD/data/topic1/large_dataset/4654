This is probably the most dull Hitchcock movie I have ever seen.  I love Alfred Hitchcock, and I own almost every single movie he has ever made, including this one.  I bought it before renting it. (Bad choice)
This movie has a dull plot, and when something exciting happens, the story goes right back to being dull.  It is like Hitch didn't direct this movie.  There are only two scenes where I can feel Hitchcock's presence in the film.
The first one is the murder of Gromek in the farm house: pure Hitchcock.  In my opinion, it is one of the greatest murders Hitchcock has ever filmed.
The second one is when Julie Andrews and Paul Newman are on the "fake bus" escaping, but the real bus is coming up behind them, and they are having a police escort.
That is about all the thrills you'll get out of this movie.  I dozed off through most of it.  It is really a disappointing movie for Hitchcock fans. I could not believe how boring this movie was!  
Here's a thought:  Instead of remaking Psycho, why not remake this?
