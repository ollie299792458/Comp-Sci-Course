Pleasantville is a fantastic film experience, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. A true, striking, and original masterpiece; Pleasantville is a must for any movie fan. What makes the film such a joy is how it exists  on so many levels; almost anyone can find something to like here. It's at  times a simple fantasy, others a biting satire, and even others an account  of our history and change as people. Pleasantville is purely original and  very well-structured. It deals with mature themes and if you're someone who  likes to analyze films, then this is a great choice. The DVD warrants a  purchase, even if you already own the VHS version (as I do), one of the few  DVD's that does. Do yourself a favor and listen to writer-director Gary  Ross's commentary-it's dynamite, even if you generally do not like  commentaries. It's incredibly enlightening and adds much to the film's  depth. Ross cleary illustates all of the overlapping themes and symbolism,  and adds a personal touch to the movie's meaning. (The unintended rip-offs  of The Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane are particularly interesting).  The film has a bright, crisp transfer and excellent sound. The only way to  enjoy Pleasantville (other than the theater) is on DVD. Newman's music is  magical, also. There's a neat (oh, I'm talking like a 50's person now)  behind the scenes documentary on the film's jaw-dropping special effects.  The included Fiona Apple music video is pretty neat and directed by P.T.  Anderson. (Anderson fans take note: watch for Anderson regular John C.  Reilly at the video's end.) Overall, a DVD to buy: one of '98's best films  with tons of extras to boot. Swell.
