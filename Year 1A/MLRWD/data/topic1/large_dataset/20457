I AM ALWAYS looking for a good romantic comedy. I FOUND IT!  The preview, to me, depicted the movie as being very funny and sweet. And it was--it's easily one of the best romantic comedies I've seen. Ashton plays a more subdued/thoughtful character than he usually does, and Peet plays a wild girl, and its cool to see how their characters change their hair, their clothes, and their feelings over the years. Peet is really good as Emily, the tough girl who has always had a man in her life is trying to figure out her place in the world. Her character is both vulnerable and stubborn. Ashton fans will also enjoy seeing him here - he's really kind of charming. The chemistry between Ashton and Peet is great, a cute couple. One great scene is when they are singing together on a long car ride, and other great scenes show how they support each other after a tough break up, or a death in the family, or losing a job. It all seems very genuine (you recognize parts of you or your friends in the characters).
