This is an exceptional DVD transfer of an exceptional movie.  Criterion has done a magnificent job of restoring Charade to its colorful glory.  The film is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The print is clear,  crisp, and beautiful to behold.  You feel as if you can reach out and touch  the actors.
And what actors!  The film features the dashing older version  of Cary Grant and the youthful gamine Audrey Hepburn, with enough chemistry  between them to ignite a fireworks factory.  The plot is a convoluted and  flimsy trifle about cold war spy shenanigans, with cases of mistaken  identity and episodes of grave danger for Miss Audrey.  But Cary, the  classic good guy in cad's clothing, is there to save the day.  In addition  to which he provides chaste romance that sizzles beneath the  civility.
Audio commentary is provided by director Stanley Donen and  screenwriter Peter Stone.  While interesting and funny in spots, it does  drag a bit over the length of the film.  It may be better to check it out  when you find something in the film that you would like to hear dissected.  Otherwise, you'd be better to stick with the delightful, corny dialogue  spoken in the dulcet tones of Cary and Audrey.  The soundtrack music is to  also to be savored, done up in classic '60s spy movie style by the movie  maestro Henry Mancini.
If you have nothing to do on a rainy day and own a  DVD player, this is the movie you want to have on hand to pop in the  machine and deliver you from care.  It's a keeper (and it comes in a keeper  case!).
