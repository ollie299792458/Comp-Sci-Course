I enjoyed watching this video in class because it balanced the beliefs between creationism and evolutionism.  I definitely learned a lot about evolution because I am a Christian, and being one I wasn't very aware about how evolution and the "big bang" theory were developed.  I also learned about others' opinions and how some believe that there was a "big bang" and organisms reproduced asexually but God created all of it. This is one of those theories where evolution and creation combine.  I personally feel that creation should be taught in schools just as well as evolution.  I feel everyone should become educated about both theories and choose upon that, whether it be faith or evolving.  It is interesting how creation has evidence of being true as well as evolution.  For creationism, Noah's Ark was said to save many animals from the great flood and those who weren't saved drowned, and were buried under the mud and preserved.  This would explain why we have so many large fossils being discovered today.  On the other hand, archeologists have found that there are similarities between humans and primates in science that depict the evolution theory.  I believe this film should be shown in schools because it has educational value to anyone whether you are a Christian, an Atheist, or undecided.
