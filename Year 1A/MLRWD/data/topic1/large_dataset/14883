I got this movie as a gift for Christmas and I can honestly say this is the wierdest,stupidest,most insensible piece of garbage I have ever seen. The begging starts out with "Blue Meanies" attacking some place for no particular reason and then leads into some old guy telling some dude with a trumpet about leaving "Pepperland" and finding help. So whom else does he turn to than...THE BEATLES???? And get this, as if it wasnt enough that the movie had to be terrible, The Beatles themselves(Probably sensing how bad of a movie it would be) did'nt even voice thier own doggone parts!!!! This movie is basically a LSD filled Beatles idea of a bunch of blue people chasing a guy with a trumpet and them(The Beatles) saving the day. As if it wasnt bad enough that the movie had to be horrid, the extras are too!!! With a Behind The Scenes Feauturette that is sooo boring you'll find the biggest task is not to fall asleep and interviews that explain that when John Lennon died(Bless his Soul) the dude who voiced him in this fallacy's daughter thought the guy who voiced him died(...biggest...bull...ever) and the thing is the storybored sequences are ridiculously bad. Point in case, i am ashamed that the great Beatles of Liverpool would lend thier name to this unworthy film...but hey, i'm sure there is a guy on LSD right now enjoing this film and all I have to say is...the more power to ya brother!
