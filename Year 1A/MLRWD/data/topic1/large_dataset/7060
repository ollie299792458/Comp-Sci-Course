You've, I imagine, read all the other reviews, so I won't recount the plot of this movie. Rather, I will add, as sort of a "caveat," that I saw this movie on July 4, 1976, with my brother's (then) fiance and her best friend.  I was in the Army at the time, on leave, and I'd just returned from visting an old Army buddy in S Carolina.  As a parting gesture, he'd provided me with a (as the late great prototype for "Uncle Duke" would say) "whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers, etc" - and we three helped ourselves liberally before viewing "The Omen."  Oh boy...about 10 minutes in (about the time the nurse hangs herself), the vibrations started getting a little...nasty, and by the time the photographer "lost his head," all thoughts of a cozy "Fourth Of July threesome" after the movie were thoroughly dissippated.  And I, thereafter in the pouring rain, emptied my "stash" with an (at the time) tearful vow to forgo any pleasures of the flesh henceforth - and I slept, in my Parents' living room with the light on all night, until I returned to "active duty," where sleep was a bit of a...rare commodity.  I kept my promise, oh, 3 months, but I'll never forget the FEAR that "The Omen" instilled in three libidinous proto-yuppies.  "Damien" kind of ran out of steam, But Sam Neill in "The Final Conflict" restored the series to its downright "scares the mortal %^&* out of one." OK, that being said, "The Omen" is scary, not only because of its "horror film" schtick, but because it's (more or less) Biblically correct.  Remember: who/whatever the prorotype of "Damien" is, he's out there right now, folks.  That's what gives these movies, nascent though they may be, CREDIBILITY.
