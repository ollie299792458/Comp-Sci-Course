Brad Anderson has presented an unparalleled trip into pshychotic fear & terror with 'Session 9'. Forget any inklings or references to 'The Shining', as this film takes place in the most notoriously haunted & scariest places in the world: Danvers State Hospital. Having seen this hospital myself in 2003, I can attest without question that this property leaves an impression which will stay with you a lifetime. Anderson masterfully presents a complex scenario of pshycho-terror that one would expect from Danvers. The storyline is straightforward: an asbestos removal company is awarded the bid to clean up various areas of the derelict hospital; but as the week progresses there is very strange happenings with Gordon (Peter Mullen), the asbestos company owner. The casting is perfect, with Peter Mullen becoming 'possessed' by "Simon", one of the  schizophrenic personalities of former patient Mary Hobbs. David Caruso performs brilliantly as the job foreman & his growing conflict with Mullen is surely one of the highlights of the film. The story touches on many areas of interest, including solitude, lonliness & the dichotomy of good & evil. A most essential horror story filmed at one of the most scariest places on earth.
