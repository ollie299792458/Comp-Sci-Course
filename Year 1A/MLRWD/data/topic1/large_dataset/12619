After watching this film, I couldn't help but ask myself, just what was M. Night getting at with this? I think I've figured it out. What better way to commit career suicide than to create the worst movie ever made with the plot being that the whole Northeastern US kills themselves? It's brilliant!

  I've always been a lot easier on M. Night than many. I actually liked Lady in the Water. This however, left me stunned in it's rediculous plot and horrendously inane writing. An example? They are as legion as the suicides in this movie. Warning! A spoiler,but gee, you have to include at least one. It's irresistable. There's a scene where Mark Wahlberg's character, a whiny schoolteacher named Elliot, (who's dialogue is so inane that it seems like his geek genes have expressed themselves to the point where he can no longer properly show emotion), and his band of suicide endangered people come across a man boarded up in his house who won't let them in. His solution to convince the man that he's "OK" is to start singing the Doobie Brothers' "Black Water"! (Everybody knows he should have sung "Sweet Home Alabama").

  If this was a single instance, it probably would be no big deal, but the WHOLE MOVIE is like this. The inconsistancies are so wildly illogical that you're left with thought of, "How could someone this big in the film industry do a film this bad?!" See first paragraph of this review.......
