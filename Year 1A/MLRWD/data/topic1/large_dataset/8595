I just found this version again and I'm still mesmerized by this production.  There is simply no better.  The first time I saw this was in high school and it has stuck with me ever since.  I've seen other movie versions and live stage performances, but nothing truly compares to Zeffirelli's production and it is no wonder he was awarded the Academy Award for this work.

The location, cinematography, design, detail, score and of course the actors make this a feast for the senses.  Casting teenagers in the lead roles was moment of genius. Olivia Hussey as Juliet is perfection.  Her angelic beauty and emotive performance is wonderful.  You can see and feel every nuance of emotion throughout the play.  Leonard Whiting's equally spectacular performance as Romeo is an excellent complement.  The chemistry between these two and the fantastic performances of the entire cast as a whole takes this from a watching a movie to an immersive experience.

While I stumbled upon this again via a DVD rental subscription, I will be purchasing a copy in the very near future.
