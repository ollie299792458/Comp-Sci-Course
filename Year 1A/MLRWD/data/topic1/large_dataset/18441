I seem to remember liking this movie when I first saw it in the 80's. DeNiro and Walken are fantastic as always and fans of either should see this film just for their scenes together. Otherwise, the movie is a rambling mess with an hour spent on the wedding scene and no time at all spent on their initial training and unit assignments. One day they're hunting. The next they're in Vietnam. Then they're in an NVA prison camp without showing how they were caught. They seem to have been there a long time because they're already coming unglued. The audience is left to fill in the blanks.  I get the feeling the director doesn't really know all that much about the military since he doesn't spend much time or effort on these scenes. I'm guessing by DeNiro's class A uniform that he is a super solider who is both an Army Ranger, a Green Beret, has served for about 15 years judging by the number of service stripes on his sleeve, and is such a badass that no one can tell him to shave or get a military haircut. There is simply too much implausible stuff going on here to take this movie seriously anymore and frankly I'm wondering what I or anyone else ever saw in the disjointed mess of a movie for it to be so critically acclaimed.
