I'm now giving this DVD 5 stars because I discovered that it wasn't a bad quality DVD; it was my my DVD to V.C.R. hook-up that caused the problems. So kids, if you've had the same problems with the quality of your DVD viewing as I've described below, try hooking your DVD player either to a newer V.C.R. or directly to the T.V. So now allow me to apologize for my original review, and do purchase this DVD.

I'm giving this dvd 3 stars not because of the content of the movie but because of the quality of the dvd. Singin' in the Rain is a wonderful movie: very fun, very light-hearted, very good acting, singing, dancing, etc. But everybody knows that. What they don't know is that the quality of the dvd is very bad. In small print on the back of the box it says: "Standard version- presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition." Which must mean that the DVD is supposed to run blurry and dark. Every 10 seconds or so the color lightens up and straightens out enough to see what's going on, but that only lasts for a second or two and then it goes back to blurry and dark. For me, watching this dvd was a practice in frustration. I LOVE this movie. It's too bad that the quality of the dvd is so bad. If you're going to buy this movie, (and you should because it's fabulous) buy it on VHS and save yourself the disappointment.
