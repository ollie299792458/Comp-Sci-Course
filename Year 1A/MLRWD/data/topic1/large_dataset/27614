In the past 20 years of studying this problem, Biology is now entering what can only be described as a revolution. Because the evidence is so overwhelmingly against the conventional neo-darwinian view, scientists and scholars that hold to this THEORY are abandoning it like rats abandoning a sinking ship. More than 100 scholars (from Yale, Princeton, Smithsonian and MIT) have signed onto a statement declaring they are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged. This declaration ran as an ad in the Prestigious New York Review of Books. In life's big bang, the Cambrian explosion, most animals appear in a very sudden sense. From nothing, we have almost everything, almost overnight. This remains mysterious. Nobody understands how this happened (except for me, I know). The Cambrian explosion puts the various phylum of the Darwin tree of life upside down so that it is an upside down tree. The Cambrian explosion does not conform to the Darwin THEORY of the tree of life.

"A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question."  -Charles Darwin
