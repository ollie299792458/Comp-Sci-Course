I first saw this when I was fourteen and it completely blew me away. Great cinematography (Unforgettable opening sequence with the boardwalk and rollercoaster at night), hot actors and funny lines.

I recently watched the DVD version again and was expecting to cringe in embarrassment. Instead, it was still as entertaining as the first time I saw it, despite the dated clothes (but seeing that the 80's are back again, not that bad)and the greasy saxophonist (that was possibly the worse part of the movie).

The acting is still sharp and the vampire lore precisely identified and employed. It's amazing to think that Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric were only just 18 when they did this -- they've got incredible screen presence. I'm hoping for better things to come from these two.

Also, this movie only serves to show that teen movies then were pretty damn good. Today, that genre has just become so banal, with jokes veering left of the "beeatch" category without so much as a ha-ha (case in point, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen). Also note how thin the acting has become (Hilary Duff??)Can Lizzie Maguire The Movie stand the test of time like Ferris Bueller or The Lost Boys? I think not.

What I also like about this movie is that they didn't compromise on the vampire lore. It's a copout for scriptwriters/writers to bend the rules and have their vamps withstand sunlight and garlic. it's much harder for them to work within the rules and still come up with something fresh which is something this movie has done. I suspect it's partly the reason why it was so successful.

Great, great stuff. This movie deserves a giant rave like this one!
