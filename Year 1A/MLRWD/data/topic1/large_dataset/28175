You don't have to watch these films in order, but I suppose it helps.

The story so far: little Jason, the deformed child supposedly drowned many years ago, came back from the dead to avenge the killing of his psychopathic mother, who was bumping off the kinds of dozy teens who made love whilst her son, entrusted into their care, was drowning.

So now, several years later, Camp Crystal Lake is open once again, and a load of teenaged councillors are moving in to take drugs, have sex and do all the other kinds of things that'd make you delighted to entrust your kids into their care.  The survivor from the first film has been murdered, so a new heroine must outwit Jason.

Quite frankly, a good opening sequence and a spooky climax involving Jason's shrine to his mother can't excuse the eighty minutes of tedium in between.  The special effects are worse than in the first film, the teenagers are irritating, and the occasional musings about the mysterious Jason are ruined by pathetic attempts at humour.

Worth watching if you're a fan of the series, if only to see the film which introduced the grown-up Jason.
