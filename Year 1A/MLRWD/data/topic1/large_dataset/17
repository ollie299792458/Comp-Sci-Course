I love all three of the Transformers movies, but this last one is not my favorite.  Whatever the reason for Megan Fox not being in Dark of the Moon, there is a loss of continuity with a new female lead.  There was chemistry between Megan and Shia LaBeouf that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't bring to the screen, IMO.

I do appreciate the irony in the government getting outwitted by the Transformers again!  What would happen, if there's a Transformers IV, if they actually get cooperation at the outset instead of having some stumbling, bumbling upper echelon idiot get in their way?  I know it's in the script, and it gives good drama... but it's the same story line over and over.

In the end, however, it's (spoiler alert) the good guys' triumph over evil, the requisite stunts, explosions and stomach churning, death defying drama that makes this movie *almost* as good as the first two.  Definitely worth having, and thanks, as always, to Amazon for the availability of prepurchase!!
