I can see why some viewers came away with the perceptions they did, but if you watch and listen closely you understand the characters better.  Clarkson's character, Juliette,is a quiet woman who has held the fort for a husband involved in world affairs.  Her children are now grown, she and her husband are taking a long put off trip together, then he doesn't show.  She is quietly distraught and disoriented as she copes with worry, odd sleeping patterns  and the unfamiliar city.  But if you watch what is happening this is as much a story about a woman learning to know herself again, while she comes to know another person.

Siddig's character is meeting a woman he has only known through a third party, her husband. As the story progresses we find he has shut himself off from love and romance. But when she comes to him for company he finds himslef talking about things he's not thought of in years.  As they spend time together they discover how much they are alike. Both quiet gentle people, who like to watch the world, take things in and can sit quietly without speaking. In the final events of the story she offers him what appears to be a small thing, but it is an enormous thing emotionally.  She gives over a memory she had planned with her husband to him, and in the end lies to keep it secret.  The secret is as deeply felt as if they had made love.

The Director loved Cairo with the camera, and brought out the tender subtleties both of these actors possess. It's a delight to see a film about people in the Middle East just living side by side and going about their lives. This is for the patient and serious film lover.
