Top gun was the biggest grosser of 1986,a tom cruise vehicle that spelt magic at the box office.this is one tom cruise action movie which is way ahead of cruise's other MISSION IMPOSSIBLES movies  .It doesn't mean that this was an out an out action flick but was an one-man experience in his
top gun training days.The  plot was simple but what was extraordinary was tom cruise screen presence.
his fans(especially girls) must have got what they wanted- why was this a big hit:
1> tomcruise driving his bike with his friend on airplane while the song DANGER ZONE plays in background
2> airplane dogfights amazingly shot
3> the background color which makes it look rich
4> one of the best soundtacks with excellent numbers used nicely in film5> MR TOM CRUISE HIMSELF
just hear tom saying YEEHAAH and ill enjoy it.other characters too fit their roles properly.
there was this youth touch and energy to its feel.VAL KILMER was a good adversary to cruise.their few
scenes do bring the friction required.kelly mcgills was bit older but the way their tease each other
in a elevator with a senior officer on it.
TOM's  character was nicely shaped and allowed to develop which other films didnt.the way he dealt friendship with
a brother-like goose,an affair with much older instructor,opposition of equally talented pilot,
a tragic accident that changes his life and career.
tom cruise looked best in this than all his other films,it is easier to get into a life of such a person
who is a pro and wants life his way.this movie came after tom's RISKY BUISNESS and COLOR OF MONEY and was
an instant hit.
the only thing i didnt like was that it didnt have a SEQUEL.
rest - IF U R A TOM CRUISE FAN THAN THIS IS BEST HE HAS TO OFFER.
