This collection is priceless and timeless! Fred and Ginger are truly immortalized through this collection of wonderful films full of the music, dance, variety and fashion of an era which I personally adore. The movies are fantastic. Clear picture. Extremely minimal sound disruption. Clearly a lot of time, effort, energy and care went into the restoration of this collection. It is evident and truly makes for a remarkable experience with each film. In correlation with the films under the "Special Features," each DVD has some type of short film or cartoon and documentary surrounding either the particular film or the relationship and talents of Fred and Ginger in general. On a more personalized note, being a hoofer myself, having Fred & Ginger at home is a great reference to an art form that isn't as abundant any longer, which truly saddens me. I'm glad to have my heroes with me. I've heard rumor, and hope it's true, that a Volume 2 is to be released next year and I look forward to it with GREAT anticipation.
