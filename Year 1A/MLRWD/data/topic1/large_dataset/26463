I grew up in Indiana and am well-acquainted with the true story behind the 1954 State Championship from Milan. I've actually met a couple of the players from that team, one of whom plays a referee in the final game of this film.
The image that forever stays with me from this movie is that of Ollie, the unlikely hero being carried off the floor by his teammates, his fists pumping the air. To me there is no better image in the entire film than that. It epitomizes the message behind this movie and others like Rudy and Breaking Away, both of which, coincidentally, take place in Indiana and, like Hoosiers, are based on true stories. The message is that you can reach the unreachable.
How's that for sentimentality? Some have complained that the film is too sentimental, but in basketball-crazy Indiana, home to six of the ten biggest high school gyms in the nation (ours seated 8,200), the story behind Hoosiers was legendary. And that, naturally, is a big reason why this movie inspires me. Oh, yeah, and Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper do a good job.
My only disappointment is that there are no notable features on the DVD. Of course, it was made in 1986, before a director had to consider how to make a movie and a movie about the movie.
