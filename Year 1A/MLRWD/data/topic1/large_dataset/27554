This is a very very great movie,and it has the value to have created one of the coolest heroes of all the times (The first one is a sort of prologue,for me...) ,but ev'ry one knows the THIRD ONE -MAD MAX BEYOND  THUNDERDOME- had MORE success and was ...simply the BEST. "Road  Warrior" is pure action and visual impact. Several years after the  first one's events,there was a great World War that leaded to the total  collapse of each form of civilization.There were nuclear exchanges too,but  we viewers will see their effects on the environment into "Mad Max  beyond thunderdome" scenario. However,Max is becoming a loner psycho,a  scavenger  wandering into a not-specificated Wasteland (probably following  an ecological disaster occurred prior the first "MAD MAX") in  costant search for food and...FUEL !  .He will meet a compound of  survivors,attacked  by a weird and bloody band of Marauders.All the events  connected to this small fight will lead Max to the way of  REDEMPTION.
"Road warrior" is an intense movie with a bit of  poetry in it,and the BEST CHASE SCENE of the Cinema history,but there's a  lack of a substantial plot,one thing you can find into the MASTERPIECE of  the series,MAD MAX 3.Yes,this one has created the myth of Mad Max,but the  third one is incredible !  Mad Max purists (like me) have  UNDERSTOOD the lesson,and there is a critical revalutation of the third  one,that however was a box-office smasher.
