The first impressive thing about this film, as with Zhang's other films released in the US ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Hero") is the fabulous photography. This is a beautiful, beautiful film to watch.

The acting is equally fine. The three main characters are compelling and natural. It's no surprise to see Jin falling for Mei, but the outcome of that attraction is a big surprise.

The plot is tightly woven and finely designed. The finale seems melodramatic, perhaps, but it's no more so than "Romeo and Juliet" or "Hamlet". This is a tragedy in the classic form, in which each member of the cast is brought low by the weakness he (or she) doesn't recognize inside.

If it seems pale compared to "Crouching Tiger", I think it's mainly because most of us saw that film first and were enchanted by it. If we had seen "Flying Daggers" first, we would have been equally enchanted by the combination of beauty, stylized violence and complex romantic tragedy.

This is definitely a film to own a copy of. You'll want to watch it many times.
