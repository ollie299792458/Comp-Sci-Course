This review applies only to the 2008 DVD reissue.

Having a carefully-remastered edition of Dirty Harry is, if not joy, then at least a cautionary message to those who feel unlucky.  The transfer preserves much of the grainy quality which seems to have been endemic to films of the late '60s and early '70s, while cleaning up the image in a non-intrusive manner.  This was my first time to see the film in widescreen, so I cannot say if the 2.35:1 ratio is correct.  However, I am almost sure that this film was initially released with a monaural soundtrack.  For the 2008 reissue, the film's soundtrack has been re-routed into the now-ubiquitous 5.1 Dolby Surround format.  This creates several problems.  On the one hand, the sound drops in and out in an unpredictable manner on mono or stereo televisions.  On the other, the assumption that every watcher would want to see Dirty Harry in full surround sound is a bit presumptuous.  I would rather see the film in its remastered glory with the original soundtrack, which could have been no more than stereo.  Using 5.1 surround sound only is a bit of technical elitism on the part of Warner Brothers.  Still, this is a seminal film of the zeitgeist that was the Sixties as well as being the template for the "Bad Cop with a Heart of Gold" films which followed in its footsteps.  This is the first, and by far the best.  I only dock it one star in my pompous fashion for the manner in which the studio has imposed the 5.1 Dolby Surround sound on the buyers of the film in this latest incarnation.
