I had rented this movie on pay-per-view months ago, watched the first 15 minutes, decided I didn't currently have the patience for it, and walked away from the television. Just now, I happened to catch it on HBO; I was pretty bored, so I decided to give it a second chance. It took a little while to get rolling, but it surprisingly turned out to be a pretty enjoyable film. All the actors did a great job portraying their characters. This isn't one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I thought the plot was clever and mature for a romantic comedy, if you would even catergorize it as that. It didn't have the perfect movie ending you would anticipate, but it was still happy. I liked it better that way; it was much more realistic, believable. The film was refreshing in that it wasn't just a love story between Scarlett Johansson and Topher Grace, as many initially believed. Emphasis was placed on the relationship between Dennis Quaid and his younger boss who replaced him (Grace). In the beginning, Quaid was bitter that he was demoted, especially to someone with no experience, who turned out to be an incredible salesman. Grace was just getting through a divorce, and didn't really keep in touch with his parents, so he greatly envied Quaid's strong family life at home. They both desired something the other had, and in the end they learned a lot from each other and become close companions despite the awkward "bumps" in the road, such as Grace's relationship with Johansson. It was a touching film without trying too hard and getting cheesy along the way. **** stars!
