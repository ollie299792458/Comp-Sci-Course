The Jillian Michaels: For Beginners (Frontside/Backside Combo) DVD really IS the best way to start a work-out routine! The emphasis is on demonstrating proper form and explaining WHY each of the moves is effective.

As a life-long couch potato who carries 100+ pounds of extra weight, when I made the decision to finally lose the weight and get in shape for the first time in my 35 years, I got a pedometer and started walking since that seems to be the easiest and most low-impact thing to do, right? Yeah, it's also the most boring and I didn't stick with it once the weather turned warm. When I realized I needed to move my work-out indoors if I wanted to stick with it, I started researching work-out DVDs and bought 3 of Jillian Michaels' to try. The 30-Day Shred work-out is great, but I had a very difficult time keeping up with even the Level 1 modified moves; my knees hurt so much even doing the jumping jacks! Rather than get discouraged, I did a little more research and found the Beginners DVD. The first time I tried it, I LOVED it! It really is geared towards beginners with the way the moves are explained and proper form is emphasized to get maximum benefit and to prevent injury. Even with the simpler moves, my heart rate was pumping and my muscles were burning by the end of the first DVD.

If you're like me and just starting out, this is definitely the DVD to try first!
