This is actually one of The Few Times that I am Happy To Pay A HIGHER PRICE for an Item! I had pre ordered the One Disc DVD when it was announced on Amazon at a price of $8.99. I ordered it but was Disappointed that it seemed to be skimpy on the extras But I will take this DVD any way I can. I was Pleasantly Surprised when  I was informed by Amazon that the one disc was being discontinued and that I would have too order the Two Disc Directors Cut, Didnt have to twist my arm on that one! I am more than Happy to shell out a few more dollars for an extra disc that will be loaded with Extras!  This Movie Deserves the Full Treatment! Yentl is The GREATEST of ALL Barbra Streisand Films and is by far her Most Personal Film! I respect Barbra's Professionalism and Integrity in Making Sure that This Movie Received the Proper Treatment for a DVD Release and I know it will have been worth the wait! To Me, The Ending of The Film when Yentl is on that Ship and Singing "A Piece of Sky" is one of the greatest scenes in Cinema History, Gives me Goose Bumps everytime I see it.  HERE IS A RUNDOWN OF THE DVD FEATURES: Yentl Director's Extended Edition.
