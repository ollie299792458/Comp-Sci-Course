"Gattaca" was originally released in 1997 with very little publicity, but instantly collected a dedicated fanbase. Today, two decades later, the growing fanbase of this science fiction drama has dubbed it one of the most creative and unique perspectives on the future, and they're right.

Director Andrew Niccol paints the picture of a future where humans are valued for little more than their DNA structures. Prospective employees must give blood samples as part of their initial interview process, allowing employers to unfairly discriminate against applicants with undesireable DNA structures (poor health, balding, heart problems, etc.). Into this picture Niccol paints Vincent, an underdog "degenerate" who will do whatever it takes to achieve his dream job: working at Gattaca Aerospace Center and flying into outter space. As the story unfolds, the audience sees just how far Vincent is willing to go to make his dreams a reality, and the consequences that arise from his actions.

"Gattaca" entices its audience with an interesting storyline, and then delivers throughout the rest of the film with beautiful cinematography, well-rounded characters, and plot twists that make for an overall incredible expereince.
