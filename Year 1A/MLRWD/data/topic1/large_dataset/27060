Please don't get me wrong, I love Xena, Gabrielle, Hercules and Iolaus but as far as season 3 of Xena goes, well, lets put it this way, of the 22 episodes that season, truly only about 5-6 really stand out. The rest deserve grades (on a scale of 1-100) of less than 75 each.

I suppose the real question is...is season 3 REWATCHABLE?

Not sure, but I cannot imagine anyone out there who loved the episode called "King Con" from season 3. Then again people called me crazy for loving the Babylon 5 episode called "Grey 17 is Missing". So to each their own I suppose. One mans garbage is another mans gold mine, etc, etc.

All in all I feel Xena and Hercules should be watched as they aired originally because otherwise you can miss stuff from one show to the other and back again. For example, if you missed "Armageddon Now" from season four of Hercules, you will not know where Callisto is emerging from when she first appears in the episode "Sacrifice pt 1" in Xena finale from season three. You won't know what she is emerging from or how she got there in the first place. I know it is confusing but the shows do overlap from time to time.

Taken as a whole, both Hercules and Xena are highly recommended with the edge going to Xena in overall enjoyability. But if you have the money, buy both. I know I'm gonna.
