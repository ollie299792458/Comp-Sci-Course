Answer me one question, before I start this review: Were the Dukes a couple of foul-mouthed, oversexed, hyperactive cousins who literally wanted to screw the General Lee and got off listening to AC/DC music? I think not. That's the beauty of this misunderstood 2005 film. Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott are a classic pair that play off each others' charisma perfectly. Jessica Simpson is a beautiful blonde bombshell who uses her gorgeous posterior to get what she wants. Willie Nelson is just fall down funny and Burt Reynolds comes off as having an almost Jackie Gleason-inspired persona (a nod, no doubt, to the "Smokey and the Bandit" franchise). But what makes this comedy gel so well lies in its direction. Director Jay Chandrasekhar reunites his old "Broken Lizard" buddies (look hard and you'll see all the well known faces from "Super Troopers" and "Club Dread") and completely makes the film his own. He injects enormous amounts of his outrageous style to craft a memorable, side-splitting comedy that stays with you long after you've taken the DVD out of your player. While it's not for purists of the television show, anyone with a taste for raunchy, off-the-wall, politically incorrect humor will have a field day with this triumphant success. One can only hope a sequel's in the works!
