First of all this film is a mockery of the classic cartoon.  Scooby looks nothing like himself and Shaggy is played over the top by Matthew Lillard who looks nothing like Shaggy.  I could get over these points however but the movie was completely boring with no plot, just a showcase for lackluster special effects.  Then about half way through Scrappy Doo who is upset because he didn't get what he wants decides to take revenge and PEES all over the girls.  I could not believe they would put such filth in a movie geared toward families and children.  The people who made this film are really sick in the head and should think about working on more adult oriented films to satisfy their obvious "creative" needs.  I have no problem with adult material but it belongs in an R or NC-17 rated film.  Films like this are the ones giving Hollywood a bad name.  Kids might think its funny when a dog pees on someone but kids also think just about anything is funny.  Like it or not Kids learn alot from movies and TV about acceptable behavior and tend to emulate what they think is funny for attention.  How many children after seeing this film threw a tantrum and then peed on one of their siblings or parents?

What a way to ruin a good series with an awful movie and then some dog pee.
