So you want to know what Eyes Wide Shut is all about huh?  Well don't ask me because, being art, this film is open to interpretation.  However, the best way to an artist's point is through the title.  What does it mean?  To  whom does it apply?  Does it mean anything at all?  (Hint:  riddle me this,  riddle me that, what does The Shining have to do with the theme and focus  of the movie other than a nifty name for a special gift?  By the way, if  you have a valid and logical answer, please let me know because I am  completely open to learning new things)  Anyway, back to my point.  I had  no point.  So do you finally get it.  You thought you were going to read  another review from a nobody who thinks they are a somebody.  Same thing  happend to Dr. William Harford.  He thought he had everything planne out.  He had a profitable medical practice, a beautiful  and intellegente wife, a  little rug rat.  He had everything while at the same time having nothing.  That's the art.  Kubrick, the directorial genius of no rival, took you on a  great long dream.  he duped you.  But it got you thinking didn't it.  You  started thinking about sex. (oh my!, how awful and perverted and sinful of  you.  Good Job, your growing up)  Nothing could be more helpful to opening  your mind than turning off the lights and making it find its way out of the  cave.  This is one of the greatest films I have ever had the honor of  watching.  To not have been given critical praise in America only goes to  show how conservative and closed minded a people we are.  I feel for my  future and that of my children if this pattern continues.  But enough of my  ranting and raving.  See the movie, be amazed and think.
