I served two tours in the Vietnam war and I am sometimes wary to watch a movie about it.  My grandson told me about this movie and so I decided to watch it and see.  Overall the movie at times seems embellished with hollywood but that does not mean they are stretching the truth, perhaps just adding some color to it.  The boot camp scenes were all to familiar as I had a lot of memories come back doing pushups, situps, and getting yelled at for someone else's mistake.

The battle scenes were not far off but not accurate to be applied to all the men and women who were are in combat.  The scene that stuck out in my mind was when the man called "animal mother" played by Alec Baldwin was wanting to go take out the sniper.  Sometimes these things happen but all to often the first and foremost thing you want to do is make sure you don't get killed trying to be a hero and doing something stupid that could endanger you and your fellow marines around you.

There is a lot of comeraderie and this movie did a good job of showing that with the men.  It also did show that some damn near do lose their marbles.  Many people watching it probably found some scenes to be resentful or sickening.  That they are, but one has to realize that it's another world over there in the war zone, and how you cope and are able to get through it sometimes would be deemed bad or wrong.  It's easy to judge when your at home in your recliner, and not crawling over bodies in the mud while someone is shooting at you.

The film to me was emotional at the end as the men regrouped and headed out on patrol, where there will be another sniper waiting, another letter from home that won't reach it's recipient, and another friend lost to war.  Full Metal Jacket embodies many things that were common in the Vietnam war.
