This documentary deals with an important and timely topic, namely the deliberate and secretive intrusion of the Church of Later Day Saints into the civil struggle over marriage equality.  It also contains new and important information about how the Mormons attempted to disguise their activities, probably in violation of their tax status as a non-political religious entity.  This is vital material that deserves to be known to a broad audience.

Thus it is sad and unfortunate that the film is so utterly unengaging.  The director uses every cheesy trick possible:  scary music, distorted pictures of LDS church leaders, rag-tag children, and a celebrity narrator.  What it does NOT have is any real through story or fully developed characters.  There is no beginning middle and end, just a series of tirades.  And the entire second half of the film seems tacked on to stretch the length rather than to draw in the audience.

Its a testament to the importance of the topic that this film was shown at SUndance.  It's a pity it wasn't constructed in a compelling manner such as other documentaries on this topic; e.g. For the Bible Tells Me.  This COULD have been an important film.
