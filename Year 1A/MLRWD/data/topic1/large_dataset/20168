Do the right thing is amazing!!! As we all know it is the tale of race relations in America, set in Brooklyn in the Bedford-Stuyvesant community. This movie glows as it shows the racial tension that still goes on today. Lee shows that as diverse as America is, instead of diplomatically talking out our differences, we fear what we do not understand and as minorities fight ourselves, while (some) of the racist majority laugh as they like to see our downfall. It is downright dazzling that Spike Lee can show culture whether black, Italian, Chinese, and white in a fun perspective when talking about race. The day like this one has happened in communities across America racial tension and all and it is about time that somebody said documented it. This being stated a common point is often missed in the film when Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Who did the right thing? They and the black characters both did. By buggin' out boycotting Sal's Pizzeria for selling pizza to African Americans in their community, and not acknowledging them (pictures on the wall), he represents Martin Luther King. MLK boycotted to make a difference and when inspiring leadership he found it hard to get followers in some states (like buggin out did). When they burned down the shop as a act of revolution for killing radio rahiem it was Malcolm X, not to say that Malcolm was violent, he was nonviolent, and peaceful man who believed in self defense, however, he said that revolution is violent and that is what happened. In the end Spike Lee communicated how a man lost his shop and another man lost his life becuase we did not, and still at times are not working together to solve our problems. Spike Lee is the last classic director we have in illustrating what America tries to hide, and challenges us to change it!!!!
