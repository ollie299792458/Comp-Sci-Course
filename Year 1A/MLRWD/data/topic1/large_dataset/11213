I've read all of the reviews posted above, and don't understand why people were shocked by the language. SouthPark isn't about potty humor at all, it's a constant commentary on society. The people who didn't like it didn't  comment at all about the gruesome deaths- only about the foul language. If  the title didn't warn them about what they were going to see, then it's  their own fault. I don't have anything against people who didn't like this  new classic, but I also don't go rent movies that I know won't appeal to me  and then gripe about what they are about. This movie isn't about two guys  trying to see what they can get away with, it's a political statement about  the current state of society. When you understand what Matt and Trey are  saying, the whole concept of South Park clicks and you can find the humor  on the intellectual (as opposed to the Jr. High) level. If you want  mindless entertainment, go watch a "serious" PG rated movie. If  you want to see a brilliant statement that gives you some hysterical relief  from the current state of society, go get this movie. Personally, I believe  that the best way to defeat what's wrong with our society is to laugh at  the stupidity of what Matt and Trey expose about our society in this  movie.
Thanks for reading this. :) Enjoy the movie, I do. p.s. -  The DVD  should have had more extra features, but that's not the fault of the movie.
