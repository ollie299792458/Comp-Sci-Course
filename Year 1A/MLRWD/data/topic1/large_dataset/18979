I took my oldest son (13) to see this movie in the theater.  I had major buyers remorse.  With the exception of the short scenes of Adam Sandler's character work place and the short scene with David Spade, this movie was so contrived and forced.  I know it's a comedy, but Sandler has done some quality stuff in the past.  It seems like such a "crap shoot" with Sandler.  He will make a quality movie like "Spanglish" then turn around and do this piece of work.  Adam Sandler playing his sister was so bad, during the movie I really wanted Adam Sandler's character "Jack" to boot Jill out and never see her again.  It wasn't a happy ending when we continued to see her.  There was no sympathy that could be felt for this horrible character.  It would have been better if Jill had been Jack's twin brother, Jim, and was dressing up as a woman and he had difficulty accepting his brother/sister and it would have been more believable.  I digress.  As your mother would say to you about an annoying cousin/brother/sister/etc. "Don't laugh (or give money to this movie), it only encourages them."
