Having read the book, I must say that the movie is pretty closely aligned to the story written by Alice Walker.  Realizing that it is impossible to completely portray a book as a film (you can't show the character's thoughts, for example) this movie has grown to be one of my favorites since it was first released, and I was in junior high school.

The actors do an outstanding job depicting the characters with all their flaws, weaknesses and beauty. Even the more prominent men in the movie (Harpo, Mister) have another side--both seek the affection and approval of a father who withholds it.

Those who dislike the movie because of its portrayal of men, particulary African-American men, overlook the minor roles of Rev. Samuel, the missionary who adopts Celie's children; Buster,the boxer who dates and doesn't try to overrule the strong-willed Sophia; and even, Shug's husband,Grady, who (in the movie version) accepts Shug for who she is, knowing her past.

 While I agree that Hollywood needs to promote many movies that depict African-American men in a positive light, that was not the purpose of this movie (or book). The story is about the women, who overcome disappointment, shame, low-self esteem and abuse to accept and love who they are, just as they are.
