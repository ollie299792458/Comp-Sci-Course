"You can be as you choose to be. It takes some discipline but it can be done."

I first saw The Bodyguard in a hot summer day. I waited in a long queue for my ticket and the theatre was fully packed. Tired and frustrated, I could not enjoy the film but it grew in me over time. It was different experience when I saw it again. In fact, The Bodyguard is a serious, original and very well told story. Love can be as real as me, sitting and writing here, and still be impossible and bitter-sweet. I can relate to this. Don't we all go through it at list once in our lifetime?

I love Kevin Costner's performance as Frank  Farmer. I find him very convincing in the skin of this tough, self-disciplined guy with a heart of gold. I admire Kevin's portrayal of Frank's emotional  torment when he had to choose between his duty and his heart. Whitney Huston is surprisingly good and her enormous musical talent makes up for her lack of acting experience.

The Bodyguard has it all: action-packed scenes, cool lines, pearls of wisdom, tender loving and fantastic soundtrack! This film is definitely worth your time.
