I had high hopes for this release; however I should have know that something was amiss by the cover.  None of the character was faithfully recreated:
- Schmendrake was not fat and dumpy in the movie.  I think they could have come up with better angle to express the size of his nose.
- One of the distinctive traits of the unicorns was that their mane flowed close to their body, no flailing in the breeze
- IMHO the weakest link in the story, their butterfly did not even have his trademark goggles.
Once you open the clamshell case you're greeted with the same cover image on the insert.  GASP!  The image imprinted on the CD is a mirror image of the cover.
The quality of the recording was mediocre at best.  Its dark, the colors are washed out, and all the edge is soft and dirty.  I was expecting a lot more since the back cover did expressly say that it was a re-mastered version.
The story itself was untouched. The old witch died her grizzly death and the talons of the anatomically correct harpy.  The violent fight scenes were not deleted.
All in all I recommend this for someone who never saw this feature.  The packaging is poor but the story itself is timeless.
