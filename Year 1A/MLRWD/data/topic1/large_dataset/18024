I am not a big fan of violent movies.  As a matter of fact, I've only seen one Tarantino movie.  I don't like blood and gore.  But I like action movies.

But, I was bored and got nothing to do.  And I was also curious at Paul Walker's acting in this movie since this is not like his other movies.  I love 8 Below and the Fast and the Furious not because of the acting but because I love dogs and fast cars.

I did not expect that Running Scared would actually hold my attention from start to finish.  I thoroughly enjoyed the cinematics and the camera work.  I thought it looked cool and really artsy. Wayne Kramer did a really good job. I like the fast-pacing.  There's never a dull scene.  Although, I had to turn my head on some of the of the scenes.
[spolier alert!]
Paul Walker's acting is surprisingly good. As Joey Gazelle, he really looked like he is "running scared".  He made a believable mob grunt who's at his wits end for botching a really simple job.  Vera's character described Joey as someone who is "shady, sleazy and mixed up with the wrong people but not evil".  Walker did a good job in portraying this.

Kramer described the film as being a fairy tale.  And I think he's right.  The scenes with Oleg felt like he is Alice in a very twisted Wonderland.  Instead of following the white rabiit, he is following the hooker.  He does not meet the mad hatter but he meets certainly one nutter after another.  The mob is after his head.

If you like blood, violence, and gore delivered through really cool cinematics, I recommend this movie.
