...or better yet not.  This film is real but depressing.  I agree with some of the criticsm here that the stories within this film are a little disjointed when you first see this.  And if you know nothing about the problems with organized crime in and around Naples then some of this may not make complete sense.  But for the most part this film does not romanticize the mafia like so many American films do.  And for that alone this is an interesting film to see.

I waited a long time to see this.  It took quite a while to be released on dvd in the US and in the US format.  The bottom line is that this is raw and sometimes hard to watch because of the random, heartless and very real violence...  but it is something that you will probably want to see again because the performances are very unaffected for the most part and after seeing that horrific real Naples hit on Youtube this seems very realistic.

This does for Naples tourism what City of Lost Children did for Rio.
