Not your typical heist movie - very intense and unpredictable. A few scenes are particularly memorable, such as the scene in which Owen's character instructs the police to focus their cameras on the second floor window. Wow, that was shocking and eerie.

Foster, Owen, Washington, and Plummer are on the short list of actors I admire. Lee has not been one of my favorite directors, but I love this movie, especially his attention to detail. For example, the bank used to be a Fallout shelter - you can see the yellow and black sign as people go down the stairs to the basement. I really liked the camerawork in the beginning, with closeups of statues and signs. Interesting soundtrack too, beginning and ending with an exotic Indian song that alludes to the multiculturalism of the setting and cast.

Unfortunately though, Lee is clearly obsessed with breasts. This detracts from the maturity of this movie. Watching males act how they typically do around breasts is pathetic and demeaning to women AND men. I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could - sorry, I decided to round down instead of up.

I used to work for a bank but was never involved in a robbery. The few mistakes of this movie, and most bank robbery movies, occur during the vault scenes.  The money is not supposed to be spread out on shelves, in plain view of whoever goes into the vault. It's really stored in steel lockers with separate combinations. It irritates me that most people imagine the money to be lying around, unprotected. Responsible banks wouldn't operate in that way. I realize this is just a movie, but give some credit to the bank for keeping the money properly protected. And give those security guards handguns.
