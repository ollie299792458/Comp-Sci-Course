The scary thing about "Scary Movie" is that it is aimed to a strong audience of American (As in America the Continent, not the USA, duh!) teenagers and young adults with no sense of good taste and a preference for toilet humor instead of some good comedy. I'm glad I didn't have to pay from my pocket to see this one. 
 Call me an antiquarian if so much you want to, but with the sole exception of a few scattered jokes, there is nothing of much appeal in here for anyone with a high self-esteem. (Yes, this movie is THAT bad) The "jokes" are all in the classical North American tradition and this is enough to make you think for a second time before venturing in. That's right my good sir, we have everything ranging from fart jokes to gross sex and everything in between. The only thing this movie is capable to do, is to show the importance 90% of North American teens give to sex instead of other, far more important, issues. (Well, the horror movies this movie tried to "spoof" already show such given importance, anyway) 
  The producers, director and screenwriter(s) seem to be unable to spot the difference between the disgusting and the genuinely funny, and knowing that there are people out there who find this funny gives me the creeps. After all, how stupid do you need to be to think that a penis that ejaculates like a hog house is funny?
  Case closed.
