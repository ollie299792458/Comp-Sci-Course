I'll admit to being amused by all the people griping about having to buy these films in boxed sets.  I mean, come on, people...if you're a true Bond fan you want them all, even the bad ones, and if you're not a true Bond fan you don't need to own a few select titles because you won't be watching them over and over anyway.  Consider this; how many people buy only one or two of the Star Wars movies, or just one of the Lord of the Rings films?  This is a series, and therefore the boxed sets make perfect sense even if they do have their problems.

In my opinion, none of these boxed sets is perfect because other than the fact that each contains at least one film starring Connery, one with Moore and one with Brosnan, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the groupings.  Each box has good films and bad films.  The good news is that the picture and sound have been so excellently restored for these editions that even the bad films look better!  I might even be able to sit through A View to a Kill one more time---if I have enough martinis beforehand, that is.  To compare, I played a scene from my old DVD of Goldfinger then played the same scene on the new DVD.  The picture was more crisp, the colors brighter, and the sound was both louder and better mixed.  No more problems with the dialogue being too soft and the music and sound effects being too loud!  The menu screens are pretty snazzy as well and other than those annoying previews being added to the beginning of each disc, the intros are all very cool.  Oh, one other complaint---just like others have said, the boxed set designers should have come up with a better system for including the booklets rather than just shoving them in the back of the box.  All in all, though, I give these sets a solid four and a half stars, bumped up to five because I've been a Bond fanatic all my life.
