Having scanned all the reviews of this movie, and having read the book and seen the movie product myself (and oh boy, is it "product"), I can honestly say that you will either love this movie or you'll despise it.  No disrespect to the people who love it, it has it's moments of fun and is a rare family movie.  But to me it's a cloyingly sweet, over-the-top, Hollywoodized perversion of a great children's novel.  Oddly enough, Ian Fleming had a great innate understanding of children of Jeremy and Jemima's age and he treats their characters with a respect lacking in most adult novels about children.  In contrast, the movie is absolutely condescending to children, as bad as the nightmare babysitter who knew how to sweet-talk your parents but you could absolutely see through.  For those of you who love the movie, watch it in good health.  For those of you who can't hack the syrupy celluoid, find the original novel (I found a nice bound version through a used/rare bookseller site - take notice, Amazon) and read it together with your child.  Now that's an adventure you will really cherish!
