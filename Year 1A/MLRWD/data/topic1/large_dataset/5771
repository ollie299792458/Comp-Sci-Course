As something of an japanimation fan today, I went back to see this again.  While it lacks the intense raw edge savagery and majic that are potent to newer MA shows like Outlaw Star, the sheer scale of the animation has seldom seen equal.  I kid you not, some scenes are as intense today as those in Private Ryan.  The robots are fed live into the evil of Unicron.  I disagree with other commentators somewhat.  The TV show and The Movie were spawn of different realms.  I see the TF televised series as fitting with Justice League and Scooby Doo on afternoon TV.  Kid stuff for when I was 8.  But this movie belongs on every TF fan's shelf.  It takes the energy of our imaginations then, and reminds us today of that world in a way we can understand now.  I saw it in the theater, and its best enjoyed there!  Something like the fun and fear of watching Army of Darkness...  Unicron belongs on the BIG screen!  Some movies, like TF and JP (Jurassic Park) aren't the same without the big screen.  This movie was 20 years ahead of its audience!  No one wanted to see heros die when we were 8!  If you enjoy early anime - macross, gundams, or akira types especially - watching this rare gem from marvel comics animation, is as good as it gets.  Go visit the friend with the HDTV set and surround sound, though!  If you don't remember the transformers (do you even remember college after all those parties?!) the good guys have the red patch and the bad guys have the purple.  100% Classic!  Support a theatrical re-release!!  Oh yeah, cast included: Leonard Nimoy, Robert Stack, Eric Idle (Monty Python), Casey Kasem, Scatman Crothers, and Orson Welles
