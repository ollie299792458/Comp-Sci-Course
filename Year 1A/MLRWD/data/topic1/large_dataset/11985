This is one amazing show that everybody loves. The unforgettable characters and memorable music make "Rudolph" one of the videos my family never fails to watch each winter. See, I'm 16 years old and didn't grow up with all these stop-motion, "Animagic" Rankin/Bass holiday special shows, but I do love them. For the longest time I watched "Rudolph" every Christmas and "Peter Cottontail" every Easter, but didn't know the wealth of other wonderfully great shows awaiting me. Luckily just today I finished watching the Rankin/Bass marathon on TV, and was introduced to some other incredible classics that I must buy: "Pinnochio's Christmas," "Jack Frost," "The First Christmas," "The Little Drummer Boy," "Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey," "The Year without a Santa Claus" (the best one), "Rudolph's Shiny New Year," and more. I know most of the voice acting because I enjoy watching older TV sitcoms and game shows, in which all these 70's actors and actresses starred. "Rudolph" will always remain a favorite part of my holiday traditions. The characters of Yukon Cornelius, the Bumble, Clarice (Rudolph's girlfriend), and Hermey, along with the songs like "Silver and Gold" and "Santa's Elves"--oh, and let's forget the BEST part of all, those poor little Misfit Toys!--make this one video you can't afford to miss.
