Other than the James Bonds, this is my favorite film and my favorite war film.  I remember seeing it at my local theater at age 13 in 1963, a year after its first run reserved-seat engagement on Broadway.  I watch it every June 6th. and have yet to tire of it.
Starring John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton and a pre-Dr. No, Sean Connery, among numerous others.  (The only film I can think of with a better cast is probably "How the West Was Won.)  The film had three directors and the massive action sequences are still breathtaking: The 82nd. airborne division disasterous drop in German-occupied Ste. Mere Eglise, the 2 Luftwaffe plans strafing the 2 British beaches, the Ranger division's incredible attack of the German-held Pointe du Hoc and especially, the French Commando raid on the french town of Ouestram with one long several minute helicoptor shot that has to be seen to be believed. (Like other films of this period the end-credits are shockingly short.  Today the credits on a film of this size would last ten minutes.)
I have this film on video and DVD.  While it was nice that they added a few extra features on its most recent DVD release, I truly wish they could have located a few deleted scenes. (You can see a scene not in the film briefly in the trailer included.)  In 1994, on the 50th anniversary of D-Day, a colorized version of this film was released on video, (the film is in black and white.)  The colorized version was pretty good and should have been included with the recent DVD and blu-ray release.
This film lost the best picture Oscar to "Lawrence of Arabia" and amazingly only won 2 technical Oscars.  While Lawrence is a great film also, "The Longest Day" is a greater and more important achievement and it continues to annoy me to this day that it did not win the best picture Oscar.  If you have never seen this incredibly epic and well-made film, you should grab the DVD or blu-ray as soon as possible, you won't be dissappointed.
