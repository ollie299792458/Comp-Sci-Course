The story line is twisted to put it mildly but never boring for a second and interestingly making for great conversation after viewing...

I will not divulge any of the plot (too much has already been spilled in other reviews) and while the plot is amazingly thought out and delivered by Scorsese, the plot really does not matter as much as the characters and their stories.

What matters more in my mind is the characters (all brilliantly acted) who show sides that are deeply engraved in all of us (thankfully in less extreme denominations in most cases). The movie take the obsession, anger, feeling of guilt, revenge, pity, dependence, lust to the extreme but with a bit of soul searching we can relate to the underlying urges and feelings and if we allow it, the movie leaves one thinking afterwards remembering our own experiences and our own behavior in difficult situations over the years.

No one can ever claim this movie did not touch something in them and even its harshest critics are spellbound to the screen throughout the movie.

A must see.
