Four friends vowed to have the best bachelor party that they will never remember, only to wake up the next day with their hotel room trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, one guy missing a tooth, one guy missing who's supposed to get married in 1 day, and nobody can remember anything that happened from the night before. Watching the theatrical trailer for this film, I really expected this to be funny, laughing from beginning to end. That's how I knew it was. It's an idea that we've seen before as evidenced by movies such as Very Bad Things, but Todd Phillips (director of Old School, and Road Trip) and co. took the "bachelor party in Vegas gone haywire" theme and gave it the right parts needed to make this an instant classic. Great casting was done here as well as you immediately have three actors: Bradly Cooper (Wedding Crashers, Yes Man), Ed Helms (TV's The Office, Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay) and comedian Zach Galifianakis (What Happens In Vegas) who may even be this years comedy rat pack. Trust me, I'm never usually excited about a comedy because I'm usually letdown by more than half of what I see. Excited by a theatrical trailer? That's never really happened to me until this movie, and it was every bit as funny if not funnier than the trailer. You'll laugh all the way through. I recently read that a sequel is in the works. Most people would cry foul over a sequel especially since some aren't as good as the first, but I'll check it out.
