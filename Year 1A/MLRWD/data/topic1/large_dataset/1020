This is Tim Burton's best work, well this and Edward Scissorhands are his best work closely followed by Ed Wood and Big Fish.  This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.  I mean, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was good but this was way better ny far.  I recommend this to any Tim Burton fan, or evwn if your not a big fan of his work, you'll still love this movie.
