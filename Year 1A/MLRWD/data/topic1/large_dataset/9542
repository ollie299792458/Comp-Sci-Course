I found this movie to be essentially perfect Bond. By Thunderball, the producers had made the Bond Formula. 
One of the ingredients in this formula was the Pre-Credits Sequence. In Thunderball, it was one of the best. A perfect blend of action (the fight) and gadgets (Rocket Pack). 
Then, we fly in to the first Maurice Binder titles. It complements perfectly with the music and the underwater theme. Then we are treated to 2 hours of perfection.
The plot has some great action without going way over the top and becoming cartoonish like some of the more recent bonds. It starts when SPECTRE has a plan to hijack a warplane carrying two atomic bombs and hold NATO for ransom. Bond is assigned to Nassau and quickly gets drawn into the world of SPECTRE. With the help of Domino, a beautiful girl whose brother was killed as a result of SPECTRE's misdoings, Bond gets the villain cornered on a boat... You'll have to see it to find out!
 The girls, for one, Claudine Auger as Domino Derval was perfectly cast. She had the essence of a Bond Beauty, and she was very memorable. But the best girl was Luciana Palluzzi as Fiona Volpe. This sexy and dangerous Redhead is my favourite Bond girl. I loved the scene in the hotel when Bond is captured. She was imitatated in the next Bond, You Only Live Twice, but was never matched. 
One of the great Bond villains, Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo, better known as Number Two. He was threatening and cool, a great combination. 
The locales were nothing short of stunning. From Shrublands to France, from Florida to Nassau, this Bond delivers! And Sean Connery at his best. Even he says this was his best performance! And I agree. The action is perfectly balanced in this movie, allowing strong character and plot development.
This is the best Bond.
