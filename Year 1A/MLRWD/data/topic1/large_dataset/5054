Surprisingly well written, this is another atempt my main stream media to make dope smoking part of the normal culture.

The plot of the movie is thin.  Guy gets kicked out of his apartment since his stoner roomate spent all their rent money on hookers.  Guy is now forced to move in with his Grandma.

Weak at best but it makes for an interesting idea.  It would have been more plausable if they used the idea from Failure to Launch but you can't have everything.

Sure their are plenty of laughs but parts of the movie just don't work.  after all the main character is spending a lot of money on drugs , pot.  Yet the amount of money spent on drugs is never brought up.  In deed the reason the guy can not get a new apartment is because he can not aford a new apartment, yet he can afford his drug habit.

To complicate matters our hero is a video game tester.  Supposedly one of the best and oldest in the business.  But he does not come across as a gamer.  When he gives hints on past games or is descring one our hero sounds fake and passionateless.

Instead of believing him you feel that he is mocking the sub culture that he is suposed to be a part of.

Even with this the movie does shine.  This is done by one hell of a supporting cast.  From the Grandma bunch to the Geek crew you have a wonderful mix of pranksters and vetrans.  As such even though the plot is thread bare and the hero lack luster you still  have a good movie and a fun time.
