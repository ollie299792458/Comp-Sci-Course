So I got this movie free with my new PS3 and was thinking sweet, now I dont have to rent or buy it.  Well I can see why they were giving it away.  It does have some clever one liners but some parts of the movie are just so dumb.  Too much of the humor is tasteless and not funny. The Jean Girard character is so ridiculous and not funny or entertaining.  Ok he is homosexual nascar driver, how hilarious, what genius writing.  Then the reaccuring part where Will Ferrel runs around and thinks he is on fire is enough to make you want turn off the movie.  It is kind of hard to explain, but they took most of jokes and punchlines to the extreme thinking it would be funnier, but it missed.  Or the fact Will Ferrel had to drive the Wonderbread car, even though Wonderbread refused to pay any for it.  The writers were so set in their ways they gave Wonderbread all that free advertising and no other product would be funny on a racecar.  I even tried watching this movie a few more times to see if I missed something, still not funny.  DO NOT BUY this movie if you have not seen it, you are not missing much if you choose not to watch it at all.  Half of the good parts are in the previews for the movie anyways.

P.S.  I think Nascar fans may enjoy this movie more than someone who has no opinion of Nascar.
