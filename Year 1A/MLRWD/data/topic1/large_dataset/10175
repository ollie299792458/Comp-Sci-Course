Very few horror movies, especially nowadays, really get to me.  By get to me, I mean that I can carry the movie in my heart even when it is over.  I truly feel for both the pain of the main character and I carried it with me once I saw the credits.  It really stuck with me.  Now, the story I think is a masterpiece.  It doesn't use loud music and isn't "over done".  It is in your face but very quiet.  This review is hard to write without giving it away.  I was at the edge of my seat (couch in this case) the entire movie.  I immediately bought it after watching it just so I could watch it whenever I choose.  Granted, I am a horror movie fanatic and can be very judgemental over what is produced nowadays.  This movie is truly a must see and really shows that good, no great horror movies can be made even today.  I will say I was a little disappointed at the end but not the kind of disappointed that would ruin the movie.  I was disappointed that he didn't do things the way I would have lol.  Not a good enough reason not to watch the movie.  Fantastic movie if you truly appreciate a beautiful combination of story and horror.
