Ellen Barrett is certainly a pleasant instructor, but this workout strikes me as an odd combination.  The cardio workout involved many Pilates inspired moves combined with basic low-impact aerobic moves.  For instance, one section features four sets of side-to-side step touches and then you do the Pilates inspired move:  point your foot to the side, cross it behind, back to the side, and then point in front with your arms held straight out to the side.  You do this twice, and then it's back to the step-touches.  The object is to balance and maintain a strong core.  The series of plies work the thighs a bit more, but overall, nothing too intense.

The overall effect of the cardio segment felt like a low-impact aerobics routine without the fun or challenge of some of the mmore intense cardio dance workouts I enjoy. The floor pilates section also disappointed me:  I felt like I spent a lot of time waiting for the instructor to stop explaining and get me moving again.

Now, given the many positive reviews, I suspect that this combination is a better fit for individuals seeking precisely this unusual combination or who perhaps are just getting started with a fitness program and need more explanation. Those with more experience with Pilates and cardio workouts may find it a little disappointing.
