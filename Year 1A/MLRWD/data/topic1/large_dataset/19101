When a discussion of Clint Eastwood's most popular films begins the first films usually mentioned(and rightfully so) are his spaghetti western "dollars" trilogy and his "Dirty Harry" series.
Often overlooked is the taut World War II action adventurer "Where Eagles Dare".
"Where Eagles Dare" (1968) has a lot going for it; a fantastic screenplay by Alistair MacLean, great performances by Eastwood and Richard Burton,&amp; a superb score by Ron Goodwin.  It's one of the best "impossible mission" films ever done; loaded with suspense, derring do, thrills and fantastic action.
The DVD CONTAINS the WIDESCREEN VERSION of the film beautifully transferred to disc.  It also contains the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER, a MAKING-OF-FEATURETTE: ON LOCATION: WHERE EAGLES DARE, and an EASTWOOD FILM HIGHLIGHTS LISTING.
If you're a Clint Eastwood fan; if you're a war movie buff; if you're an action/adventure movie enthusiast; you will enjoy "WHERE EAGLES DARE" !!!!!!!!!
