I've had this DVD for a while and just started doing it again after a hiatus.  Now I remember why I like it so much.  All in all it's close to an hour, but it does go by quickly and it's simple to follow.  And the calorie burn? This morning, my heart rate monitor measured that I burned 637 calories during this workout!  If you work it and you really make an effort, you will get a super cardio, sweaty workout.  If you do this DVD and hardly know you're working out, you're just going through the motions.  You'll still burn calories of course, but as with anything else, you have to give it your all to make it really effective.  There is a lot of chatter, which really doesn't bother me.  What does bother me a bit is during the 4th mile, there are a couple of "pull down" exercises with the band that work the back, where Leslie doesn't count and you end up doing more on one side than the other.  But as long as you count yourself, you can make that adjustment.  Otherwise I'd give this workout 5 stars.
