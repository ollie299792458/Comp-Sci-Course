I remember seeing Clerks when it first came out on video and knowing that I would always see every film that Kevin Smith ever made. I had to drive over an hour away from home to see this film in the only theater it was playing in Atlanta. And I was not disappointed. At least not at first.

I trust everyone knows the synopsis and characters by now, so I will skip it. I've read many of the reviews and have found none that point to the best scene of the film. Immediately after finding out Alyssa's sexuality, there is a scene between Banky and Alyssa primarily where they discuss sexual wounds. The scene is a clear homage to Spielberg's "Jaws;" the scene in which Hooper and Quint share sea-faring injuries. I remember laughing hysterically as I watched it, because I had seen Jaws only a few nights earlier.

Unfortunately, Smith's obvious love of film has not enabled him to develop a plot sense. As with "Dogma," this film captures you early with its sharp dialogue and intriguing characters, only to fall apart when conflict resolution arises. I would have been much happier with an even more depressing ending, if the theme of the movie was developed through the plot first and the characters second. But alas, Smith's writing is still not quite sophisticated enough to always tie up all the loose ends.(Hooper X just disappears)

On the positive side, Smith has become a much better actor since "Clerks" and that makes his scene much more enjoyable to watch. All in all, this film is definitely worth the price if you have a soft spot for Gen X comedies that have great characters and sharp dialogue.
