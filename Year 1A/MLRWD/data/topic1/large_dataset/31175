'Son of Frankenstein' is, in my opinion, the least successful of all the Frankenstein films in this series. It obviously had a great deal of money spent on it, judging by the austere and quite massive sets. It boasted a  fine cast, too,  including Karloff, Atwill, Rathbone and Lugosi's first  involvement in the series as the classic henchman, Ygor. And, admittedly,  it has a lot of atmosphere what with crashing rainstorms, gothic  architecture and restless villagers. But it lacks something. The weird  black humour of former director James Whale, possibly, and the dry,  eccentric characters he used to create (Minnie the housekeeper or Dr.  Praetorious from 'Bride...' for example). Possibly, the inclusion of the  brattish 'Grandson' of Frankenstein, who adds nothing but an element of  irritation to the picture. Somehow, it seems to drag in a way that none of  the other films did, and the monster itself is treated with little respect:  he has become a silent murderer in this film, with no sympathy or humanity,  much as he would do in future stories, but at least they would have the  novelty value of a different actor playing the part. Here, even Karloff's  heart doesn't seem to be in it, and by no means a negligable film, this is  definately not one of the best.
