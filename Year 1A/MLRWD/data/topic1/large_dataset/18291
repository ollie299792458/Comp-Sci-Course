Most definately the worst superman in the series, the secial effects in this movie look poorer than in superman I. One of the methods they used to make christoper reeve fly was the optical technique, this involved turning supermans blue costume turqoise, and in this movie it was too turqoise! Poor cinematography made it obvious to tell the fake background, and his yellow 's' on the cape looked white instead. If this wasnt enough, the sequences had no end of errors, this includeds Lex and Lenney robbing supermans hair from the museum in broad daylight without being noticed, the woman kidnapped ny nuclear man at the end of the movie somehow breathed in space, lois not realising that clark was superman when he revealed himself after dropping off his flat and the faint of the train driver at the beginning of the movie was a little short and sudden. The dvd quality makes it easier to identify the errors.  The first superman was beautiful! its a shame as they went on they got worser, especially the firing of director Richard Donner endded the emotion and energy that was contained in the first movie. Superman 4 lacks all the elements of the previous films, and it looks as if it was made for the sake of making it. As im a Superman fan, I bought the boxset as soon as it was released, if there is anything positive about this movie it's the fact that Superman gets involved in Politics. Overall a not so good movie, buy only if your a true a superman fan.
