Season 3 is, by far, the best season yet.  The actors continue to gel with their respective roles, and we gain some new ones who will hopefully stick around long enough to cement themselves into our hearts and fantasies.  Think a tall, sexy new werewolf, a seemingly nurturing beau for our La La and an intriguing new fairy.  Although I must confess to missing Russell Edgington.  What a delicious villain!

On the other hand, it is also easy to criticize the highly soapy, sometimes overacted, aspects of our favorite vamp fest.  But then, that's what True Blood is at its core: a nightly, paranormal soap opera that rarely disappoints, because it never claims to be what it isn't. Alan Ball mined exactly what he needed from Charlaine Harris's entertaining, romance-novel-meets-supernatural-mystery series, peppered in plenty of blood, nudity and hot sex, and never forgot that we, the audience, also needed to be scared.

If I have one gripe about my purchase of Season 3 of True Blood, it would be what is missing in the blu-ray DVD boxed set.  HBO fed us teasing, online sit-downs with pairs of actors/characters and a wonderful interview with the entire cast outside the Stackhouse family home (sans Nelsan Ellis, who was sorely missed), not to mention actor interviews, only to exclude them on the DVDs.  Huh?  And shame on them!

Of course, this die-hard fan is gnashing his own set of choppers for the Season 4 premier this Sunday and has no intention of putting any final nail into his viewing coffin, but seriously, HBO execs, make certain to cram as much as your devoted fans give you in revenue into the Season 4 DVD set--or some of our fangs might really come out to play.
