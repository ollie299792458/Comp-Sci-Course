Where is your home? The place you matter most. Where you mean something to other people. Where somewhere means something to you.

Mac, working for dotty oil company chief (Burt Lancaster) - more interested in astronomy than the next big oil-field - based out of Houston where he makes million-dollar deals by phone before brunch, finds himself sent to a remote Scottish coastal village, to negotiate a big refinery project. At first, the ultra-slow pace of life of the locals frustrates him - why can't he seal the deal and get back home? But then the magic of the place starts to seep into him. Things he thought mattered aren't really that important. And the genuinely important things in life begin to reveal themselves. And Mac finds his true home.

Funny, light-hearted (everyone gets what they want, nobody loses) yet deeply touching, this film is a rare thing - one that makes you feel good all over, in all sorts of ways, indefinitely.

Somewhere, there's a phone ringing, someone calling home. Where are you going to call tonight?
