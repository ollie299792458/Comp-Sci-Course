I've always enjoyed "My Fair Lady", so when I read about this film I was intrigued.  I'm so happy I finally got a chance to view it.  It's every bit as wonderful as My Fair Lady, just in a different way.

Leslie Howard was perfect as professor Higgins, and I'll admit that I found Wendy Hiller to be stunningly beautiful. The marvelous acting, excellent screen play, and superb cinematography more than made up for the lack of musical numbers or lavish color sets found in My Fair Lady.

As far as the Criterion Transfer goes..... well..... it's not perfect. However, I've got a feeling that has more to do with the quality of the prints they had to work with rather than any lack of skill on their part.  Mostly it's very good, but occasionally, for a VERY short scene here and there, it drops down noticeably. That's ok with me.  This is a visually beautiful film and we are fortunate they were able to give us something this good!  I found the audio quite adequate throughout.

Is Pygmalion "better" than My Fair Lady?  That's debatable.  To me it's simply another wonderful version of an enchanting tale.
