I am a huge Jennifer Saunders fan and I thought that these episodes of AbFab are just as amazing as the first 3 seasons.  I think some might be daunted when watching these new episodes of AbFab because there are a few things that have changed in the series, but what did you expect?  The characters are still just as shallow as they have ever been.  Besides, a series can not stay the same forever or it would just be the same old thing all the time and become boring.  You can't compare the first 3 seasons of the show to the 4th because there has been a 5 year hiatus.  Ideas change, the world changes and television changes. I think by changing things a bit Jennifer Saunders has created more trouble and more laughs for the characters.  The jokes are just as dry, witty and humorous as the first episodes and I applaude her for that.  
Plus, the dvd has an amazing selection of extra features like the commentary from Jennifer Saunders where she tells how she got inspiration for the jokes and episodes.  The out-takes are absolutely hilarious and filled with funny moments from the cast.  Also, one of the best features is the full length pilot episode of "Mirrorball" which was going to be Jennifer Saunders' new series on the BBC.  It has the entire cast of AbFab playing different characters, and it is fun to see their wide range of acting abilities.  Plus, the episode was actually quite funny. There is a lot of slapstick comedy in it.  So, all in all, I would absolutely recommend buying this dvd collection. It is a must have for any AbFab fan.
