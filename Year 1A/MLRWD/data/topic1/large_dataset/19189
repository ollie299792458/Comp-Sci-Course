I saw The Grandmother and The Alphabet on the big screen in London way back in 1990 (on the same bill as Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, what a night!!), and had been trying to get my hands on them for years. I was so happy when Lynch finally released them (and the other films on this DVD) from his website a few years ago. I bought it as soon as it was available, and fell in love with his weirdness all over again. Fans of Lynch will love owning these films, but they aren't really for everyone.

It's easy to see the seeds of not only Eraserhead, but many of Lynch's later films in the early short films. The later entry, for the Lumiere DVD, is also exceptionally Lynchian. I could do without The Cowboy and The Frenchman, but all in all would recommend this for anyone who has seen and loved Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Drive.

Some of the best parts are the introductions by Lynch before each film. He's so normal it's bizarre!! Great to have this collection and the new(ish) Eraserhead DVD available on Amazon!
