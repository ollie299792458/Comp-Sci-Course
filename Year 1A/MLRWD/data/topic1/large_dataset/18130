I had the same problem as most of the other reviewers in that I am one episode short but with another episode duplicated.

I have to say that other than that I think that the BBC have done an awfully good job in pushing this show back to the dizzy heights of the first season. You are always surprised by the loss of characters which happens at unforseen times but the new ones are often rough diamonds which soon are polished especially the new character of Ros...one to watch there. Can we trust her? Is she as honest as she says? Time alone will tell.

There are some really solid storylines here, stellar performances and far far too many realistic scenarios especially in the last episode.

I am not surprised A&E have chosen not to broadcast this season, they are probably too scared of all of the issues that might arise from groups who could take offence and some of the powerful political lobby groups in the States.

Overall I think this season has been superb but I hace to say, One Episode short of a 5 Star.
