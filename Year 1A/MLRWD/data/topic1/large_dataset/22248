I had very high hopes for the remale of 3:10 to Yuma, and I was happy with the first part of the film. But by the time the movie closes toward its ending, the screenplay becomes filled with scenes that would be seen as acceptable (not brilliant, mind you, but merely acceptable) only to someone who knows next to nothing about classic Westerns and has little common sense about human nature. I am still dumbfounded that so much that could not pass the plausibility test on the old country store porch or the old courthouse square is in a Western that so many find a laudable addition to the genre.

The best western since Unforgiven? It is third rate, or worse, compared to Open Range. The new 3:10 to Yuma is inferior to the original, whose creators knew it was a B movie and wise enough to keep it on track and realistic in light of both the Old West and human nature.

The immense talents of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, not to emphasize those of Peter Fonda, are wasted in this remake. Perhaps the three of them could give Mel Gibson a call and encourage him to make a Western and cast them in lead roles.
