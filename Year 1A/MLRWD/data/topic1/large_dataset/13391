A lot of times when I see these cartoon and human mash-up movies, they come off more corny than funny and more over the top (in a bad way). When I say over the top I mean the fact that we know cartoons are not real but the movie is trying to portray what it would be like if they existed along side us in the real world, but they still have their cartoon attributes like getting hurt and not dying.

I find that this movie was enjoyable and is watchable for adults and kids. The storyline was decent. The actors were good at knowing where to look and how to react to the cartoon characters, which makes you forget that they aren't real. I liked that they include most of the classic WB characters. It would have been nice if they included some of the newer ones like Babs and Buster Bunny or even the Warner brothers and sister: Yacko, Wacko and Dot.

This movie kind of reminded me of Who Frame Roger Rabbit, which is my favorite cartoon and human mash-up movie and I watched many times as a kid.
