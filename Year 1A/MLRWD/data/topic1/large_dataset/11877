What made "Poseidon" so compelling was following a small band of characters in their struggle to survive a major disaster.  This fiery follow up is overlong and pales in comparison--not only thrusting five times as many characters at us (does anyone really care if OJ Simpson saves a kitty cat?), so we don't care about them...it's just one flailing rag doll plunging to a pitiful death after another!  There are also countless "Poseidon" rip offs throughout, proving that it doesn't always work the second time around.  You'd think screenwriter Silliphant would have done more than just change some character names!  (Robert Wagner "ran the 100 yard dash" much the same way Shelley Winters held a swimming record...  Fred Astaire channels Jack Albertson with the addition of a bad toupee...  Susan Flannery is dressed like Stella Stevens and suffers the same fate.  Sheila (Mrs. Irwin) Allen turns up with a bigger role this time plus gets to survive!  Carol Lynley must not have wanted to reprise her role as the willowy pop singer who croons the Oscar-winning best song, so Maureen McGovern dyed her hair blonde.  There's Bobby Brady being even more obnoxious than Eric Shea's "Robin."  It goes on and on.  The DVD offers no exciting special features, although the picture quality of the film is excellent as are the action sequences directed by Allen.
