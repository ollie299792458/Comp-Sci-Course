I found 'Spider Baby' to be creepy yet funny little movie. Writer/director Jack Hill deserves mucho kudos for assembling a marvelous cast and putting together an absorbing little movie on what appears to be a very tight budget. The two young sisters in the film were both adorable and outstanding. And the sight of a very young Sid Haig bopping in and out of scenes were priceless. How this guy was overlooked at Oscar time is beyond me. The cinematographer, Alfred Taylor did a wonderful job 'spooking' up the mansion and the sets were incredible.
And also it was great to see the terrific Lon Chaney Jr. in his best work since the 'Wolfman'. His performance was poignant and nearly brought tears to my eyes at the tragic ending. As i mentioned at the begining, all the supporting roles were filled with skill and nuance. I would recommend this film to anyone who shares my love of B 'Horror' films. And the included documentary on the making of the film was alsoquite enjoyable. Add that to the 84 minutes of genius preceding it and you've got some great entertainment for a rainy Saturday afternoon. I highly recommend 'Spider Baby.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RPCJ9I">Spider Baby (Director's cut)</a>
