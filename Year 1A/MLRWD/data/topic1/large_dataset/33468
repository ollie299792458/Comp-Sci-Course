I saw this when it came out, remember it vividly and loved it.  I'm about to order a copy.  But except two of the songs, I disliked the music very much, hence the missing star.  I thought the title song's lyric was Cahn's best creation in a career of mediocrity written usually with Styne and for Sinatra.  I think Van Heusen wrote this tune.  The other exception of course is Gerswin's "Do It Again" which believe it or not actually IS written up-tempo, despite Garland's sexy tear-jerker version (which I love).  Bea Lillie.  Coward called her the funniest woman in the world.  And I've heard a couple of her own remarks and they were hysterical.  But aside from these, I have never felt like laughing at one single thing she ever did or said, not TMM, High Spirits, Inside USA or An Evening With -.  I can imagine her singing Porter's "I'm A Little Cuck-coo", and it's legend that Rodgers had to buy back his own song ("My Heart Stood Still" I think it was) and quickly find a show for it to keep her from singing it!  Anyway I loved TMM and agree with everything good said about it - from fragile Mary Tyler Moore to hysterically funny Julie Andrews to tempermental elevator to a plot that is briming with imagination and white slavery.
