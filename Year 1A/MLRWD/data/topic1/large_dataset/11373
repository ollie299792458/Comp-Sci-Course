Jessie (played by Sissy Spacek in one of her finest performances that, it seems, was overlooked) has it planned.

She appears to be long past bargaining with her mother, but the night starts young, as it is said.  What will happen when the evening ends?

Jessie wants some answers.  They will not change her plan.  But she wants answers.

Jessie learns some things that seem to please her even though she finds out she was deceivd, but she does now know as much truth as she ever will.

For Jessie Cates is going to kill herself.  Tonight.  She has no plans to leave the house again alive.  Thus the title, "'night, Mother."

Her upbeat mood not at all unlike some people who, once they have decided to kill themselves, feel almost liberated.

It has some dark humor.  Jessie brags about how easy it was to get ammo when Dawson, her brother, found out she had and interest in guns.

Will Jessie really kill herself?  Her husband is gone (divorced or just gone), her son is a criminal (or will be), and Jessie is sick and sick of being sick.  She can end the sickness, too.  But we all have problems.

Jessie's main problem is what she feels is a lack of control.  With the pull of the trigger she can have total control.  Jessie tells her mother:

"And I can't do anything either, about my life, to change it, make it better, make me feel better about it.  Like it better, make it work.  But I can stop it.  Shut it down, turn it off like the radio when there's nothing on I want to listen to."

Buy it or rent it.  Don't miss it for 20 years as I did.

You might want to forget the movie, but once seen, you'll not forget it.
