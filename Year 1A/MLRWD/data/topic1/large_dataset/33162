The Cars were such an amazing band for their time. Their ability to split the difference between what was "new wave" and "rock & roll" at that time remains unmatched. What's more, you can hear their influence live on 25 years later in bands like Franz Ferdinand and The Strokes.

However, they were one of the worst live acts ever to step on a stage. Cardboard cut-outs of the band members would have more life than they ever did. In fact, the only Cars concert that had any life to it was the now-infamous "New Cars" tour when Todd Rundgren was behind the steering wheel. That rendition of the band actually talked. They actually moved. They actually smiled. Above all, they performed with the sense of FUN that their music always had.

Colbert and others can poke fun at the New Cars all they want; until this band can display as much humanity as musicianship, they will remain a band that is best enjoyed in the car or at a party. It will be interesting to see if Slick Ric has developed any stage presence in all these years.

Eager for the new release.

In the meantime, this is the Cars live, which means it's pretty lifeless.
