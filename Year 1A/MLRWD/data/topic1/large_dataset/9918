The quiet unassuming opening of this film quickly and inexorably turns into a nightmare. A 40-ish executive, recently widowed, is nagged by his son, friends and business partner to get on with his life and begin dating again. Because he is involved with film production, a colleague suggests he hold an audition, whereby he may meet a match among the candidates. The ensuing audition is by nature a cruel but funny affair. One jewel does sparkle in our protagonist's eye, and the old adage "be careful what you wish for" here applies tenfold. What the viewer has been watching soon becomes something very different, hallucinatory, violent and pretty damn scary. If you watch this alone late at night, you may have trouble sleeping afterwards. And even if you see this with a crowd in broad daylight ... Beware! Stay with the slow beginning, the subtext for the characters is set up here, and repeated viewings will bear this out. Make no mistake, this is a horror film. It is also a rewarding and frightening experience, well acted and directed.
