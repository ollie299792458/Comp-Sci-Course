Out of Sight is not Elmore Leonard's best book, but it is definitely the best movie based on one of his works.  The movie, which mixes comedy, romance, and action, relaunched Steven Soderbergh's career.

The movie features a twisty, Pulp Fiction-esque narrative that showcases sudden, intense scenes of violence with some extremely funny dialogue.  The story centers on Jack Foley--a career bank robber--who escapes from prison and runs into an attractive, smart Federal Marshal named Karen Sisco.  Sisco must hunt down Foley, while fending off romantic feelings for him.  Foley, meanwhile, tries to pull off one last retirement heist.

The story is pretty smart and is very surprising in the directions it goes.  The cast is truly great--featuring one fine performance after another (George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Albert Brooks, Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, Luis Guzman, Dennis Farina, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, and Nancy Allen).  I highly recommend this movie.

The DVD has some interesting features including an informative and entertaining audio commentary from Soderbergh and writer Scott Frank.  The deleted scenes are more interesting than your usual run-of-the-mill deleted scenes.  There is even an alternate version of one pivotal scene shot in one take.  There is also a theatrical trailer--but not the good one I remember from theaters but some alternative version.
