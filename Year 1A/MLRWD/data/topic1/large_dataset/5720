Steve McQueen is the last movie star in the same league with film's greatest leading men like Gable, Wayne, Newman, Cooper, Flynn, and the other faces of Hollywood's Golden Age.  We didn't know it at the time, but looking backward, actors never became any more charismatic, magnetic, or iconic than McQueen.  Between McQueen and the rest of Hollywood royalty, most of today's top actors are accounted for.  Penn is doing a poor imitation of Dean.  Gosling is trying to be McQueen.  Clooney is Cooper.  Cruise is Gable.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  Kierkegaard is right.  We only understand things looking backward.  McQueen was the end of a generation of originals.  Now, we have only copies and copies of copies.  I guess that's okay if you don't look backward, or you think that Hollywood should be all about $$$ and nothing else.  But it's good to be reminded that once, for a few moments, Hollywood reached a little higher and achieved something very fine, and this film does that beautifully.
