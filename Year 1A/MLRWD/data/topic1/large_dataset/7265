This is the most effectivley powerful film I have ever seen. Spectacular in every way. The general plot of the film has impact, the FX are unique beyond anything witnessed in the film industry.

The Story is all about global cataclysm climate disaster, or mother nature returning the favour of sucking her dry of natrual resources - indeed. The start of the film throws us straight in  the deep end, news reports of indians walking in a winter wonderland, the collapsing antartic and basically terrible weather everywhere. The general humanising (making it as if real people are in it - what we would do in other words) is extrememly acurate, even for the americans, bless them. The Day After Tommorow generally sums up our way of life, humans. We only seem to care about ourselves and fellow humans, if there is a super disaster then WE have to survive, as long as WE have fuel WE are fine, the American president (actually the vice presiident for some reason) is bush and Clinton rolled into one, denying the coming storm, "Our economey is just as fragile as the enviroment", which is dead short sited - BUSH IF YOUR READING THIS, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT - - GIT.
