Quite simply one of the most elegant works in cinematic history.  Ang Lee has proven himself to be one of the most versatile and sensitive directors in modern cinema.  The treatment of the story is subtle and heartbreaking-- you feel so deeply for these characters, who all move through life in a dazed state of isolation, unaware of how damaging this calculated lack of connection can be.  All these characters
share in common a fear of vulnerability that robs them of the fulfillment of their most basic human needs-- the love and companionship of others.  
In this way, the themes are similar to "Happiness"-- but the storytelling in "The Ice Storm" deals more with disconnectedness and less with shame and self loathing, so it is much easier to watch ("Happiness" is a movie I think most people only see once).  Every character in this film is a perfect whole, while not all even likable (particularly Sigourney Weaver's character, Janey), their imperfections breathe life into each portrait.  The ensemble cast is riveting.
There are definite elements that may upset some-- such as the open presentation of childhood sexuality.  Be prepared to be painfully reminded of your own tentative and awkward first steps toward adulthood, or what most kids think of as adulthood-- i.e.
sexual relations.  "The Ice Storm" deals with this with sensitivity and dignity, which is a refreshing change from the sexualization of children so prevalent in the media, which has the distasteful undertones of serving up innocents for the consumption of adults.  The kids in this movie are learning about themselves within the realm of other kids, the way we all experienced it.
This is simply one of the best films I've ever seen.
