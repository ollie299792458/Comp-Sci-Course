Okay, I'm behind the times.  I'm just now catching "Iron Monkey" and feel pretty much like a Johnny-Come-Lately.  I never really cared much for martial arts films but was amazed by Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon".  I read a few things about "Iron Monkey" after it was released due to "Crouching Tiger's" success but never got around to seeing it or buying a copy of the dvd.  Recently, however, I found the movie at a pre-owned cd/dvd store and purchased it.  I'm glad I did because it ranks right up there with "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon".  Yuen Woo-ping's chinese take on Robin Hood is done with great style, incredible fight choreography and filled with charming actors and actresses.  Yu Rong-gang plays the Iron Monkey and Dr. Yang, a humble doctor that basically practices the same tactics as the Iron Monkey---helping the poor who are sick for free and charging the rich for his help.  The rest of the cast is filled with interesting characters such as Dr. Yang's helper and romantic interest, Miss Orchid, and Wong Fei-hung, a young boy who's fighting skills are as remarkable as many adult men.  The fight scenes in this film are a pleasure to the eye and well worth the purchase of the dvd alone.  If you are a martial arts fan, you will NO DOUBT want this movie in your collection.  If you are not a fan, I dare you not to enjoy it!
