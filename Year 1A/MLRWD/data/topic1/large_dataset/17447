I love bad movies and have been a fan of them for many years. To this day I try to keep up with what is currently considered the apex of anti-style. I just can't understand the recent elevation of "The Room" to a bad-movie status virtually equal to Troll 2.

Troll 2 is the funniest and greatest bad movie ever made. The costumes, performances, script and special effects are consistently hilarious. The Room, on the other hand, has a few things that induce a smile but it is only marginally worse or funnier than a hundred other small budget vanity projects just like it. There are no cheesy costumes or special effects or musical numbers to laugh at. It is really just an empty display of amateurism, more a sad waste of time and money than it is funny.

To me, a movie has to have some sort of budget and an attempt at professionalism to be truly, transcendently bad. It has to try and gloriously fail at everything. Vanity projects like The Room fail in a way that is boring because they are too self absorbed; professional or semi-professional projects like Troll 2 or Battlefield Earth or Can't Stop the Music or even Gigli fail in a funny way because they are trying hard to entertain us, they are just too incompetent to do so.

Give me the crazy costumes, the outrageous special effects, the nonsensical plots, the big stars making fools of themselves, the mad scientist directors and the failed attempts at humor over the self-glorifying soft-porn antics of the clueless rich-guy Tommy Wiseau types of the world any day. Make mine Troll 2!
