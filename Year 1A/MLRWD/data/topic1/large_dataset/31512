The film "Crook's Tour" of this double disk set is kind of corn ball. It is like an old dog who lies on the couch with you and is not too smelly. Even so, it is so compelling I can't stop watching the films. I actually like the "Crook's Tour" film better at the moment. It features a couple of Proto-English Twits whose lives seem to revolve around cricket. It is a travelogue of Iraq, pre-Saddam and pre-modernized. It does have references to oil pipelines even back in those days when stealing middle eastern oil was a fact not hidden, more of a right of the western oil companies.
One of the English twits seems to keep getting distracted by scantily clad spy-dancing girls, but the other completely sexless sports fan is always there to save him.
I also enjoyed "The Lady Vanishes". Just perfect too.
As a really dedicated cheapskate, I may be forced to go against my nature and buy this DVD set.
Another good thing about this Criterion Double Set is the commentary by film experts who fill in some of the blanks and generally make the whole experience richer.
