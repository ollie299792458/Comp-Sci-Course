The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a one of a kind anime. It has a little bit of everything in it. From action to romance to fan service to intellectual discussions on the meaning of life. The anime is fantastic, but now to the product itself. It says it is the complete collection, which is true as long as we are talking about season one. Season two and all of its exploits are left out of this collection, but you can buy that for about the same price. It comes with fourteen episodes, approximately 350 minutes. It is in Japanese audio with english subtitles, English 5.1 audio, and English 2.0 audio (Not sure what the difference is) It contains four discs, two clamped on each side of the case. It has the televised commercial and textless opening and endings, among other things. The box art is fantastic and really captures the cartoony and humorous feel of the whole show. This is a great product, a bit misleading with the "complete collection" claim but still good. If you liked Haruhi Suzumiya, or like just about any type of anime (romance, pschycological, comedy, slice of life, ect.) you should at least check it out.
