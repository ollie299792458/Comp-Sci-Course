I can understand why Paramount is doing this. FOX has been doing the same thing for a while, Lost In Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to name a couple. I think the $26.00 Amazon wants for this box set is very reasonable. The only thing a boycott is going to achieve is Paramount not putting them out at all. People think the studio just slaps these shows together and since they are old it should be dirt cheap. The studios have stopped investing time and money into the restoration of these shows (Gunsmoke is fifty years old as it is) when they find there is not a market for them. How does that old saying go? Cutting off your nose to spite your face? I'm still waiting for FOX to put out season 2 of St Elsewhere!
I, too would prefer full seasons at the current average prices of shows from this era of around $40.00, but a lot of people would balk at paying that much for a show this old. The studio probably feels $26.00 is within the budget of it's target market of baby boomers old enough to remember this program.
Paramount is one of the only studios left that are restoring these old gems for a new generation to enjoy. Anyone who doubts that, should take a good look at what they have done with the Mission Impossible or Hawaii 5-0 season box sets. They look and sound better than shows half their age. If you don't like the packaging send a letter or e-mail to Paramount's dvd division and express your views. Besides if you keep an eye out right here at Amazon you'll find great deals if you can wait for them.
