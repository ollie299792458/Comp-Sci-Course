I've been really surprised in reading the 26 previous reviews that almost nothing has been said about what seemed to me the central theme in this movie - the repression of male love, which in the end triumphs.  You can call it "male bonding" if you want (as one reviewer did), but frankly, "male bonding" doesn't involved jealousy to the point of attempted murder, a rather large and dramatic incident in the film which nobody who wrote reviews seems to have noticed.  At the end of plot, intense jealousy is replaced by the mutual love which the two survivors had for the third - and apparently now for each other- and which is no doubt encouraged by the lack of options for them, a fact which gay men who have grown up in rural areas before the internet will instantly recognize.  I would not hesitate to call this a "gay genre film" - it's all over the plot and the emotional development of the characters.  If you ignore it, you're missing a major part of the film.  The lack of overt sexual content simply points to the fact that while being "observed" by an (initially) unknown outsider, the two farmers in the kitchen are restrained from acting naturally - as one sees when their customary meeting for coffee one morning lasts all of a minute and is abruptly terminated by the presence of the "scientific observer" (Folke).  Of course, as with any real piece of art, this film has many other aspects  - the general repression of one's humanity by a narrowly scientific approach to life, the issues surrounding the tension between Norwegians and Swedes, etc. It also has a certain deadpan humor, although I can't imagine why people would be rolling in the aisles.  But in the end, it's essentially a movie about men who fall in love, even if the circumstances don't allow sex on screen.  Perhaps the message was a little too subtle for some.  It's a good film. Watch it again,  and get it.
