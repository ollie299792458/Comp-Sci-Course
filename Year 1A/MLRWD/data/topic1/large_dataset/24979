When watching this movie I was not at all surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie as it offers so much to the audience, to name a few aspects of this movie that I enjoyed very much would have to be action,suspense,a very well written story,drama, character development, and much more. This movie is set in Alaska and this certainly adds to the challenge of staying alive, we even get a really good look at how this environment affects each character. (No I don't just mean the shivering or a red nose) What I mean is that the weather slowly but surely wears each and every character down, even to the point where one character dies due to the weather. You (the audience) begin to get a feel for just how scared and desperate each character  becomes as their hope for survival begins to dwindle down to nothing.

This story follows 6 oil pipeline workers and a skilled hunter who was hired by the pipeline to protect the workers from the wolves that attempt to attack the workers. While the workers are returning home their plane crashes and they are forced to cooperate in order to survive. However the challenge of survival becomes even more difficult when they quickly realize that a local pack of wolves begins to hunt them one by one and they are forced to fight for their lives. Can the survivors band together,put aside any past differences and make it out alive? Or will they all just perish in the snow?

I have to limit exactly what I tell you in this review without spoiling the movie for you, however, I will say that ending  may seem a TINY bit unsatisfying but due to the direction the film was taken, you can see its necessity.
