This movie, although starring three incredible actors, left me very bewildered.  Grief is a harrowing experience.  Grief of the loss of a child is not only mentally challenging, but beyond comprehension until it happens to you.  Having not had a child, but experiencing death (both my mom and dad), the course of action this movie takes to ignore and treat death as a stranger left me not only cold, but wondering if healing will ever take place.  It seems to at the end of the movie.  But it left me wanting to go in that car with Jake and to find out if he really did survive it.  I wanted to see more from Dustin and Susan and how this all panned out the next day.  I almost crave a sequel just to be totally satisfied.  Then again, this movie does give us all hope.  It actually helped a little with the grief of the loss of my parents because I, too, feel like it really isn't over.  Maybe that is the human condition on grief, to be left a little cold and bewildered.  If so, then this movie succeeded.  But as a human being, I want grief to just end.  As in my life and in this movie, maybe the end is never near when it comes to grieving.  Is it what keeps us humble?  God knows.
