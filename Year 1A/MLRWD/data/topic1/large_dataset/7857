Werner Herzog warned the studio that he wouldn't make another movie on penguins.  He didn't keep quite his promise.  He actually did film some of them, concentrating on one individual that went totally berserk, heading for the mountains instead of the ocean full of fish, to a certain death...  Following Herzog this penguin had enough of the biting cold, the frozen wind, the endless day and the endless night.  You see this is undoubtedly a typical Herzog movie, where this time no imagination at all was required to create his fantasy world.  Herzog didn't had to invent Fitzcarraldo.  He just had to go out with his camera and interview the people he came across : linguists growing tomatoes in a world without languages, philosophers driving heavy machinery, scientists watching science fiction doomsday pictures, investigators playing rock music in the middle of nowhere, a glaciologist putting poetry into the movement of the Antarctic ice mass, a marine biologist pondering about the horrors of the undersea world...  In a nutshell : great people living great dreams !  And also the soundtrack is great, partly performed by seals making "Pink Floyd music".
