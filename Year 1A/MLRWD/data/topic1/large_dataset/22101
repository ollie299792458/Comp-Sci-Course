I suppose that James Dean pretty much defines the modern meaning of the term 'outsider'. He is cool, distant and removed from the everday trivialities of middle class austerity. His attidute is a reaction against hypocrisy and puritan drivel. It isn't a violent reaction. It is a kind of carelessness, a cavalier attitude, something that says you have no power against it... except to be yourself.

This is what Dean was. He was himself. That's what this movie is about. It not so much about being a rebel or not fitting in. It is a James Dean movie. Everything about his movie center itself and revolves around Dean, his mannerisms, what he says, what he does and what he doesn't.

There is a lot of dichotomy in this movie. He gets the girl but not without social disapproval. He gets challenged to a race off, but the other guy dies. He seems calm enough, but there is a rage from deep within. In the end, the only answer for Dean's character is to resign not only to the fate of events, but that he has to live with himself, for better or for worse.
