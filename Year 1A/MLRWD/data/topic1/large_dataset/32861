I'll admit it, I got into "Failure To Launch" and gave it 4 stars. This on the other hand is a new low for all involved, which basically means it's barrel scraps. It's labeled as a romantic comedy, yet their were no real romantic moments, and the majority of the comedy comes from two minor gay cooks. Sure, there are other redeemable elements, but they're few and far between. It's National Treasure at sea, except less exiting, less humorous, and more juvenile (Wow, that's pretty bad). First the bad elements.

With the exception of a few Kate Hudson (although I would've preferred another Sarah Jessica Parker outing) and the general rough jerk-persona of Matthew McConaughey, the acting is bad to pathetic. The villains being the worst offenders, with not even that Cosby kid showing one bit of prose. Ray Winstone is bad as always, along with the main villain, Bunny, and his white hired gun. And poor old Donald Sutherland gives possibly the WORST performance of the movie, and/or his career. Matt's sidekick doesn't add to anything either. The story is unoriginal, and obviously little to no thought went into this treasure tale, so I won't dwell on the plot. The action is also mostly uninteresting.

Good elements? Well, Donald Sutherland's screen daughter does well as a stupid and ditsy Paris Hilton like character. There is some good humor involved, again mostly coming from two minor gay guys, and a few of Hudson's comments.

Amazingly, it could've been much worse, but not by much. Being from the director of "Hitch," you'd expect something a bit more quality, but this movie has more holes than Hugh Hefner's water bed. This movie all but fails in what it set out to do, and I wouldn't even recommend this for renting. There's plenty of better date movies out there, so just say "NO!" to this movie, and move along. Not much to see here.

Real Score: 1.5
