This DVD is packed with just enough extras.  As it comes on two discs, it also does a nice separation so that you don't have to flip back and forth between the two...  
On disk one, you have the typical movie in the usual formats with the director commentary.  On disk two, the extras are all available.  This DVD does more than talk about the "Behind the Scenes" or the "Making of..." filler that is always interesting, but seems to just to be the requisite extras.  The DVD contains a lot about the real John Nash -- from conversations with him discussing his theories to the real Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony. I particularly liked the discussion around the musical score and the discussion about how to communicate to the audience how John's disease was felt from his own mind to the perception of those who were around him.
As a movie, you probably already know that this won 4 Academy Awards -- so if you are a mainstream viewer, you will probably love it.  If you are not, you will still be impressed by the incredible acting of Russell Crowe.  The DVD I definitely give 5 stars.  The movie -- 4.5
