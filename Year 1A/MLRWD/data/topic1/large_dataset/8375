As a former religious Jane Fonda's New workout user I was in search of something more modern than those out of style 80s type workouts, so after much deliberation and reading literally all of the reviews for various workouts I decided to try this one out.  I have NEVER seen my body rid itself of fat so quickly!  After using this DVD just two times I could already see a change in my body.  Not only that but the mixture of sculpting & aerobics & cardio is absolutely amazing (so far I've been teaming up workout #1 from this dvd with workout #1 or #2 from Shape: Bikini Body Camp REDEFINING workout DVD for a complete 1 hr workout).  With my background of praticing martial arts usually ~2hr sessions three times a week and light aerobics inbetween I still found these workouts to be very challenging but not to the point of completely depleting your energy.  After working out I feel re-energized and ready to continue on studying/working!  I definitely recommend this workout to anybody even if you have knee/ankle problems so long as you know your body's limits & adjust accordingly (there is always one instructor who shows modifications to decrease impact on your joints!!)  Happy workout-ing! :)
