I doubt very much if very many people have not heard of this movie. If you haven't, welcome back from the Moon and boy are you in for a treat! One of the greatest Date Flicks of all time, this movie is MANDATORY SEEING as a couple, especially DVD with surround, the lights low, the scented candles on, and plenty of Kleenex! Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play roles you have never seen before, as does Whoopi Goldberg. The range of emotions displayed are breathtaking, and many scenes will make you have tears in your eyes.
Yes, it is a moving story, one that will make you cheer and will make you cry, but in the end, it will leave something behind in you. The story is original, fast paced and well crafted. You not will not get lost in this movie, and the timing is perfect. 
This is the movie that re-made the Righteous Brothers "Unchained Melody" hit for them a second time. This song is perfect for this movie, and delivers the added puch to the scene it is in.
If you have not seen this move - SEE IT! If you have a DVD, this is mandatory for any collection. Is this for children? It is in my opinion too intense for under 14. This is a modern love story, and should be seen with the one you love or intend to.
In DVD Format, the soundtrack surrounds you and adds something that you can't get from network TV - and un-interrupted. It is a vital part of this movie
A "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
