This is how the world ends... not with a bang but with a whimper. This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. As I watched, I was consumed by an overpowering feeling of hopelessness. The fact that you are going to die, is one you start dealing with since early adulthood. But the certainty that all your loved ones will die, and that the generations to come will not be, and that there is nothing you can do, brung me more that one to tears. Having read the book and knowing what was coming, I had to stop the movie to prepare for some scenes. Maybe it's the fact that I have a young daughter, but the "cinematic" reality of death has never hit home so close. I have never seen such a tender scene as the one in which Holmes dies with his family, in tranquility and in love. In the end, this is how I hope to go.
I recommend this movie without reservations. It deviates from the book in some aspects, but that is to be expected, and aside from the ending conveys the feeling that Shute created. The only "but" is that they gave it a "happy" ending, affecting the consistency of the Dwight Towers' character. Other than that, this is a must see.
