I can vividly remember the teaser trailer for this film during the summer of '91. It was a basic shot of the alien egg cracking open and a narrative that said: " In 1979 we discovered in space, no one can hear you scream, in 1992 we will discover on earth everyone can hear you scream" Obviously the course of the movies plot never ended up on earth and what we did get was a plot set on a prison planet and Ripley crash lands there. All of the events of Aliens and the relationships established by Ripley, Hicks and Newt where all vanished because of the nature this movie was made and changed hands up until production. The making of the movie is much more better then the finished product. That's not to say Alien 3 is a total turd. It has some good moments, but that is all I am at liberty to say. Included is the original '92 theatrical cut as well as a producer's cut made at the time of the Anthology DVD release back in 2003. PQ & AQ are just as good as the previous 2 films and all the nice extra's to go with it. In the end Alien 3 was a let down of sorts, but for a true Alien fan, Alien 3 deserves a place on your shelf.
