Schinlder's List is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Set in war-torn Poland, this movie is a dark story about an unlikely hero.  Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) began a business, employing Jews who were headed for certain death in the concentration camps during World War II.  Schindler belongs to the Nazi party and starts off thinking of only the money he can make using Jewish people to make pots and pans for the German military.  By the end of the war, Schindler, the the help of his Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley), he saves 1100 Jews from death in concentration camps.  He spent every dime he made to employ Jews at a munitions factory, which was a cover for the safe-haven he was truly offering.

To me, the part of the movie that really drove the message home was the little girl in the red coat.  So many times, when movies about the Holocaust are presented, all we as the audience see are masses of faceless, nameless people.  One little girl in red coat, which was the only color in the entire film, struck out at me, challenging "Do you see me? I am an individual."  This one little scared girl, running to hide, put all the horror and tragedy into perspective.

This movie gives us a brief, powerful glimpse of the struggles of European Jews during World War II and the heroism of one man that risked his life to save so many others.
