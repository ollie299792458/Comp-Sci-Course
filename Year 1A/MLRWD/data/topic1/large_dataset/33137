I have read the book as well as seen the movie, and unlike others who have commented about disliking the differences between the two, I rather enjoyed the changes that were made to the story to bring it to life as a film. Although I am very fond of the book, I think that the story would be too plodding to make a film out of if you stuck too faithfully to the story or included ALL of the "important lines". I was saddened to see the '96 adaptation and see how certain lines were 'dumbed down' to make them more understandable to a modern audience. The casting is impeccable and Mia Wasikowska in particular blew me away. Her face is so changeable that even though there may be less dialogue in this adaptation than others before it, you can actually see the thoughts behind her expression and the deliverance of her lines is full of feeling. Some people complain that she is too pretty to play Jane, but I think she was actually perfect because she has a quiet bare faced serenity that at first glance seems plain, but her whit, her voice, and the way she carries herself in the movie really bring to life the beauty that Rochster begins to see in her. She is quite like the Mona Lisa in that she looks like she has a secret world behind her eyes. I think that the acting of all of the cast and the dialogue make the story more real and gets to the heart of the story more effectively than others have. I also loved the "lost on the moors" scene and feel that it is much more expressive of Jane's agony of having to tear herself away from Rochester than her just running down a lane and hitching a ride in a passing carriage. The lighting used is just the same as people would really have had back them, candlight, firelight, sunlight. It really added to the authenticity of the film for me in addition to the wonderful costumes. Lastly the score is gorgeous and really reinforces the scenes to the fullest! If you enjoy love stories, this beautifully shot movie is for you!
