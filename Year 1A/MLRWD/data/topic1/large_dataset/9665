This movie is a favorite of mine.  The story is a simple, yet moving one and the scenery is breathtaking--a natural side-effect of its gorgeous setting, the Bitteroot Mountains in Montana.

The characters are tender and their lives are real and delicate.  The themes concern the nature of faith (both in God and in the people you love) and the helplessness of watching those you love self-destruct; they are conveyed with patience and generousity of spirit.  The director respects the individality and privacy of his subjects.

I usually refrain from commenting on other reviews here, but I would like to state that this film is, in no way, "clueless..." or vapid.  It acknowledges some sad truths about human beings and their frailties...frailties born of love.  There is no perfect faith and no perfect human being and it is often hardest for us to help the ones closest to us.  Sometimes no amount of pulling on the proverbial "boot straps" is going to change the outcome. Life would be nice if it were that simple...sometimes it isn't--It's even happened to conservatives on occasion.

The film is a visual joy; and a heart-string tugger.  You'll be glad you invested in it.
