I bought a copy of the DVD from Amazon a couple of months ago...and I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it since. I am a child of the 70's and all themes and settings in the movie are a part of my childhood.  I remember playing outside on the sidewalk in Harlem and just being kids.  This movie makes me cry everytime it ends!  When I have nothing to watch on TV I pop it in the DVD player and pour a glass of wine and just think back.  This movie shows the strength and fortitude of two people trying to work themselves up in life in spite of the financial hardships that they face.  I don't think Rupert ran out on his children.  I firmly believe that those relationships just did not work out for him.  Same as Claudine.  Granted there were nine children between them but all in all they were two people who happened to find themselves later on in life after they had already acquired so much baggage.  The hookers and rodent infested apartments were what many families who lived in the tenements back in those days had to contend with.  Overall Rupert was a hard working honest man.  Claudine just wanted a good life for her children and that showed in how she went to work while she was collecting welfare.  The soundtrack is amazing.  I just downloaded it and I listen to it over and over again.  'Be Invisible' is my favorite tune, the music and lyrics are so true to life.  Soundtrack and movie are fabulous.  This story does have a happy ending and that's what makes it all come together in the end.
