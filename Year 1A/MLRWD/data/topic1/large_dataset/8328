I would compare this movie to that one, though Saints will always be slightly better since it is a cult classic.  This movie is full of twists, suspense, witty banter, clever clues, and an outstanding cast.  Each character is absolutely wonderful!  Esp. Josh Hartnett and Lucy Lui.  I have always loved Lucy but this is a completely new role for her as a spunky, 'smart' ditzy neighbor.  She makes this movie.  On the other hand, I never really cared for Josh.  He was cute but never really had great roles or anything that moved me.  In this movie, he was outstanding. I have a new respect for him as an actor.

Take a chance on this movie and rent it, even if you don't buy it.  Unless you are horrified by violence, I think you'll really be surprised by how good this movie is and how wrong the credics were when they gave it mediocre praise.

Also, please ignore the review that called this movie "banging!". I think he is an adolescent boy with too much free time.  His review was insulting to this movie.
