Let me start by saying i've seen this movie several times and think this movie has held up very well considering its 42 years old. After reading these other reviews i felt i should throw in my opinions on this movie. I cannot compare Rosalind Russell to ethel merman because i never saw the play. As far as im concerned Rosalind Russell was perfectly cast and this was her second best performance because after she was AMAZING in Auntie Mame. Theres so much trivia about this movie that most dont know so let me fill u in. Rosalind Russell was battling breast cancer while shooting this film and still went to work and did her job like a true professional. Her singing voice was partly dubbed meaning part of the songs she sang and parts were dubbed.In real life Natalie Wood had a horrible stage mother type so in every movie Natalie is saddled with a similar type of mother so thats partly why Natalie and Rosalind play so good off each other. Baby June in real life is Morgan Brittany from Dallas who in the movie was using her real namof Susanne Cupito.The older June is Ann Jillian so it seems this movie has tons of actors who were unknown in 1962.Even Harvey Korman had a bit part photographing Gypsy.Some other reviewer said they couldnt wait for the number"You gotta have a Gimmick" to end and i think the number is great and very entertaining. Watching Natalie Wood get ready in her dressing room full of art deco surroundings is so interesting to see her transform herself from a plain but pretty girl to a beautiful and sexy curvy woman. The real gypsy rose lee didnt take her clothes off either. Natalie Wood was yung and beautiful whereas the real gypsy was not pretty but she was unique and stripped with class.Natalie and Roz have great scenes toward the end of the movie and Natalie doesnt miss a note telling her mother off and to let her go and get her own life.In the end they remain as close if not closer than they have ever been because all their hard work paid off and she finally made a big success out of her daughter and gypsy proved to be 1 one person who didnt abandon rose. Natalie in her last scene is absolutely gorgeous. I love the whole movie but the last hour is the best..Some movies start out really good than turn sour by the end but this movie is the opposite and the last hour of this movie is great and the ending is fulfilling with the exception of rose not getting herbie but shes a mother first and her personal life was to take a backseat.I recommend this movie for several reasons. The dvd version is how u need to view it because its in widescreen and u see things that were missed on pan and scan. The hollywood blonds watch gypsy nervously do her first strip number which i never saw in the other version. 1 more bit of trivia.The actor who played Tulsa was in both the original play and the movie. NOBODY LAUGHS AT ME,BECAUSE I LAUGH FIRST AT ME,ME FROM SEATTLE,ME WITH NO EDUCATION,ME WITH NO TALENT AS U KEPT REMINDING ME MY WHOLE LIFE,WELL MAMA LOOK AT ME NOW, LOOK WHERE IM GOING,IM NOT STAYING IN BURLESQUE,IM MOVING MAYBE UP MAYBE DOWN BUT WHEREVER IT IS IM HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE,BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT IS MY LIFE AND I LOVE IT,I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME..I AM GYPSY ROSE LEE AND I LOVE HER AND IF U DONT U CAN JUST CLEAR OUT NOW!!!That scene is forever memorized...
