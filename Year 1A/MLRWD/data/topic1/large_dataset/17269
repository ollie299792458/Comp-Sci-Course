Wow... I could not get over this movie after seeing it for the first time. It is incredibly inspiring and well made and... what's the word... ENLIGHTENING. Of course, after watching this movie (with Robin Williams, my favorite actor of all time), words just came out so quickly. It's kind of like getting a hypothetical "electrical shock" back into reality, and I saw it and realized, That's the way life is supposed to be lived. Seize the day. 
I was inspired enough to actually have the right words to draft a fan letter to Robin, but by the time I'd reveled enough in it, the adrenaline rush was fading. So I'll have to rent it again, and then write. 
You will love this movie. It wakes you up and jolts you back into the world. You look around and see everything in a whole new light. Enjoy the movie.
P.S. The day after I saw this movie, I had my high school orientation, and as a "get to know you" activity we were supposed to find people with specific talents, and one was "able to recite one line of poetry". All I could think of was "O Captain, my Captain", but I didn't say anything. I had a little secret of my own... :)
