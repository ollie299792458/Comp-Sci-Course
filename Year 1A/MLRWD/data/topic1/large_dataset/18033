Having read 14 of the 20 or so novels in Patrick O'Brien's series on the British navy during the Napoleonic wars, this film captures the heart of the stories, ie, the relationship between "lucky" Jack Aubrey and Dr Stephen Maturin.  I've seen the original DVD (sans blu-ray) and loved it, both for picture and sound.  But, the blu-ray version is beyond description. Intense color contrasts and crushing, almost overwhelming sound makes this one of the best adventure films you'll ever see.  While the majority of the story follows the "Far Side of the World" book, it also is interspliced with scenes that are found in earlier series books.  This doesn't interfere with the screenplay, but only enhances the opportunity to get to know the characters better.  One can only hope that another movie based on these books is being considered.  The casting is superb and contains an eye for detail that the screenwriter caught perfectly.  Hundreds of reviews by top reviewers in every major newspaper and magazine have called these books the best historical novels ever written.  This film, and especially the blu-ray enhancement, certainly does them justice.
