I must admit to being sadly dissapointed in this movie!  I had been told a lot of good things about it by people, and read a number of reviews for it before finally purchasing it.  Having watched it I must say it was not good, but not terrible.  I gave it three stars just for the good acting, and because I love a good Autralian accent.  lol  The plot is, to say the least, lack luster, and is just as muddled and pointless as the main characters life.  It was downright boring at times, and that is never good, when the viewer feels compelled to pick up the remote and fast forward.  Yikes.  While the main Character is attractive, he's on the cover of the box, that is not enough to carry the film, and his taste in men is apparently for the unattractive.  The ending is just insane, I mean maybe I've been acclimated to happy endings by U.S. films, but this ending was neither happy, sad, nor even poignant it was just ended.  I would suggest not buying this movie.  Rent it then buy it, that is the safe bet.
