The veterans who participated in this finely crafted doco are unquestionably brave and patriotic.  The unvarnished retelling of their experiences is what gives it its power.  The soldiers frankly explain why they enlisted before reflecting upon the difficulties adjusting to the consequences of actions they were not psychologically prepared for during their tours of duty. And like the famous "Winter Soldiers", who dramatically blew the whistle on the excesses of the Vietnam intervention a generation ago, are likely to be rejected as unpatriotic by many who view the film.  But what do they know?  These are real soldiers, not John Wayne or Mel Gibson togged out in jungle greens, pretending to save the free world from some dark, hideous specter.  Only those who serve can really appreciate the full horror of war - these are their stories.  This documentary forces the viewer to reflect upon the seriousness of committing young men and women to the occupation of killing people they are, through their training, conditioned to hate.
