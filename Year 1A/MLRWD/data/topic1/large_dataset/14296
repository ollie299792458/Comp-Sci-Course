Okay, there are about to be a bunch of spoilers, so be warned.... A horror flick about a bunch of teenagers driving up to a cabin in the woods to party is just about as cliche as it gets. But if you can stomache a little gore, Cabin Fever is quite entertaining and has so much to offer. There were so many moments that seem to have made an indelible impression on my brain. There was the matter of a german shephard, not at all central to the plot, but it would appear at random and kill people. And while this was happening, it always appeared to be just playing with them. There was the 20something deputy who rides around on a bicycle and is obsessed with finding people to party with. The local rednecks, who flip out and decide to kill our teenage protagonists after a virus is transmitted to one of their kin. I mean, it seemed like an excessive reaction, but maybe thats just me. There was so much about this movie that did not make sense that in the end it is really quite beautiful. Its difficult to fathom how this movie only averaged only 3 stars. I found it truly memorable.
