Im not going to say they dont make movies like this anymore.

Maybe they do. But Dragonheart is a rare breed. With a lot of what I look for in a movie worth owning for a lifetime. The hero is flawed, less than perfect, having to abandon his lifetime of beliefs. The villian the song of the king who acquires the crown by defualt, is a rlentless ruler far wrse than his father. This creates a kingdom where the people are held captive,slaves to the king to build his fortress. When you watch this movie, it seems more in line with Willow or Lady Hawke, than a 1990's movie. That never comes into play. Its not a movie to represent ny decade of fantasy film, it simply "is". The music is fantastically stirring, and helps support your love for the cast and out of the ball park performance by Sean Connery. Dennis Quaid has his regular "stock performance" which is good, but doesnt move me. Dina Meyer plays a capable and strong villager who is along for the ride.

Rovert Cohen, of fast and the furious fame directs, dont expect ANYTHING even close to The Fast and the Furious. This just shows Cohen can DIRECT, he's not bound to a genre, and I think that helps the movie overall. At its core, Dragonheart is about friendship, and a little about understanding and tolerance. I suppose it depends how deeply you want to read into it.

What amazes me is Dragonheart is not epic in a Lord of the Rings kind of way, maybe that lack over relentless depth makes it worth watching over and over again.
