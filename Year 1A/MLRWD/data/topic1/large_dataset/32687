...the studio had allowed Mr. Proyas to release THIS version (the Director's Cut) of Dark City to theaters, maybe it would have been better received. I will not do a laundry list of what has been added or removed but I will say I believe this version has more depth than the original theatrical release and, frankly, makes more sense without being obvious or losing the sense of the story unfolding for both the audience and John Murdoch at the same time. One thing I will give away is that they have removed the opening voice-over which, together with the music, makes for a tense, eerie opening atmosphere that I liked quite a lot. I also think they restored Jennifer Connelly's own voice to the scenes of her singing in the club but I can't be 100% sure. All in all, I much prefer this Director's Cut version to the theatrical release. Mr. Proyas says in the special features interview that this version represents more closely what his original vision was for the film and I think he did an excellent job. Just brilliant!
