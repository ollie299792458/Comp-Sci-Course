I love this movie. Unlike any other action movies where the movie tends to slow down so that there can be some romance scene, or something like that. You know those scenes where you get up and go to the bathroom while you wait until the action picks back up. Well... You don't get any of those breaks in this film. Because Chev needs to keep moving so that he doesn't die, the movie is always moving with action. Chev steals cars, and Police bikes while causing trouble where ever he goes (the local shopping mall, hospitals). Theres even one hilarious scene where there is a crowd of people in Chinatown where Chev does something that you just wouldn't see (ever in most peoples lives) everyday. I couldn't stop laughing threw that hole scene!

This movie was interesting to watch, it had its own original story, and it was done differently then any other movie I saw. Crank is a must need for any action movie buff like myself for his or her's collection! The only downside is... I just wished there was more special features on the DVD.
