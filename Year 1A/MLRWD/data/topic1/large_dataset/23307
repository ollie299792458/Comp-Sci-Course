Sweet Home Alabama, which stars the adorable Reese Witherspoon (Election, Legally Blonde), is a homespun delightful movie.  In my opinion, it is a welcome relief to those of us who dislike violent or depressing movies.  You actually walk out of the theater humming the song with a wide smile on your face.
Melanie played by Reese Witherspoon is a charming fashion designer who is being courted by the son of the Mayor of New York City.  Embarking for an evening out, the young couple arrive at Tiffany's where Andrew proposes to Melanie.  Trying to keep their engagement a secret, though, is hard to do and suddenly the Mayor, played by Candice Bergen, is planning a wedding for several hundred at The Plaza.  Only problem is not only isn't Melanie from a wealthy and old Southern family as she's led others to believe, but she is also still married to her childhood sweetheart Jake played by Josh Lucas (A Beautiful Mind).  Now Melanie must return to sweet home Alabama and obtain Jake's signature on the divorce papers which he has stubbornly refused to do all of these years..  What ensues is a down home Southern yarn, complete with a reenactment scene from the Civil War, which leads to sorts of revelations.
I really enjoyed this movie.  While it was refreshing and humorous, it also offered several warm and tender moments.  The cast was well chosen and included some memorable actors.  Among them was Candice Bergen, Mary Kay Place as Melanie's mother with Fred Ward as Melanie's father and Jean Smart as Jake's mother.  Adding to the enjoyment was the beautifully photographed scenery from Florida and Georgia and a first rate soundtrack which I still can hear several days later.  I do recommend you see this movie reminiscent of the great Frank Capra films of the past.  And see if you don't find life in Sweet Home Alabama truly sweet.
