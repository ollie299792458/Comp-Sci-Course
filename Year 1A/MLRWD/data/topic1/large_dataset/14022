Gee, I've had this DVD for at least 8 years and have played the heck out of this thing! What a fantastic tribute, this is for a man who inspired so many other musical artists. You can hear alot of his style in Bruce Springsteen, J D Souther and Jackson Browne songs. So many people have their own takes on a lot of his songs that some might forget he's the Original, the one and only! Kind of surprised not to see Linda Ronstadt there, some of her greatest hit's were his songs. The Video is very well produced and the audio is excellent for DVD. I guess I need to get the BD version. If you don't have it get it!

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.
