I was a fan of the first Harry Potter film (released in 2001), but thought this one was even better. For those who have'nt read the book, the film offers you a chance to really get to know the characters. The film starts off with the second year of Hogwarts ready to begin. However Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), and Ron (Rupert Grint), have some troubles getting there. Which means a great action sequence! After arriving, they re-team with Hermione (Emma Watson), and the adventures begin. 
Because the characters are a year older, the story is more intence, mysterious, and exciting then in the original. Making this a wonderful sequel. All of the main characters are back, along with some new ones! And this is a great chance to see the late Richard Harris, as Dumbledore, in his final role. I don't want to give away the end of this film, (even though most of you probably know what happens) but the finale is not to be missed! This is one of the few movies based on a book that actually follows the book! It is a little long, coming in at over 2 hours and 40 minutes. For all Harry Potter fans,this is a must have!
