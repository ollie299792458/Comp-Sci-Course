I saw this German movie almost two years ago. However, I can remember this movie clearly, because it really impressed me. It is very philosophical and also exciting movie. Moreover, it is only 80 minutes movie, but I assure you will be fluttered through the entire movie.

To sum up this movie simply, heroine Lola have to arrange a hundred thousand dollars in order to save her boy-friend Monni and she manage to arrange it. Monni had to deliver a bag with 100 thousand dollars to the boss of the gangster, but he left it to a train and a homeless man took it away. If they fail to deliver the money, he is likely to be killed by the gangster... From the beginning, as title goes, she is running and running.

The movie is made of three short scenarios. They are slightly different with each other at the beginning, but the difference become larger and larger as the scenario proceeds.  So the scenarios end up very differently at the end. The style of the movie is fresh and its basic concept is nice. Smaller changes become bigger changes. It is not so special when we see it as words, but I think you will be surprised by this concept in the movie. To people who dissatisfy with the movie of just acrobatic action and seek for philosophical implication, I recommend this movie!
