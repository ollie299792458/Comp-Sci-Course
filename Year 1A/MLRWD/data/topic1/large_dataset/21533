the Baker Boys is one of those special movies that you get more out of everytime you view it.  For anyone that plays or performs or has wanted to perform music, they will surely relate to the gritty pitfalls and problems that are endemic to the sub-culture world of the gigging musician.

In this movie, you have two brothers with an unusual act, having side to side pianos, and at a juncture in their lives when the act is already starting to stale out, add a singer, who just happens to be the impossibly beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer, singing her own parts in the movie, and she serves as a catalyst to bring about a change in all of their lives.

there are several keynotes intense dialogue scenes involving a confrontation between the brothers and between Michelle and Jeff Bridges that are some of the best ever put on celluloid.

and the clincher is the soundtrack masterminded by the great Dave Grusin, which covers many styles and moods.

Anyone who hasn't seen this one yet is in for a special treat!
