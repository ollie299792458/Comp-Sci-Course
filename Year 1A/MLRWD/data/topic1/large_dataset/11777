This film will always remain high on my list of all-time favourite movies. Having watched this film hundreds (okay, maybe just dozens) of times growing up, I am so glad to finally own the Special Edition DVD copy, far better than my now worn out VHS copy.

A League of their Own embodies every aspect of a great film - it is hilarious at times, sad and touching at others, has great characters, a great story, a fantastic soundtrack (hearing Madonna's "This Used to Be My Playground" at the end makes me tear up every time), and touches on an American past that should never be forgotten, making me nostalgic for a time in which I've never even lived. It is so much more than simply a film about baseball - it is a reminder of how important the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was, for the girls involved, and for all Americans, who had something comforting to turn to while WWII was on. And what a great cast, from the major stars to the hundreds of real baseball-playing extras. You really couldn't ask for much more of a film.

The Special Edition DVD has a few extras that any fan of the film would thoroughly enjoy, the highlights being a documentary with cast interviews, and an audio commentary featuring some cast members and director, Penny Marshall.

I can't imagine how great it must have been for those involved with the film to be able to recreate this fantastic piece of American history, but I am grateful to Penny Marshall for capturing it on film for us all to witness.
