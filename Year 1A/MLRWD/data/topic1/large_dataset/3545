Olivier is a great actor. he brings a persona to Hamlet, a depth to his character, that no one else can bring. However, the rest of the cast he seems to be just making speeches, albiet great ones. Basically this is a filmed play. Even though many may disagree, I still love the Ethan Hawke Hamlet and my favorite Ophelia is Julia Stiles(maybe she because she looks like someone I could love, and she expresses modern madness). I do love this version, but it is by no means definative, as each generation will need to express the madness that comes with the responsibilty that the other world gives to mere mortals. As Hamlet says "the plays the thing", but as we know real life intrudes into Hamlet's "madness" and it ends tragically for all concerned. All people on a true spiritual journey battling the demons created by the sins of man and woman will identify with Hamlet and hopefully will learn that it is not the "the play" that's the thing, but life itself. We can learn from all our Hamlets', and Olivier is surley one of our master teachers.
