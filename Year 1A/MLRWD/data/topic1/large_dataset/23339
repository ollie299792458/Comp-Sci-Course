My husband and I borrowed this from the library. I am so happy that we didn't actually spend money on it otherwise we would have to ask for a refund. This is the most far-fetched bible story that I've ever seen. Could it get any worse? Honestly, I can't believe that they wasted those kind of special effects on a piece of trash like this! It's offensive, and I have no idea what book of the Bible it's about because it definitely isn't accurate to the book of Exodus that I know. I'm a Christian and I don't see how any other Christian can like this movie. It's not the story of Moses, It's about a pale Pharaoh and the angry guy with the stick. It should be shown as a documentary on how NOT to do a christian film. How could this story get any worse? Next time can you please try to get REAL believers in the movie so people can actually be affected in a way that doesn't make them sick to their stomach. Unless you want to confuse every young saint in Christ or waste an evening yelling at the T.V. please save both your time and money!!!!!
