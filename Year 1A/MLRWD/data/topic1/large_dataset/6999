Filmed on the 1st September 2001, U2 Go Home is the first ever release to feature U2 playing to a home crowd in Ireland.
Following an 80 date sell-out world tour, U2 headed home for two extraordinary outdoor shows at Slane Castle in Ireland, where the band played to more than 160,000 people.
This homecoming concert will be released on DVD by Universal Island Records on November 17th.
U2 Go Home charts an emotional return for the band: in 1984 it was at Slane Castle where the band had recorded their landmark fourth album, an event which was captured in The Unforgettable Fire documentary. The documentary is released with the new DVD, re-mastered and re-graded for the first time.
The Elevation shows also marked the 20th anniversary of the band's first appearance at Slane, supporting another legendary Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, at the inaugural Slane Castle Festival.
The new DVD includes a bonus track, and DVD ROM special features include U2 calendar, screensavers and weblinks plus three songs shot on `Spincam' allowing the viewer an interactive, 360 degree view of the concert.
