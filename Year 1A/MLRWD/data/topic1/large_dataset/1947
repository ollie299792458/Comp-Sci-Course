I like the nanny and in Italy it was not possible to listen the true voice of the nanny because the movie is dubbed - so I was very interested to know the true voice - And she is so funny as well - excuse my english but I'm Italian and I live in Rome -

I would like to buy next episode but for the moment only the first season is available - I want to suggest one think to the producer of the dvd and the suggestion is to put subtitle in english because in this edition there aren't - yes there are the english subtitle for the hearing empared but not normal english subtitle very usefull for the foreigner - that's all - I was one of the fellow that two years ago wrote to the Nanny's producer to tell them to  hurry up to put on the market this wonderfull dvd and also if after two years they have listened to me at last - good bye - I'm Tony Zecchinelli from Rome - Actor's photographer - buy this dvd - it is a part of us all over the world - it was made in a historic period when every body of us where more happy - and it is helpfull to try to rich the mood again . Ciao Tony from Rome .
