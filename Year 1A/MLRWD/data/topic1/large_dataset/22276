Best-selling sci-fi author David Gordon (John Cusack) grieves the loss of his wife and finds himself in a search for more meaning. Adopting a child was something they considered before she passed but David isn't sure his heart is up to it. That all changes when he meets a unique young boy named Dennis (Bobby Coleman) who believes he is from Mars. David adopts Dennis believing that he can help cure the pain that has caused Dennis to retreat into his own alternate universe. What David doesn't anticipate is how much light Dennis will in turn bring to his world.

Martian Child is a simple movie with a powerful message about hope, love and acceptance.  While this story idea is nothing new, Cusack and Coleman bring a new level of freshness to familiar territory. Cusack always brings a strong performance and he is certainly believable in his role as a single dad. Without a doubt the star of the film is the Martian Child himself, Bobby Coleman. This is an incredible performance that will tug at your heart strings and warm your soul. Amanda Peet and Joan Cusack also lend strong supporting roles to the well-rounded cast.

My wife and I were in the initial stages of adoption when we found out we were pregnant with our little girl. Since then adoption has always been close to our hearts and something we are considering for the future. It was refreshing and encouraging to see a film about the beauty of adoption and how special it is for both the child and the adopting parents. The lessons that Dennis and David both learn throughout the film are relevant for us all. In the end we are reminded to embrace who we are and to cherish family. This film is a true gem the whole family will enjoy.
