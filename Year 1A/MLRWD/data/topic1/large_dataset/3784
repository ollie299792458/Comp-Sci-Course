With any book to movie translation, there is a chance that material will get lost or that actors involved will fail to capture the essence of particular characters. However, I am pleased to say that Bel Ami exceeded my expectations of seeing the classic novel brought to life onscreen. Although it would make for a more interesting movie experience if viewers have read the novel before-hand, the movie does an adequate job of portraying the scheming, manipulative, womanizing Duroy in his quest for money and status.

Following roles in movies such as the Twilight Saga, Water for Elephants, and the highly underappreciated Remember Me, Robert Pattinson proves once again that he can take his place among the talented actors on the screen today. His ability to make you feel sympathetic for such a roguish character are to be commended.

In addition to Pattinson's outstanding performance, the acting prowess of the women involved in this film are not to be ignored. Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and Kristen Scott Thomas do an impressive job bringing each of their characters to life as well.

Also not be ignored is the spectacular setting, brought to life by the props, costume design, and music included in the film.

I highly recommend this movie, and I think it is a shame that it has gotten so little publicity.
