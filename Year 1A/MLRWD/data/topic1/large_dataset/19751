A sweet,simple story about a lonely, shy butcher who grapples with balancing family and work.  Struggling to find confidence due to the ridicule and rejection of people who base on outward experience, Marty maintains his dignity along with his determination to forge a better path for himself.

One night at an upscale nightclub Marty meets a kindred spirit:  Clara, an intelligent, plain girl with dreams of her own.

Over many cups of coffee the two share heartfelt conversation and reveal their dreams to one another.  Still, friends and family judge.  In the end, however, true love prevails as Marty firmly resolves to explore a new world of possibility with Clara.

An uplifting gem with a timeless message.  The dialogue is superb.  And the simplicity of the story does not detract from its sheer entertainment value as Marty's mother and aunt provide archetypes of Italian culture that add just the right amount of humor to balance the more tender moments!

My only disappointment is that the DVD version cuts three to four minutes of footage as Clara spoke with her parents about her date with Marty.  It was such a lovely scene and the movie is not that lengthy to start with.  I hope they repackage this DVD and add those to create a theatrical version.  In fact, it's my dream to see a 4 disc or a last 2-double sided discs that would include the director's cut, the original theatrical version, the 1953 TV version, and a documentary/commentary about the making of the movie.

One of the best movies ever filmed!  Well-deserved Oscar for best picture and Borgnine for best actor!
