This is a true ten of a horror film!original and highly interesting, Nightbreed brings the best qualities about Clive Barker's unique visions and ideas. The story follows the saga of Aaron Boone, a guy who is hunted down by a maniac doctor (played by horror legend David Cronenberg) and finds protection within the guarded walls of a cemitery in the middle of Alberta's beautiful and cold wilderness called Midian, inhabitated by hideous creatures. But the monsters turn out to be the good guys against a beast called Human Nature, in this film based on a short story.
Terrific performances by Cronenberg as a cold, menacing and elegant doctor who turns out to be a psycho, Anne Hobby as the main guy's love interest and a supporting cast that pays hommage to horror legends Doug Bradley (Pinhead in Hellraiser, and here he plays some kind of older father figure to the creatures of Midian) and Simon Banford (Butterball in Hellraiser, here as member of the Nightbreed). Howard Shore's score is a joy to listen, very creepy indeed!the scene in which Boone is first confrontated by the Midian breed is memorable mainly due to Shore's score.
Overall, I highly recommend Nightbreed, and it should be acquired by anyone who trully loves horror films!
