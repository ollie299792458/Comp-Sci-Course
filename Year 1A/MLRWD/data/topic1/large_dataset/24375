I'm not someone who watches movies repeatedly, at least not very often.  For example, I've only seen my all-time favorite, "Donnie Darko", only twice.  However, over the six years since "Wicker Park" came out, I've watched it three times, and I've loved it every time.
Unlike some, I didn't find it at all confusing.  If anything, watching the storyline unravel the very first time made that viewing the best of the three.  And this is nowhere near as complex a storyline as "Memento", "Irreversible" (and one of the stars of that, Monica Bellucci, was in the original French version of this movie), or "Donnie Darko" for that matter (or heck, even "Pulp Fiction").
I'm not going to go into the plot.  As Roger Ebert has pointed out, it's nearly impossible to do so without giving something away--and if you haven't watched it yet, I want you to be able to enjoy it as I did the first time.
What I do want to say is that Rose Byrne's performance in this film is fantastic.  The look of pain on her face when someone reveals something to her through a dressing room door is so real that I actually felt it, as if I'd been punched in the stomach.  And despite the foreknowledge during later viewing, that visceral reaction to her acting occurred the second and third time I watched the movie as well.  During a much later scene in the film, in a restaurant, you can actually see the sickened (as in heartsick) look she gets as she realizes that she's not going to get what she most desires in the world.  Simply an amazing performance throughout the film, and I honestly can't remember ever being as affected by the performance of any actor or actress in anything else (with the possible exception of Anna Chlumsky's performance at the funeral in "My Girl", but that was just one scene, not throughout the entire movie).
