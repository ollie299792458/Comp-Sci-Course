We just saw the film yesterday and although it is technically a well-made film and the story and jokes are quite okay and nice, we were totally put off by the way nature and especially bees were presented. We think that a film for kids should also try to teach them something about the beautiful nature around them and not spawn false ideas about it that will stick forever. Other animal animation film crews took care first to learn something about the animals (movements, social activities, capacities) and then teach it to their young audience. Of course it is okay to turn a hive into a fabric, every child will see the exaggeration here. But neither are there male/female families in a hive, nor can bees fly 10 km above the ground alongside a plane with 600 km/h nor do flowers die because they are not pollinated nor will random pollen be any good for other kinds of flowers. None of these really wrong things about bees was necessary for the film, the whole story would have been as fun with the correct knowledge about bees. We're disappointed that DreamWorks didn't make the efforts to produce a more realistic film that entertains and teaches children at the same time.
