This is the first thing I want to say about the 2012 Blu-ray Release of "E.T., the Extraterrestrial:" it's back, in its original form. Yes, every frame, the terrorist gag, guns back where they need to be, the musical score in the farewell scene restored to its original grandeur, and no digital shilly-shallying. What a delight! Big thanks to Mr. Spielberg for finally recognizing the deliciously imperfect perfection of his original creation.

I've seen this film approaching 70 times, and I know where the beats are, top to bottom. I was looking for changes, and could detect not a one. Even the slight jump-cut as ET indicates the closet as "home" is restored. The original ILM animation of the bikes in flight is back. The string passage during the final embrace is right where it should always have been. All the terrible tampers have been removed.

The transfer, from original 35mm elements, is as flawless as can be. The look and feel of the theatre experience fills the eye and the ear and, as always, the heart. Welcome "home," E.T., and thanks, Universal, for a job well undone.
