There's not much to add to the laudits for this film.  Groundbreaking director in what some consider his most groundbreaking film.  The era  produced many innovative films that influenced cinema thereafter, and La Dolce Vita is primary in that regard.

More to the point of this review, this Criterion edition meets the highest of the quality standards they have almost solely set for the film DVD.  Any DVD today that doesn't have commentary and features are a rip-off for buyers, but the quality varies significantly (I dare you to sit  through Rob Reiner's commentary on "When Harry Met Sally").

Criterion truly understands the film lover, the person who wants to know as much as possible about the film, including the how and why of its elements and the who and what behind its making.  They realize that not only film students are interested in the process and people of moviemaking.  Not cheap, their editions however offer far more value than the usual DVD release.

The commentary by Richard Schickel, a true expert on film, is extremely literate and informative.  His command of his knowledge keeps the insights coming non-stop.  His purpose is to inform and to interest, and he stays right on the mark throughout.

Enough features are included to require a second disk, and I believe this edition contains more than any other Fellini film edition.  Interviews with Fellini himself as well as others involved in the production give excellent background and context to the film and to Fellini and his career.

Film buffs will appreciate the care with which this extensive set of extras has been compiled.  Criterion certainly has set the standards for film editions, and this is one of their best.
