This is a beautiful video, with breathtaking landscape and a good flow of narrative. It was also very eye-opening in terms of the theories of how human migration may have occurred in pre-historic times. I've always wondered how humans existed in Africa, Eurasia and the Americas long before ship-building could be perfected. Eurasia and Africa not so much, but the Americas just seemed too far away. I admit to never really looking this up; it was just idle wonder about how people could have accomplished more than 10,000 years ago the same kind of things that Columbus and Vasco Da Gama were considered heroes for repeating barely 600 years ago. This video was priceless to me in just being able to provide theories that address these questions better than my imagination of a bunch of enterprising pre-historic humans that built an enormous raft and just floated themselves across the Atlantic.

The video also ends on a very important contemporary note, which addressed a lot of the puzzlement I felt about the simplistic presentation throughout. This video aims to reach the widest audiences possible, and for that, a lot of emotional and personal content seems to have been included. Far more than I'm comfortable with, but understandably so. I would probably have rated it at 3 stars if not for that closing note that sort of justified the travelogue-like presentation for a supposedly scientific discovery narrative.

In summary, I would have loved for there to have been a companion edition of this DVD with much more details on the discovery process (sorely lacking here) and much less footage of pleasantries being exchanged and of Wells 'spreading the message of science'.
