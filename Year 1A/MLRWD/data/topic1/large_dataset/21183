I snapped up this item as soon as I saw it on sale!  This was, and is, the concert event of a lifetime.  There have been a few attempts to do something similar to this over the years, but none have reached the scale or success as Live Aid.

When I observed that the length was 10 hours, I knew that some compromises had to be made as to who to include, and who to ignore.  I had just graduated from high school in 1985 and remember running VHS tapes from 6 in the morning (to catch the Australia footage) to well past 10 that night...almost 17 hours' worth of footage.  I still have those tapes and can shed some light on the Zep story.

True that the Zep set is missing; true that Plant and Page refused to let it be included; also true is that it was not a quality performance by any objective measure.  Jimmy Page was obviously well-stoned by the time he got out there, and the interaction between Phil Collins and ex-Chic drummer Tony Thompson (NOT Jason Bohnam as an earlier viewer implied) was sporadic at best.

Others key moments were left out as well.  The Thompson Twins' "Hold Me Now" and "Doctor Doctor" was left off, as was Duran Duran's "View To a Kill.  However, it would have required another 2 discs to do the whole program, and the sheer amout of stuff that is there is more than worth the price of the package!

As to why it took this long to get this in some format or another, Bob Geldof opposed releasing it until now saying that the show was best left in people's memory.  I vehemently disagree!  This was well overdue, and hopefully the $ raised will be put to good use.

Unfortunately, much of the original funds from the concerts bought aid that ended up being diverted by corrupt African regimes to their own pockets.  We can only hope that won't happen this time around
