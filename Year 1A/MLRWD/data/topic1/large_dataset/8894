What's better than a movie with swords AND lasers?  
There's magic in Krull, and it's not just coming from the blind wizard!  Krull is the story of a prince whose marriage to the princess of a rival country will bring an end to their family's longstanding feud.  Their wedding, however, is interrupted by reptilian-like aliens in Cylon-like armor who fire lasers at an essentially medieval-like peasantry.  
Throughout the film, the dauntless Prince Colwyn assembles a group of brigands, mages, and even a golden-hearted cyclops to help rescue his princess and bring about a more egalitarian future for his planet.  The evil alien king--somewhat akin to Milton's Satan, but without the sour-grapes dialogue--plans to marry the princess and extend his fascistic grasp on an otherwise peace-loving aristocratically-organized political body.
The political significance of Krull cannot be overstated; however, I do not want to detract from the amazing special-effects, the comic scenes, the heart-wrenching sacrifices, or the fantastic scenery.  Additionally, the score is so dramatic, that it truly does become a character of its own.  The leitmotif of the glave is one of the boldest moments in the history of film soundtracks (it even rivals "Alexander Nevsky").  
Of course, Krull operates on different levels: one can read into the film if one likes, or one can indulge in the fantasy of it.  Either way, the film is an essential in the development of American Genre Film.  Because it is a "genre" picture, AFI neglected to put Krull on its list of the greatest movies ever.  But if we could see past the labels of "sci-fi" or "fantasy," we'd certainly recognize that Krull tells the story of our own quests to find the princess in each of us.
