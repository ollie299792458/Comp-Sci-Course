Many critics consider this film one of the great ones.  Others think it is sentimental claptrap.  I hadn't seen the film in many years, and I had to see it again to make up my own mind. 
I bought the DVD ... and looked at it just last week.  Hey, this is really a good film. The photography is excellent throughout. There are great, moody B&W shots, and certain images, such as Ingrid Bergman in soft focus, her hat slanted low over her brow, have become iconic.  Bogart drinking away his sorrows while Dooley plays "As Time Goes By" is a scene filled with dark shadows and lover's angst.  
The acting is superb.  Bogart and Bergman weren't just stars.  They can express emotion with the movement of their eyes or the gesture of a hand. They are fun to watch.
This was supposed to be just another studio film, or so the legend goes.  But it seems Michael Curtiz put more effort into this than one might expect.  It is impossible to find a false moment in this film.
The last time I saw Casablanca, many years ago, the print was scratchy and dirty.  The DVD version is bright and crisp.  I'm glad I revisted this old standard.
