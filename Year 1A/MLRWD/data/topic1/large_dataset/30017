If you've ever taken "the family truckster" cross country, you will absolutely love this movie. The cast is perfect and the story outrageous, but grounded just enough in reality to be believable.  Who  doesn't have a Cousin Eddie in the far side of the family tree? This movie  has become one of my favorites as have the sequels.  My only complaint is  this movies transfer to DVD.  I've always felt movies on DVD should at  least be available in widescreen format. "Vacation" could have  benefited from this, but the movie is strong enough that I could overlook  this omission.  What I couldn't ignore was the terrible sound quality.  The  movie is in Dolby Digital 1.0 which as I understand it is glorified  one-channel mono!  I expected at the very least STEREO.  I can't believe  this movie was released to theaters in mono, so why release the DVD in  mono?  The picture quality is better than videotape, but again not  exceptional.  Good, but not exceptional.  This film is a favorite for many  of us. If you've never seen it, by all means do so.  I only wish Warner  Brothers had done a better job on the DVD transfer. Just imagine if the  secondary audio track had included a running commentary from Chevy Chase,  Beverly D'Angelo and Harold Ramis. As it is, the DVD version of this  wonderful film is less than it could have been.
