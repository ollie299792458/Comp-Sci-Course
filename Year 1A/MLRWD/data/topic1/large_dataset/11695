PICTURE QUALITY (5/5 STARS)
UNBELIEFABLE!!! Looks like all-new!! The new transfer is so much sharper and more detailed than the previous one, I am impressed!
SOUND QUALITY (4/5 STARS)
The NEW Dolby Digital 5.1 remix is great: clearer voices and extraordinary surround effects, but without a good surround system you might overhear some dialogue which was specially isolated to a define channel. In some scenes (i.e. broadway scene) the effects are significantly louder than the music on the previous release. Although this release lacks an original mono-track in English, it features a Frensh mono track.
EXTRAS (4/5 STARS)
THE CUT BANK ROBBERY SCENE (only on the second special features disc, without an an option to view the whole film with this several minutes long scene), featurettes (with commentaries), photo galleries, traisers, teasers.
SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:
- anamorphic Widescreen
- NEW Dolby Digital 5.1 remix
- deleted bank robbery scene
COMMENT:
This is a great movie and deserves this new great treatment! Isaac Hayes is great in the role of the Duke of New York and Kurt Russel is even more superb in the role of Snake Plissken! The cut bank robbery scene is very cool (with commentary!) and the quality is typically pretty descent but introduces some new great music in these scenes that never appears again in the movie! For fans of the great Carpenter score there is another good bite: the menues feature also some new music (I figure it is specially recorded for this release). For all Plissken fans there is a little comic book included and a note for an upcoming computer game?! Let's see what is comming next... "Escape From Washington"? CHEERS
