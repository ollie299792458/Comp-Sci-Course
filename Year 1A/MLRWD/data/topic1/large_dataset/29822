This is a classic suspense movie.  You have the frail Mrs. DeWinter in constant battle against the chilly Mrs. Danvers climaxing in a haunting scene in which Danvers nearly coaxes DeWinter into sucide.  There is the  ever present, thought oftem cryptic, memory of Maxim's first wife, the  title character.  The movie has a nice flow, wonderful perfomances and  direction, and, of course, great atmosphere.  There are, however, two  flaws.  One is the screenplay, which was based religiously on the original  novel.  The problem is, there are times when it doesn't quite work because  they had to cut corners and condense scenes together usually  unconvincingly.  The diologue itself was a little trite and often sounded  written (as opposed to sounding like actual everyday conversation).  The  other problem is the fact that the movie was in black and white.  Though  this wa most likely done for money reasons, it really needed to be in  color.  In the book, Manderley was filled with bright flowers and colors in  general.  Seeing Manderley in black and white wsa a little underwhelming  based on what I excpected from the book.  However, this sin is easily  forgivable, and the screenplay can be forgivin because it still preserves  the great story, and the performances are good enough to make the script  sound better.
