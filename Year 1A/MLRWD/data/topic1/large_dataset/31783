To this day I think this is a great movie. I love the special effects. For its day this was amazing. I still pull this movie out and watch it on a Sunday afternoon. It is one of my all time favorite movies.
I think one of my favorate parts is when James Spader is walking through the Stargate for the first time and he touches, what looks like water. It ripples then with courage he closes his eyes and puts his face in. The was they did this shot and the way Spader  performed it. It made me feel like I was doing it with him. I guess someday I hope to travel a wormhole or maybe just ride a shuttle to space. Anyway I loved the ride Stargate gave me.
I am sorry I am not so critical of the movie as others. I just look at movies as an escape and adventure. There is enough problems in the world and we could use a little more adventure and love and joy the things that movies give us to ease the life we live.
GO AND ENJOY A MOVIE OF YOUR CHOISING DO NOT LET THE CRITICS TELL YOU THAT A MOVIE IS GOOD OR BAD MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND!  This is what I do and I have seen some of the best movies (what I consider) no matter what the critics say. Besides if sales are in the $700 million dollar range how can that many people be wrong. even though the critics only give it 2 stars.
I hope this helps. Go out and live life watch a favorite movie with someone you love.
