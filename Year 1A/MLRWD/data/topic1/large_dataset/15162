If you see one super hero movie you pretty much see them all.  They become, they see danger, they fight, they conquer.  Anyone going to see this type of movie should know what to expect. I am not that much a fan of this
type of genre but there are some I like, some I don't.  This one I did like.  It had good special effects that were done well, although not an abundance of them, and there were enough surprise jump scenes that might satisfy the "scare me" crowd.  The suspense and figure me out scenes kept me interested but it would have been nice to have a little more interwoven into story. Putting Cage in black hair was a bit of shock for me at first but once I stopped dwelling on the weave and color change I got into his character and did not notice it after that.
What I liked about Ghost Rider was that it was pretty OK for the entire family of 12 years on up.  Some of the "demons" may be too scary for younger kids.  Over all it was better on the big screen (of course) but enjoyable entertainment over all.  I have seen far worse movies this year and many better, but you can get OSCAR material out every movie, can you?
