Although I have almost always only reviewed books on Amazon, I had to write my feelings on "Rocky Balboa". As someone who counts the original Rocky as one of my favorite films of all time, I had to see this movie, which I did last night to a Sold Out audience. Most of the people in the theatre were guys around my age. As soon as the previews ended and the movie started, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause. Who would have thought that a fictional underdog from South Philly from the late 70s would carry such a following for all of these years.

I thought that Rocky Balboa was excellent - not because the boxing scenes were great, or because every scene was a treat, or because the acting was the best I've ever seen, although Stallone did a great job I thought. But the film was very inspirational and reminds us that no matter who we are, we can achieve our dreams. Rocky reminds us that it does not matter how hard life hits, so long as we get up and keep going forward. Rocky did so in life and inspired me to keep on going forward in my life with this excellent film. Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky . . . . . . .
