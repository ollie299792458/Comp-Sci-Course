With appealing performances,a haunting soundtrack by French band Air and excellent direction from Sofia Coppola, ''The Virgin Suicides'' stands as one of of the best films of 2000!Why it was left out at the Oscars is beyond me!
The story centres around the tragic breakdown of 4 sisters after the 5th [Cecilia] shockingly commits suicide [All seen through the eyes of the neighbourhood boys].After nights in hospital, A psychiatrist informs the parents, Mr &amp; Mrs Lisbon [Kathleen Turner &amp; James Woods] that Cecilia needs more interaction with the opposite sex so the Lisbon family through their first and only party inviting the neighbourhood boys.After being ignored, Cecilia attempts again and meets her demise, to the shock of her family.All the neighbours,family and friends have their own theories which they keep to themselves.One sister in paticular Lux [played with smoldering sex appeal by Kirsten Dunst] takes this news unpredictably and hides away sorrows, loses her virginity and starts smoking.The only real guy that got to know her was Trip Fontaine [Josh Hartnett]. After a night of passion with Trip, Lux walks home alone much to the disapproval of her uptight parents when the house turns into a maximum security ward.After all the hassle of the ordeals, the girls give in to the pressure and they all take their own lives....
The first time I saw this film I felt that it had an unsatisfactory conclusion but after multiple viewings, I thought the ending made perfect sense.Kirsten Dunst is well on her way to super stardome, this being one of her finer performances.Kathleen Turner &amp; James Woods are both on top form as usual yet nothing can be said about Josh Hartnett.His character is made just to stand and look pretty.
Apart from minor flaws, this movie can ONLY be described as EXCELLENT,BEAUTIFUL,TOUCHING,HAUNTING,MAGNIFICENT!!!A True Masterpiece of film making!!
