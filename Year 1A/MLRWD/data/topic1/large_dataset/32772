Sadly the reviews for this movie on amazon skew high because people seem to be able to review the classic versions of this movie on this remakes page.

Regardless, and speaking of the Peter Sellers version, I very much enjoy this film on a level that people might not expect.  Like most good comedians Peter Sellers was a great (and underrated) actor.  His work in this film playing two characters shows his prowess and makes the "look-a-like" scenario believable.  The only, and major problem with the film as a whole is that the filmmakers do not seem to  know if they want this to be an adventure movie or a "pink panther" comedy.  Thus, in one scene where the "fake" king is playing croquet with the fiancee' princess...there is flirting going on, but the background music makes one think the greatest comedy sketch is about to happen.  The "assassination attempt" that does seems to have some edited=-added "inspector Cleuseo" stuff with the assassin flying up in the air with a Sellers-like "whooooaaaaaah" to make moviegoers comfortable.  The sad thing is that I believe Sellers wanted to make a more straightforward film, with humor (like The Three...and Four Musketeers) but the makers wanted Pink Panther.

Alas, we have this gem and can watch and enjoy it and wonder what might have been.
