If I had to make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, this one would top the list.  Not too far into it, I started to wonder when this thing would be over.  I started to just turn the thing off, but I'd paid $3.50 to rent this thing and decided to try to tough it out.  
Plus I found a couple of parts of it highly offensive.  Right after they start dating, one of his co-workers makes a comment that maybe she's Bipolar.  I know someone who's Bipolar, and apparently the writers have no idea how something like that can totally ruin a person's life.  Also, further into the movie, when she goes to meet his parents, he jokes about part of the family being "mental cases", and that they "all have Tourettes".  People who have Tourettes who would have seen this movie must have been so thrilled by that comment.  
Apparently the writers decided at that point that they had no other group of people to offend, so they offend us all by making a dull, boring, predictable movie that was a complete waste of time.  Near the end I actually felt embarrassed for the actors for having to do this film.
Don't waste your time seeing this one.
