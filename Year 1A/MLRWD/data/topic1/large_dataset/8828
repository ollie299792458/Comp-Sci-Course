Briefly said - "Unforgiven" looks like a western, where two cowboys cut the face of a whore; whores seeking revenge, spread the rumor that they would pay a thousand dollar prize to any killer who would kill "them" cowboys; some killers could not make it and were repelled by the sheriff; but eventually killers killed those cowboys, the sheriff and his deputies. And the last man standing was of course William Munny, the killer, played by Clint Eastwood.
This is the description of the events, but "Unforgiven" is not about the events, it's not really a western either. This movie is about people, struggling to live some life and being always unforgiven for that. All of them had lost directions in their lives, all of them understand good and evil at some intuitive level of their own.
The movie does not depict honorable women, tough good fellows, witty winners, slick riders. Tough Little Bill is brutally tough, witty English bob lost miserably, and William Munny can hardly climb the horse.
This movie is a drama and only the final shoot out reminds about a western, but even this shoot out is depicted to be humanly slow, hesitant and dangerous. The final glance of William Munny is of course the famous glance of Clint Eastwood and yet again with the shadow of alcoholic agitation.
"Unforgiven" is a true masterpiece.
At the end the idea of the movie is that people have to be resolute. When the common moral grounds are low the resoluteness becomes the honor, and the voyeurism of by-standers like the writer, who "never had a gun", becomes the utterly disgusting, ignoble.
