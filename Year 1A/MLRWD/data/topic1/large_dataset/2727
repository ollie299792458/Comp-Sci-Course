Gandhi is one of the best movies that I have seen so far. The movie Gandhi begins with the leader Mahatma Gandhi who was a leader against non-violence and also against the British during the 20th Century. Gandhi had challenges for he was seen as being a colored man and he then began to start a resistance for non-violence in South Africa and wanted to have rights for all those who were Indian living there. Gandhi was humiliated and beaten many times however; this did not stop him until Indians were granted their rights within South Africa. Gandhi then leaves South Africa after the Indians was granted their rights back in South Africa. Once Gandhi returned home to India he was known as a hero. Gandhi at that point was not done he still was against the British. Gandhi then rounds up Indian Muslims to come help him resist against the British and when they went against the British many of them died. Gandhi then went back to jail, subsequently, jail would not stop Gandhi again from standing up for what he believed which was non-violence for all. Gandhi got ill when he sacrificed eating but it paid off in the end with the British gave freedom and independence was granted from Britain to India. Unfortunately, Gandhi died in 1948 when he was rebelled against for his cause of wanting peace.  This movie is very powerful and showed that with dedication, faith, and belief if you stand by what you believe in anything is possible. This movie also teaches us non-violence and compassion to have peace with one another.
Gandhi relates to the World Religions because he was able to unify the Hindus and Muslims of India to come together. He also describes a valuable line, "I am Muslim, Hindu, Christian, and also a Jew," This simplifies that we all are one and that we all love our God in our own way and religion. Gandhi lead by example that world peace is possible with all religions. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
