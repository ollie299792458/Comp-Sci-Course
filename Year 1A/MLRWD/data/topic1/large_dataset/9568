Highlander... There can be only one. Watching through the whole season 6 dvd collection, fans of the show are given an ending to a show that we've followed for many years.  This dvd collection offers 13 episodes and extras including never-before-seen footage of deleted and alternate scenes as well as recently discovered footage.  In AVATAR, the sword fighting is back again with more action from Duncan.  In ARMAGEDDON, the final battle is well-deserved and the photo gallery captures the moments.  In SINS OF THE FATHER, Dara Tomanovich adds to the story of danger and a promise to fulfill.  In DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, writer James Thorpe once again provides a plot of flashbacks and wishful thinking.  In PATIENT NUMBER 7, Kyra gives Duncan a run for his time and I love the way she interacts with him.  In BLACK TOWER, the story weakens and is one of my least liked episodes.  In UNUSUAL SUSPECTS, JUSTICE, DEADLY EXPOSURE, and TWO OF HEARTS, the stories are too predictable, but the fightings are still good.  For INDISCRETION, the scripts on the CD-ROM will give you a better understand of the whole episode if you got lost in it as I did.  In TO BE, Adrian Paul gives one of his best performances in the final series.  As for NOT TO BE, it seemed too brief of an episode to give what the fans really needed as an end to all.  Overall, I suggest you to watch all the featurettes and listen to the audio commentaries.  Afterall, this is the best collection set that the Highlander series had to offer.
