Viewed as stand-alone episodes, Fringe might fall into the CSI/horror genre with exploding bodies, viral outbreaks, etc. However, its creators chose to develop Fringe as an episodic storyline about the ultimate reality of our universe. They do have a couple of ground rules: First there are no aliens working behind the scenes, and second there is no fantasy, magical events or people with super-powers. All events are grounded in science - although it sometimes becomes a bit far-fetched.

One of the problems with viewing the episodes weekly is that it's easy to miss the numerous and subtle interconnecting plot threads. This where the DVD set becomes useful: in freeze framing key plot events and scanning backwards to earlier revealing dialog. The series is basically a mystery that is being solved by the heroine Olivia (Anna Torv) which has complex elements throughout. For example, The Observer character, which appears in a few episodes, actually makes fleeting appearances in every episode that are difficult to detect. These appearances are well-documented on the Internet at [...] and also

Perhaps Fringe's best attributes are it's quality special effects that aren't overly-reliant on CGI and the character development. George Lucas (who was in film school at USC during the same years that I was studied engineering there) remarked that special effects are not enough to sustain a film - you need memorable characters that the audience can invest in. Fringe does well in this regard with quality actors and engaging dialog for their ensemble cast - especially for the characters of Olivia and Walter. Season 1 does very well in presenting Fringe's overall premise, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JVWRD6">Fringe: The Complete Second Season</a> sustaining the momentum.
