I almost watched this movie to its entirety when I finally just could not take being bored further. I was even fast-forwarding through the last 20 minutes in case anything interesting happened. Nothing did.

Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking how awful this movie is. The entire movie is quite literally: sword fight, mumble some half-baked philosophies on life slowly and deliberately, repeat. I just can't stop thinking about how every aspect of this movie disappointed me. Even the sword fights are stupid and pointless. Every opponent of Izo seems to come from the school of "hold up my weapon over my head so that Izo can slash me apart" fighting. As if it wasn't easy enough already, Izo can't die, and isn't affected by what would be fatal wounds to anyone else. After the first few fights, one wonders what is the point? What makes it even more disappointing is that a lot of his opponents are really cool looking. At least they could have fair fights that would actually be entertaining.

The endless philosophical rantings between each fight become increasingly agitating as well. I think what they were actually saying could be thought-provoking if I actually cared, but I didn't because I could only think about how stupid this movie is. It was like watching a pretentious art film blabbing about the human condition, except that it was TWO HOURS LONG.

To sum it up, I was shocked to find that the place where I thought (hoped) the movie would be ending was still less than half-way through. The pointless fight scenes, the deliberateness of everything in between, and the endless cycle of repetition just destroys anything that's remotely likeable about the movie, and somehow what could be an intelligent movie with lots of fighting turns into the most boring movie ever.
