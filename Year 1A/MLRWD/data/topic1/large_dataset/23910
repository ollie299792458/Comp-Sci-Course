Here it is. Your classic Anti Hollywood/reality TV show picture crowned with only a few of Hollywood's most AA lister's, newcomers and foreign child actors. Director Clint Eastwood has set into motion a raving Pro Con discussion about the acclaimed "success-failure" of his new movie "The Hereafter". Moviegoers will be surprised to be sitting out the 2 h 9min movie with mostly waiting on some action after the Grand Opening of a natural disaster scene.
Forcing the viewer to be intuitive rather then judgmental is the fact that half of the movie is being subtitled in English, while a French couple tries to mend their relationship after it had been traumatically shaken up on their vacation in Asia.
The 3 storylines that are running beautifully parallel to each other, subtle suggest that they will find their path to each other. Paris, London, San Francisco.
Matt Damon's character beautifully portrays a medium that due to his "curse", being able to talk to the dead, is unable to lead a real life or have any romantic relationship unless leaving his gift untouched, while at the other end of the world a young English boy is mourning the sudden death of his little twin brother.
No Mercy for reality TV lovers: If you are looking out for flat foul action you guaranteed to miss the subtle signs pointing gently to a suggested Higher Power that maybe after all might lead us humans together and connect all spirit. Whether you like the movie or not--It cant be denied that certain Life scenario's have in some form or another been present in your Life leaving the question open: "Can this after all be just coincidence?"
Eastwood and Damon's character won't give you the answer: You have to give it to yourself.
It's the beauty of this movie that it suggests a truth that might miraculously web through everyone's real life. If you only want to see what you want to see you will not even get a glimpse of the intention of this movie.
