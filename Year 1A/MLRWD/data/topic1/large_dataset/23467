The Scorpion King was not what I had expected. After what I saw in the Mummy 2 and the music video for "I Stand Alone," by Godsmack, I expected the Rock to go through some sort of magical transformation. I also expected to see him being helped by the army of Set, which was depicted in the Mummy 2. I am guessing that the Scorpion King is the prequal to the film where this actually happens. I am guessing that this up and coming movie will be better, so if you are planning on seeng it you might want to at least rent the Scorpion King when it comes out on video.
The Scorpion King does have some redeeming qualities, though. There were some good fight scenes. The Rock (surprisingly) did a good job of acting (some of the other reviews say otherwise, but I disagree. After all, this role was practically custom-made for him, so how could he screw it up?). The costumes and environments were well thought out and well made. The story itself loosely follows ancient pre-historical events, which has stirred up a lot of interrest in these areas where there was little before.
Also worth noting is that Arnold S. was criticized for his acting in the film Conan the Barbarian, only to move on to a very fruitful acting career. The Rock will probably do the same.
