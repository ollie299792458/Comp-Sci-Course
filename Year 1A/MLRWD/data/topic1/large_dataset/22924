Absolutely do not buy "Police Story" marketed by "New Media / CineVu International" There are NO extras on their DVD - The one and only choice is "PLAY".  But the worse thing about their release is the video quality - I think it would actually have been better if they had copied it with a hand held camera in a theater. Video quality is fuzzy and so shaky it may make you dizzy. It looks like a hand held camera was used to copy a VCR tape while watching on a year 1960 TV while sitting on a couch in their living room. The second worse thing is that both the English and Chinese subtitles are displayed at the same time  - AND the subtitles are very often unreadable. The fact that Maggie Cheung is one of the players is the only reason I haven't thrown my copy away. This review is for the "New Media" DVD release only. Hopefully other distributors have better releases of "Police Story".

Note: "New Media" logo is displayed on front of DVD box lower right corner. DVD box shows picture of Jackie Chan gritting his teeth while straining to hold onto a rope.
