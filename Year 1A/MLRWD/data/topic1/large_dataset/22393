While many of the reviews of this DVD are critical of the obvious missing bands and the missing depth of connections between Punk and Rap for example, showing the Beastie Boys but not really noting they started as a punk band gets the purists going. And one of the things that Henry Rollins so aptly pointed out is that the narrow mindedness of punk kept many of the bands from exploring musically.

What really shined through was the punk attitude. Not the aggression and fashion that so many think of as punk, but the anger at the system, the willingness to rebel and using voice and music to do it. In a time and in an economy when people need to be angry enough to fight back at a broken system, the message is worth repeating and it is worth getting angry and fighting for change, that is the underlying message of this movie which should be obvious by the title.

If you are a fan of punk or just want to understand the the thinking of real and radical attempts to create change with nothing more than the tools at hand this is a great documentary. And, you may just walk away thinking to yourself that maybe its time to create a little change yourself.

Excellent film, great to watch as Video On Demand but as far as I'm concerned a must have for your serious music library collection. I only give it four stars because it left out a lot of history and left a lot of dots unconnected.
