I wanted to see this because it was about music, but after I saw it I wished I hadn't. Nick and Norah are the uber-cool high society wise-cracking casual detectives who are the lead characters of Dashiell Hammett's "The Thin Man", but the title characters of this film have only a sliver of their coolness. The Nick of this film is a loser who obsesses about the girl (a vain skank, as it turns out) who broke up with him, Norah is part of that girl's social group at school. Nick and Norah are into music, and Nick meets Norah after his band plays a gig and Norah is in the audience. They are nice to each other, they are not nie to each other, then they realise that they are in love, ho hum. There is a drunk friend to look after, and there is a quest to find an indie band "Where's Fluffy" that likes to tease its fans with "secret gigs". Woo hoo. Pale and immature.  The director who ask that his audience suspend their disbelief that hip kids would be rabid about a band called "Where's Fluffy" really expects too much.
