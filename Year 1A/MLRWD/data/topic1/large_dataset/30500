I just received my copy of "The Final Countdown" in the mail today.  Popped it into the DVD player and all I can say is "WOW!" The film really looks neat, crisp, and clear.  It's also great to see this movie in widescreen for the first time in memory.  Can't wait to buy a large widescreen plasma TV to watch it on someday!  The audio is something else.  While watching a scene with the characters in the combat center, I thought I heard voices of someone down the hall in my house.  Had to put the movie on pause to realize that it was the surround chatter from the movie!
Anyways, Blue Underground really did a bang-up job of restoring the movie and transferring it to video.  I'm throwing my old VHS copy of this movie in the trash today.  Great job, Blue Underground!
On a more somber note, I learned of the recent passing of Ron O'Neal, who played the ship's XO, Lt. Cmdr. Thurman.  He was such a good actor and his best role (aside from the one he had in this movie) was the Cuban commander in "Red Dawn."  Rest in peace, Ron.
