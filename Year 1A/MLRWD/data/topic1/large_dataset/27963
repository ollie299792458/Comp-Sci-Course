It took me about a week to decide which tapes to purchase.  I did a lot of reasearch and am very happy with this set.  I bought these tapes and have used them for the past 2 weeks.  WOW!  The video's are 30 minutes each.  But within those 30 minutes, you get a great workout.  Simple moves, but boy do they make you sweat!  I feel the muscles working during the workout and feel energized after.  I even have that "good hurt" feeling the following day.  You know you have worked those muscles, but didn't injure them.  I am starting to see small changes, but that is because I haven't been as consistent as I should be with the videos.  Some reviewers had said that the instructors can be annoying.  It's all in how you look at it.  Yes, they can be redundant at times, but that's what I need to make sure I don't lose proper form.  I would definitely suggest using a workout mat, especially if you do not have carpet on your floors.  Other than that, stay consistent and you will begin to feel great and notice changes.  And, of course, smart food choices and exercise go hand in hand.  Drink lots of water, too!
