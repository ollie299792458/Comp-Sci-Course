Dogtown and Z-Boys was one of the best documentaries I've seen in a very long time.  The side of skateboarding it shows is not meant to wow audiences used to the likes of Tony Hawk and other modern skaters.  These guys weren't amazing because they could get huge air on a halfpipe or ollie over a ledge.  They were amazing because they basically created skateboarding, as well as the culture and additudes associated with it.  The idea that something is not an important first because someone "would have done it first" or isn't an inspiration for later extreme sports because they "would have been created anyway" is one of the most illogical and nonsensical claims one could make.  The fact is, these guys infuenced underground culture in a MAJOR way, and this extremely well made documentary demonstrates this fact with style, humor, and an excellent sense of what constitutes an interesting and original documentary.  I would recommmend it to anyone, especially if they are interested in skateboarding.
