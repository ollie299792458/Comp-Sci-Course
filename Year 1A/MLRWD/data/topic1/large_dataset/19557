When I heard that they were releasing a comedy about the wemon's baseball league in the 1940's I instantly wanted to see it. Along with most of my family I went to the drive-in (a normal family outing) and watched this  movie enjoying every brillant moment. 
The story is about two sisters,  Dottie &amp; Kit Hinsen (Geena Davis &amp; Lori Petty) who play softball in  a league for their small Oregen town. When a baseball scout (John Lovitz)  spots Dottie in a softball game he decides to pick her to go to the  tryouts. When Dottie refuses &amp; Kit explodes at the offer he makes a  deal if Dottie goes Kit can too. After begging her sister to go the two get  on the train to go to Chicago. 
Both girls are picked for the Rockford  Peaches who's manager is a former home run king who's career spireled  downward because of drinking. Some of the sister's teammates include Doris  (Rosie O'Donnell), Mae (Madonna) called All the Way Mae by her teammates, a  former Miss Georgia, &amp; Betty (called Betty Spaghetti). 
The final  scene has had some arguing over the past few years but you have to find out  what happened for yourself. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5  was because it's on TV so annoyingly much.
