If you've ever wondered what a children's movie directed by Martin Scorsese would be like, wonder no more. Based on a children's book, "Hugo" maintains much of the simplicity one would expect. The cinematography and art design is amazing. Whether or not the Paris scenery was real or generated, it was beautiful to behold. It's a good family movie; however, even evaluated at that level, it could've used a little more feeling. Despite Hugo being an orphan, it was difficult to sympathize a whole lot with him. Maybe it was because Hugo was so self-sufficient even at a rather young age. Hugo is a very likeable character and the actor did a great job, but somehow I didn't feel emotionally connected to him. In general, the acting was rather good. It was amusing to see Sacha Baron Cohen playing a role which was less outrageous than his typical characters.

The part of the movie which is geared more toward adult audiences is the homage to Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the great filmmaker. It was wonderful to see Scorsese bring elements of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's old movies to life. Watching some of the behind-the-scenes features included on the blu-ray, it was interesting to discover how much fact there is behind the movie. M&eacute;li&egrave;s really did end up forgotten and poor running a toy shop in a train station in Paris before someone re-discovered him by chance.

In general I would recommend "Hugo" as a nice family film, despite its emotional shortcomings. Although the plot is largely predictable, the tale of redemption of Hugo and M&eacute;li&egrave;s is still entertaining. It shows how versatile a director Scorsese is, since one couldn't get much different from "Goodfellas" or "The Departed".
