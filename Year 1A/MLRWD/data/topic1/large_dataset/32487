I saw this movie origionaly on a VHS rental from Blockbuster back when people still did that.  When the DVD came out with Widescreen and 5.1 about 10 years ago...I snatched it up.  I just watched it again recently and I still love it.  I love the great dark voice over and I realy like the dark deep heavy base Guitar soundtrack as it fits the movie perfectly.  Bruce pretty much kicks butt and does a great job updating a classic Yojimbo/Fistfull of $s story to a action packed mob shoot 'em up.  Also, unlike what the Amazon reviewer said there is humor as well, but like the whole movie its dark and dry.  When Bruce talks to the "skirt" about what a sweet guy he is or when he tells Doyle's men he doesn't understand why nobody likes him because he's "such a nice guy" made me laugh outloud, as did when Walken says he isn't Doyle's best man only the best lookn'.  The complaints about what happens to the guys getting shot being knocked back probably have never shot a 1911 handgun.  Ask any weapons expert what happens when you get shot with a big slow fat bullet like a .45 ACP and he'll tell you that it will knock you off of your feet.  Thinner faster bullets tend to go right through you, but a .45 shot from a 1911 has the right mass to velocity ratio to stop in the body and thereby transfering all its momentum into the victim knocking them off their feet and onto their back.  Now I agree it is exagerated in the movie, but heck it is a movie after all.  The only complaint is that this DVD is now showing its age and needs to be updated soon and hopfully to Blu Ray with some decent special features, because there aren't any on this one.
