I loved all of the Dibdin/Zen books.  Somehow in the Zen series Dibdin managed to catch the atmosphere peculiar to each book's location so I looked forward to watching.  What a disappointment!!!  At times, the dialogue was incomprehensible, the settings in many cases did not jibe with the story location  . . . and the plot lines were almost impossible to follow.  No doubt the budget for these productions was huge, but budget alone does not make a good film. No wonder the BBC cancelled. Maybe British accents with no gestures or facial expressions just don't mesh with stories taking place in Italy.

For a really good Italian mystery series go to the Montalbano of Camilleri DVDs. Each one is in heavily gestured Italian punctuated with incredible facial expressions.  The sub-titles are easy to read and follow the Italian pretty closely, except for the @#$% words which are delightfully numerous and easy to understand. . . .and who can get enough of the landscapes of Sicily?

Montalbano is fun.  Zen is work.
