Sordid Lives is the tale of a family's journey to acceptance of one another.  The death of "Grandma Peggy" serves as the catalyst to bring the family together in a series of hysterical encounters showing many of the stereotypical Southern family "traditions".  Big hair, cigarettes, gossip, and lots of food play intrigual parts in the film, and as anyone who was born and raised here in the South will testify, that these items are prevelant.

Leslie Jordan steals the show as crossdressing, institution-bound "Brother Boy".  His portrayal of Tammy Wynette is over the top and his therapy sessions are outrageously hysterical.  The soundtrack is filled with Wynette's songs and original music performed by Olivia Newton John, who portrays a convict turned country lounge singer in the film.  And, Delta Burke provides plenty of melodramatic comedy as the spurned wife of "Grandma Peggy's" lover.

Overall, Sordid Lives will keep you in stitches and thanking your stars that your family is relatively "normal".
