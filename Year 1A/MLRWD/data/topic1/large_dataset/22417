Lawrence isn't the best movie ever made, but that really isn't a fault of its own.  To be honest, the storyline line is limited and relies on the sheer magnitisim of the protagonist (Peter O'Toole, as Lawrence).  This  does not imply that Mr. O'Toole fails, for he is believably captivating as  the desert hero Lawrence, and more than once transports the viewer to not  only a different time and place, but a different mentality of valor and  glory.  However, any lags in the storyline, are more than compensated and  overshadowed by the brillant cinematography of the film.  This is by far,  the greatest shot film of all time!  Forget about the others, they are no  comparison.  In widescreen formate, the viewer is transported to a gorgeous  Arabia, full of scintillating scenes that look almost too good to be real.  The power of the film, lies within the viewer.  I did not know much of  Lawrence before viewing this film, but immediately after, I sought out to  read his "Seven Pillars of Wisdom."  Lawrence, really isn't  simply a film, but an experience.  If you have but an inkling of adventure  in your heart, this movie will never leave you.  If on the other hand, you  are a little more jaded, then the cinematography should at least please the  gallery.  It may not be the best film ever, but it may be the most  beautifull, and the one the stirs the heart toward far away things.  No  matter your connection, you can't go wrong with the small guy from England.
