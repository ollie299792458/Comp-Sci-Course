We've all heard and seen films that portray Christians (especially from the South) as villans, fools, bigots, and zealots.  At last, from legendary actory Robert Duvall, comes a film that is so riveting and poignant and  full of love that it is, quite simply, astonishing.  Duvall's Apostle E.F.  is no saintly, sinless caricature.  He is a man who has heard God from an  early age, but is subject to the same vices that plague the rest of us.  His struggle with and utter dependence on the Lord will move you. His  dedication to rebuilding an old church in Bayou country into a multi-racial  love fest is sheer poetry.  His fire in preaching the love and forgiveness  of Christ, when we know he needs it every bit as much as we do, leaves an  indelible mark on us.  Even prison does not lift Apostle's need to preach.  I've rarely seen a film that is so personal, so touching, and so real.  A  must-see for Christians and non-Christians.  Forget Good Will Hunting and  LA Confidential.  The Apostle is a real movie, and uplifting experience.  Enjoy!!
