This movie was recommended to me from a buddy and I went in thinking "zombies on a plane??" only to find out this was actually made BEFORE Snakes on a Plane so I shrugged it off and watched the movie. It's great! It starts somewhat slow but after about 26 minutes or so the virus is released from its container and all hell breaks loose. Once the action starts it doesn't stop, for the next hour is blood, guts and guns. What I really liked was the fact that Richard Tyson (Buddy Rivell from the 80's teen flock 3 O' Clock High) is in it in a starring role. The CGI like what some other people said, is kinda bad in some areas, the plane looks pretty fake but it's not THAT bad I guess. The zombies themselves are amazingly well done for being a low budget direct to DVD movie, the makeup is outstanding. Some of the blood splatter looks kinda fake but it's not that big of a deal.

As far as the gun issue, the guys with guns were TSA Agents and a federal marshall transporting a prisoner, so it's believable. What's not believable are the fact that their shooting inside the plane and none of the bullets do damage to the interior of the plane, no windows shot out or anything, so it's kinda off in that aspect. Overall though I HIGHLY recommend this movie as a great popcorn flick to watch with your friends, rent it before you buy it though, some people might not like this, while I think most would like it.
