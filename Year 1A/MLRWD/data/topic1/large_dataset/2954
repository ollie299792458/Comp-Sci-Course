Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis Jr - absolute perfection in the role! It really grabs you, and does not let go. Joe Mantegna does an excellent job as portraying Dean Martin as well. Ray Liotta does as good of a job as any one could have as Frank Sinatra. And he deserves credit for having the courage to even take on the role! It isn't a stellar performance on Ray Liotta's part, but when you bring Liotta, Cheadle and Mantegna together - you forget all about Liotta's shortcomings. And honestly, no one could have pulled off Frank, other than.. Frank. (Nothing near the catastrophe of Jennifer Love Hewitt as Audrey Hepburn!) I enjoyed the movie very much! Especially the performances in Vegas! I laughed so hard tears were rolling down my cheeks. It is too bad it was only 2 hours, these actors together could have pulled off a riveting series. I took away a star due to Barbara Niven's performance as Marilyn Monroe. Where she did catch Marilyn's dark and cynical side, she had none of Marilyn's softness or sensuality - to a distraction. Luckily she has a very small role in this film. Had her part been any larger, I might not have finished watching the film. Which would have been a huge discredit to the amazing performances of the other actors.
