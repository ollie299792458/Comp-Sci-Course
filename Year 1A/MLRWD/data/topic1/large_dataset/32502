Richard Curtis is just splendid when it comes to light-hearted comedy (especially romantic comedy). This movie personifies that. It is upbeat and very easy to get into.

Hugh Grant does his whole mumbling routine (which you either love or you hate - I happen to dig it) and the supporting cast is simply brilliant. Andie McDowell's place in this movie is something of a mystery. I don't know if her casting was genius or just grabbing any American actress who had name recognition. Her character should come off as, well, a bit of a whore but Andie couldn't play such a role if her life depended on it. She's just too nice. I think her playing the role may have saved it, though. Any other actress may have come off much less likable in the end.

One of the only negative things I can say about this movie, and Richard Curtis, is that the gay people aren't written well. The gays are gay in name only, they just come of as flamboyant asexuals. Granted the movie is 12+ years old, but still...

I am not a fan of romantic comedies at all (save for "French Kiss," this movie and "Love Actually") so I was very pleasantly surprised with this flick.
