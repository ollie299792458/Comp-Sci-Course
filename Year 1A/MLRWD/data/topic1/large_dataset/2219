I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. When I first saw the trailer I thought it looked interesting, but apparently no one else did. After seeing the positive reviews and hearing from friends that it actually was a very funny movie, I decided to pick it up on BRD (my first BRD btw). While the story isn't particularly original and a bit predictable, it walks the line between having a heart and over-the-top-and-frequently-crude humor perhaps better than any movie since the original American Pie (the fact that Sean William Scott is in this movie is just coincidence). And this is a comedy after all; people are expecting feel good laughs--not crazy plot twists.

I think most people know about the main characters, who do an excellent job, as well as the plotline, so it's worth mentioning that the auxilary characters are hilarious, especially Jane Lynch. Her friendly and well-meaning but borderline-psychotic demeanor is hysterical. I also enjoyed the overzealous dweeb who's volunteered for over 5 years for Sturdy Wings (the "Big Brothers" type of organization Lynch runs), and the "King" and his minions in the fictitious role-playing game that Augie (McLovin') takes part in. Almost all the characters add a little something to the movie, which is great.

As for the added content, the deleted scenes are, as expected, hilarious. Blu-Ray exclusives include things like Blu-Ray Live, which connects you to the internet for some exclusive content, and the ability to cut out certain scenes. I haven't gotten too much into it, but it adds some longevity to the entertainment of the product if that's your thing.

Anyway, if you thought the previews were ho-hum, don't let that fool you. This movie was perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the year, with a light hearted but solid story and, most importantly, huge laughs.
