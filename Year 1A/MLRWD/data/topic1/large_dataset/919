First off, while this movie is called Dagon, it's actually based largely on "The Shadow Over Innsmouth," one of Lovecraft's most successful stories. Of course, it has been modernized, but it I think it still held true to what Lovecraft was shooting for. Even though the film was made by Stuart Gordon, who directed the other two best Lovecraft movies (The Re-Animator and From Beyond), I wasn't expecting much when I picked this one up. However, I was wrong to underestimate it. 
The movie, although undoubtedly "B", was spectacular. The scenes were erie, suspenseful, and ominous, the acting quite decent (Ezra Godden from Band of Brothers plays the overwhelmed, nuerotic lead), and I didn't even mind the sometimes poor CGI special effects. As far as the movie goes, it is much more like From Beyond than Re-Animator, in that it attempts to be more wicked and dark than campy. Although it's not too violent, there are one or two somewhat gory scenes. It was shot in spain, and the run down town was very effective at provoking a sense of the macabre.
As far as the plot goes, it's about a group of friends in a boating accident that forces one couple to seek help on a nearby island. When they get to the run down island village, they found out that it is inhabited by a race of subhuman creatures that worship a dark sea god. It's not long before they realize they would have been better off drowning.
I really liked it and if you are a Lovecraft fan, or if you enjoyed Re-Animator or From Beyond, you will want to give this fair go at Lovecraft on screen a chance.
