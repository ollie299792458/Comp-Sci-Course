I ignored Rattle and Hum when it was initially released. I liked U2 well enough but just didn't think I'd be interested in a concert film. Fast forward through time and many albums. All that Cant' Be Left Behind caught hold of me in particular the song Beautiful Day. I started delving into more of their art. Rattle and Hum was a free selection for purchasing an HD DVD drive for my Xbox 360. I was deeply moved by the way the band was captured in this film, how their songs were framed, their wonderful musical journey and overall how compelling each performance was. I recommend that you rent it. Watch it. Buy it and watch it over and over. You won't be dissappointed.
