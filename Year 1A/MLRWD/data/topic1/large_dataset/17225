I like a good,solid, horror flick as much or better than the next fanboy.

Unfortunately,Prophecy: The Monster Movie is a shining example of what occurs when you bring environmental political correctness into the mix.

No mad scientists or supernatural creatures of the night.
Instead we get a mercury poisoned grizzly bear that attacks a couple of scientists in the wilderness of the northeast.

Stupid script and wooden acting make this the worst movie I have ever seen in all of my years upon the earth.(And I have seen some bad ones).
I originally saw this in a theater and this was the first time I walked out and told the management I wanted a refund.

I can't even imagine the zealots from Earth First sticking around and watching this dead fish rot on screen.

I would be hard pressed to choose between having to watch this movie or have somebody use a hot soldering iron to burn their initials on my scrotum.

To sum it up,yes,it sucks.
