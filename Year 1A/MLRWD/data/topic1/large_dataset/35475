Jarvier Bardem's portrait of a man in Biutiful is the most complete development of a character I have ever seen put to the silver screen.  His fully fleshed out person, Uxbal,  makes this film my new favorite of all time.  I cannot begin to put to words how much I learned about the human experience of true manhood, fatherhood and the stress of poverty through viewing this film.  It is simply brilliant in terms of portraying a broken family living on the edge in Barcelona facing only hardship and yet still managing to find love and compassion in the crevice of each difficult day. Uxbal dances between worlds, between the living and the dead.  The photography, the script,  the casting, the production design, the soundtrack and the translation into English captivated me entirely. The direction by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu is flawless. The supporting cast fit together so authentically that I was convinced in every scene of of their family bond.  Each moment of this film is rich with texture and nuance,  a masterpiece.
