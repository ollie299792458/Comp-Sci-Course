I'll just out and say this: The Italian Job is a fun movie. Originally I felt shafted, being a fan of the Sutherlands, but I do have to say that Wahlberg and Theron make this an extraordinary film.

The action scenes are incredibly unpredictable and well-thought out without catering to the lowest common denominator (i.e., random explosions, millions of bullets and the like). Edward Norton does a terrific job playing the slimy double-crosser and with Jason Statham, Mos Def and Seth Green backing up our two main protagonists this is probably one of the few ensemble casts without any real weaknesses.

Mark Wahlberg has had me hooked since "Three Kings," and "The Italian Job" only adds to his growing resume. Charlize Theron is incredible as always and she manages to take a role that could have easily become a cliche and make it completely unique.

I've never seen this director before, but with the planning and camerawork that went into the film, you can bet that I'll be looking for him again in future films. This is one of those movies that you can always count on if you feel like popping a DVD in the player. This belongs on everyone's list.
