This movie will make you see war in a new way. I've seen many war movies with plenty of atrocities and negative sides of war, but this

film truly shows a unique and realistic view of war, that should make anyone reexamine their attitude towards war. I was & still am a supporter of overthrowing Saddam, but despite all the things we hear & see on TV, this film shows a more nuanced psychological perspective on war (albeit the previous one) that we rarely take into account as a society.

Still, the story does not seek to defend either the left or right, or even to change your mind. It just shows things as they are. After seeing this movie, I'm even more convinced that the only people who should be allowed to send a country to war are those who have actually been involved in the painful realities of combat. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of your political views.

PS - There is material in here that might be unpleasant but the "offensive language" & the rest of the things that make this movie rated "R" are a realistic view of Marine life, so I urge you to give the movie a chance even if you traditionally avoid films with language & rough content.
