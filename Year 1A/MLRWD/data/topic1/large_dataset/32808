I was cautious about renting this movie at first.  I thought it would be another sad attept to make a modern day film about the life or druglords.  Plus, I've never been a fan of rapper Cam'Ron, so when I saw he was in the film I was even more cautious.

But after watching this film, I am amazed.  The emotion was there, the humor too, and the realism was unquestionable.  Cam'Ron is actually a pretty good actor, and is very surprising in his role as Rico, who's similar to a modern day O-Dog(Menace II Society).  Overall though, I found Mekhi Phieffer(Mitch) to be my favorite in this.  I could really connect with his emotion, like I can with a lot of his films.  Wood Harris was great to as Ace, a kid working at a dry cleaners place until he is corrupted by the drug world.  The scene where Ace sees "Scarface" for the first time was really impressive.  I liked the way that while Tony Montana was defending his empire in the movie, Mitch and his gang are retaliating against another gang.

Overall, this isn't a life changing film, but it is definitely up there with "Boyz N The Hood" and "Menace II Society".
