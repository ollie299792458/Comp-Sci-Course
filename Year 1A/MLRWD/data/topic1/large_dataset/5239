I originally saw it as a NBC mini-series event, and absolutely loved it. There is a remarkable realism on everything you see on it: scenery, costumes, props, you name it. You're really drawn into the time period of that ancient Greece.

The cast is remarkable. They all deliver wonderful performances true to the character they play, exept maybe for the main one Jason, as one other reviewer mentioned he lacks a certain commanding prescence, nevertheless, he fits perfectly the words of the script as the "youth with a pleasing face", favored by the gods. This particular movie includes one of the best adaptations ever made of Hercules, true to its myth, and exeptionally cast and performerd, which was very rare to see.

The extras on the DVD could have been better,if not a little longer.Mostly composed of cast and director's quotes with just one overall interview that seems more like a promo for the movie. Overall is a beautiful production with amazing special effects and realism that would please all lovers of ancient Greek myths. I highly recommend it!
