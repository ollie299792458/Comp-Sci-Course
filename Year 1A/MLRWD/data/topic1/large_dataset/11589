This is a good movie that will liberate librarians everywhere.  The book burning scene was good.  Carrie Snodgrass is so sensitive and ready to freak at every scene.  I love her.  And the people of the town are so snobby to her, except for her loving staff.  Ray Milland is just the worst person you'd ever want to have abusing you from a wheelchair.  He even wants to make you feel bad for going to the movies without him.  He is the guy that makes the worst guilt trip you've had seem nice and kind.  
The other movie on the disk, Crawlspace, has a very long credits scene in the beginning.  It's like they wanted to thank the director's first and second cousins.  And it's all in this red font that is just so bloody looking.  The villan, Karl Gunther, is your natural, overly friendly landlorn at first.  His smile is so true and real looking.  And I wasn't afraid of the rats.  There is no gushing blood in this film, which would have made it a lot better.  But you gotta love this guy for being a true wierdo.  He really needed a Vodka milkshake himself.
