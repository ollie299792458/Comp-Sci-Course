I saw Once Were Warriors one night on a whim after the film I wanted to see was sold out.  Rena Owen's performance in the film is the BEST I have ever seen in my life on film.  She is so powerful.  Her inner strength in the role makes the film so riveting.  I bought a copy of the film as soon as it came out a few years ago.  I have watched it over 50 times.  I must admit that it brings me to tears everytime I see it.  The cast is so powerful, true to life, and scary.  Rena Owen truly was overlooked for an Oscar for Best Actress.  Jake is so scary that you will hate him and feel sorry for him.  Out of my top ten list of favorite films, Once Were Warriors is Number 1 on my list.  I definitely recommend this film to anyone that appreciates exquisite writing, phenomenal acting, and a film that will enrage you, touch you, and make you cry and think.  The Academy Awards of 1995 should have given Oscars to this film for:  Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Original Screenplay!  Out of 5 stars, I give this film a million!
