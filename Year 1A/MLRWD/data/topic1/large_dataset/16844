I'm the most conservative guy on the planet so you would think my reaction to this movie that is chocked full of disturbing sex would irk me.  But that is far from the truth.  This film excellently portrays the emptyness of these teens lives and the sex scenes were very necessary to show that.  It is a natural step for them to so cavalierly plan an excute a murder and they're reaction even as they're about to begin the trial for that murder leaves the audience aghast in their absolute emptiness.  It was not untill the film was over that I realized how important the sex scenes in this movie are.  They are by no means exploitive since they are critical to paint the despair and absolute emptyness in these kids.  Unlike movies "American Pie" and "Porkys" where the sex is inserted as icing on the cake, "Bully" actually uses teen sex to show how truly empty, shallow and feelingless it really is.  The MTVs of the world love to paint a happy picture of teen sex.  Thankfully "Bully" has come along to paint a realistic view of how that generation, and their actions so encouraged by the media today, have robbed the souls of kids today.
