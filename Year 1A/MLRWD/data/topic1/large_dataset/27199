I didn't know what to expect going in to this one, and I don't really think I can prepare anyone else for the experience.

The plot is strange. I won't try to summarize it beyond saying that a bluesman decides to cure a girl of her sex addiction. The trailer does a good job of telling you what it's about.

I'm not a huge fan of Christina Ricci, but she is amazing in Black Snake Moan. She put a fire into her character that no other actress could have created. According to the Craig Brewer, the director, she actually insisted on using a real chain instead of the rubber prop.

Samuel L. Jackson gives exactly the performance you'd expect, which is great but nothing special for him.

Craig Brewer's direction is also great. Direction isn't something that I usually comment on, but there were a few standout scenes in this movie that had incredible energy that requires good direction in addition to acting.

It's funny and strange and great; I definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a unique film experience.
