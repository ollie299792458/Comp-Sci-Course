As an interested retired person I have followed accounts of our president's origins, history, and later egregious, obviously impeachable, malfeasance in office since his gross defects became apparent to me in January 2008.
I had been aware of most of the evidence for, and theories about, the facts demonstrated in a coherent narrative in this film.
The many additional facts and the fitting of what is known into a single coherent narrative is new. Frank Marshall Davis as the natural father had a strong probability. But the notion of the mother of a President as a teen age nude semi-porn model caused decent people (and I) to keep their distance. They had forgotten the last Democrat president who probably had a natural father whose name remains known to very few. (Slick Willie was also a president who probably had an earlier career as an accomplished serial rapist.)
This film has the ring of truth. Particularly for one already very aware of most of the factual evidence it is based on.
Like the Swift Boat evidence of 2004 it will probably never be substantially contradicted. But the spin will be extra dizzy.
