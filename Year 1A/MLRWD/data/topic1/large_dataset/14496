This production overall is very good. However I need to put in a tone of regret coming from faviorate recordings such as Tucker/Leinsdorf, Callas/Serifin, etc. I certainly don't feel like I waested my money and  right now there are only 2-3 choices on the market for this opera - and can  you believe still no DVD! 
Here are a few of my observations: The singing  bounces between pretty good and average. There really isn't anything  special about any of these singers, with the exception of Sharpless (very  good). For the most part, they do their jobs and they do them well and  thats that. James Conlon does a good job with the Orchestra De Paris,  however his tempi are very much on the fast side. Great directing, however  for an opera that for the most part nicely goes right by the book - there  are some details that are omiss (so I don't ruin the movie, I'll just tell  you what does not happen - you will have to buy it to see what they do  instead): Butterfly does not sit the child on a stool with an American flag  and a doll - the sound of the knife falling isn't there, Butterfly does not  in a dying fit gropingly crawl twards the child, and Pinkerton and  Sharpless don't run in and find her dead. If your not an opera buff it  probably won't bother you. I do recomend this movie, but I'm sure that very  soon there will be better alternatives.
