Frank Miller's writing, drawling, and creating ablility was astounding, as with Elektra. Now the elektra portrayed in his comics is excellent. A charecter with emotional depth, you actually care about her. However, Unlike the comics, the elektra movie which taints his creation, the movie was that bad.

  This seems to be a trend in comics movies, as witht he recent FF movie. Guys, stick to the comics. That's how they were sucessful at first, don't go rewriting the whole orgin and look. And you wonder why it sucked? It was amazing Hollywood let it out of the editing room, (but they let Gigli out too, so no surprise there.)

  It looks promising from the opening credits, but goes downhill from there. i think they tried to pull too many elemnts on what made the Alias series sucessful for Jen and tried to recreate it here. Alias is good for the show, not for a totally different charecter.

  The cameo for Ben Afflect doesn't help, since Daredevil wasn't all that great and Ben Afflect, again, can't act. He's been in a long string of bad movies. You would think that Ben Afflect has a enemy like Bullseye is picking the worst movies out there for him. I haven't seen the directors cut, but it could not be thta much beter. Check out pretty much any comic book movie before this.
