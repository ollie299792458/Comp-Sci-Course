A Hilarious masterpiece from director Todd Phillips.  Staring Will Ferrel as Frank "the tank", Luke Wilson as "Mitch", and Vince Vaughn as "Beanie".  This instant colt classic represents the ultimate college comedy since "Animal House".
  When Mitch catches the early flight home from Denver only to catch his girlfriend cheating on him inspires his good friends Frank and Beanie to through him a "kick off" party in Mitch's new campus house as a way of "releasing him out into the wild".
  Due to regulations set forth by the Dean, Mitch is forced to turn his home into a faternity house, while recruiting fourteen new pledges.  The Dean does everything in his will to get rid of this new fraternity.
  The new fraternity is the new "hit" around school, so the boys decide to do everything possible to keep the fraternity.  With scene after scene of hilarious footage, "Old School" will have you on the edge of your seat with non stop laughter.
  Overall, I give "Old School" 2 thumbs up!  It is the ultimate comedy for more then just a few laughs, and gets funnier each time you watch it.
