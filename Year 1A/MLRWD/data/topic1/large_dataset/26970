If the title above gets you interested then stop reading and watch the series. But if you are someone that needs more explanation, then this will be a basic premise of what the series is about. First off I will not discuss the characters for two reasons: 1st:I couldn't explain their motivations better than the show did so. 2nd: Like the 1st episode states. There are no main characters, anyone can be the main character.

So with that the show has 3 stories going on at the same time, they are occurring in 1930, 1931, 1932, also they are told non-linear style so at one point you will be in 1932 and then jump back to 1930 then to 1931 and so forth. If the non-linear style worries you the series "confusing" points wear off and the story comes together very easily. Also this style makes it worth watching multiple times. The series takes place in US going from Chicago to New York

This English dub is probably in the top 5 of dubs for animes in on my list. It works because this anime takes place in the US. Also important to note that the Japanese audio works great and if I have one complaint about the English dub is that 2 of the characters where funnier in Japanese than in English. But that doesn't mean the English dub was bad for them. This is just my personal opinion.

If you love mafia gangsters, immortals, romance, humor, action, or supernatural then this series has something for you.

This series is a lesson in storytelling and character development which hasn't been done so well in a long time let alone a 16 episode series. A must buy for any fan of gangsters or anime.
