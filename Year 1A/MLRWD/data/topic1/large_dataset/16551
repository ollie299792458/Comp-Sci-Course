The Awesome Science DVD Series is designed to give young Christians a biblical view of science. This particular episode is intended to explore meteors, craters, and petrified forests. Unfortunately, I felt that the DVD offered a very narrow and someone biased explanation of science.

I watched this with my 1st grader, and while the series is intended for older kids, my son still enjoyed it. The graphics are great and the presentation is easy-to-understand. My problem with the DVD is that I felt it focused more on Christians vs. Scientists, rather than explaining how things work.

The first 20 minutes of the film focus solely on the idea that the world is 6,000 years old. While I understand and am familiar with young earth theology, I also think it's important to remember that not everyone - not even all Christians - believe that the earth is young. You can accept the idea that the earth may be millions of years old without believing that humans evolved from monkeys.

If you're looking for a curriculum for your home schooled child that only offers a conservative Christian perspective on science, you may really enjoy this. While I'm a Christian and I do home school my children,  I really want to show them both perspectives (young earth AND old earth) and let them decide for themselves.

When it comes to science, I don't believe that it's "Us VS Them." You can explain science to your child in a way that is interesting, fun, and biblical, but can also show your child that we don't have all the answers. Christians and scientists alike both have things we don't fully understand or comprehend, and that's okay. The biggest concern I have with letting my child watch this type of video is that he'll develop a negative opinion of scientists in general or in people who are Christians but who may have a different opinion on something. Instead of focusing on meteors, I felt that this video just focused on the differences between Christians and "the rest of the world."
