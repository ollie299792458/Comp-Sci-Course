Ok, so I chose this disc over others because it had a digital copy with it, and I am a huge fan of digital copy with disney, so I thought this would be the same.  I put the disc in and wait for it to load so I could enter the code, boy was I surprised when it said this offer has expired. I go to warner bros support site to see whats up, and it states it was only for a limited time after initial release, and code is expired.  I sent them an email about it.  They should compete with their competitors or not all on these digital copies.  Their helpsite also stated that the expiration date of the digital copy is clearly stated on the exterior of the packaging!!  No ITS NOT.  only after you open it and on the inside only (at least on the one I bought).  Ridiculous.  Warners Bros if you didn't want to offer your customers a digital copy then don't put it in there!!

(fyi, as a user of paid for digital copies the quality is not very good, but when viewing on tiny ipods it is fine, which is the whole point of digital copies, to put on your digital portables)

My 6 yr old son however LOVES this movie (and he has never seen any of the regular star wars movies), so I did give it a good rating for that.  Not fare to give movie a bad rating b/c of warner bros.
