In some ways BLUE VALENTINE is two films. On the one hand is a naturalistic look at what happens when a relationship breaks down. On the other (told in flashback) it's a sort of quirky romantic comedy that tells the well-worn story of kooky, lost girl finds equally lost guy: together they compliment each other and live happily ever after... except in this case we know they don't.

And that's essentially what's wrong with the film. It's a clash of ideas but writer/director Derek Cianfrance can't resolve that clash in any meaningful way.

By definition rom-coms are a type of wish fulfilment fantasy (think of something like LOVE ACTUALLY - where the PM falls for the tea girl). They work perfectly within their own context but held up to realistic analysis fail dismally. And it's the naturalism of the second strand that forces the viewer to consider the whole realistically. I was left utterly confused as to what I was watching. Or how I was supposed to.

Although the acting is first-rate, this is also a deeply uncomfortable film to sit through. The rawness of the split up was too much for me. Add in some gratuitous sex scenes and implausibilities (if an ex-boyfriend of mine asked if I was unfaithful to my husband I'd be deeply offended not coquettish) and the result is a film that fails to convince or engage.

I suppose BLUE VALENTINE wants its cake and to eat it too. It might have worked well either as an off-beat romantic comedy or as a serious drama, but by combining the two it fails at both.
