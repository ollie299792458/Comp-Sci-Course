Let me just say that I've been watching Tara Stiles on YouTube for the past couple of years, and I love her and her style of teaching.  So it's no surprise that I'd love this DVD.  As far as my yoga practice goes, it's been pretty off and on, always lacking consistency.  So I still consider myself a beginner.  For beginners, this DVD is tough.  I had almost zero upper body strength, so even plank pose was a challenge.  But Tara does show you some modifications that made it doable for me, such as the side plank.  If I hadn't been able to keep my knee down in the beginning, there's no way I'd have been able to do this video. Also, Tara's also good about reminding you to start where you are and don't feel bad about it.

I couldn't do the entire DVD at first.  I started with 15 minutes and worked my way up.  It's the only workout DVD that I look forward to doing!  And if anyone is reading this and maybe thinking that they aren't in good enough shape to try this, just do it and start slow.  You'll build strength pretty quickly.  This DVD is a good workout.  You will sweat and your heart will pump!  I think she has kept her promise that yoga can be a good cardiovascular exercise.  I'm still nowhere near as graceful and strong as I want to be, but for the first time I'm enjoying sticking with it.  I know I'll get there.

As far as the music, I honestly never even notice it until maybe the seated poses, and it's fine.  I have no trouble hearing her over it.

I'd recommend buying this DVD if you like unpretentious, challenging yoga with a great teacher.  Just be aware beforehand that beginners lacking upper body strength will have to modify a bit at first.
