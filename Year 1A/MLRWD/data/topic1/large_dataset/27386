Ah, if it only had a brain.  The extended cut does make a couple of things a tiny bit more sensible, but they still don't wash, they really don't.  Best to just lay back and let this spectacle roll over you -- if you get  critical, then you miss the fun elements (and there are plenty) and you  might as well ditch this and go watch a Bergman or Woody Allen flick.  It's  big, it's loud, it's stupid, and people love it for exactly the reason that  they love the circus, or fun fair, or roller coasters, or even  Disneyland.
Contrary to another reviewer's comments, the picture quality  is excellent, with superb mastering, a high bitrate, smooth seamless  branching in the special edition, and even a blipless layer switch on my  Toshiba SD1200.  The sound is terrific, with rock-the-house lows and some  marvelous surround work.  The extras, meanwhile, are okay -- disc two is  more so-so than I'd like, but does have some good features.  I would have  liked an isolated score track on that second disc, though -- that was a  highlight of the Patton set.  The Emmerich/Devlin commentary is a hoot,  because neither of them are po-faced about their work, and the irreverence  is refreshing.  The visual effects commentary is quite the opposite -- a  serious and engaging discussion that should be listened to several times by  aspiring VFX techs, wannabe directors, and even screenwriters aiming to  create a blockbuster sci-fi (as opposed to science fiction) event.  In the  real world, as part of a seminar, that second track would cost you serious  money.
Why three stars?  Because the DVD rates about a 4 and the movie  itself around a 2.  I think I'll keep mine for a while, and not just for  the kids, either.
