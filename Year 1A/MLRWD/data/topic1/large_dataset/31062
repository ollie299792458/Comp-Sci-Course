Jessica is pushing thirty and looking for a meaningful relationship. She finds it through a personal ad. Only problem is the person she meets is a woman and Jessica is straight. But hey, you don't know if you like something until you try it. And so she does try it, with Helen, an artsy type who is as patient with Jessica as she is sexy. 
What develops is a sweet and endearing relationship between the two which eventually gives Jessica the courage to shake up other areas of her life and take responsibility for making her own happiness.

The ending is unexpected and at first might piss you off. But if you watch it again and think about who this character is you realize it had to end that way. You can't make someone who is gay straight and you can't make someone who is straight gay. The writers in my opinion had the courage to make a story about a woman who "tries out" being a lesbian rather than a story about a woman who, "presto, chango", becomes a lesbian. And although you are hoping these likeable characters end up together and make it work you have to accept the ending for what it is because hey, it happens.
