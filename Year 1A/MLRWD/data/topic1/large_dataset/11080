I gather that the film was labeled 'misogynist' when it came out. Let's hope all that predictable chest-beating  has died down enough so that one can see the film for what it is -- a comic delight with unexpected and unaccountable moments of the sublime tossed in, for free, as it were. And yes it contains serious allusions to Vertigo side by side with trash, but that's its charm! Precisely because DePalma doesn't take himself too seriously (he goes out of his way to portray TWO film directors as total buffoons in this story) he is able to achieve, in collaboration with the composer, Pino Donaggio, aesthetic moments of a kind that others couldn't even conceive of let alone aspire to, because they would be trying so hard to be arty and "significant." For example, the sound design and music for the scene leading up to the theft of Gloria's purse on the beach is especially beautiful, as though Claude Debussy on a whim had done an MTV video. And then there's DePalma's use of the popular song, "Relax" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood (banned in the UK). I'm the kind of person who spends his commute time listening to the Berg Violin Concerto or comparing different recordings of Beethoven's late string quartets, but I have to admit that the "Relax" sequence as choreographed by DePalma in this film is comparable to any iconic moment you might care to point to in all of western classical music. Strange to say, but it's true. (Blame it on the unearthly beauty of Melanie Griffith's shoulder blades if you like...) If you have the slightest interest in or curiosity about this film, by all means buy the special edition -- excellent Special Features have been added.
