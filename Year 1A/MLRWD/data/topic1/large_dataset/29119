I saw this movie also and loved it.

 Questions:  Why do people feel the need to tell the entire story when giving reviews?  Just say what you liked about the movie give your critiques ONLY  Some of you folks told the whole d....movie.  Also to Acorn "jcorn59483"  Blalock is described as "Genius and Unbridled Ambition and  Taylor is described as "loyal and dedication"  ???  Did you see the same movie as the rest of us.  Or are you unaware of your own unconscious prejudices??  Also to another reviewer Did not Taylor have a Major contribution to the valve that saved the life of blue babies ???  Maybe I should see the movie again.  You gave the credit to Blalock and some other Caucasian Doctor  Only  ??

Racism and Prejudices are such complexities of the "American Life"  Some of us live it every day and say "What!... Not Me!  While others live and deal with it every day!  How obsurd to call the genius of Vivien Taylor "loyal and dedicated"  This man had No formal medical training yet he went toe to toe with a Doctor who was at the top of his field.  Who was the real genius here  !
