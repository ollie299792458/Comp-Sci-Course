When the show first hit our television screens in 2006, I loved it, and still do as a matter of fact.
ABC, the television network in the US, has axed the show due to low ratings, this could be due to the fact that they kept on changing the timeslot of the show, so no-one could really find out which day or time, it was on.
The writing is fantastic, the characters also. Season 4 (the final season) is ending tonight as i write this I look back on all the amazing moments ugly betty has given us, it was the greatest show on TV, and still is in millions of ugly betty fans today (including myself). But fear not, as a brand new show called 'Glee' you might of heard of it seeing as the show has become an international phinominon XD. But this is'nt about glee (which is my favirote show at the moment, apart from doctor who, desperate housewives, gossip girl, murder she wrote, 3rd rock from the sun, the simpsons etc... lol), this is about the fantastic show ugly betty, which I and many other will miss dearly.

We love you betty.
Goodbye :).
