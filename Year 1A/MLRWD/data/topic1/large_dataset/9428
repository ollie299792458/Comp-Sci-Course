So far, the biggest knock on this film is the fact that it's all 3D CGI.  Apparently there are cell-animation (2D)fans who feel this is the wrong move.  Well, I have a friend who worked for Disney (Little Murmaid, Oliver and Company) and Pixar (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo).  I grew up with him (3rd grade in 1973 until now)and become a hugh fan of animation of all kinds (especially Ray Harryhausen films).  I have collected every Disney cartoon I could afford (and enjoyed).  I even dabbled in animation myself.  So I think I have a pretty good perspective on this subject.  Here's the scoop...

-Cell animation is VERY EXPENSIVE.  If you make a crappy film (Home on the Range) you basically wasted 3 to 4 years and millions of dollars.
-You may have noticed that computers have been used in 2D animation for about 20 years now (I think "the Great Mouse Detective" was the first)
-Computer animation requires artist to design the characters, give them meaningful motion, character, emotion etc.  In other words, you still need to be an artist to do CGI.
-ALL MAJOR STUDIOS HAVE SCRAPPED CELL ANIMATION, INCLUDING DISNEY. It's simpley too cost prohibitive and CGI films (even the Made-on-the-cheap "Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius")MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLONS OF DOLLARS!!!  Consumers, for the most part, LOVE CGI!
-Once you create a computer character, you can file it away and use it again later (Though they seam to get upgraded with the latest technology regardless).  This saves tons of time and money.

There's alot more reasons CGI is the choice of studios today.  Does this mean cell animation is no good?  The way I look at it, about 30 more CGI movies need to be made to catch up with the existing cell animated features already in existance.  I love films like "Fantasia", "Sleeping Beauty" and even "Spirit; Stallion of the Simeron".  But I can understand why a studio would be unwilling to pony-up money for cell animation when the option to use CGI is nearly a sure-thing financially.  It's not going to happen.

NOW ABOUT THE DVD:

-My 2 year-old enters the house after day-care with the words "Mickey Mouse" and "Donald Duck".  He's definately spending too much time in front of the TV, but he does love it.
-Hence, I've seen it about 15 times in the last 2 weeks.  Yea, I'm sick of it, but it still manages to entertain me on some bizarre level.
-When I first saw it, I realised this was Disney's future.  It was well enough executed that I did not mind.
-Plenty of extras for those seeking content value.
-Most reviews here give an accurate sense of the stories.  I enjoyed most of them (the one with Goofy will be dated in a few years).
-Good sound and picture.  Actually very nicely rendered.
-My 6 year old was completely engrossed during her initial viewing.  The stories just sucked her in.

I hope this is helpful to those trying to cope with the "demise" of Hollywood cell animation.  Perhaps some day, we will be complaining that the new digital holographic movies lack the charm of the old CGI films.
