This is one of the very best movies I have ever watched.  I thought the entire cast was wonderful.  The story is true, based on the life of a an only child, a boy, whose first dog helped him to grow.  It's really funny at times, laugh out loud funny.  I like the adult characters as well, especially Kevin Bacon as the dad, and Luke Wilson who plays Dink Jenkins the 'Golden Boy" who went to war and came back feeling defeated.  I think the scene between Bacon and Wilson is very touching. Frankie Muniz is simply adorable, and he was so believable.  Can't leave out Diane Lane, she is such a pretty woman, and I really enjoyed her character as well.  She seemed to be somewhat different than most of the women in that time period.  Story of love, friendship, family, and loss.  I have recently bought the book to read as well.  Advisable to have a box of tissue on hand, I wept a great deal the last 20-30 minutes of this movie.  Though I always loved my dog, after watching this, I had a whole new appreciation of that very special relationship.  To me this is one of those movies you have to watch from time to time...the message never gets old.
