I must have seen this movie about a million times in my short life, on both video and dvd, but never have I seen this movie look and sound so fresh.
The picture is the crispest I've ever seen for this movie, and is true testiment to the power of DVD, much in the same way as Terminator:Special Edition was. Print damage still appears in places, but given the fact that the movie is twenty three years old, that's expected. But what blew me away is the sound of the 5.1 Aussie English Audio track(that's right, the original soundtrack). Unlike the local video release, the audio is as clear as a bell. Low sounding dialogue is understandable, clear and crisp. The dispatchers voice isn't muffled, and Brian May's musical composition plays more powerfully, while mixing effortlessly and complimenting the action sequences more effectively than ever.
This movie has always been a classic of Aussie cinema, if not, cinema in general. It's a shame that it took twenty two years for you guys in the US to finally experience this the way it was originally intended. Better late than never, but given the treatment it's been given on this disc, well worth it!
