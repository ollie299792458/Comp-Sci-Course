There are a number of Laurel & Hardy DVD's out there and many of them are not so good, featuring them in some of their latest, and sadly, weakest works (Utopia, Air Raid Wardens etc.).  This DVD is not only excellent quality, it has some of Laurel & Hardy's strongest works.

It includes "The Music Box", which deservedly won the Oscar in 1932 for best comedy short. In it L&H spend the day taking a piano to the top of an unbelieveably long flight of stairs. You remember! What a hoot!.

It also contains another of their feature length films, "Sons of the Desert."  In it Hardy fools his wife into thinking he and Stanley are taking an ocean voyage to Hawaii for his health while they in reality are going off to revel at the Sons of the Desert convention in Chicago. Check out Stan lounging at Oliver's house surreptitiously eating his third piece of waxed fruit in the past month. Mrs. Hardy wondered where her living room fruit display had been going. They are at their best.

 The three remaining, shorter works "Another Fine Mess", "Busy Bodies" and "County Hospital" are also very well done with L&H both being in their comedic prime  particularly in the first two.  The DVD also contains some nice extras including a location tour of some of the sites for their early movies as well as biographical information.  It's great for L& H fans.

I hope someone comes out with another DVD with some of their other best works, like "Block Heads."  I also wish that those who sell the DVD's (like AMAZON!!) would not simply list "Laurel and Hardy volume XX" as the title, but would make it easier to discover WHICH of their films are included on that DVD (i.e. the dog "Utopia" or the gem "Music Box"). Look at the listings. It 's almost impossible to easily discern which is contained. Since Laurel and Hardy never made a film titled "Boxed Set volume 6" we need more information!!

With the trash on today's theater screens, we need more Laurel and Hardy!
