I rather enjoy this style of documentary.
  In my experience documentaries have two faces;
an opinionated narrator with an obvious agenda who either alienates you or pushes you into their mindset, or
an educational narrator who may lean in one direction yet is more concerned with understanding and empathy.

This documentary educates the viewer on the various forms of "interrogation" we have developed over the years in a precise and methodical manner.  The underlying story of a young taxi driver serves as a link.  A link to a living, breathing individual who faced these techniques and died after only two days of interrogation.  This film brought 4 concepts together for me - Interrogation becomes Torture which fuels Terrorism and becomes War -

And here is how:
American forces capture and interrogate people suspected of being a threat to national security, 9% of which are brought into interrogation by U.S. forces.  These interrogators are indirectly pressured to find information so their company/troop will appear to be getting results. The detainees are held for months or more and undergo forms of interrogation that can only be described as humiliating, demeaning, disgusting... torture.  When the detainees are eventually released their experience of America is one of disgust, and in a predominantly deeply religious country, unholy.  This act produces hatred which in turn fuels terrorism which fuels war.  I may not know a better way of handling the situation, but I know this method is a step in the wrong direction and the director illustrates that beautifully.  Buy this movie, it brings out your empathetic side and forces you to think about what our country is doing in our name.
