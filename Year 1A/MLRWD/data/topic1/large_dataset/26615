Scary Movie. What a name huh? Because, unless you are a total whimp, there was nothing scary about this movie. It was however, an outragesly funny movie for the young (12+) at heart. The scenes portray such as Scream (1,2,3), I know..., Blair Witch, and many more. The actors and actresses are also made fun of in this entertaining flick. 
Now, this is a movie for teens and adults younger than 40. Some "adults" won't enjoy this. But I know my mother of 39, liked this movie and certainly did get a good laugh out of it! So, if you are in the mood for a "teeny" style flick, you'll like it. Even more so, if you have seen all the "Scary Movies" that they poke fun at. 
One warning however, this movie is not for those people who think things should be "proper, and respectible" but for those who absolutely love stupid (George of the Jungle) or wacky sexual pics, you should enjoy it.
Not the best review, I know. But hey, It gets the point accross. I liked it, I'm 19 and I think normal people who aren't real bent up about sexuality and stuff, should see it.
