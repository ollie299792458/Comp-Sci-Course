Those who taunt THE LAST KISS as a terrible or even a boring film are either a.) too young to understand that even adults are humans and constantly make the wrong choices or b.) they were forced to watch the film due to female pressure.

The Last Kiss is in no way a film that leaves the viewer with a clean cut story of "here's the characters, here's the problem and here is how they fix the problem and live happily ever after".  In all reality it is "here are the characters, here are their flaws, here is their interaction and this is what happens without much of a resolve".  Now to most that will sound like an uncomplete film, but for me it is a complete film that revolves around the human condition to wonder "what's better out there?" without thinking of the repercussions of such searches.

Much like last years Crash and this years Babel, the masses have looked at this film in almost total abhor as they seemingly miss the fact that the movie is not about characters, but actions and reactions and the emotions that are caused by such actions/reactions.  Which in all takes the (open-minded) viewer on a trip where not only their eyes and ears are navigation tools, but as well their hearts and feelings.

Drop your expectations and give it an open minded shot!
