I will always hold this Nightmare movie in high regard.  Since it was the first one I ever saw at the young age of 6 in 1988.

This film has Freddy tying up the lose ends from Nightmare 3.  With only Kristen as the last "elm street survivor", she must somehow stop Freddy from killing anyone new.  Freddy exploits her dream power and she calls in Alice, a shy, innocent girl who doesn't seem to have a mean bone in her body.  As Freddy finally gets his revenge, Kristen passes on her power to Alice.

Only problem is, Alice has a serious problem with daydreaming.  Now one by one, all of Alice's friends get murdered by Freddy.  But with every friend that dies, Alice acquires a strength or skill from them.

At the end, after all her friends are gone (except for her crush Dan), Alice takes on Freddy and ultimately defeats him in one of the best ways I've ever seen.

This movie could have really put an end to the Nightmare series.  But I'm glad they didn't.  Next up...Nightmare on Elm Street 5!
