I have to admit to being very biased in favour of this whole Popmart show concept, having closely followed U2's whole 90's career path, but it still deserves a 5-star rating on merit, because the show I went to, in Dublin on 31/08/97 was without a doubt the best rock concert I have ever seen. The Popmart tour went all round the globe in 1997-98, and this video shows U2 in Mexico City in December 1997 with all their glittery excesses, video walls and ironic multimedia tinkering in place. However, as with any show, it is the perfomance and the quality of the material that is paramount, and here U2 deliver a 3-part summation of all their famous styles. This show is great value for money - you get a whopping 24 full-length U2 songs in a &gt; 2hour concert!!! A sizeable chunk of the 1997 album Pop is performed, while there is the traditional B-stage acoustic set mid-show, and then after a pause, there is the obligatory run through their "greatest hits" set. The third part of Popmart is the bit where the shiny silver Lemon glitterball comes to life and the band launches into the snazzy Discotheque set. This is a great video, but it still isn't as good as the show I saw in Dublin, which was U2's second of only two homecoming concerts there. Their reception in Ireland can now be gauged with the new Go Home DVD. I recommend the Popmart video for anyone who enjoys big, glossy , stadium-sized pop/rock shows and who ever liked U2.
