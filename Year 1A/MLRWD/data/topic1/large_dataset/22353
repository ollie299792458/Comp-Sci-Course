I recorded this movie on my DVR from Turner Classic Movies channel. It's one of those movies that gets better with each viewing. I like lots of dialogue since I usually view (or listen to) TV/movies while I do needlework, so it's nice to listen to what's going on and glance at the TV occasionally.

I love Dame May Whitty because her character was such a horrible old biddy. What a great actress! I'll bet that was a fun role for her to play. I think she was the best part of the movie. Robert Montgomery gave me goosebumps because he was always so calm and charming, yet a monster. He was a good actor as well. Rosalind Russell's acting was sort of flat in this movie, and her character was a moron anyway. She was attracted to Danny (Robert Montgomery) knowing full well he had murdered and decapitated a lady and had the victim's head in a hatbox in their house!

The quality of the film is excellent, so when someone finally gets around to putting it on DVD, the copy should look great.
