I had been excited for this dvd release for about 3 years. My friend and I who grew up on Nickelodeon in the early 90s (the acclaimed "prime years") had figured if shows were getting released on dvd, this one had to, and we were lucky because this was definitely our favorite show. Having digital cable and Noggin (which i use often thanks to Degrassi the next generation) i got to see some reruns of Pete and Pete about two years back. However, they stopped airing. luckily enough, if you were lucky enough, you could find an episode or two here and there on kaaza. now with this dvd release, nickelodeon is finally doing the right thing. this was easily the smartest program they ever showed. it didnt condescend to kids, talk down to them or try and preach to them. watching "New Years Pete", little pete even responds to Frank the crossing guard's new years resolution of smoking with "you gonna smoke more or smoke less?" when a 10 year old is able to ask someone if they are to smoke more on Nickelodeon, you are reminded of the lazy summer days and weekends of your youth with shows like this as the background. this show is forever implanted in my brain, and this dvd set could have earned 5 stars even if the quality was horrible and there were no extras besides the 4 "special" episodes (including my all time favorite episode of any tv show ever, "what we did on our summer vacation", in which the petes and ellen try and hunt down their awol ice cream man, mr tastee) and the show's "house band" polaris was exposed to me thru the listening station included on the set (im purchasing the soundtrack to the show this weekend) i reccomend this set to anyone who likes tv or just wants to have a good time, because that is the basis in this dvd set. you learn some great lessons without getting preached to, and you see the world for what it is...an adult conspiracy.
