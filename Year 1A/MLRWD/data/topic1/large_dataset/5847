One of the most striking generic traits of film noir is its iconography of the city. Broad, labyrinthine, boundless, the protagonist is unable to decode the urban landscape. Thus, it can only be endured by fragmentation - cut into palatable little pieces. 
In "The Third Man," the city of Vienna is literally broken up into quarters (British, French, American, Russian), but it is also visually so. Distortion is produced through tilting of the camera lens and the expressive use of lighting. The first appearance of Harry Lime is one example, where we view only a disembodied shoe, the brief glimpse of an enigmatic face, and an attenuated shadow. The jaunty zither music further exacerbates the disorientation. The iconic ferris wheel is a fairly obvious reference to the incongruities of fate (with its ups and downs), while the subtle reference to Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" confirms the film's insistence on the impossibility of telling a coherent narrative. Harry Lime's demise in the city's sewers mimicks Kurtz's anticlimactic dispatch in "Heart of Darkness" - death is no heroic enterprise, nor is it cathartic; but rather, pathetic and entropic. There are no heroes in "The Third Man," because the possibility of heroism is specifically precluded; people do not transcend the modern landscape, but rather endure it with a kind of fatalistic opportunism. 
Unforgettable.
