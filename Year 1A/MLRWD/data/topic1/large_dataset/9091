As a born-and-raised Yooper I was delighted by this film.  Yes, it was a bit over-the-top at some points mainly having to deal with the bearwok and such but Jeff Daniels couldn't have been more accurate in other areas.  The conversations between the Soady's could just as well of been my father and I.  The extreme hatred for the DNR, the fear of camp rituals changing, and the firm stubborness of the father Albert (Harve Presnell) were absolutely perfect.  Whether you're from the area or not, this quirky and slapstick comedy is at least a must-see.  I know some folks from the area felt insulted by the film, but I know more, including myself, that found the humor in it rather than feel like we were being stereotyped.  The bottom line is that the U.P. is one of the most unique places to be from and we should be proud of the fact that a great mind like Jeff Daniels was so intrigued by our little slice of Heaven that he made a film featuring it.  Though some of the film throws you for a loop, the portrayal of the truisms and uniqueness that make the U.P. a place like no other, make this a wonderful film for the true comedy fan.
