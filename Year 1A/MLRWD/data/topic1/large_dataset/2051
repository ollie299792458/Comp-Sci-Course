First the title The Enemy Below after all is said and done is really not the enemy under water but the enemy within ourselves.  Yes the scene where the sailor gets his fingers cut off was not done well but the point of that is to parallel the problems on a sub where the guy goes crazy grabs a wrench and wants to get out. Each captain has his problems on his ship.  Each captain lost a loved one and each captain had a person they could talk to and that is where we see that both captains are in reality the same even though they are on different ships.  Mitchum's character distains war because as he said you cut off one serpent's head and another one grows. Saying you stop one war and another one takes it's place. Jurgens character found WW I glorious with a sense of purpose where WW II serves no purpose at all. The enemy below is the enemy within humanity itself but at the end there is hope for humanity found in the middle of the Atlantic. Problem with some people who rate these movies is that they are like deer and see the special effects like deers lookiing into lights not see the underlying message the story is trying to get across but I guess those type of people are not deep enough for the average intellect and give poor ratings.  I am kind of in between a 3 and 4 star. I would like to give it a 3 1/2 but not possible in this rating. The story itself was pretty good.  The acting I thought was good from the main characters.  For those who want action I would not recommend this.  But those who can view this movie in a different light in a way that gives food for thought I would recommend this movie.
