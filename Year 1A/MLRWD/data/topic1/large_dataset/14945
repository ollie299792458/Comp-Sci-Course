I'd been hearing about The Sopranos all last year but honestly, I just never have time to catch a series every week.  I just don't watch TV with any regularity and I'm not crazy about missing episodes or seeing them out of order when I know there's continuity.  When I saw that whole first season of The Sopranos was coming out, I figured that would be just right for me.
I wasn't disappointed.  Matter of fact, I was blown away.  It's a great show, at times hysterical, at times very dark.  The characters are sometimes over the top but they stay close to basic story, unlike a lot of shows where, struggling to fill 60 minutes and having run out of any sensible ideas, they'll have doctors from an ER show caught in an improbable plane crash in the Andes or whatever.
The most interesting thing for me is the way they've used Tony Soprano's sessions with his therapist as a way to stitch everything together and let you get inside Tony's head.  The actors playing both Tony and the therapist turn in remarkable and very believable performances.
This set is also a heck of a bargain.  You get 13 episodes, four per DVD, plus some bonus materials, which is a lot of viewing time for the money.
I recommend this set as easily the best DVD purchase I made all year (this from someone who buys nearly everything that comes out.)
