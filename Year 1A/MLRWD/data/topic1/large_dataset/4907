I knew nothing about this movie, but I picked up the jacket, and I thought that it would be interesting.  Wow! it was powerful. I am not a football fan, nor do I know anything about the game, but I can share the spirit of  Notre Dame wins.  You do not need to know anything about football to love  Rudy. It evoked laughter and tears while I was watching it on a sunny  February afternoon.  Strong friendships and love were strongly portrayed in  RUDY.  Strangely, I could identify with Rudy.  I returned to school in my  mature years to obtain my bachelors and my master's just prior to my 60th  birthday.  Like Rudy with the very brilliant student at Holy Cross College,  the strong friendship was formed, I formed a buddy system with some of the  young students at Fordham, and down the line, I made lasting friendships  with these young students.  The same type of buddy system existed for me in  graduate school.  The great football players for Notre Dame respected the  wonderful spirit and knowledgeability of Rudy.  The young students I  respected their sharpness, and they in turn respected all the experience I  had to bring to school in my mature years. Rudy was no competition really  for the top players, but he was able to steadfastly hold his own.  I was no  competition for some of the young students, but I was a solid B+ student  who could her own.  Yes, I did shed a few tears about this movie, but I  came away from it feeling very happy.  Would I watch it again.  Absoootoootely!
