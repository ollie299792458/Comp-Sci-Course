Admittedly being biased because Charles Dickens "A Christmas Carol" is my favorite Christmas story, and I am a big fan of the Muppets, I can say without fear of contradction this film is very well done.  It follows remarkably close to the original Dickens version, except of course in some scenes where Waldorf and Statler play the "Marley Brothers", and the narration by "Gonzo Dickens" and Rizzo Rat.  Even here, however, Gonzo quotes lines from the orignal tale.

Michael Caine was an excellent, if understated, Scrooge, but I imagine they did not want the character of Scrooge to steal the show.  I was most amazed at the the human only scene where Scrooge's long lost love is bidding him farewell.  The song "Where Love Has Gone" was astoundingly sweet and very poignant.  The young actress singing the song was superb, and the tears in Michael Caine's eyes appeared to be genuine; touched by the sadness of the moment. It was a stunning metamorphosis away from the fast paced comedic routines into an adult drama.

As usual with Muppet epics, you have to watch it several times to see all the activity in the various scenes, because there is so much going on in the background.  If I recall correctly, this movie was the first attempt to continue the Muppet tradition after the death of Jim Henson.  His son Brian, did an excellent job as the voice of Kermit.  His voice sounded very close to Jim's, almost what a younger version of Jim's voice would sound like.

I heartily endorse this film and urge anyone to put this classic in their library to share it with generations of your family.
