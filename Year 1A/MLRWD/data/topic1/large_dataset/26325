I've read the books, and despite all the hype decided to watch New Moon and Eclipse this week. I was really impressed with Eclipse. What the first two movies lacked was direction, in each scene of Eclipse the actors understand their motivation and we get a lot of true emotion. The movie is also very beautiful, as it should be. Every time I've visited the Peninsula I've been blown away by its beauty.

I thought this was Robert Pattinson's best film, he revealed Edward's vulnerability and heart. This is a man who has faced losing the woman he loves and now only wants what is best for her. He seems like the bad boy, and yet he won't let Bella go too far without marrying him!

Taylor Lautner has been very believable in both New Moon and Eclipse, he's the loyal nice guy that you would take home to your parents and buy a house with. In Eclipse he was raw emotion without going over the top. He appears briefly in the first movie Twilight, and is really sweet. Again this is the kind of boyfriend you want ladies!

Kristen Stewart plays Bella, and for me she is what a lot of us were as teenagers: depressed, lacking self confidence and unaware of how beautiful we are. Kristen has the hardest role, being torn between two men she loves in different ways. With all of their appeal, how could you decide? Why would you want to choose?
