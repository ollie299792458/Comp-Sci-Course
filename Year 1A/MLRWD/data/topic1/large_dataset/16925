The first opening number you hear to this film makes you instantly suspicious. You see that it's so simple that you honestly suspect something randomly is going to happen half way through the song; but the song ends and what follows on in one of the greatest songs ever. Sung by Terrence and Phillip (Canadian actors) this song got the world record for the most swear words in one song (mainly being the F word). After this comes a film with pure hilarity, by far one of Kenny's greatest deaths and has as much gore and randomness as any other South Park episode only longer and told like a musical.

The only reason it loses one star is due to the lack od DVD extras. After playing the movie to death and wanting more out of the DVD I don't really care much for trailers of the film. And the only thing besides that is a music video for the song 'What would Brian Boitano do?' (I don't know who he is) and thats ashame because the movies great.

Well there's not much else to say besides buy it if you want to laugh yourself silly and end up humming the tunes everywhere for weeks.

P.S people who have watched the film already will react to your humming in two ways:

1. Start laughing and having a complete singalong with you for the rest of the day

2. Will be irritated at the very sight of you and start torturing you with a giant pile of chicken wings.
