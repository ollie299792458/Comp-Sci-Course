I bought "Land of women" because I'm collecting all movies with K-Stew. I normally do not watch this type of movie. After viewing it for the first time, I set it aside and played it again a few weeks later. The writing was excellent. The selection of actors was excellent. The story was excellent.
K-Stew gave a great performance. She is grossly under-appreciated as an actress. She has continued to grow in her craft and has shown an ability to play any role from sweetheart to vampire. She has certain mannerisms that some use to discredit her. Her mannerisms are in fact, to her credit. Many great actors displayed the same characteristics from film to film. Jackie Gleason, Bert Lancaster, Natalie Wood, Natalie Portman, Jodie Foster, Tom Cruise, John Wayne, Bratt Pit, to name a few, carry their personal mannerisms from film to film. Kristen Stewart is no different. She is just more consistent. One identifies instantly when watching any of the actors mentioned above, by their mannerisms. Of course, K-Stew is more beautiful than most. This DVD is definitely a Buy at a tiny price. Go for it.
