The Music Man with Robert Preston is a classic and a great one and Matthew Broderick had big shoes to fill. Perhaps he did not fill them adequately. The zest is there, he seems to be enthusiastic about the whole thing, and there are really some very fun moments, but he just does not seem to embody the part of Harold Hill very well.

That does not stop this from being a great remake and this is for one reason: Kristin Chenoweth. She is not Shirley Jones. She is better. There's no denying that the girl is talented. Her voice is amazing and beautiful, but it's more than that. The emotion, the heart and soul she pours into these songs is amazing. Her rendition of "Good Night, My Someone" may very well reduce you to tears. She plays the part of Marian almost effortlessly - you'll find yourself saying Shirley who?

Other hilights include a wonderful performance by Debra Monk who almost never disappoints and Victor Garber, who will grow on you.

I think of it just as highly as the Robert Preston version.
