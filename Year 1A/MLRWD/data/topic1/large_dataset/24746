Although I like the digital restoration treatment Lucas gave the film, I always felt that the extra CGI scenes are completely out of place with original movie. After seeing the direcotr's cut on DVD a little while back, I was dissatisified with it and went scouting the original copy and found it on VHS from here on Amazon. As I was watching it I realized that not only had Lucas added the additional CGI, but he also had dramtically re-edited a few important scenes or removing them altogether ( i.e., there's a scene just after THX and his mate LUH have just made love, THX enters a room of benches filled with people staring at him as he enters, he looks around feels uncomfortable and leaves, was almost completely taken out ). Although I'd never seen the original before seeing the director's cut, I could tell some things just didn't seem to fit in. Nowhere on the DVD commentary does Lucas and compoany mention that any changes where made at all, just that it was restored. I also read that Lucas doesn'y plan on releasing the original on DVD at all. I hope someday enough poeple's voices will be heard and get and it out on DVD.
