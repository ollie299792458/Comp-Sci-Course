I saw this movie for the first time last night and I instantly fell in love with it.  I sat there dumbfounded, wondering how the subject matter for nearly every scene could be so timely ... just as fresh, funny and creative over TWENTY YEARS after it was made!

  Right off the bat, the scene in the fish tank had me cracking up within the first two lines "Good Morning ... Good Morning ..."  And then it just kept getting better and better.

  The social commentary still stands on its own, being just as hilarious, insightful, and controversial as any of South Park's best episodes.  This is the in-your-face comic brilliance that has inspired the few people today who are still making good comedy.  In short: I was amazed from start to finish.  And the direction was nothing short of phenominal (especially in the extended Business Pirate scene on the special edition).  What vision!

  Well, I'd love to keep raving about how much I loved this movie, but I think instead I'm just going to go buy it and watch it again.
