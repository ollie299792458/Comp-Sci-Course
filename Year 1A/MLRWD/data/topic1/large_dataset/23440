Django is a masterpiece of the spaghetti western genre. It may be based on A Fistful of Dollars, but it has so much of its own unique style that it distances itself far enough away to avoid being a ripoff. Instead of battling weapon and liquor smugglers, our hero, Django, battles Mexican bandits and the KKK! That's right. All while dragging a coffin behind him, for reasons unknown to someone who's never seen the film.

I actually like this one way more than A Fistful of Dollars. Franco Nero as Django is just as awesome as Clint Eastwood in any of his "Dollars" roles. The music also spectacular and just as good as anything Morricone ever did. If you've ever even HEARD of this film, then you should just flat out order it RIGHT NOW.

By the way, this DVD presentation is excellent, and while a few frames are dirty, it's still the best way to see this film and doesn't hamper it at all. The DVD includes English and Italian language tracks. Please see it in Italian with English subs. It's meant to be watched that way. It makes the movie even more unique and stylish.
