Though this actually was entertaining and wasn't as watered down as I expected, you all know this will never top the original.  For one the original had top notch actors from top to bottom (It's amazing how they managed to squeeze Luis Guzman in this one being that he was in the original).  To all those wanting to know why they didn't spotlight Benny Blanco from the Bronx is because this is a PRE-QUEL.  Not a SEQUEL.  Big difference.

As you should know, in the original Carlito's Way, Benny Blanco was the new Kingfish on the block during Carlito's last couple years of serving time until he was released.  However, Blanco looked up to Carlito, admired him, and wanted to be like him until Carlito dissed him in public.  Being that this is a pre-quel and it's spotlighting Carlito's early years and how he gained his rise to power, Benny Blanco would have probably been in elementary or junior high school at best.  No need to waste film spotlighting that.  Now if they do a sequel, then yes, you would have to spotlight Benny.

Puffy being in this movie was a joke.  I could think of several real actors that could have easily took that role to another level.  But other than that, I loved the connection to the original and it was entertaining enough.

If you like British mob movies, Layer Cake is also a keeper.
