The Big Lebowski almost...almost...conquers Fargo for title of best Coen Brothers movie. Anyone who enjoys their work will find it very funny, and their humour is taken to surreal heights this time around. A lot of people  don't like this film, but let me tell you something. Compare this to any  other films of the 90s and it comes out as one of the best. People forget  that we are so inundated with absolutely banal cinema that once in a while,  when something good does come along, we miss out because we're too busy  watching rubbish like Armaggedon or Titanic. Script first, then film -  that's the way the Coens do it, and it always gets brilliant results. Any  scenes with the nihilists in this film are laugh out loud funny, and  Bridges is so apathetic it seems like he really is The Dude. Coen brothers  films are emminently quotable, and this one is no exception, along with a  series of setpieces that are marvellously mad - just watch the scene where  Goodman goes postal on a car. The dialogue is fresher than anything  Tarantino can do, the only other person able to reproduce the spoken  language so well being Elmore Leonard. Now there's a prospect - a Leonard  novel adapted by the Coens. We can hope. The interview on the disc is quite  interesting if only to see how the Coens hate being interviewed, moving  onto the subject of carpets instead of the actual film. Nice moving menus,  although they could have done with a bit of music, but DVD can take you to  all those brilliant scenes in the blink of an eye, so buy this liitle  beauty - you won't be dissapointed.
