I grew up watching these movies as kid.  I finally bought them on DVD to watch with my son but was disappointed with the lack of quality in both picture and sound.

When Amazon offered me a killer deal on BD (that was half of what I paid for the DVDS), I couldn't resist buying them again to share with my entire family.  Picture and sound was excellent in DTS.  It comes with a high quality hard bound fan book.  It was interesting, but not necessary.  The BD hubs attaching the BD in place to the book were a poor excuse for packaging.  I had to twist the BD back and forth and work it off the hub, hoping I wasn't going to break it in the process.  Once I got them off, I put them in standard size cases, never to go back in the fancy case again.  Also, what am I going to do with this oversize box?  I have cabinets designed specifically for DVD/BD and this will fit nowhere.  I would have been much happier with all 5 movies in a standard size case.  As for the fancy packaging, I will probably store it somewhere in a file box with all the other useless fancy packaging I have been forced to accumulate over the years.  I would have just bought the newer standardized set, but it was twice as much.  Maybe I can sell the collector's box on ebay.

Note to the studio marketing department: I am buying movies, NOT extra junk to clutter up a storage shed.  I prefer good, solid, STANDARD packaging to this poor fancy pants marketing nightmare.  I want my discs to pop in and out in a matter of seconds and go back on the shelf stored safely with its brothers without being an eyesore.  For some reason most "collections" have this same issue.  If it doesn't fit on the shelf like the others, it doesn't have room in my collection.
