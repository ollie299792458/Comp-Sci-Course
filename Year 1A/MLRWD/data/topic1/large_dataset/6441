I wasn't quite sure what was going in the opening, yet I had a feeling what was coming. After that scene, it didn't take long for me to soon get wrapped up in each of the three New York police officers' (Cheadle, Hawke, Gere) lives. I was actually surprised it wasn't until the end that they came together at the same location, each of them with different motives for being there. Brooklyn's Finest is somewhat like three movies in one, flipping back and forth between characters' story lines.

Gere's character probably could have been removed without the movie skipping a beat, but I found myself rooting for him. He just wanted to retire and get through his last week on the job, yet stuff kept falling into his lap. Wesley Snipes stole it for me despite his small role, though. I would have liked to have seen more of him. Cheadle and Snipes as notorious figures in the drug business is a great pair. Hawke is pretty good as a crazy cop under desperation to support his family.

Most of the deleted scenes would have been cool in the movie, so definitely watch them. Also, one particular deleted scene with Gere fishing offers some closure.
