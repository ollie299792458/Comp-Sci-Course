Branagh's 'Hamlet' is the best among contemporary film versions. By producing the play unedited, with a brilliant cast of actors, Branagh presents the text with a clarity other directors often stifle, seemingly in attempts to somehow 'out do' Mr Shakespeare. But Branagh respects and understands the need for the entire play to evolve as it was written. His bravery in producing the full text reveals it is truly a flawless piece of writing that should not be edited for the sake of reducing its length. Edited versions do not have the same power or clarity. The relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia particularly, Hamlet's sense of humour, the fragility of his psyche and his intelligence are brought to life with renewed vigour - fully justified. If you love well produced and performed Shakespeare or if you are a teacher seeking a clear version of the play for young English text students and/or university students this film version cannot be beaten. I am grateful AMAZON stocks this DVD because for some reason, it is unavailable for hire in Australia. I've seen it many times but I decided to buy it for my DVD library. I will cherish it among my collection of favourite films.
