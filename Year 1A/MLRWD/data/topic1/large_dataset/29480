Obviously there are many reviews for this film -- I don't want to take up too much space - just want to say that this film demonstrated to me that Branagh is a true talent. Henry V and Hamlet are both failures in my opinion -- although both have wonderful aspects, Branagh overacts severely... however his ranting and raving work well in this fine rendition. Emma Thompson is absolutely wonderful as his foil. Denzel is quite good as well. The actress who plays Hero is beautiful, and acts reasonably well. The actor who plays Claudio is utterly forgettable -- he would do well playing the part of a woman. But the worst is Keanu Reeves. I can only guess that Branagh chose him to attract young girls to this movie, otherwise it makes no sense... he is such a sorry actor -- I earnestly believe that many people who have NEVER acted in their lives could do at least as well as Keanu in this role if not better. His performance is an embarassment, and he should leave the profession and do something more suitable to whatever talents he does have (except Bill and Ted's, he was great in that.) But I digress. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful film -- restored my faith in Branagh. He should do more light roles like this and stay away from Hamlet &amp;c.
