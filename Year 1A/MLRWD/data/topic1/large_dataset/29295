It's amazing how many people have seen this film even though it was never a critcal success at the box office.  Ladyhawke boasts an outstanding cast (I believe this to be Rutger Hauer's 2nd best film next to Blade Runner)  and an excellent script with an original storyline that many should find  quite engaging.  The costumes are first rate and the sword fights are the  most effective I have seen in film to date (neither Excalibur nor the  insulting First Knight were ever as effective with their fight sequences;  it should never look like you're swinging tooth picks around; swords are  heavy and fighting with them is exhausting; the director obviously realized  this fact and utilized it effectively in the finale--excellent).  Yes, the  music score for this film makes you scratch your head.  Nevertheless, there  are a handful of effective emotional tracks that tug you in the right  direction (and a couple that make you cringe).  
Overall, a beautifully  shot film, high production quality, and an original story.  This is a  first-rate film that should please most.  This film never fails to impress  me.
