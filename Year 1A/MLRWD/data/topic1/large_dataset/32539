Director Tim Sullivan had the best of intentions making this one and we must give him credit for just finally going out there and doing it.  Dealing with a studio is simply too much red tape, which he felt lessened the previous film.  I disagree.  I enjoyed the heck out of "2001 Maniacs." Sure, it was low-budget, but it had style, gore and a sense of humor.

"Field of Screams" lacks the necessary budget, writing and direction to even come close to the first effort.  Yet, my biggest problem wasn't the uneven performances, the lackluster picture quality or haphazard writing.  It was the audio.  This has to be the worst film I've had to listen to in over a decade!

As for the plot, it probably helped to take the Southern folks on a field trip since recreating the town might have cost more money than they had.  The problem is that the soon-to-be-victims couldn't act, we couldn't give a crap about them and what they were given to do was so awful that I literally started multi-tasking on other things that needed attention around the living room.

Maybe some extra cash and a little studio interference would have helped this production.
