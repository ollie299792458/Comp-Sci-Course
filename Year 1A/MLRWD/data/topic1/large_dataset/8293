Much like the last installment, this movie has a couple big action sequences that may excite the small child within you followed by an hour and a half's worth of pandering, formulaic writing you'd have to actually be a small child to sit through without rolling your eyes. It's like they took the first Patlabor, added a couple of subplots from Star Trek, tacked on some insipid romance dreck and then threw in a re-creation of JFK's funeral just in case they'd still failed to evoke any semblance of emotion. This fails on more levels than I could even hope to count, and the already weak story's progressive disintegration into "techno-zombies are very slowly attacking the city!" is just painful to watch.

Shirow clearly had little to no involvement in either of these films, which is a shame because the original story (as he wrote it) was actually fairly interesting. All this is is a committee designed licensing agreement and you can pretty much shut it off after the first 8 minutes without fear of missing out on anything important. The packaging is nice at least.
