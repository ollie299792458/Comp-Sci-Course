I've read a lot of these reviews and have yet to find one that aims directly at what I believe to be the central message of this film. This is a story not about a man choosing between someone who "infantilizes" him and someone who makes him feel like a man, nor between the safe girl and the wild girl, but rather of a man who is immature, irresponsible, and utterly selfish, yet cannot understand why he is unhappy. Everyone around him works tirelessly to pave a path of happiness for him, handing him career jobs, creative opportunities for his avocation, and beautiful women (yes, the "safe" brunette is in fact a beauty, even if not of the Paltrow level). Yet instead of appreciating any of that, he is ready to walk out on them in the cruelest way just to run off with the type of woman who would try to seduce a married man away from his family.

I don't want to give away the ending so I won't qualify why I am saying the following, but if you watch this well made film you will understand why I say: In the end it is left ambiguous whether he actually learns to take responsibility for his own happiness by learning to appreciate what he has, but I don't think there is any ambiguity about whether he learns to value the needs of the loving people around him. He seems pretty selfish to me from start to finish, a shameless opportunist. He's the kind of guy that in the absence of the brunette in the picture, goes on dating message boards to complain that hot women only go for rich men, the evil gold-diggers. Never mind these dowdy dudes' irrational expectations that their shallow attraction to such women would be met with anything other than equal shallowness.

If you'd like a truly convincing portrait of the source of much discontent in our society, this is a film to see.
