I liked the characters, their on-screen chemistry was so palpable that it got me thinking if they in their own lives wanted to change their courses by using free-will to be together and leave their own married partners. The storyline could've been beefed up more. I felt that when the main character was told that by not being with Elise, she wouldn't be a famous choreographer but instead would be teaching "6 year olds to dance"...is that really enough to say, "Okay, gosh, I really must leave her.  She's destined for a life of pain"...I would've point-blank asked her...What was more important to her, our love or her career.  I think we all know what the answer would've been and we would have saved about 7-10 minutes of the movie while he blows her off at the hospital, etc...Even with my quips about this, this movie inspires.  It inspires me to embrace my free will even more and make sure that everyone knows they can exert it to maneuver thru life experiences they want to change.
Hope you enjoy the movie!
