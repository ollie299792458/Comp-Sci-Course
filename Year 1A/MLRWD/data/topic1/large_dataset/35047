This gripping revenge thriller will keep you guessing from beginning to end and keep you talking long after it is over. With it's unusual style and it's extremely complex plot, Memento will take you for a mesmerizing ride that you will not soon forget. Leonard, possessing a rare brain disease that leaves him incapable of forming new memories, is on a constant search for the man who murdered his wife. Leonard's disease, however, makes this search for revenge seemingly impossible. He must assemble numerous clues for himself, some in the form of tattoos, others in the form of Polaroid pictures of people relating to his search. These clues leave Leonard with just a hint of who the people around him are and provide him with knowledge of the previous progress he has made. The viewer follows Leonard, without any awareness of who is pulling the strings, from the eventual finding of the suspected killer to the start of Leonard's escapade. This backwards telling of events leaves the viewer in a similar state to Leonard's, having no idea what has just previously happened and how or why the current situation is taking place.
 Memento is a great movie to own because it is one of those rare movies that you will want to watch over and over again. With it's intricate plot and changing perceptions of characters throughout, there is always some missed hidden detail waiting to be discovered. If you like thriller movies that will keep your mind stimulated while keeping you at the edge of your seat, you need to buy this movie. It is a masterpiece that must be seen.
