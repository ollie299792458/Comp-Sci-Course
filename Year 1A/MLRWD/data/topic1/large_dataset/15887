I can't believe I didn't see this movie earlier.  Until I saw it in a  magazine and asked a friend at work what it was I had no idea that a movie  of the quality existed.  I borrowed it and fell in love with it.  Only a  few movies have actually gotten me to feel for the characters and feel like  watching it again right after the first time.  I wasn't too sure about it  after reading who was in it; most movies with lots of big stars in them  make me feel like it was just something they made just to try and make some  money.  The whole thing kept my interest unlike most movies where I keep  looking at my watch.  Slater and Arquette made the perfect couple and when  they each killed for the first time I was reeling.  They both had such  different reasons for killing and pulled it off beautifully.  The R rating  is there for a reason, but the movie was not overly graphic like some of  the newer movies that feel that the more blood the better.  An absolute  must buy for anyone who likes to watch movies.
