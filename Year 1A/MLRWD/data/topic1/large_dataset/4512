This is easily the underrated gem of the Avengers tie-in movies, and in my humble opinion, the best of the five. Some call it the "Black Sheep" of the series, but I believe that this is a result of too many people comparing it to Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" (Also very good), wherein people see it as a failure to capture the same witty energy as Iron Man, rather than a success at doing something different. And in that area, it most certainly succeeds.

The Incredible Hulk manages to be a fantastic tribute to both the classic Hulk comics and the Bixby TV show, as well as a superb film on it's own. While it has a somewhat dark tone, I wouldn't call it gritty; more atmospheric and mysterious. And indeed, the first fifteen minutes capture this well, along with being a stellar example of visual storytelling. The soundtrack from Craig Armstrong is also very well-placed, alternating between bombastic and powerful for the action scenes, and engrossing and mood-setting for the calmer, more emotional scenes. The action is admittedly limited in scope, but bery visceral and brutal, and since I can't gush enough abotu Armstrong's score, I'll say again that it suits the action very well.

I had never heard of Louis Letterier' before this film, and I still haven't seen any of his work since, but he directs this film masterfully, giving the actors just enough room to emote while still keeping the film's story in sight, and also giving us a fantastic sense of scope. The main cast are all very well-placed, with Norton doing a spectacular job portraying both a brilliant scientist and a tortured soul, William Hurt seeming as determined as the Captain-Ahab-type-character he is, without overdoing it, Tim Roth making a convincing villain, and Liv Tyler makes a good love interest, though I wish she had a little more room to act in the film: mostly she just reassures Bruce a lot and yells at her dad. But oh well, she's still damn-well-cast.

All-in-all, definately worth a watch.
