This is a great movie. Yes, it's meant to be a chick flick, but this film has such a high level of truth and reality, it can be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to watch it. It follows the story of young Nicole, a troubled teenager who has all the money in the world, but naturally, that can't buy happiness and Nicole certainly doesn't have much of that in her life. Her mother died when she was little and her father is very kind, but the woman he is marrying does not like Nicole and is urging her soon to be husband to "cut her loose." Nicole is a party girl; she has many emotional problems and is always getting into trouble. She's heading down a bad path, and gets herself in with bad people. Then she meets Carlos, and things change. Carlos is down-to-earth, hard-working, and determined to make something of himself. At a glance, it seems like he and Nicole are way too different to have a relationship with each other, but that's not true. There's something about Nicole that attracts Carlos, and they begin a close bond. Then Nicole's father gets involved, trouble erupts, and a dark cloud threatens to plunge Nicole back into the darkness she experienced before she met Carlos. But love definitely finds its way through the hard stuff in this satisfying film on trust and forgiveness. Kirsten Dunst plays her role as Nicole with obvious strength and ability. We're used to seeing Dunst with the long blonde hair and the movie roles where she portrays a sweet and generally good teenager. Her performance in "Crazy/Beautiful" proves that she can take any role and pull it off beautifully. It shows what a great actress she is. Jay Hernandez also performs extremely well as Carlos. Yes, this movie is very dramatic all the way through, but it's a good one. I'd definitely recommend it.
