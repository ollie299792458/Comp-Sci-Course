Without a doubt, Elaine May is no technical stylist. At first, this plainspoken directing style may feel a bit clunky. But the story does build cumulative force. By the time Matthau's character meets May's, things really take off.

It would be very interesting to see the additional ninety minutes that were cut without her approval. That being said, it feels just the right length as it now exists. It's hard to imagine the missing blackmail footage as being anything else than too much of a good thing. If the content of the movie is being altered, then one should side with the director. However, if the movie is excessively long, then in at least some cases the studio or producer may be in the right.

Outside of the too conventional ending, the movie does feel like it's completely her own. It has an uncommon rigour that avoids for the most part the usual commercial formula. No teary eyed close ups or treacly moralizing here. The suits may have chopped the movie, but the soul remains wholely intact.

It would be no exaggeration to say that this compares favorably with The Front Page, His Girl Friday, All About Eve, or the best from Preston Sturges.

 One of the rarest of things, a Hollywood film where the human element trumps the technical side.
