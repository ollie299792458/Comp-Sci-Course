I just received my Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray and have to say that I am overwhelmed by the extraordinary extras and stellar packaging.  Warner Bros. has both my respect and gratitude for delivering a box set that is truly special and clearly designed with die-hard Harry fans in mind.

The five films which comprise this set stand up beautifully on their own, filled with the same raw, fierce energy that has always served to set them apart from the standard cops-and-robbers flicks which preceded and followed Dirty Harry.  However, the addition of such unique swag as- reproductions of Warner Bros. Departmental memos and letters from studio brass and star Clint Eastwood, movie poster cards from all 5 films, detailed poster map chronicling the route of Harry's first adventure, replica badge/i.d. card, and hardback book- serves to push this Blu-ray box set to the front of the line in terms of quality, originality, and value.

If you are a Dirty Harry fan treat yourself to this spectacular box set.  You won't be disappointed!
