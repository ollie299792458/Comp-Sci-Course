Bruce Robinson's 1986 masterpiece still stands as fresh & as funny as it did 15 years ago. His classic dark comedy about two out of work actors in the late 60's, who decide to flee their paranoid surroundings & go on holiday by mistake. An absolutely flawless script met with perfect casting & forever memorable performances making it the modern film classic it deserves to be & not just your average cult movie fare. Richard E.Grant was always meant to be "Withnail" & Paul McGann nicely balances the pair, playing "I" & giving the story it's narration. Hilarious throughout & truly unforgettable. In 1996 a 10-year-edition "directors cut" was released & played on cable containing extended scenes & additional footage; Having seen this version, I hope that 'Criterion' includes it on their forthcoming release. The out-takes blend so well with the original footage. For the hardcore fans there should be the theatrical release version too. To finally arrive on DVD is indeed a great thing. Chin-chin!!!
