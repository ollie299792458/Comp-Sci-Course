Interesting as it is, Freddy's Dead, The Final Nightmare is about as "Final" as Friday The 13th; The Final Chapter was. The biggest complaint I always hear about this film is that it was supposed to be the last one because they killed Freddy, okay, and how many other times did they kill Freddy? I seem to remember him getting the slash, if you pardon the pun, in almost every one of these films in the series. Is the film bad? No, not really.
The origin parts really shine, contrary to some reviews here, and really give you a bit of a feel of what Kruegers childhood and subsequent adulthood was like when he was killing children. It gets a bit on the brutal side at times as the story telling here is actually quite serious, unlike most of the rest of the film which is one campy scene after another. Anyone though that can't tell that this was how the film was supposed to be presented really needs to go back and watch movies like Army Of Darkness and Cemetery Man to remember what the old tongue in cheek folms are like. Can they be bad and over the top, yup, and that's because they are supposed to be. What the movie is lacking in gore, it has some pretty funny parts and a well put together package. The 3D scenes are well put together, and the movie is just a good time, the way these were meant to be. Seriously, if you like the Emn Street movies, and for some reason you have lived under a rock and missed this one, I'd buy it and check it out. Horrow fan and not seen the Elm Street films? What's wrong with you? They are cheap and a good watch for sure, get off your butt and go get them already!
