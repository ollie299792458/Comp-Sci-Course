It wouldn't take anyone 5 minutes to realize "The Set Up" is not your normal boxing movie, and herein is part of its charm. Because there are no pretty boys, glamour girls , or even fabulously wealthy mob guys, the characterizations are that much more riveting. These third and fourth rate inhabitants of boxing's underbelly just fighting to survive are not that much different from us(or who we might have been), from washed out pug Stoker Thompson, thru his manager and trainer to his just attractive girlfriend and the underworld connected rival manager "Little Boy" and his sleazy girlfriend. 
The action is set in motion when Stoker's manager agrees to have Stoke take a dive for one of "Little Boy's" up and coming boxers and doesn't tell Thompson, believing him so washed up that he doesn't need to say anything at all to Stoker(found money that doesn't need to be split). This is the main theme of the movie, but on the way there are so many great characterizations from RKO's stable of nobodies(including the one with the most famous face whose name you can't remember, George Tobias) that build the suspense it would be hard to quit watching till the end. 
Best of all, the scenes on fight night are true american originals, from the contender who wins another fight, thru Steamboat Johnson's dreaming of becoming another "Rocky Manila", the fan that keeps feeding his face, and the crowd that wants to see someone's blood spilled and doesn't much care whose.As an added bonus, the scenes in the ring are as realistic as you can get. This isn't clever camera work; people really get hit.
As "noir" it's an entertaining evening; as an introduction to boxing it's time well spent.
