With the recent buzz about making the third movie, I had to check out the previous two. It helped that Amazon Instant Video offers it for free. And so I watched the two in order. To be honest, I stopped several times over a course of about two weeks before I finished the first movie, Before Sunrise. The premise was good and their meeting was simple enough, but then it just dragged on and on as the two exchanged barbs on one topic and then the next. I understand it was their labored way of getting close to its climactic conclusion, but I didn't enjoy the process.

And so I was hesitant to watch the second one. I read some reviews to see what others thought (I didn't want to waste 2 hours of my time), and with good reviews, I jumped in.

Excellent movie. Rather than a whole 1/2 day to spend together, the two were given 1-2 hours. That sped up the whole process to my liking. In the process, they sucked me into their pains and found me rooting for them to get together (even though the guy is already married!) Yikes! Enjoyed the ride...but hated the ending. Give us 10 more minutes!
