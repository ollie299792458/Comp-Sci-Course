This use to go on channel 11 wpix all the time pre 94 when t.v was good and actually entertaining  before they censored fun movies to brainwash youth and show constant sex on t.v what was more likely, you unlocking a gate to hell with a heavy metal album and killing demons or you haveing sex getting your girlfriend pregnant and getting an aborition which is real murder well anyways it was about glen and terry two friends glen being the quiet type and terry being the metalhead(check for venom and killer dwarfs back patches on his jackets) they find a hole in the backyard which omits evil and terry listens to his sacrifyx album his dad got from europe (probably blended the bands sacrifice and crucifyx together) and finds out the hole is a gateway to hell and can be closed by playing the record backwards and reciting the subliminal message to the hole and the booklet inside of this mysterious bands album (the band sacrifyx which died in a mysterious plane crash)tells them the whole story about the demons and how to fight them well the parents leave the kids home  and the gate opens find out what happens???muhahaha i also recomend the lost boys,creepshow 1 and 2,tales from the darkside the movie,night of the creeps,trick or treat,critters 1,night of the demons,phantasm(the best horror movie of all time)ghoulies,spookies(1987)invaders from mars(80's movie)hellnight besides the freddy,jason,micheal myers,leatherface,evildead,return of the living dead the exorcist and the other ususal faces in horror so before t.v turned to brainwash and was fun this movie was on  this is something to enjoy with your kids if you have them or if you are in your 20's like me to enjoy with your friends and look back at memories especially if your a true metal fan a movie from my youth  since i was 6 is about right that i will never forget check this out at all costs the special effects are great before they used that cheesy computer simulations crap when they used makeup and props check out the man in the wall rated pg-13 and rules gate 2 was o.k more of a love story type but that should be check out as well God Bless it's time for t.v to be entertaining again if your from a movie station play this movie
