We should all be sad as humans that this type of movie gets made, that people praise the brutality of the images they see, and that so many people take pleasure in seeing death and brutality on film. I understand that in an open society things "get in" that maybe should not get in, but I feel as though films such as these that nearly glorify violence and brutality are pusing the boundaries, and in a bad way!
I mean really, what is the point of making a film such as this, other than to make money and shock value? There is no redeeming value to this movie. None. Are we supposed to realize the brutality that can exist within the human mind? We don't need to see a film such as this to know that. Just watch the nightly news for that! Or read a history book - history is full of human brutality.
This film was a big disappointment as I have seen Abre los Ojos (also by this director) and thought it to be brilliant. And Abre los Ojos set the stage for Vanilla Sky (by Cameron Crowe), a fantastic film. Too bad Amenabar has to tarnish his resume with this one!
