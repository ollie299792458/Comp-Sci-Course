Let me start out by saying that "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is one of my ,all time,favorite sci-fi/horror flicks.But my love of this movie will not color my editorial.On the down side,let me say that,this is an absolute "bare bones" edition of the film.I think a movie of this historical importance should have been released with tons of extras.This movie begs it and unfortunately they will probably release the "collectors edition" sometime next year,so that all of us "true believers" will be forced to purchase that edition as well.  Now on the plus size...This is one of,if not the best,blu ray copies I have ever seen.Considering the age of this film and the fact that it is in black and white it's absolutely extraordinary.You can see EVERYTHING! It's like seeing the movie for the first time all over again.This is the reason I collect blu ray...the picture quality!It was essential that they finally released this seminal flick just like this.So buy this and enjoy endless watchings of this marvelous,looking classic,until they release the collectors edition...and then buy that one as well.Now when the hell are they going to release "The Thing" in similar fashion?Keep watching the skies.
