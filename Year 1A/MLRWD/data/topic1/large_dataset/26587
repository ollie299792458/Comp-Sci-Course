I must say that I loved the movie, but the movie was based on the novel so f the writer.  No the writer used a completley different plot, same main characters yes.  The book didn't even metioned fisherman, so why changed the plot.  There are numerous reasons, writer of novel, Lois Duncan would not allow it, hell if you read the book you would already know who the killer is, and then the movie would've sucked terribly, f the sequel no way that was going to help it, so forget about the blockbuster movie award for young and beautiful Jennifer Love Hewitt, which was what a big help on what made her what she is today.  Reason why this movie is my favorite horror thriller because this isn't one of those big breasted chick flick horror films this is a what would you do horror flick.  Picture it, after you and your friends got totally drunked at some party and you hit a guy at the curve at night.  It wasn't a hit and run, they stopped the car exactly when they hit the guy, so which means they weren't that drunk, good choice.  They checked if the guy was alive, his face was all mest up, now just imagine if you showed that guy's face in the courtroom today, no jury would have take their case.  Why Willis would put them in the chair well he just killed his dead daughter's husband and then brutally got hit by a car what do you think.  There was no dumb scenes in the film like for instance the classic scream, a movie I own, the scene when the scream killer was in the grocery store dressed as the killer, if the 2 kids with masks got caught in school why not a grocery store.  I would recomenned anybody to watch I know what you did last summer and to read the book and ps. I heard on a triligy.
