If you want to know if you'll like this show read the first part of this review:

 Are you someone who likes drama shows? Particuarly crime drama  shows? If yes, continue on then.

 Are characters that are easy to fall in love with important to you? Are you a human that enjoys a good laugh? Do you cherish the sweet moments on television?And do you crave out-of-your-seat tension that will keep you up all night wondering what will happen in the next episode?

 If you said yes to all of these things, I guarantee that you will love this show!

 And here is my personal take on NCIS:

 I like crime dramas like CSI, Law and Order, JAG, and such. I also like thrillers like LOST. But I also like SpongeBob SquarePants.

 CSI is okay, but it doesn't really have the laughs that I like in a show.

 Law and Order is nice, but the relationships between the workers are too perfect.

 LOST is nice, but once again, no laughs, no 5+star ratings.

 NCIS has the wonderful combination of all of these show into one. It will leave you laughing, crying, or staying awake staring at the ceiling hating Dave Bellisaro.

 I won't go on about the characters, because there are about 6 reviews talking about them.

 I just wanted to give my take on this show. It is by far, my favorite show on the network.
