I, like so many other reviewers here, am a huge fan of Tim & Eric. I have spent hours online on both youtube and the advertisement-heavy adultswim websites watching probably every clip and every episode, some of them over and over again - and I've also busted a few ribs laughing hysterically at their insane sketches and fake ads. Some of their best work is in the phony product advertisement genre and I eagerly paid the $9.99 to see this movie, expecting to break my remaining ribs. I did not.

The plot was not the most clever, but it did hold up. The gags were not the most original, but there were many surprises. There were a couple laugh-out-loud moments, even a scream-out-loud moment when I had to watch a supposed real penis get pierced with a fish hook. But overall, it was not the transcendental seminal movie experience I had been hoping for, one in which the TV viewer is elevated to film premier attendee and one in which the actors and their material is brought to a higher level of entertainment. The cable access style film editing of the show seems to work better when the themes are short and to the point...not drawn out of 90 minutes of 35mm film like quality.

These guys are still funny and they show a lot of talent, but this movie fell flat. They certainly missed a lot of good opportunities to make a great movie with the billion or so dollars they were pretending to waste - but kudos on the two or three special effects.
