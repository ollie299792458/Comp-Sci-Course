The Dead Zone MOVIE by Stephen King
The Dead Zone opens by Jonny Smith whom is a teacher had a girlfriend, Sarah.  Johnny takes Sarah on a surprise date at a carnival and as they are riding the roller coaster, Johnny all of the sudden has an odd headache.  Johnny then takes Sarah home and they claim their love for one another as he drives off in a horrible rainstorm.  As he travels, while a truck jack-knives and as the truck and trailer separate leaving no injuries to the truck driver, Johnny hits the end of the tank.  Johnny lands himself in the E.R and then into a coma for several years and when we wakes up, Sarah has married and his parents break the news  to him about Sarah about his accident too.  Johnny has an assigned doctor in order to heal properly.  His doctor is a sort of therapist whom is also interested in Johnny's visions.  Since Johnny can see things as they happened to warn people of danger before it happens, his doctor takes detailed notes.
And he has to undergo a series of painful operations in order to regain use of his body. Meanwhile, he has started getting visions. He tells a nurse that her house is burning down. The media get a hold of the story, essentially ruining Johnny's life. And a Sheriff Bannerman from neighboring Castle Rock is getting desperate to solve the case of the "Castle Rock Strangler."  After that, Johnny becomes obsessed with a local politician by the name of Greg Stillson. Johnny has a certain vision of Stillson's future, and he then goes around asking his friends and family if they would kill Hitler (given a time machine or similar device to go back to the 1930s with full knowledge of the future).
In the last scene Johnny shows up at the big Political Outing to shoot Greg Stillson only to be shot and killed himself.  Greg is the one married to Sarah.  They also have a son whom is held by Sarah as the political outing is being filmed by media.
