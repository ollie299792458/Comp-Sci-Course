I am a huge Lebowski fan and watch the movie at least once every 2 weeks.  So, as you can imagine, I've been awaiting the release of this boxed set ever since it was announced.  Although I have not watched the new edition on the DVD yet, I'm sure that anything added to the old DVD is a plus and the new DVD is worth buying, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SET!!  Things included in the set:

- The new DVD that can be bought for 13.99 on Amazon.com

- 4 coasters.  These are the cheap cardboard coasters that are fine in bars all over the country that will probaly last for about 5 uses.

- A thin, cheap towel that can't in any way be used for bowling.  I was st least expecting that if I couldn't use the towel for bowling or the gym, that it would be a nice keepsake...not the case here.  It's cheap and about as thin as tissue paper.

- postcard-sized pictures.  What the heck am i going to do with these?!?!?!?!?!

Overall, not worth the 35 bucks, even for die hard Achievers like myself out there.
