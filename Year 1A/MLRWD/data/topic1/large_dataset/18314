I don't believe what I'm hearing from the other reviews. One question, are you saying that A ship that big can't hold five tons of animal? Must be a pretty weak ship.

Anyway, JP2 is as good if not better than the original JP. It has some incredible scares, such as when the compy's head poppes out through the bushes. Using the same if not better state-of-the-art computer effects that made the first one a huge success, JP2 is an incredible story of survival, and a lesson is to be learned about greed.

JP2 has some differences in the dinosaurs though. The raptors have evolved from a dull brown into a freekish red with yellowish stripes. T-rex is more bluish grey now than brown. But even the texters of the skin have more depth than in the original.

JP2 is a must-see must-own movie, and it doesn't get enough credit. It's story line is involved, and it's one of those movies you have to see several times in order to fully grasp its power. Spielberg has done it again!
