***Spoiler Alert!***
"The Beaver"

For anyone who struggles with depression `The Beaver' is a must see.  Mel Gibson's Walter is depression personified.  In fact, Walter is so desperately depressed that it almost seems this puppet takes Walter on as if the puppet, itself,  was alive.  Why should this be curious?  Well, the puppet talks, but Walter moves his lips - no ventriloquist tricks here.  The `Beaver' looks like a mangy, dirty puppet he found on the street, because that's where he found him. Still, I got caught up in the dialogue and the story.  Walter convinced me he was sad, and, interestingly enough, so did Gibson.  With so many marriages  on the fritz today, so many children caught up in the divorce wars, it was refreshing to watch this family love and hate each other toward some kind of heart human ending.

Jodi Foster directed and acted as Walter's `I can't take it anymore' wife.  What a beautiful woman.  She certainly got the best out of Gibson in the film.  Anton Yelchin was excellent as Walter's son who made a very long, very depressing list of what he had in common with his dad.  Afterwards, he worked on ventilating his room.  I enjoyed watching Jennifer Lawrence (of Winter's Bone) play such a different role.

While there were laugh-out-loud moments, this movie becomes very serious.  And, I must reiterate, for those of us who have suffered depression of significant duration, there may be an enduring poignance at the apex.  For what wouldn't one do to rid oneself of the very thing ...

This film is absolutely worth seeing.  Gibson shows us his skills as an actor.  That's what film is about.
