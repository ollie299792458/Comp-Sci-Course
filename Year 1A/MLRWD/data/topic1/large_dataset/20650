Released in 1976 based on William Goldman's bestseller of the same name, 'Marathon Man' was a greatly anticipated film and it worked brillantly on screen. Goldman seemed to take two elements that spook people, Nazi's and dentists, so fused them into one character, Dr. Szell. Dr. Szell played to the hilt by Laurence Oliver (who was ill at the time and was considered uninsurable) has come out of hiding in Uraguay to collect his war booty and crosses paths with Dustin Hoffman, a graduate student who's drawn into the situation by his brother who works for a shadow element of the government. It's a complicated story, as you would hope for in a thriller. A world class cast of actors, skillfully directed by John Schlesinger, makes for a great film one that can be viewed repeatedly, I saw it when it opened at the Loews in Times Square in 76 and I still can watch it...but must confess, I still close my eyes when Dr. Szell is torturing the Marathon Man. Ouchh! Goldman was so right, a Nazi dentist nothing could be more fiendish!
