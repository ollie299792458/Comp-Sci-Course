It's hard to pinpoint exactly where this show went wrong.  The cast is magnificent, and it's nice to see Mark Valley get his own show.  The plots of the individual episodes are nothing great, but they aren't bad either.  Typical fare really.  The biggest problem with the show is probably the characters.  They are just plain dull.  Only one character, the assassin seeking redemption, is in any way interesting.

I also have to take issue with the reviewers who comment it is a great adaptation of a comic book.  The comic book was about a man who took on the roles of the targets, disguising himself as them perfectly.  He did so so perfectly that he had begun to loose any sense of his own identity.  This thread is gone from the show, and the show is weaker for it.  Valley is simply a body guard, who doesn't tell people his real name.  The sense of being lost, of being consumed is gone.  And all the interesting acting opportunities that come with inhabiting different roles is absent.

Over all, not terrible, but still a big disappointment.
