X-Men is one of the top three best comic book adapted movies every made (Superman 1 &amp; Batman 1 being the other two). The movie is made in a way in which people who have never picked up the comic book before can relate. No bright color spandex. No over the top explanation of why they have the powers they do. You walk out thinking, "Yeah, I believe that's possible. Every actor plays his or her role to the "T". This is the perfect jump of movie for Hugh Jackman, who gives an excellent rendition of his comic book counter part Wolverine. Although Halle Berry performance as Storm was not as great as some would have hoped, (honestly due to a lack of lines and badly written at that) she does have the upcoming squeal to improve. I was glad to see that the director, Bryan Singer, did not overflow his cast of characters as some other comic book movies have done in the past. Although this movie could have been called Wolverine and the X-Men, most of the other characters are well represented. This movie proves that as long as you keep the essence of the character in tact, you still can have a successful movie that everyone will enjoy. I can't wait for the sequel. Sentinels anyone?
