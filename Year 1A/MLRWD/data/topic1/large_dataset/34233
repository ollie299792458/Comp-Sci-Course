This is seriously one of the most informational and motivating DVD I have ever seen! It does a great job of pointing out all the ways the doctors and pharmaceutical companies make a ton of money off of our ignorance and ambivalence. I love how Andrew W. Saul points out "Good health makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't make a lot of dollars."

If we just started eating right, taking the right vitamins and taking care of ourselves - we'd have significantly lower rates of diabetes, fibromyalgia, depression, and a ton of other illnesses!

After watching "Food Matters" and "A Beautiful Truth" - I bought a juicer and have been living a much healthier lifestyle! So far I have lost 18 lbs! Let's hope I can keep going!!! I encourage EVERYONE to watch this!

If you are skeptical about what nutritional and vitamin therapy can do for you - check out a site called ChrisBeatCancer.com and see the real-life story of a man who beat cancer with NO chemo!!!! It can be done!!!

I applaud the creators of this film for putting out this information! It has changed my life and I hope it will change yours as well  :)
