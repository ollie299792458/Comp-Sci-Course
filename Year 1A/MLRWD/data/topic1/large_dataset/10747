Is it just me, or does anyone else come to realize how tragic the character Burl Ives plays becomes.  I actually feel for him.  I think before one watches this movie, you have to develop an empathy for the time and lives these people led BEFORE this moment in their lives.  I views the movie again with my wife (Her first viewing) and realized that if this had been me, I would felt more of a liking for Hannasey than the Major.  He was a least a man of rough honor.  I think most are missing this in their reviews.  Ives character had a more character than all but McKay, and in a way they were more alike than one would suspect. The scene when he is preparing the dueling pistols is very poignant, where he gruffly dismisses McKays advice on how to prep the dueling pistols, that he had handled "flintlock and cap and ball" before McKay was even born, and chastises his son because he had never faced danger with "only one shot" between him and death, instead of a "fast draw" and and six shooter.  Think about this when viewing, and also when he crashes the engagement party.  This man had cajones!  I have known few men in life with this type of character, and I feel bad for people who never have been blessed by this type of association.  What a tribute to the American personality!
