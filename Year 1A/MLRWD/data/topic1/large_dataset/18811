The movie itself is a 5 star, the "no extras" brings the rating down for the dvd. It is fact that they taped at least another half hour to an hour of footage that is not going to make the dvd, which is sad. (they even messed up and put pictures from these scenes in the trading card set) If you can get passed that Get the DVD! 
Even if you are not familiar with the comic book, this is a female empowerment, "riot grrrl" movie. Tankie Fears NOTHING! If you like movies with female strong leads and a wacky sence of humor this is it! No tears for this one. This is like Boys on the side and Beaches for a younger minded audience without all that pesky death to veil your judgment. 
When I went to the movies I did not think Lori Petty could pull off Tank Girl, but it was a nice surprise to watch her. Petty Captured Tank Girl by the Bullocks! Naomi Watts as Jet Girl and Malcolm McDowell as Kesslee were great in it as well. Don't let the critics feed you a line of bull on this one. &lt;b&gt; INSTANT cult classic&lt;/B&gt; Just because there is no HUGE life lesson in this, it should not take away from this lighthearted movie. Sometimes all you want to do is press play and enjoy, not rattle your brain.  If you have the mentality to like the bands on the soundtrack (Bjork, Hole, Joan Jett, L7, Portishead, Stomp, etc.) you will LOVE this movie..... stop reading and go get it! 
 &lt;b&gt;PA-PA-PA-POW!&lt;/b&gt;
