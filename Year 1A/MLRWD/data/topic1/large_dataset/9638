This was the best low budget film that I have seen in years!  The story was incredible and it kept your attention from beginning to end.  While the setting is sometimes unrealistic the plot is very believable and sobering to say the least.
The movie goes to show that the threat of nuclear war is a very real modern possibility that has not died with the Cold War.  It takes the United States' most recent all out military engagement, The Persian Gulf War, and takes the scenario one step further with Sudam Hussein's son, now the dictator of Iraq, invading Kuwait once again.  The President of the United States, who has just come into power due to the death of the previous president, is faced with his first major international crisis during his election campaign. He is determined to react to the emergency quickly and with a show of ultimate force.
I will not reveal the ending; however, I will say that it is both unique and thought provoking.  This is a must see film that will really make you think.
