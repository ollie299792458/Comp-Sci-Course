Rarely does a Hollywood feature film effectively go behind the lens -- while at least a couple European films spring to mind:  Day for Night (Truffaut) and The State of Things (Wenders).  Altman's approach is different than those mentioned above by going through the Lens, AND into the lives of those behind the lens.

The multi-layered story line has been discussed elsewhere in these reviews.  What intrigued me was the commentary by director Robert Altman and screenwriter Michael Tolkin.  This juicy conversation illuminates how this movie satire came to "light" and why it flies below the conventional Hollywood radar that consistently underestimates the intelligence of critical cinema viewers.

My favorite line from the commentary was Altman's quip that he could have titled this piece anything -- and he had been toying with the idea of calling it "The Republican", saying that it exemplifies a class of people in which there exists an absence of guilt.  This viewpoint brings another layer of meaning to the closing scene, in which Griffin as the new studio head, peremptorily & prematurely pats his progeny.
