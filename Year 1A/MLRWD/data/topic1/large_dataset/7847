When I saw that they were rereleasing this film I preordered right away

for the dvd.  Than I looked for the cd soundtrack and was amazed that they

didn't bother to make a cd for release at the same time.  What's the deal

with that.  Disney has some wonderfull old films like this one with the

only way to listen to the music is records. Who has a record player now a

days? Hardly anybody. And where can you find records? Only a few places

on the internet.  Stop redoing versions of current films adding one song

here or there to sell the cd and start preserving the magic that was

never released on cd, or indiviual cd.

I would love a cd with all these songs and only these songs.  I'm sure

I'm not alone in that. Now and than I still search hoping for the cd of

these songs, please make it available so one day I can enjoy the thrill of

victory in finding it after a long search with no results.
