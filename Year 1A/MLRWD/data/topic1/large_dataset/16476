I'm a pretty big Broken Lizard fan. I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00193F30E">Super Troopers [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYFXW">Beerfest (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>], and I'd even defend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7TMY">Club Dread (Unrated Extended Edition)</a>. Slammin' Salmon, however, doesn't really come close to any of those. The premise here is that the Broken Lizard troupe, along with a few token females, work as servers at a restaurant under the direction of Michael Clarke Duncan's character, a none-too-bright former boxer named Cleon Salmon. Salmon ends up owing a bunch of money to the Yakuza, and the servers are given one night to raise the money he requires. The premise isn't so great, but the other Broken Lizard movies aren't exactly known for their brilliant plots, either. However, whereas the other BL movies are (IMO) well-written comedies, this one relies mostly on hackneyed gags (if I never see another movie where an engagement ring travels through someone or something's intestinal tract, it'll be too soon), and much of the timing seems off.

The best element of The Slammin' Salmon, and the one that most consistently brings the funny, is Michael Clarke Duncan. His blissfully punchdrunk Salmon is the main reason why this movie is worth watching. If you like the other Broken Lizard movies, I'd say this one is a solid rental. I'm going to give this one another try, mostly because it took me a couple of viewings to like Club Dread.
