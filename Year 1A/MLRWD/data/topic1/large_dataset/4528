I was reluctant to buy this movie at first, having read only one review of it, which was positive. It has a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the movie description didn't tell me enough.

I was glad I bought it, and watched it, for it is one of the finest William Holden performances I've seen, and it is one of the most suspenseful movies, war or otherwise, I have seen.

This is not a standard war movie; it is not filled with combat, tanks, and glorious battle scenes. Instead, it is a compelling espionage yarn that is based on true events. At times the suspense is unbearable as William Holden's charcter faces capture by the German gestapo time and again. The ending is truly satisfying and inspiring.

While the movie starts a little slow, it gears up and grabs you by the throat, heart, and the pit of your stomach. The standard war movie romance is not standard after all, as you will find out. All the actors are wonderful, but William Holden stands out.  I understand at the time he made this movie he had not had a hit in some time. He redeems himself marvelously in this film. His character is multi-layered and wholly human, at first self-serving, then later serving the greater cause.

A combination spy/war thriller, you will find yourself rivited to the screen and the over two hour run time will fly by. I'm keeping my copy for future viewings, and sharing with my friends and family. You will not be disappointed.
