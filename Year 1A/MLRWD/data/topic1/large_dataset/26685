The previews of the movie explain what the movie is about so i will only give a very brief summary of what it is. Peter (Bettany) has been around in tennis for years and this is his final tournament in Wimbledon. Throughout his career he has been quickly losing the spotlight. Then he meets Lizzie (Dunst) and then things start to get better for him in love and in the game.

The movie has the typical humor of a typical recent British born comedy like Notting Hill and Love Actually. Meaning that there are its fair display of British mannerisms that Hugh Grant displays (which to me is a plus). The relationship that the 2 characters share is very cute that they share a common bond of esp(?). They have like this spiritual connection that helps them succeed and fail, but it's as if they are soulmates from the start after their coincidental(?) meeting at the beginning.

It is a cute and enjoyable movie. For those that not other reasons to watch the film, the sports choreography is pretty well put together. So, for those that like tennis, romantic comedies, the actors, and British comedy; check out Wimbledon.
