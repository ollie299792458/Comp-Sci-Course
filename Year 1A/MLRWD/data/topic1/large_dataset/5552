Any reviewer upon this page who finds this movie confronting the ideas of suicide, family, death, addiction, denial, and obsession for "younger viewers" should be instantly dismissed.  Furthermore, any reviewer who claims that this movie doesn't have depth should also be dismissed on the grounds that no, this movie isn't a classic Hollywood film with a little moral at the end that punches you in the face.  This work doesn't pander to the masses.  The poignancy expounded is an incredibly subdued genius that takes actual reflection and thought to uncover.  As for the comedic elements of the story, well, I suppose that relies on taste. It's not slapstick, or dumb humor, or shock humor. It's dark, often absurd, and most of the time underplayed.  However, if you like that kind of comedy (my friends and I laughed through the entire two hours) then this film is hilarious.  Gene Hackman's performance is amazing, as is the performance of all of the other characters.  The directing was unbelievable with long, beautiful shots, as well as quick cuts and snappy camera movement.  The movie flowed all the way through, set up tension right at the beginning, allowed the audience to watch the problems get flushed out as the story progressed, and they did not conclude until the end.  By that simple standard this movie cannot be considered boring at any point.  Also, you can't look at this movie as a plot driven piece.  It's a film about the characters in which there is great depth of plot.  The characters are all so eccentric and such individuals it's hard to not just sit there and admire them for the entire film.  Anyway, if you haven't gathered my opinion of the film yet from this review, I would definitely consider this movie for the best film of the year and a must see for anyone whose willing to depart from Hollywood dramas, give a movie some thought, and embrace the Tenenbaums.
