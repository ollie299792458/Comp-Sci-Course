My six year old son and I are writing our first movie review together.  We were both so impressed with this movie that we felt we had to let the rest of the world know how fantastic it was.  First my son's review: "I would like to buy it because it is cool and exciting and adventurous.  I do not want to return it to the library.  I want to watch it 6,100 more times.  My favorite part was at the end when Peter and Hook were fighting."  From an adult perspective this movie was visually stunning and well written and acted.  When it is so hard to find a movie that the whole family cannot only watch, but enjoy, this movie completely surprised and delighted me.  I hadn't heard of this version before, my kids were too young when it first came out I guess. I checked reviews after watching and found it didn't go over well with some critics.  I think you have to have a part of your inner child still alive and kicking to really get this much darker, realistic, film as compared to the Disney version.  Overall it was a far more rewarding movie in my opinion (and my son enjoyed it more too).  I think my son will win and we will order this movie on DVD to enjoy many more times.
