The film is slightly different from the book; but the feeling of the movie seems almost more authentic than the book.  The setting of the times was extremely successful; nothing felt 'cute' or 'designery' about the sets and tangibles of the depression and post depression era.  All of the actors brought their characters alive - and the horse is fantastic!

The racing sequences are quite exciting, except for close-ups of the jockeys (movie jockey's not the actual ones) and the wierd, rocking horse mounts.  But they were correct in putting in the actual footage of the races, because then you know this was a real occurrence, and not that long ago in history.

The story is also told from a popular psychology point of view: a runty, wierd looking little race horse, Seabiscuit, who was down on his luck at the time he was taken in and trained to be a champion (that he really always was deep down) like millions of Americans in the depression era- he came to represent the hopes and aspirations of many Americans who identified with him.

It's an upbeat story; ending well.  Unlike the book, which is also good, but in the book we learn how everyone really ends up which was not as fortunate as Seabiscuit.
