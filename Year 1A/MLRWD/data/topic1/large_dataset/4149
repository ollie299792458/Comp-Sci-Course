THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. I AM GLAD THIS MOVIE WAS MADE BECAUSE THIS IS ACTUALLITY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THIS AND GO THROUGH THIS ALL OF THE TIME. PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE THEIR PARENTS AND MISTREAT THEM AND SOME BI-RACIAL PEOPLE WHO ARE MIXED WITH N.... ARE ASHAMED OF IT AND DON'T WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW OR AFRAID OF WHAT THE NEXT PERSON IS GOING TO THINK AND SOME BI-RACIAL CHILDREN ARE ASHAMED OF WHO THERE PARENTS ARE. ALL OF THEM AREN'T LIKE THAT BUT SOME ARE I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE IT CAN SHOW YOU THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE YOURSELF AND YOUR PARENTS NO MATTER THE COLOR OR THE SOCIAL CLASS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OR SAY ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE DIFFERENT. BUT THIS MOVIE SHOWED THE EFFECT ON SARAH JANE AT THE END SHE REALIZED THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TREATED HER MOTHER SO BADLY AND DIDN'T TELL HER MOM THAT SHE LOVED HER UNTIL SHE WAS IN HER CASKET. SHE WAS ASHAMED BECAUSE HER MOTHER WAS BLACK AND TRIED TO PASS HERSELF AS BEING WHITE I CAN UNDERSTAND IT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR BLACK PEOPLE. BUT THE WAY SHE TREATED HER MOTHER WAS TERRIBLE. BUT, HER MOTHER WAS STILL LOVED (LANA TURNER) HER BOSS LOVED HER VERY MUCH AND LOOKED AFTER HER. HER MOTHER WAS JUANITA MOORE A LEGENDARY BLACK ACTRESS WHO DID A FINE JOB AS WELL. MAHALIA JACKSON HAD SUNG AT THE FUNERAL. EVERYTIME I WOULD SEE THIS MOVIE I ALWAYS CRY LIKE I HAD JUST LEFT A FUNERAL. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FILM IT VERY DRAMATIC AND TOUCHING AND GOOD LESSON THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM.
