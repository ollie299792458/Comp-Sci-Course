I'm not big on writing reviews, because most of the time I just can't be bothered. After seeing this outstanding DVD, I just had to step up to the plate and tell all the blues loving people out there to buy this DVD. Being a blues lover for over 30 years, I've collected a generous amount of blues cd's, but never anything like this. I mean, to see Sonny Boy Williamson, Lonnie Johnson, Willie Dixon, Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, ect. on stage doing complete preformances, well , I still can't believe it. This certainly has to be the holy grail of blues music. I just can't believe that all there years, these videos are surfacing for the first time. Leave it to the Europeans, to capture all the glory of there shows. Here in the states, these blues giants were treated like second citizens, but in Europe, the red carpet was rolled out and they were treated like heros.
  The video production of this DVD is very good, considering it was the early 60's. It's all in black and white which was just fine for me. The music on the other hand, was just something I thought I would never see in my lifetime. And to double your pleasure, you have to also get Vol. 2, which also must be seen to believe. I just can't help to wonder,if these two videos are just comming to light, how many more are out there, waiting to be restored. There must be more, but for now these will do just fine.
  Please do yourself a big favor. If you're a lover of classic blues, run, don't walk to your nearess video store and buy these DVD's.
