I'll begin with:  Yes, this movie does load quite slowly compared to other movies.

However, once you see how crisp and clear the picture is, the load times are a minor inconvenience.  There are some movies that just had really bad transfers to blu-ray, this movie definitely is not one of them.  I can't even begin to explain how beautiful the launch sequence is.

There are a lot of reviews here saying the disc doesn't work.  I'm not sure what's up with that, my blu-ray player plays it perfectly fine, and no, there has never been nor is there currently a firmware update for my player.  Toshiba BDX-2000, nothing high end in the least bit.  My player has NO internet connection to it.  Those here saying you need to have an internet connection to play this disc are ignorantly wrong.  Leads me to believe that there was a bad batch of discs and that those having issues just have bad discs that need to be exchanged.  I've seen it happen many times before for DVDs and I see no reason why it can't happen on blu-ray as well.

If you're hesitant to purchase this, don't be.  Give it a try.  This is an amazing movie made only better by blu-ray.
