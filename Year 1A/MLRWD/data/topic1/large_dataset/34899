I own everything of Wayne Dyer - all his books and what I don't have on books I have in audio format.  I got this movie from a friend; while the movie is very well done.  I am left once again.. in the dark about this "mystery force".  Sit back and just "let it happen" doesn't really make it for me. If that were the case to activate this mysterious force all the people out of work would be happy & successful. Considering that is not true I feel the movie lacks content. Instead of discovering this "force" through hints, gestures, facial expressions, and clues.. how about just say "how it's done".  This movie is a spiritual journey; however Wayne had almost 2 hours to finally just say how to acquire this "force" outright; instead he used soft tones, his own gentleness and clue type direction to guide this movie into a drama-feel good movie.

Wayne talks about the ego being in control and in this movie there is a lot of him saying:  "I", "Me", and "My".  Isn't that the ego Wayne?  It easy to come from a spiritual path when all your finances have been met.  Here is a challenge for you... Wayne give all your money away, all of it, keep about $5k and then how would your spiritual path be then when money became a worry?

I gave the movie 2 stars only because the movie - feel good movie as it were is done very well.  If you are looking for answers to make "the shift"; keep searching.  Reminds me of the pharmaceutical companies.. we don't want to cure you, we want you to keep wanting more to make us rich.

God Bless
