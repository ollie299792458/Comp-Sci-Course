"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.. . "

Akeelah and the Bee wraps its mind around such deep concepts as success, and goal-setting.  Not to mention all the big words.

It probably single-handedly boosted National spelling bee attendance.  It was that powerful.

Keke Palmer's performance was palpable; you could feel what it was to be in her shoes.  Scared of rejection, or worse, she downplayed her intelligence.  Her mother, portrayed by Angela Bassett,  couldn't see it, because Akeelah was always getting in trouble, plus mama had other things on her mind.  Akeelah seemed to get lost in the shuffle, until she was forced to participate in a school spelling bee to avoid suspension.  Her performance there caught the principal's attention, and he brought in Lawrence Fishburne's Dr. Larabee, a former champion speller himself.

The cool thing about this movie was that it didn't play up a whole natural ability angle on spelling, or intellectual giftedness.  It gave credit where it was due--in hard work.  Akeelah's biggest competition worked harder than them all; it was not left up to talent.  That, and admitting that success was the ultimate goal is what made this movie soar.

It was beautiful to see a story unfold with real characters, and not weighed down with sex or eroticism.  That would have been inappropriate.  This was a movie the whole family could enjoy together, and actually learn something--besides how to spell antidisestablishmentarianism.  And that's why it's one of 7 happiest black movies of all time.
