I saw a screening of this movie and as much as I expected to be non-plussed at best, it was amazing.  Like a cross between Memento and a dark It's A Wonderful Life, the movie plays with time, reality, and the greatest "What if?" that there's ever been.
Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, a college student who can relive gnarly past events and in doing so, change the present.  The outcome is always a surprising set of consequences.  I don't want to say too much about the movie because I sincerely believe this is one of those few movies where you shouldn't know too much.  While a number of movies have played with time travel (Terminator, Back to the Future, Etc...) this one does it with a gritty slickness that is truly different and very unpredictable.  
People will definately be surprised at Kutcher's performance and this movie is an inarguable breakthrough for him as a dramatic actor.  Amy Smart shows her dramatic chops as well, after doing comedic roles in Rat Race and Road Trip.  It's kind of a dream role, in that she gets to play four characters in one movie, each one multi-dimensional and vastly diverse from the previous ones.  I read that Eldon Henson, dropped and gained 30 pounds for his various roles as well.  I think it demonstrates the dedication that the actors put into the project and it certainly pays off on screen.
It's an incredibly thought provoking concept with all these cool set ups and payoffs along the way.  I was surprised by how violent it was at times, but it worked for the story and I'm not turned off by that kinda thing.  By far one of the best movies I've seen this year and deserves some sort of critical acclaim even though it comes out at a time of year when movies are for the most part forgotten. 
See this movie and you'll get your money's worth.  I'm probably going to have to see it again because, like films like The Sixth Sense, it should be even cooler the second time around when you know the secrets.
