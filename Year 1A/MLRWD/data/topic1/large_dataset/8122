Glass's opera, La Belle et la BÃªte, was composed to be listened to while watching the 1946 movie by Jean Cocteau, and everyone who likes the music of Phillip Glass should listen to it at least once that way.  I bought the CD when it came out and have listened to it many times.  It is a good sounding CD, but it is a CD, with the deficiencies that implies.  The Criterion DVD has a 5.1 surround mix of the recording but it also has DVD quality sound which is basically 5.1 channel mp3.  But now there is a Blu-ray version from Criterion with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround version and that soundtrack has much warmth, richness, and fullness that is lacking in other versions.  It is now the best way to listen to this music.  You don't have to watch the movie every time.  But you can turn on the picture long enough to select the Glass soundtrack and press start and then turn off the picture if you don't want it.

I highly recommend the Blu-ray version.  The sound is good enough that I am sure that the original master tapes must be recorded at something a bit higher in resolution than the 44.1/16 CD standard even if it wasn't recorded at 96/24.  Was it 96/24 originally?  I don't know, probably not; but many recordings were recorded at higher bit and sampling rates by 1994 when this music was originally recorded.

You can also watch the movie with the original soundtrack music by Georges Auric, in a high resolution uncompressed transfer of the original mono soundtrack, if you wish to see it as originally presented.  And the picture quality is excellent, probably the best it has been seen in 50 or 60 years.  If you like either the original movie or Phillip Glass, you can't go wrong with the Blu-ray, unless you don't have a Blu-ray player, yet.
