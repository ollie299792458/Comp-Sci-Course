This is a pretty good film, although from a historical point of view it misses a few important points about the conflict in Algeria.

The director's intent was clearly to show how a good soldier (LTC Raspeguy) becomes compromised in his efforts to stop a terror war in the French colony. The more dangerous and extreme the actions of the terrorists the more Raspeguy looks the other way when his soldiers take extreme steps in response. A man of physical courage, Raspeguy fails to invoke moral courage in himself and his soldiers.

A few minor technical issues, such as the matchbox bombs used in the film. There is no way such a small device could be as destructive as they are portrayed in the film, but it is an important plot point.

Anthony Quinn is as good as ever in this film, although I think the role could have been expanded to take better advantage of his acting skills.

Be sure to look for "Cato" at the beginning of the film. I also had my doubts about him...
