I won't waste space repeating what respected students of cinema, critics, and film fans have already said, and said much better than I can.  This is simply a remarkable movie--haunting, funny, sad, boisterous, bigger-than-life.  Whenever I watch the scenes of Welles portraying Kane as a young man, running the Enquirer, I get a lump in my throat:  so young and vibrant, totally unconcerned with the conventional wisdom about how movies should be made.  The twinkle in his eyes is his wink at the viewer; he's a magician (Welles literally was) letting you know that you're watching an illusion, and he's almost--but not quite--letting you in on the secret.  The secret, of course, is that all really good magic is mostly stagecraft and patter, and Citizen Kane is almost nothing but stagecraft and patter.  I think that's the secret of its ongoing appeal for me.  I like the fact that you can see some of the behind-the-scenes gizmos that make the trick work, and that it's still astonishing when you see the trick unfold.

The commentary by Roger Ebert for the 2-DVD set is terrific, by the way, despite a few small gaffs (e.g., Kane's friend is Jed Leland, not Jeb).  Don't deny yourself the pleasure of seeing Orson Welles and Gregg Toland, his photographer, pull out all the stops.
