Please do not misunderstand me. This was by no means a bad movie, but it does not have a prominent Christian theme to it. I only watch and buy movies for my family that I believe edify us in Christ. This one, although not bad, misses the mark. Our main character is a Pastor who is having some unexplained loss of faith issues. He returns home and the movie goes into a Perry Mason mystery solving drama for about 90% of the movie. Then towards the end we see a restoration of the Pastor's faith somehow from solving the mystery and then they try to bring out a real weak Christian lesson from the previous drama that had unfolded (not even sure what that was).

I only tend to do reviews on movies that miss the mark, since the good ones alwasy have tons of good reviews already. Since this is the only line of movies I watch, I often find myself scraping the bottom of the barrel for material. My wife and I decided not to let our children watch this film as we felt we did not gain any value from it. I have been asked before for recommendations and I thought Grace Card was a gem and Marriage Retreat was really good the second time around. It had so many little things that I didn't pick up on the first time through. Whoever wrote it's script hid some really valuable relationship advice in it. Hope this helps you as you decide to buy or not to buy (:
