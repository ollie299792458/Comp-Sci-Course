Mulberry St. actually turns out to be a pretty decent film. I went into watching it with an open mind because some of the After Dark films turn out to be crap but with this one, you actually start hoping the characters will make it through, even though you are pretty sure that they won't.

The characters are all living in a run downed apartment building in N.Y. and there was no surprise to me that it did have rats anyway. An epidemic breaks out because rats start biting people around the city and all hell breaks loose. Certain people in the building get bit and then it's an allout race as to who can defend themselves and who can't. Check it out and watch the WHOLE film. Not once did I feel like I had to shut it off because it is THAT good and keeps you wondering throughout the whole film.

I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Great characters, good plot(even though we know this won't happen-Rat People), great suspense building and ok camera work(could've done a little better but not all that bad). Also, it had some good gore scenes(rat people eating other people) and some ok makeup work.

One of the good films in the series.
