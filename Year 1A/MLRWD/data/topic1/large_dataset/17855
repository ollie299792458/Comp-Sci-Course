This package is a worthy treatment of the 1964 film.  It is said to be the best of the sequels, and while I don't agree, I suspect it is only because I'm not a huge Mothra fan because the film itself is well done compared to the other sequels in the original Showa Series (i.e. the first 14 Godzilla sequels).

I enjoyed all the special features...except one.

I purchased the dvd from importcds through Amazon, and while I don't imagine it is their fault, the audio on the "film with commentary" special features isn't there.  The track simply doesn't exist.  Watching the film, or watching the film with commentary is identical.  There is no commentary.  I'm not sure if I got a bad disc or what, but it is a disappointment.

Now, I already own Godzilla Raids Again from Classic Media and it was perfect, so I guess I just got a goof up.  Not sure.  Anyway, if you appreciate Godzilla for what it is: A true horror/scifi classic (if you watch the original), or a series of campy, often poking fun at itself scifi fun films, then you will appreciate this movie.
