Another excellent masterpiece by the one an only Almodovar, this film is quite darker than his previous movies. However, the twisted plot is there  as always, as well as the unexpected ending and wonderful acting. Cecilia  Roth does a great performance as the dramatic Manuela, who loses her only  son to a car accident while chasing after the theater star "Huma  Rojo", played by Marisa Paredes, whose glamour and beauty make her  ideal for this role. However, the real star is Antonia San Juan, who  literally steals the show whenever she is on screen. Her character lightens  up the somewhat sad story with her witty remarks and "perverse"  naivete. Also Penelope Cruz makes a great performance of "Rosa",  a nun who gets pregnant by another prostitute who happens to also be the  father of Manuela's child. However, the fact of her wanting to travel to El  Salvador to help in the war is quite inaccurate, as the war in that country  has been over for ten years now, unless the story was supposed to take  place in the 80's but who knows, they never clarify that. Overall, it's a  great movie and a "must see", not suitable for the closed minded,  though.
