I am a fan of Mike Leigh films and ran out to get this one as soon as it came out on DVD.  Unfortunately, Secrets and Lies or Vera Drake it isn't!

While Leigh's other films feature downtrodden people living depressing existances, this movie's main character, Poppy, is so annoyingly happy and giggly all the time, it doesn't come off as real at all.  For example, when her bike gets stolen, she's smiling and carefree.  When her driving instructor berates her and is flying into a rage, gales of giggling ensue.  She treats everything as a joke and can't keep her mouth shut for a second without laughing through basically every line she has in the film.  It just feels forced and completely fake.

Sadly, the only believable characters I found were the boy Poppy taught that was being abused at home, and the unstable, raging driving instructor.  The few and far between dramatic bits were the only realistic moments in it.

I'm quite surprised of the accolades this movie received, and that Sally Hawkins received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress as well.  Mike Leigh's films are very loosely scripted and the actors are encouraged to improvise their scenes.  This is done ably in his other films by vetran actresses such as Brenda Blethyn and Imelda Staunton, but I just felt that it was too big of a responsibility for Sally Hawkins and she failed miserably.
