I first saw this on PBS and was spellbound by it.  It is simply everything you need to know about the American Civil War.  If you think history is dry and uninteresting, this film by Ken Burns will change your mind.  This is filled with comedy and pathos, courage and cowardice, and a balanced explanation that is fair to both sides of the conflict.

Burns used well-known actors to read the diaries and writings of both famous people (Grant, Lee, Lincoln) and average persons and soldiers.  It gives one a well-rounded view of both sides.  I am in awe of the writings of that time--the people had an incredibly, descriptive way of writing; a command of the English language that has sadly been lost in modern times.

Burns also used still photographs, panning across them, giving the audience the feel of watching an actual movie of the time.  That technique has since been adopted by other documentaries.

I've seen the series many times, and each time find something more.  If nothing else, see it for Shelby Foot--a writer/historian who speaks about Robert E. Lee, and others, like he personally knew them.  Fascinating from beginning to end!
