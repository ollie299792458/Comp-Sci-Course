The 1994 version of "Little Women" stars Winona Ryder in an  Oscar nominated performance.  This film also co-stars Susan Surandon,  Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, Claire Danes, and Kirstin Dunst.  The star  power alone in this film makes it worth watching!  This film is faithful to  the book "Little Women," by  Louisa May Alcott, which it is based  on.  I have seen "Little Women" dozens of times and I highly  recommend it, especially to families, children, and women of all ages.  Byrne and Bale are both romantic and unforgettible and the lasting love and  affection between the March sisters is endearing. The film takes place  during the Civil War, which the father is off fighting.  This leaves Marmee  to raise their four "little women," conservative Meg, impetuous  Jo, who longs to be a writer, fragile Beth, and romantic Amy, who desires  to be an artist and marry a wealthy man. Marmee guides them in generosity,  independence, virtue and romance.  The sisters share their most cherised  and painful memories growing up.  "Little Women" is a feel good  movie with heartfelt emotion and humor, well worth buying and watching  again and again.
