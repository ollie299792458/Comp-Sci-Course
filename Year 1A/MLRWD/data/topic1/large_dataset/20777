I bought "Saw III" because I needed to see it.  You have to understand, I am a large horror fan.  I am also a fan of TV shows like "Buffy", "Angel", "Dr. Who" and "True Blood".  Therefore, suffice to say I like serials.  That's why I had to have "Saw III".  And (unfortunately) "Saw IV". (Heck, I even wasted money on the latest "Indiana Jones" drivel.)

When the first "Saw" came out, I was captivated.  Great villain, lots of gore.  I loved the whole mythology.  And due to the cliff-hanger style ending, I bought in for "Saw II" as well.

And "Saw II" was fine.  Decent story line.  Interesting characters.  Good amount of gore.  Liked it.

Then we come to Saws "III and IV", which according to Wikipedia happen concurrently.  I liked "Saw III" for the gore.  And the plot had enough twists to keep me interested.  There is also the inclusion of the pretty doctor and a good finale which appears to wrap everything up.  Or does it?

I have to admit I only bought "Saw III" because of seeing and enjoying Saws "I and II".  But it is a fine film, if you like the series and want to see how everything turns out.

Then I went out and bought "Saw IV", and as far as I'm concerned that's where it has to stop.  Watch the first three films and you'll see why.  "Saw V"?  "Saw VI"?  Give me a break.  What's next...  Jigsaw comes back to life in outer space (a la Jason X)?  No thanks.  Moving on....
