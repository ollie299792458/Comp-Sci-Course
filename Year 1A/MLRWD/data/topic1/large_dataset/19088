I'm not a history buff, but I enjoy learning about historical events. I loved the movie "Thirteen Days," so I looked to see what other films Amazon recommended under this genre. I purchased "IKE" because of the great reviews. I couldn't finish watching the film because from the start, I had a difficult time understanding what the characters were talking about - I felt like I was thrown into the middle of heavy strategic planning and intense relationships among historical characters.  It took me a while to figure out who was who and where they were. But by the time I started figuring out the basic details, I realized that I was missing so much of the other important details and story lines; I was lost. I think I would have enjoyed the film more if I had done some detailed reading before-hand about the relationships that took place among the military figures leading up to D-Day. Again, I'm not a history buff so I don't know much about the details, but I was hoping this film could help me learn more. I would only recommend this film to those who have studied WWII and/or lived during that time.
