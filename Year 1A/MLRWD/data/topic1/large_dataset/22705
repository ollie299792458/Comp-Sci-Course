I gave this movie 1 star only because I couldn't give it none. I mean, when you talk about bad movies, you have to mention all-time classics Nightmare on Elmstreet 6, Jaws 4, and Jurassic Park 3. But this movie creates a whole new category of "bad movies".
The acting was so terrible and absurd that at times it was funny. Never-the-less, figuring there might actually be some entertaining combat scenes in this movie, I watched it through. Wrong. No note-worthy combat scenes. You'll find better fighting scenes on the numerous Chuck Norris movies, Jackie Chang movies, Mortal Combat, Highlander, and even Xena Warrior Princess.
This is the kind of movie that's so bad that you're embarassed to tell people you've watched it. Let's list its vices: no intelligible plot, other than madman plans for world-domination (yea, they haven't made movies about that before); acting was mediocre at best, terrible at worst; action scenes were boring; fight scenes were boring and ridiculous. So you know how stupid this movie was, there was actually one scene where Captain Crunch (sorry, I can't be bothered to remember the name of the insane evil warlord) pressed big bright red buttons -- that looked like the buttons on a game-console -- to detonate underwater mines.
This is a movie where someone should have pulled the plug before it got off the ground. I would be ashamed to have my name attached to this trash. Indeed, it was such a bad movie that I was embarassed to watch it -- and I was all by myself when I watched it.
This is the kind of movie where you actually feel like your IQ has been lowered after watching it. Don't waste your money buying the DVD for this junk. Instead, spend that same money buying a copy of a fighting game, like Tekken, or one more recent. You'll have a much better time.
