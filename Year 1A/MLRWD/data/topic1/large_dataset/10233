If you've seen and enjoyed the much more popular "Airplane" movies that made fun of the "Airport" series, this is the movie that got that brand of slapstick parody movie going.  It is not sophisticated humor of any sort. It is not even a movie with a storyline really, so much as it is a series of several skits.  Anyone who doesn't like puns must turn away now.  This movie is full of them.  While it is not a dirty movie per se, it is rated "R" and clearly not something you want your 9-year-old to see.  There is some nudity that makes fun of pornography.

An important consideration is the age of the movie:  If this were 1977, I'd give it the full five stars.  Much of the satire is based on the TV commercials, politics, styles and social trends of the day.  Anyone young enough to not remember them would have some trouble getting the full impact of the jokes.  As a result, I gave it only four stars because of their irrelevance to today.  If nothing else, watch it with someone who is 50 or so who can explain the background of some of the skits.
