... was only 'Dirty' for lawyers and people in (so-called) Justice Administration/business who would be the only loosers if they were some like him, using a new Miranda verse: You don't respect anybody rights, so you don't have any other right than to be put away now. Instead, you get law-enforcement busy with getting more money from the tax-payers (with fines for jay-walking or not using your safety-belt in your car), so they can afford the cost of useless trials, followed by expensive welfare for the custody of those who spend their lives taking lifes and/or property from the same tax-payers. Just compare the cost of one bullet versus the cost of gas/electricity chambers (yet, executions are much cheaper than 20 years in jail).  
Maybe more people should remember that the Polikally-Korrekt generating crap like Miranda's is the same PK presiding the McCarthy's courts, the Hays' code for movies, or, a bit more remote in History: the 'saint' Inquisition; but, at least, the Inquisition was not as perverted as the P.K., since they didn't require cops risking to be killed while enforcing the rights of the perpetrators.
Long life to Harry Callahan (Cleaners should not be called 'Dirty'). The whole serie (5 movies including this one) is only showing an honest cop doing his best to do his job in the most efficient way, since he even rids community from the risk of recidivism.
