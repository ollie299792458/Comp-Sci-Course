After obtaining all 5 seasons of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD & experiencing the letdown that Is Season 5, I decided to go back to where It started. Season 1 Is the only season that was done with Intelligence, care, accuracy, great Special Features, great on the packaging & the discs themselves. The discs were made up with Individual pics of each castmember As their official ID cards. These were done on the 6 episode discs & A full cast photo on the 7th Special Features disc. This Is also the ONLY season to be pressed this way, all of the episodes on their own discs & the Special Features on their own disc(the 7th). This Is also the only season to have commentary spanning the ENTIRE season. Seasons 2, 3 & 4, no commentary on any episode that aired after Christmas, Season 5-NO COMMENTARY AT ALL!!!! Season 1 Is also the only season to carry the look that Showrunner Anthony Zuiker had In mind until Les Moonves stuck his nose where It did not belong. This was the only full season to feature the entire original cast-Gary Sinise, Melina Kanakaredes, Carmine Giovinazzo, Vanessa Ferlito & Hill Harper, eddie Cahill did not show up until BLINK. Season 1 fires on all cylinders, never missing the mark. Season 1 also looked the most like the real New York showcasing New York's color & ethnicities. 0nly 2 episodes feature all white guest casts-THREE GENERATIONS ARE ENOUGH & the finale WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU SEE. The most I could give this season officially Is 5, but In my heart, Season 1 gets 5 trillion. Season 1 Is pure perfection. This Is the season I watch most on DVD. I had hoped this would be the standard bearer for all subsequent seasons, Instead this season Is An aberration. If you are only gonna get any Season of C.S.I. NEW YORK on DVD, this season Is It. Never A letdown. You also get to see the more honest crimelab built by Carey Meyer. The lab you could believe could exist In the real New York, not the outrageous opulence of the lab commissioned for Season 2 onward.
