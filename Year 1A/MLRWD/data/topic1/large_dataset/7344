Oh, now wait a minute.  Didn't this movie just come out two years ago?  Why are they re-releasing it?  Oh, it's the sequel? Oh, well than it must suck, right?  I mean, it's based off of a video game, so it's gotta suck?  Wrong!  It is a really good video game movie! I saw this movie the night it came out and the following weekend, and it is really pretty good.  You'd think the franchise would have fizzled out, but it just adds more steam.  The best part is Jill Valentine.  She looks like Jill Valentine.  It is uncanny.  And, there are plenty of scares to make you jump and feel stupid with.  The story line is pretty solid and the Nemesis is pretty freaky looking, too.  Mike Epps is funny in it.  Milla Jovovich holds it down, once again, and delivers a really good preformance.  I think this movie is much MUCH better than the first one because it mirrors the video game so closely (one scene is taken right from RESIDENT EVIL CODE: VERONICA!)  So, see this movie if you want a good scare with an amazing story.  And I strongly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the video game.  It does the game justice.
