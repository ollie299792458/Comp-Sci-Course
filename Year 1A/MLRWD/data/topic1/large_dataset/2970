I never thought I would ever see this series again, so when I came across these dvd's and I couldn't help but feel like a child again. Filmed in England, this double disc dvd set features the first 6 episodes of the series, produced in 1974. Although this is by no means a prefect production, for 1974 it is quite impressing, and surely it set many standards for the later filming of Star Wars. In fact, you are going to recognize many designs and prop details in Space 1999 that were later used in A New Hope. The plot lines are far simple and a little bit over the top, but action never stops in any of the 6 chapters. Special effects were way ahead of its time and are believable and realistic enhancers of the stories. Acting in the series is superb and production and direction are quite in place. All in all, this dvd is great, I just would've wished for more extras, like interviews, production designs, behind the scenes and maybe close caption or subtitles. Hopefully, they will include that in further releases of the series, which of course, I will buy. Don't miss this one.
