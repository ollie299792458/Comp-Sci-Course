For me, this is the definitive version of the movie. Criterion haven't really filled the disc with features, but they are adequate. Less is more. 
We all know about the story, this movie has many underlying plots. The main factor for me is Murphy's personal revenge mission, but essentially this movie is all about one man who had his humanity taken away from him, and starts a quest to get it back.
A classic movie, Verhoevens best and the uncut scenes may seem savage and brutal to some but i feel they enhance the story even further. The whole idea behind Murphy's death scene was to create as much sympathy for his character as possible, no matter how brutal the scene was. We live in an age where the bad guys are often cheered as the good guys, but after Murphy's grim demise you almost find yourself cheering when Clarence Boddicker [and his gang] get their just desserts. Murphy's death scene also has a very christian undertone to it. When he is being shot to death he is kneeling with his one remaining arm out to the side, as if he is being crucified. He is also resurrected like Jesus in the bible. 
I give the film 5/5 as it is a classic
The features 3/5, there are not many but what features the disc has are adequate.
