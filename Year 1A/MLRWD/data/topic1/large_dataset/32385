I just fell in love with this series. William Powell plays Nick Charles with rich, vibrant energy, and Myrna Loy brings Nora, his classy, lovely wife to life with effortless skill. They convince you of their love. Mushy it ain't, but deep and true. Clever quipps zing left and right, each one more entertaining than the last.

The movie begins at the beginning of the Charles marriage. They are in New York for a visit, so Nora can see Nick's friends. Nick has quit work to manage Nora's wealth, and it's a constant joke that Nick married his wife for that money. Nora tends to ignore him when he does, as she often does.

A friend of theirs goes out of town, and is later suspected or murdering his girlfriend and eventually two others. Nick is reluctant to get on the case, but eventually get's dragged in, with Nora's relentless encouragement. There's more humor than mystery, and the plot is more of an excuse for Nick to do his thing. It's all good. I could listen to them do a paper towel commerical, and would probably be entertained. The supporting cast is good, but is overshadowed by the witting leads.

Though from the 30's, there is nothing dated about this movie. Love, marriage, murder, and humor, these are enduring themes in this society. The Great Depression isn't really touched on, the rich are the stars of the show, and it's just as well, since the tone is supposed to be light and carefree. Watch this to escape, as I'm sure countless others did during the depression.
