What I really liked about it - besides the main theme of the love story between the preacher's wife and the young man who got dragged off to war - is the excellent portrayal of the "ravages of war" OFF the battlefield: all of the nasty things that those poor Appalachian people had to endure from local scoundrels, rascals, thieves, bullies, mean men, and other crude usurpers out to take advantage of the young, old, weak, sick, and poor who were left behind and caught-up in the middle of a national CIVIL WAR that most of them never wanted any part of. It really shows how war is hell and destructive in MANY ways and a breeding ground for even more criminal activity on top of the insanity of the war itself. ... I mean, these people SUFFERED! ... It shows that very well. It also puts an end - once and for all - that a woman needs a man around to get things done. These were STRONG, brave ladies - dignified and independent - who made it through the thick and thin of it ... all on their own. ... God bless 'em! ... A GREAT movie! : ) ...YOWZA! - George Koumantzelis / The Aeolian Kid
