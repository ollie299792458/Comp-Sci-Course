I think some people expected a movie much more similar to the original.  This version of the movie is really a different approach entirely.  The original was of a benevolent alien learning about humanity and trying to save it.  This version is about an alien species deciding that we have had enough chances already and now it's time for it to end for us in order to save the planet as a whole because planets that support complex life are far to rare to risk it's loss.

I enjoyed this movie for the most part.  The kid was annoying at times, but the fact that they actually got the viewer involved enough to be annoyed at the kid does support the decision ultimately made by Klaatu after he has observed the interactions between son and mother.

The only other weakness was the environmental stab.  Technology is evil, etc. etc.  Being a little more subtle about this message would have helped the movie.  I would imagine the same thoughts may have been had by the original viewers of the first movie concerning nuclear power.

Other than those two specific points, I don't see anything particularly bad about this movie.  For those looking for a deep story line and extensive character development....or a sci-fi movie with lots of action.....I would avoid watching!
