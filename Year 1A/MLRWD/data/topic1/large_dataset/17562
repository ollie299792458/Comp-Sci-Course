Everybody knows already the story of The Bounty and how it ends. The battle of wills between Captain Bligh (excellent Anthony Hopkins) and Fletcher Christian (equally excellent Mel Gibson). What prompted me to write a review is another review, one from Mr. Stefan Schott from Germany (December 29, 2000), who gave the DVD one star! He said that the dialogues were so distorted that it is impossible to watch the movie and that image quality is below average.
First, maybe the quality of the copy in Europe (Region 2) is different from the one that sells for Region 1.
I bought the DVD yesterday and watched it last night. This is a prime example of low price/high quality DVD. The widescreen is a perfect media to set off the visual quality of that movie.  The sunsets are marvelous, the close-ups are stunning and the scenes filmed at the water's edge leave us breathless. As for the audio quality, I did not find any flaws.  The sound is perfectly clear and the dialogues are all audible.
Obviously, Mr. Schott had a much different experience than I did with the DVD version of "The Bounty".  I just wanted to bring that to the attention of potential American buyers so that they will not be put off by Mr. Schott's review.
The only let down of this DVD is that there are no extras.  At that price though, the fact that the movie itself on DVD is exceptional is worth the price.
