I'm a Lexington, Kentucky native-- with lots of family in the Eastern KY mountains and hollers presented in "Justified." I traveled to Eastern KY to do legal work for many years and have traipsed through many a holler myself.
I LOVE this show.  In Kentucky we have a soft southern accent-- very similar to the Tennessee accent. Most of the "Justified" cast pulls off a Kentucky twang that sounds a lot like my family and friends talking.
(Except for the dude who plays Arlo.  His accent is inauthentic. Hey, Raymond Barry!  Come hang out with me so I can teach you how a Kentuckian really talks!)
Timothy Olyphant is incredibly good.  His Kentucky-fied accent, colloquialisms, behavior-- very authentic.
In Season 2, Margo Martindale is extraordinary!!!
This show features colorful characters, rich dialogue and is as addictive as hillbilly heroin.
As someone else mentioned, this show is a hidden gem on FX.  I'm hoping more folks will catch onto it so it will be around for many more seasons.
