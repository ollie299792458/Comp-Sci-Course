I cannot even believe I spent $4.00 on this movie buying it used at Blockbuster. Heard about it when it came out but didnt go see it. Forgot about it then saw it as a 5/$20 pick at Blockbuster so picked it up thinking, "Hey it's Al Pacino, it must be ok at least?" I LOVED him in Scent of a Woman and various others so thought it was a great bargain.......... yeah, ummmm this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Pacino was completely detached from the movie, the character and kind of Planet Earth. I want to say his acting was bad but it wasnt even acting, it was like he was on another planet he was so out of it and he along with the rest of the cast, good Lord, they might as well have been reading from index cards in their hands because that is what it sounded like for all of them!

Four bucks was 4 times too many bucks to have paid for this movie and not only would I love to get my money back but the 107 minutes I suffered through it thinking it HAS to get better at some point......... I will be giving this away to Goodwill as I don't even think I can sell it on here for a penny or inflict it on anyone I know.  :(
