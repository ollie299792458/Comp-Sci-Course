I raised a smile to the low-star reviews claiming this movie ruined their night. I wasn't smiling out of a sense of snottiness or ego but because I agree with them. This movie ruined my night too. Frankly, I don't remember the last time I felt so affected by a movie.

So why give it five stars? Simple - I don't remember the last time I felt so affected by a movie! It must really say something if a movie can stop me from sleeping! This film is brutally honest (and I am a fan of honesty over decency), moving and inspiring in its artistic vision. The reason this film will get to most who watch it is that this movie is not about the lead characters but about everybody who watches it. To quote the film: "there are no extras in life."

As another reviewer said, reviews on this movie will be strictly divided - I agree and feel it will take some time before this movie gets the recognition it deserves. It's a movie that's not afraid to tell us that roses are only beautiful because they die. Life is only worth living because it's finite.

Bravo Mr. Kaufman! You have crafted a brilliant artistic masterpiece which will no doubt become my favorite. Nothing even comes close to Synecdoche New York.
