It's an Orson Welles film about world-class fakery with profiles of the great Hungarian art forger, Emlyr, and the dopey author of a hoax biography of Howard Hughes, Clifford Irving.  Both jokers ended up in Time magazine as well as in jail.  Much of it is filmed on the once-enchanting island of Ibiza (it's now something like an Iberian Club Med party destination  - "let's go club-ing!")  Directed and tediously edited (for years apparently) by Welles, this film is slow and self-indulgent and is not representative of the best work of the fat wine-soaked genius.  The only enjoyable thing about it is a few frames of Irving's calm and beautiful Swiss wife Edith(?).  On disc B there is a BBC documentary on Elmyr if you're interested in art and what you might be REALLY looking at in a respectable museum.  I recommended this to a friend but she fell asleep so many times watching the film that she never got to the documentary.  If you're a Welles aficionado maybe you would want it.  It cost me 50 bucks new with shipping.  I once had a 50 dollar car that ran fine for five years.  Buy a used one.
