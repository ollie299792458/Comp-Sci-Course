This movie had a ridiculous premise!  First, poor wifey, played by Ashley Judd, is accused and convicted of killing her missing husband, whose body they never found!  Cmon' you mean to tell me she was convicted with circumstantial evidence!?  Then after she spends a couple of years in jail, stewing over what actually happened, one of her cellmates tells her "Hell, y'all should go out and find and kill your husband cause' you can't be accused of killin' him twice!"  So eventually she breaks out of jail and intends to find her missing husband so she can kill him!  Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones is hot on her trail.  She follows a trail of evidence that her supposedly dead hubby left behind and finally catches up with him, but soon Tommy Lee Jones catches up with her, and get this, he begins to believe her story that her husband is still alive! (Why, we'll never know).  Once both Tommy Lee and Ashley (I forget the characters' names) catch up with her lousy husband it just gets beyond ridiculous.  Ashley tries hard to be serious, but it's almost laughable.  Tommy Lee puts in his usual tough guy with a heart performance (been there, done that).  The best part of the film is the dead/alive husband played by Bruce Greenwood who does an excellent job at playing the villain (it's a shame that he's not it it more, it's the best part of the film). The movie's plotline is flimsy and the acting (except Bruce, which is why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) is sub-par.  This is pretty much a dull revenge flick with not many suprises.
