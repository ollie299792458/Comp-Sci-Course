Discriminating Horror Fan: Do not be afraid to drop your dollars on this disc. Semi-Lovecraftian creepiness goes down in a midieval cathedral. Michele Soavi directs this very stylish flick from a script that allows the plot to meander through the set-pieces the way only Europeans can. THE CHURCH does have that already nostalgic mid-80's feel to it, but somehow Argento and crew achieved production value impressive even by today's standards. Acting that ranges from competent to very good, lush photography, gorgeous interiors, plenty of well executed gore and creature effects that never become gratuitous, even some gunuine suspense;  it all moves at a pace that feels just right towards a wicked climax and a spooky final sequence. I don't want to over do it, but this is a real gem. Beautifully transferred from pristine source material, it looks and sounds great. Anamorphic, trailer, director bio, in an attractive keepcase. If you are a hardened gore-hound, a Universal/Golden-Age snob, or a EuroTrash ...[fan], you might want to try before you buy. But if you're like me, a bit of all three, this is money well spent.
