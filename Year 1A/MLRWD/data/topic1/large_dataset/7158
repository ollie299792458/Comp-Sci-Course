Perry Mason is back & the first half of the 1958 season is a little shorter than I knew about.  There are only 15 episodes this installment but every one of them has some good drama. Some of them are Gardner's material including one them being his more twisted novels being adapted to TV here on the Balfour estate.

The technology is old, & a lot of the stuff is old hat, but there are some legal wrangles in some of them that teach the viewer legal terms like tort. This is a solid set which any Mason fan will enjoy. Sadly it appears CBS still has no extras to offer with any of these.

Each show is full length, & this time they menu screen is silent so you don't have to listen to the suspenseful theme until you actually start a show. There is a play all option & disk 1 features a preview of other future CBS offerings of some shows like CSI to come. The preview is short & very much a teaser.

This set is about Mason, & 1 show even has an Inquest instead of a trial for a change of venue.  There are several guest stars that are known for other work they did on tv later & movies earlier. This set wets my desire for Part 2 of season 2, hope it is coming soon.
