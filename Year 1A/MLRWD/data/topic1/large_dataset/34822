Karate Kid II is not as good as the first, but sequals
rarely are. Karate Kid II is very enjoyable. Some think
that part II and III should have been switched around, and
I agree with that. I think this would have been a better
end to the series, with a few minor changes maybe.
Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita give great performances
once again. Daniel and Miyagi are awesome characters. I
think it's cool how they were able to make a series
where two people so far apart in age are such great friends.
Anyway, in Karate Kid II, Daniel san and Miyagi go to Okinawa
after Miyagi gets word that his father has become very ill.
To make matters worse, Miyagi has a problem with Sato, his
former best friend. Really, Sato has a problem with Miyagi,
over an old girlfriend. Daniel ends up having a problem of his
own with Sato's nephew, Chozen. I can't recall the guy's name
that played Chozen, but I think he was awesome! Why didn't
he receive more roles?? It's a mystery to me. The last fight
could have been better, but it works. Great movie.
