'Ghost Dog' is by no means a conventional movie. People who dislike it are probably expecting something a little more along the mainstream format. Whitaker masterfully downplays the eponymous role, his physical bulk offset by graceful movement and deadpan cool. Excellent performances are also given in all the supporting roles, including the excitable ice cream van owner and some crazy mafioso. The movie combines the philosophical with the absurd to great effect. It's true strength lies in its originality - the contrast between Samurai, Gangster and Hip-hop culture is fantastic. Having said this, the slow paced style is not to everyones taste and if you're going to get hung up about realism or miniscule detail then don't bother. The point of the film is the exposition of themes and character. Personally I loved this movie. It is not really, despite the title, a Samurai movie. Although it is a major theme, people looking for a Samurai film should look elsewhere. If you are looking for an original and thoughtful movie, which puts a new twist on various old ideas, then i can give no higher reccomendation.
