This movie is one of my all-time favourite movies. It showes the reality of "just another day in our sick society", and the main person D-Fens is like a hero to me. He is not the sick element, but his  surroundings are. This movie can be a warning to a lot of weak people,  people who made and make this society as dehumanizing as it is now, but at  the same time can`t deal with their own mess. I believe that people who are  shocked about this movie can`t deal with the truth, because they feel  something like regret, feelings of guilt.  Wanna know why ? Because almost  everybody is building this anti-human-society every day, just a little  piece of it. Buy this movie, watch it over and over, and don`t look at it  like "entertainment", but look at it like something real,  something different, some personal warning to everybody.  Everyting Bill  "D-Fens" Foster does is totally acceptable, because the people  around made him what he was at this hot L.A.-summer-day. This movie  contains also a lot of funny elements. WATCH IT !  (and understand the  honesty of this movie)
