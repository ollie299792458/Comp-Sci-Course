After experienceing Crimson Tide for the 15th time, I believe this is my favorite movie of all time.  From the very beginning of the movie you are swept into a very plausible scenario:  Russian rebels have captured nuclear  missle silo's and are threatening to launch at the U.S..  The USS Alabama  has been deployed to launch a preemptive strike against Russia.  This movie  has what DVD owners are looking for:  Excellent visuals, bass thumping  sound, and great acting.  Denzel Washington gives the best performance of  his career as Lt. Commander Hunter.  His character's by-the-book style is  at direct odds with Captain Ramsey's (Gene Hackman) old-school ways.  The  result is an incredible clash of wills that results in mutiny and the near  destruction of the world in a nuclear holocaust.  The tension is thick in  this drama, and the movie has emotional moments and moments of extreme joy.  You will be on the edge of your seat rooting for either Capt. Ramsey or  Commander Hunter throughout the movie.  This is a must-see movie!
