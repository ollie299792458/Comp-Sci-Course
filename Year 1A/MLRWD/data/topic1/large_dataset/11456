This is a very enjoyable movie which I never fail to rewatch when it's on television.  Rob Lowe and Demi Moore meet and start a relationship which is new to him as he is somewhat of a lady killer.  The chemistry between these two is great.  Lowe is perfectly cast as the romantic lead.  Great looking but struggling with his job.  Demi is also very good projecting a single girl who would like to settle down but isn't too much of a prude.  Jim Belushi plays Rob Lowe's sidekick whose main goal is to keep Lowe out "chasing the hounds" as it is his total social existence.  This is Belushi's best role ever as the vulgar, liquor drinking sidekick who has some of the best lines in the movie.  My only disappointment was Elizabeth Perkins as the female sidekick.  Her role was rather bland.
This movie will appeal to romantics, people of dating age or who like to be reminded of the trials of dating, fans of Chicago and Rush Street, and others interested in love stories or comedy.  It's also a great study in the second wave of movies by the Brat Pack.  Additionally, Zwick went on to direct some great movies such as Glory and Courage Under Fire I believe.  I strongly recommend this movie as a great way to spend and afternoon or night.
