Ok. First of all. It's not "Life's a bitch", nor, "Loving dogs" it actually means something very close to "Bitch love affairs". Well, now my review. This is one of the first modern mexican movies I have seen in years and it truly was a surprising departure from the downright uninspired, commercial and simply vulgar movies the mexican film-industry was apparently caught in during most of the '80s. This movie is excellent, although you have got to see it with a very open-mind. It displays much more gore and violence than the average person is ordinarily accustomed to watch at films but it certainly is a unique vision from its director at the ruthlessness and paper-thin barrier that separates what we deem so perfect, neat and stable, civilized from complete chaos of passionate and reckless love, envy, death, life's fragilty and, in two words, true human nature, with all its beauty and uglyness intermixed below the surfaceof things. This movies deals with modern human life is also compared to man's best friend, our relationship with them and the very similarities of our feelings, being difficult to distinguish from that of a so called inferior species when we, with our precious mind, civilization and urbanity tend almost always to think better of ourselves. Great film, excellent portrait of life at its very, white-bone, bare nature.
