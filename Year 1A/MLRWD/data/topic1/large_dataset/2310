The list of "rock stars with brains" is a short one, but Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson has written and produced the definitive Crowley Movie. Purists may balk at that statement, but this film is not by any means a biography. It is purely joyous exploitation at its finest.
It has been said that a magician without a sense of humor is unbearable and only the "unholier than thou" would take umbrage with this nasty little gem, which is entertaining AND magickally sound (except in one small instance, which alone would persuade the faithful to disparage the entire production. Their loss.)
The film's characterization of Crowley is based upon the tabloid descriptions of him during his lifetime, a popular opinion that prevails to this day. This movie does nothing to repair that opinion because again, it is NOT a biography.
This is a glorious "what if?" conceptualization of the Crowleyan corpus. Its all here and then some. Familiar names abound and as Crowley himself embraced the cutting-edge scientific discoveries of his time, the virtual-reality concepts of this film jibe neatly with his own imaginative flights of the fantastic.
All good fantasy films mess with your brain and this one includes a spectacular "twist-ending."
As intelligent as it is disgusting, this thoughtful little gem delivers its talent is right there on the screen. The photography and sound quality hint at a much larger production.
This movies isn't for everyone, but neither is Magick, nor the "horror" that is Aleister Crowley.
I love it. I own it!
