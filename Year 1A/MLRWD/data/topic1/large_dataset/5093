Let's hope it gets nominated and wins.

I have been a Garrison fan since he did the morning show on the U of M one-lung radio station in the '70s and then on Minnesota Public Radio. He is a great American folk hero and someday may be even considered in the same category as Will Rogers and Mark Twain. Altman, well, you can't get any better a director and the cast is diamond quality. I wish Tim Russell would have been Guy Noir as he created the character and that Sue Scott would have had a bigger part but understand why a "Hollywood Decision" was made. Mickey's Diner, well I practically lived there as a kid and it grabbed me from the opening scene to the final fade out.

I have never liked Meryl Streep in anything but loved her here. Lily Tomlin was superb. LQ Jones? What a wonderful surprise! I met him when he was out stunmping his epic sci-fi "A Boy and His Dog" in 1975. Virginia Madsen as the Angel of Death, oh yeah.

Garrison came off very well on camera and Lindsay Lohan was even palatable. I have never liked Woody Harrelson but enjoyed him here very much.

This is a warm and tender movie with enough sarcasm and Minnesota humor to even make my Lao wife laugh. We just watched it here in northern Thailand. The humor is universal.

Way to go Garrison. I hope to see you accepting an Oscar! Things could be worse.
