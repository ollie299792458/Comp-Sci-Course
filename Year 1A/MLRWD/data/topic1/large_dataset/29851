Saw this movie from Netflix and have now decided to buy it. I've just returned from a safari to Namibia where we heard the lions roaring in the night not far from our camp. NOTHING puts the fear of God into you more than that, all that separates you  from them is your puny canvas tent. Our safari guide had seen the movie as well and we talked about it that  night around the fire. He is himself a lion tracker in that if his family ranch is threatened by a lion, they do track it down.  When Kilmer and Douglas are sitting at night listening to the lion still roaring and laugh about it, you just know that something more is going to happen. And boy does it ever!!! The music soundtrack is great, I especially like the interaction between Kilmer and the guy who played Shaka Zulu in the mini series. ALso the innocent Scottish missionary's part is rather poignant.  I don't care if it is hokey, or a typical Hollywood production, the story IS real, the lions ARE on display in the Field museum in Chicago and it evokes the feel of the African savannah perfectly.
