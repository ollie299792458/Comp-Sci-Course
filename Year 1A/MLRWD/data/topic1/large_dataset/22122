Long time fan since early 80's. Own it all. Seen them on several tours. I like the band. Seen their concert films. Was particularly moved and impressed with the U23D I saw at imax. This U2360 Blu-ray is very hard to watch. Put simply. How does the biggest band in the world. With the biggest stage and production in one of the biggest venues in the US not consider the home viewer of this DVD? One needs to capture the concert experience. The majesty of the set. The narrative of the songs and flow of the show. They have done this before in their other video releases. Other artists like Peter Gabriel and countless others get this concept. Apparently the director and editor of this production did not. Jump cuts and shaky footage can be useful for effect and to make visual points and are great when they are used sparingly. But when not a single shot lasts more than 3 seconds and there are jarring zooms and pans in them...You get a mess. We have split screens. Super imposed shots. Quick shot of Bono's shoes to a quick shot of the back of Larry's head. Those things work in a 4-5 minute song video..But a live concert has to take you there. I think of New Years day at Red Rocks. I think of Exit in Rattle and Hum. I think of Origin of Species in U23D as amazing moments of u2 on video. This concert film does not have those moments and it is not because of the performance, the sound, or their material which is great...It is because the editor and director approached this like a communication student that just got final cut pro. I will watch it again because I own it. Maybe dig around on the disc menu for alternate shots. Or just treat it like a really expensive live CD.
