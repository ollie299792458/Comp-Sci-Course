Okay, maybe my review title deserves one star as well, but I couldn't resist. I also am a girl who definitely appreciates good romantic comedy. I actually loved Love Actually. But this movie was simply one of the worst movies I've ever wasted two hours on.

Where to begin? The dialogue is completely unbelievable and cheesy. I cringed, I was so embarrassed for the actors having to utter the lines. The plot is implausible, with embarrassing devices like the stupid winds out in LA making crazy things happen. The acting...I have always liked Kate Winslet and Jack Black. And on occasion I've enjoyed watching Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. But each and every one of them seemed to be phoning it in. Well, I don't know about Cameron -- she succeeded in making her character a completely unlikeable person, and I found myself hoping for her romance to fail. Also Jude Law looks suspiciously orange all through the movie. He looked like he tasted of cheese. Not a good look, especially compared to how dreamy he looked in a movie like Enemy at the Gates. Not only that, his character comes off as so smarmy that you'd wonder why Diaz would be genuinely attached to him in the first place. The same goes for Rufus Sewell's character, who appears in the beginning as the man who strings Kate Winslet on. He is obviously so toxic and buffoonish; while Winslet is so obviously too smart and lovely for him. It's just not believable that she was ever under his spell.

Overall, I thought the movie was simultaneously trying to pander to its audience while actually succeeding in insulting it. At least, I felt insulted. While Love Actually isn't a perfect movie, at least it was far better written and acted and therefore infinitely more palatable as an escapist chick flick. Skip this one and rent that instead. Or Bridget Jones. Or Four Weddings and a Funeral. Or Two Weeks Notice. Or anything else with Hugh Grant, really.
