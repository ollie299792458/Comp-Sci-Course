Being a teen movie-watcher, the name Stanley Kubrick held no real meaning to me when I first watched this movie, as a matter of fact, i may never have even seen it if it weren't for a review I read of the (in my opinion) greatest movie ever, Fight Club closely comparing it to a Clockwork Orange, now, hearing the reviewer ramble, I was expecting a rant dissaproving society openly, much like Fight Club, instead, I got a more suttle approach.  This method gives you the facts and the images, and let's you decide what they mean.  Some more shallow of thought found this movie not at all innovative or captivating, most likely because they saw the story of a criminal brought to justice, I saw a debate on good and evil, is it evil to let a young man terrorize, murder, and rape, or to wipe him out from conscience thought? Some people saw and started ranting about the governement and how they want to just take us all over, I don't think that was the purpose of the movie either.  I think Kuberick really wanted us to think for ourselves and see both sides, not start ranting, blab all you wantabout free speech, but did anyone really feel happy at the first 45 minutes filled with rape and murder? Was anyone satisfied with the old man going crippled and driven mad at the loss of his wife? The messages in this movie can work anyway, and no modern movies have really achieved that I think.  The narrating wasn't as interesting as say in Fight Club, and I don't think it really added anything special.  As for me, I will enjoy pursuing more Kuberick films.
