Being a fan of good horror I am always looking for new horror flicks, so after reading the reviews here I decided to try out Haunted.  I was a bit disappointed by the film, and it occurred to me that Haunted is more of an anti-horror film.  It's almost as if the creators of Haunted took the stereotypical horror flick and did the reverse with Haunted.  Instead of the characters being a bit cheesy and fun, the characters in Haunted were dulled and lacked intensity.  There was no blood or gore, and the only real scare/startle attempts in the film were the few instances of someone/something popping up in front of your face yelling "Boo!"  Instead of having that one gratuitous skin shot, there were quite a few skin shots (about the only enjoyment I got out of this film - but not what I was looking for in a horror flick =).  In fact, if it weren't for all of the skin shots, I don't think there is anything else in this film that would have kept it from being rated `G'.
Also unlike many other horror flicks, this one has a plot that is easy to follow, but then again, the whole mystery behind the plot was easy to figure out (which I did about a quarter of the way through the movie).
Overall, I can't give this any more than three stars.  The acting was good but the characters were dull, the plot was good but very basic and easy to figure out, what little special effects there were had little effect, and the film lacked any sort of thrills, chills or electricity.  Haunted is good enough to rent and watch once, but not a film I would suggest any fan of horror actually purchase.
