One of the better 80's slasher films. I remeber this film always being on the Movie Channel & HBO in February as a kid in the early 80's. The annual town Valentines day dance is banned in the mining town of Valentines Buff because 20 years ago the supervisors attended the dance while 5 miners died in a freak accident except Harry Warden. Harry was sent to a mental institution after this tragedy, 19 years later the local kids try to have the traditional dance on the first  anniversary. The dance is stopped by a bloody heart being sent to them in a candy box. They decide to throw the party in the mine but someone doesn't like that idea. Not major gore but some creative ways people get killed involving boiling water, a pick axe, & a nail gun. The lead actors undying love for Sarah (female lead) is borderline scary obsession.  The movie leads you to believe that you know the killer the whole time who is back for revenge but it throws you with a twisted surprise ending. One of my favorite 80's horror films & an essential viewing to 80's horror film genre fans.
