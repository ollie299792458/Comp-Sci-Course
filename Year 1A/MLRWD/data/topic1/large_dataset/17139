Starring Liz Taylor, and Rex Harrison. This 4 hour long melodrama has setpieces and costumes that would cost the studio half billion to recreate today. It has behind-the-scenes gossip and news that would make Cleopatra blush.
The film moves with the speed of a snail, yacking and talking of characters that aren't identifiable. The great acting can't make up for the snoringly butt-aching length. Note to filmmakers: At least stop the film in several places; add two intermissions instead of just one. Let the audience stretch. There's no innovations in direction. You get the same narrative scope from "Ben-Hur." But at least, the way that was made kept people interested.
The cost and all it's setpieces is the grandest of all. But the pull truly great epics; "Gone With The Wind," "The Ten Commandments," "Lawrence of Arabia" and the recent "Titanic" had on people was either intrigue or something in the characters. This has neither that nor a reason to stay with it for 4 straight hours.
You may be asking why I'm giving this 4 stars if i hate it so much--but I've got a reason. The images of Liz on her throne and all the Roman garb around her; they're some of the most memorable in film. Not because the film was popular (Ha Ha), but it did have an effect on pop culture, causing it to gain that "classic" title.
