The behavior of the people in this movie is just not believable.

I typically love these kind of movies, where the main character is set up to experience a life-or-death situation that causes true growth (like Sara Connor in the first Terminator movie). But it ends up being a lot of aimless running around in the woods made to set up situations where Basinger can kill her pursuers with items found in the toolbox from her car.

There are moments where she does even not try to get away -- instead she continues to hang around near her pursuers and listen to their conversations. There are other places where she's so clumsy and noisy it's ridiculous. And the scene where she actually starts seducing one of the boys is laughable. Basinger has always been one of my least favorites actresses, but even Meryl Streep couldn't have made this work...

Not until the final scene does she show signs of turning into someone different than the lame, superficial, brow-beaten housewife she started out as, and as satisfying as that is, it wasn't worth watching the whole movie to get there.
