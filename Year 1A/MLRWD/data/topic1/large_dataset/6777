I knew nothing about this film, other than what I read on the back of the case, when I rented it this past weekend.  I was in the mood for something other than a mainstream "Hollywood" film, and boy did I get my wish!  After I "got it" that I was watching something that would not meet my "Americanized expectations" I sat back and truly enjoyed it! Becoming immersed in the pace, my whole day slowed right down and I began to notice small details that I wouldn't ordinarily get from mainstream movies and it was these small details that became immensely interesting and important.  I agree with one person's suggestion that each person watching it will take away their own unique "understanding" of it. I feel that there is a reason for every act or decision we make in our life, and that we are personally motivated from within, from a core part of us that "connects" with the great "out there" to get us what we need to grow and move forward.  The movie ended in no way that I expected it to, but I loved every moment that I didn't expect....in other words I was still extremely entertained and moved and educated and I would recommend this film highly. It's got a certain something that we find we need only by watching it.
