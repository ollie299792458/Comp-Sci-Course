HALLOWEEN: 25 YEARS OF TERROR bills itself as a documentary made by the fans, for the fans. This much seems true, until it becomes apparent that several of the people being interviewed having mostly negative things to say about any one film from the Halloween franchise. This would be bad enough, but these same people are no-name, sexist fools who criticize the movies and praise nudity. Their opinions are less than worthless, if that is even possible. While it's nice to see some of the cast members from various films talking about their experiences during and after their time with the franchise, the main documentary has a simple and insulting message: "The first film is a perfect classic, and the rest suck." The director(s) even repeatedly show footage of Moustapha Akkad apologizing for the various sequels. I find this to be unfair and outright wrong.

In short, if you live the Halloween films, this documentary will only insult you to the point that you want a refund.

PS - The bonus comic is also little more than a cheap rag better suited for a certain use following a bowel movement.
