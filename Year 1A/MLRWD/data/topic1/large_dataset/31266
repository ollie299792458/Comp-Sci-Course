It really surprises me about when legendary bands reunite to the best of their ability. That has definitely been in tune with greats like Fleetwood Mac, Tears For Fears, and one of the most well-received groups of the 70's, The Eagles. They have definitely roared their way to the top again in the 90's, and welcomed a whole new generation to the feeling that the group had developed back in the 70's. That has been true for years, and has hit again with the status of scoring the highest-selling album of the 20th century with their Greatest Hits 1971-1975. This concert might seem like it, and just even more.

Hell Freezes Over, the legendary 1994 reunion concert for The Eagles, has been known as one of the best concerts of the decade. The concert includes some of their best live material in years, including some of their best songs and a few new tracks never before performed by the group, including live classics like Desperado, I Can't Tell You Why, the acoustic appealing Hotel California, Pretty Maids In A Row, the classic Tequila Sunrise, the welcomed classic adult contemporary song Love Will Keep Us Alive, and other greats. The live DVD also includes some live versions of Don Henley's classics from his 1989 masterpiece The End Of The Innocence: New York Minute, and the Grammy-Winning Heart Of The Matter. Yet for fans of other solo works from Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and company might seem to be a little bit dissapointed that songs like The Heat Is On weren't put on the live concert. Still, that shouldn't seem to be much of a problem.

While so many acts have looked like they are manufactured right now, and other great 70's acts have been constantly going away, The Eagles have been well recognized for years, and just keep coming back better than ever. This DVD is one of the best recognized concerts ever made. This is a must have for any long time Eagles fan, as proof that hell hasn't froze over.
