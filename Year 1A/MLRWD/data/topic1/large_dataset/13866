To me, the poignance of On The Beach lies not in it's anti-nuclear war message, which mercifully was proved wrong by events in the real world (Julian's speech railing against the idea that nuclear weapons could keep  the peace is the one dated part of the film.  It's now evident that the  reason why there never was another ground war horror on the order of WWI  and WWII was *because* of the atomic bomb) but in it's human elements, and  exploring how people react to the reality that life is fast coming to an  end for all of them.  In this instance, a nuclear war is simply a  convenient duex ex machina to see how ordinary people react to the trauma  facing them.  There are fine performances all around, but to me the real  strength of the movie is Ava Gardner's touching performance as Moira  Davidson.  Indeed, there is an almost eerie autobiograhic quality to it  since Gardner had many things in common with her character.
I think  sooner or later, people will look back on "On The Beach" and  realize that it's timelessness lies in it's exploration of the human  condition and not it's political statements which in my opinion are no  longer relevant to the real world.
