"Joy Ride" directed by amazing suspense director John Dahl , is a state of the art thriller.  This movie stars the hilarious Steve Zahn, convincing Paul Walker and new-comer Leelee Sobieski.
  To open this clever thriller, 2 Brothers (Zahn and Walker) install a CB Radio into their car. Not being able to resist themselves they make  what they think is a harmless prank on a Vengeful trucker with the handle of "Rusty Nail."  The two soon realize that the prank is now on them.  There are then  clever scenes of suspense and comedy and eventually Venna(Sobieski) is thrown into the mix, and the three race for their lives from the phsyco trucker.
  Joy Ride is so well done, the script is top notch, making every scene interesting, even the over long car ride in the beginning.  The direction is amazing, and the lighting gives the dark effect and look of the plot.  Of course the trucker does have special "powers" and some things are never fully explained.  Although these little things have no effect on the over all outcome of this thrilling nail-biter.
  What is great about the movie is the great mixture of comedy and terror. Also the timing is wonderful too.  The movie is not over-long and you find yourself wanting more after the not so happy ending.  Joy Ride is an enetertaing and terrozing thriller and charms and freaks outs the audience over and over again.  Joy Ride is exactly what the title says... A Joy Ride
