This DVD explodes with great audio.  The DD5.1 track completely immurses you with music.  When you're sitting in the middle of this powerful sound cranked up, you almost feel like you're in there with the crowd.  Audio =  A++
There are some minor problems with the Video, but nothing that you're  even going to notice if you're really listening to the music.  I just can't  get over how crystal clear the audio is.  Anyways, there's a few problems  with shimmer and artifacting, but who really cares?  This is mostly about  the sound.  In fact, who cares when you get Rammstein in a nice widescreen  format and dolby digital 5.1.  Hell you can even turn on the German  subtitles!  Video = A-
Bonus:  Alright.  Bonus material.  You get a 15  minute interview with the band and you can watch it with subtitles in  english, french or spanish.  There's even a hidden video  ("Stripped" from the Depeche Mode tribute album) that you get as  a bonus when you solve all of the triva on the DVD-ROM portion... oh yea..  the DVD-ROM portion that everyone seems to be forgetting about.  
This is  also NOT a single layer disc as mentioned in another review.  In order to  attain the 9GB of data that's on this disc, it's a specially made  dual-layer single-sided DVD.  Similar technology was used on stephen king's  "the Stand" to fit on one DVD (18GB dual-layered, double-sided)  
If you enjoy Rammstein and have a DVD player... BUY THIS!  IT'S  INEXPENSIVE AND COMPLETELY ROCKS.
