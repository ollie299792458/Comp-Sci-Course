ECW Extreme Evolution
I had never seen any ECW before buying this, but this is what I thought of it... 
RVD V Jerry Lynn
This is a good match, although it takes a while to get started because of RVD taunting. When it does though, the match makes up for the slow start. There's a nice table spot and lots of chairs. 7/10
Awesome V Tanaka
The best match on the DVD. 2 tables break and lots of chairs are used! There are some good bumps and lots of high-flying moves too. I was surprised at how good this was. 8/10
Barbed wire Match Raven V Sandman
It's bloody, brutal and lots of tables break. It could have been better though, because it's quite clumsy (the last table brakes before the move actually happens). Also, it was paced a bit too slowly. 7/10
Dudleys V Spike &amp; Balls
This was pretty good, but I expected more. Spike jumps off a high ladder at the start, which is cool. Also he gets put through a flaming table, which is pretty good. 7/10
Eliminators V Williams &amp; Gordy
This match was only on the DVD for the end elbow drop. It is not really that high, especially as Perry sits down. Shane McMahon jumping of the Titantron at WWE Backlash 2001 was miles better. The rest of this match was crap and not worth watching making this a waste of space. 3/10
Sabu V Taz
This was very far off the "most amazing grudge match ever", but it was still cool. I thought it would be more hardcore actually, although there are some good spots. They use tables and chairs. 7/10
Dreamer &amp; Beulah V Douglas &amp; Francine
I don't know why this was on the DVD. Tommy gets hit with a chair by a fan, but that's about it. At least it's better than the Eliminators' tag match though. Why they made it the main event I don't know either. 4/10 
Overall
There were no amazing matches here really, and some of the matches were actually quite crap. I've seen a lot better PPVs from WWE, and this was supposed to be a "best of" DVD!
