This movie is now on my top ten list of favorite movies of all time.

This film serves as a reminder to hollywood that films with characters, even the same character, repeated (you'll "get" this reference as the movie progresses), are better than films with nothing but skin, body fluids exchanged meaninglessly, and more skin shown as disguised porn, which means porn sold as a movie or television show.

True filmmakers, as this incredible director and writer have shown us, need not 200 million dollars to make a movie that allows for great interest and fascinating developments. A truly gifted filmmaker, such as the one who made Moon, will (we can only hope) hold true to the vision of a contribution to the dialogue of what we stand for, and who we are, defining us via the dialogue is what art is, and should be. And the term "art," as used here, means the creation of that which sustains the soul and nourishes the mind. This goal need not be pedantic; this goal need not be puritanical, but it does need to nourish the need for creative mileu which bathes us in questions that turn over us day after day.

More than two weeks after seeing this movie, I'm still thinking about it. Major kudos to all who participated, down to the last sound guy or lighting guy, unappreciated yet whose contribution and caring, so made this a fabulous movie.

One can only hope that this director, and the actor sam rockwell, will continue on the trajectory of a path, done so well as to embarrass all of hollywood for pumping out so much trash, when opportunity for such as this indelible and moving movie, is available to them.

No nudity. No gratuitous sex. No drugs. Some profanity. Sheesh. What must Hollywood think?

Thanks so much for making this movie, and showing all the coming up directors and actors that there is greatness that can be achieved, with relatively little money. (believe this movie was made for only five million...)
