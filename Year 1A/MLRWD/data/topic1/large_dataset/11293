I should say I never made it to World at War, I watched the first two movies, and I had to take several breaks, to calm down and just breathe. The movies are filled with acting that Beastmaster would be embarrassed by. The plot I realize is based on a vague biblical prophecy, but apparently it's so vague that what I came away with from it was that I would be left behind. I could say this movie panders to fear, and the lowest common denominator of Christianity, but alas it is a large group of people that find this kind of fear propaganda entertaining. I will admit that I'm writing this in response to these working as movies, not really anything else, and as movies they were not even TV quality. I can't believe the scenes they left in were the best ones, they must of had some very scary takes. I just did not enjoy them on any level, I couldn't even laugh at how bad they were, they were just too clunky and the whole time attempting to have a deeper more complicated message, while at the same time Kirk runs around just telling people how they should start praying, even though there is no point at all. It's like watching a movie about rats in a box where the air is running out, and instead of drawing straws to see who gets to be eaten first, they just all lay down and give up.  I mean once you figure out there is nothing they can do, the thrill and the drama dissipate, because the acting alone can't carry this.
