This is how I remember Chicago before it became a truly world-class city. Today, this movie, on this scale, could never again be made in Chicago. I remember when it was made: the whole city was shut down and people were amazed that Hollywood had come to our town.  This is the last great American film musical, featuring of course, the blues of Chicago which are Delta Blues spiced with twangy guitar riffs. The movie's transformation onto DVD is nothing short of a triumph of technology. The music is now more than ever before an integral part of the movie. Where else can you get Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker and countless other soul and blues stars all together in one place? And have the music coming at you like they were all in your living room. Belushi was a comic genius. Clearly out of control, mad. Ackroyd's antics and stage presence seeped and played off of Belushi. He was too bright a star; too fast for his own good. But he left us with this film, a true American Classic.
