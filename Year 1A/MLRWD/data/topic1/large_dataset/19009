Being a guy, I was somewhat reluctant to see "White Oleander," half-expecting an indoctrination into the Ya-Ya Sisterhood against my will. However, my apprehensions were completely mistaken, as this was one of the best movies I had seen in a while. 
 Cinematic neophyte Alison Lohman gives an understated yet compelling debut as Astrid, a young woman who finds her independence through a most harrowing adolescent journey into adulthood. There have been many B-movies out there about mother-daughter tensions, a trying fact of life (or so I've been told), but this story does it beautifully. I have never seen Michele Pfeifer so diabolically cast than in her role as Ingrid, Astrid's mother, a hard-edged artist who, for most of the film, spends her time in prison. With the same self-confident smile that caught men's eyes in her role as Catwoman (it's a guy thing), Pfeifer instead sends a few shivers down your spine with this character. Robin Wright Penn puts forth a great performance as Starr, a born-again Christian, alcoholic, and former stripper; and Renee Zellweger's role as an unsuccessful Hollywood actress with a fragile self-esteem is also notable.
 In the end, we have our protagonist effectively reduced from a princess to an urchin (to borrow a line from The New York Times' review). I was hoping for a bit more closure in the movie's end, but it was just as well. "White Oleander" is a movie not to be missed.
