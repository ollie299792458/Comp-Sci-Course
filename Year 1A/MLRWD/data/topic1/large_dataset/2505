A marvelous movie, such as Last Orders, moves me to
write a review.  The last time I felt so inclined was
after seeing The English Patient.  As I have told any
one who will listen to me here in America, when it
comes to the human condition, no one captures the
essence of life quite as perfectly as the director
who shows the pathos and elan vital of the British
working class. Born and raised in Camberwell Green
for the first twenty years of my life, Last Orders
brought back many memories, Amy could have been my
mother, Ray, my Dad, Jack and Vic, my brothers,Lenny,
my uncle, Vince, a neighbor and June, a cousin.  
I found myself simultaneoursly, both laughing and
crying.  Hearing certain cockney terms, triggered
memories, long forgotten. The manner in which the
story unfolds combining the present with the past
through a series of flashbacks keeps the viewer
fully engaged.  If there was any fault
with the film it would be that perhaps here in
America, some of the dialogue would be lost to the
audience and certain terms misunderstood.  However,
because the actors' are so adept projecting their
emotions, the thrust of the story must be felt by all
who see this treasure.  This film is what
entertainment is about.  It deserves an Oscar
nomination.
