I thought they did a good job with this remake, it was a much faster paced movie, and there were very few boring parts. I liked the more modernized (28 days later/demons) zombies, that run after cars like the T1000 in T2.
 The special effects were brilliant, however the gore and violence paled in comparison to the original Dawn, which in my opinion was one of ther most graphic horror films produced. The stuff in the '04 vesrion was barely G-rated compared to the original. There was a lack of gut munching, and when someone fell victim to a zombie swarm, they kind of let the scene fade out, leaving you to use your imagination.
 All in all, I was pleased, and am looking forward to purchasing this film on dvd this summer, along with the directors cut of the original, which I have on vhs. I reccomend that version to anyone who has not seen it yet, there aren't more zombie scenes, just more interaction with 4 main characters, and a better explanation of the scene when they all meet at the chopper, and have the run in with the police after Steven is caught stealing gas.
