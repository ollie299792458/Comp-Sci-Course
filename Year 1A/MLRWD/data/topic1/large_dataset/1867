Whatever  you feel what went down that fateful day you gotta give him a hand for having the gumption to tell a political story.Hollywood is a gutless and braindead junkyard.I become interested in the JFK case when I first seen this film in the theatre back in '91.I was really impressed by this film.Film has it's own langusge and Oliver Stone is a master of using film to tell a story.This is one of the most engrossing films to watch.It should be studied by film schools and used as a bible on the art of becoming a movie director.I SENSE STONE believes there's a conspircy and cover-up.And a clue leads me to think a general LANSDALE played a important part.All the actors were very good but I was especially impressed  by John Candy as Dean Andrews and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw.I love this film and think its a one of our great american films but there's one or two flaws.First as much as  I love Joe Pesci I think he overdid the David Ferry  part.He comes off as a ranting clown.Also some of family comes of  f bad in diologue.I know Oliver used some F-words so Jim Garrison doesn't come off as  a flawless saint.I wish he could of been more
]subtle.Oliver Stone is not a subtle type of guy.He's the closest thing next to a modern day Sam Fuller.Like Fuller he's passionate and very opinionated.He pisses off alot of folks butwe  need more  people like him .
