I just had to write a review for the first time in my life. I have read many of the reviews on this movie, mostly mainstream newspaper reviews and I have to say that men should not be allowed in general to critique a 'chick flick'.  They have no idea what we like, it was delightful escapsism from the drudgery of everyday life.  It is not meant to be on the level of Shakespeare and I am tired of spotty faced little Herberts giving rotten reviews to movies that they will never understand, they need to get a date first.  Have they looked in the mirror lately, I took my 78 year old neighbor to see the movie, and halfway through she turned to me to utter the famous words "that Dermot Mulroney's very sexy, isn't he".  Coming from a lady who's fire has probably not been lit for a very long time, I thought was recommendation indeed.  Mulroney and Messing worked really well as a romantic couple and had real chemistry.  I will be buying the DVD for my sister and mother who did not get to see the movie, I know it will make their day.  I came out of the movie feeling happy and looking forward to seeing my husband, so I say Yeah!!! for the Wedding Date....
