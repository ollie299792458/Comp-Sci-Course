Terry Jones, like his Monty Python cohort/nemesis Terry Gilliam, has a twisted sense of humor and serene visual style which blend in a way not often seen in popular cinema.  This is evident in Jones' Erik the Viking, a misunderstood gem starring Tim Robbins (perhaps the most talented living American actor, rivaled only by Johnny Depp) as a forward-thinking Viking whose gentle sensibilities conflict with his brutal surroundings.  Like most good movies this one must be viewed more than once for its subtleties to emerge, but in the end - accepting or putting aside the decent acting and those few spots of somewhat unsuccessful lowbrow humor - it is a touching tale, a tale of a group of men who desire peace when peace does not exist, in a world ruled by gods who (&aacute; la Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan) simply don't care whether people on earth are killing each other or not.  Overall Erik the Viking works better as a visual poem and a unique illustration of Norse mythology than a comedy; if you want to laugh out loud, or are expecting the surreal randomness of Monty Python, then try Jones' masterpiece The Life of Brian.
