Many reviews of this movie have already described the movie itself. There are so many ways to perceive of and process The Ghost and the Darkness. What draws me in is the remnant of Africa that responds from within. What stands out for me is what both Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas' characters find in the lions' lair. It is Val Kilmer, the railroad designer, who notices the cave drawing therein. Namely, that of a lion. Shortly thereafter, the viewer sees what could be interpreted as an altar piece. In one place shown, there lies a human skull framed by what might be meant as human bones. This ties in with the indigenous belief of the souls of shamans living again within the lions of Tsavo, on this round. Long ago, huge cave lions existed in the world. Human history is bound up with nature and the animal world. A movie like this keeps that connection alive, no matter how far many have strayed by drawing primarily from the cognitive part of the brain. I also see repeatedly how the men discuss bravery and fear, in light of their vulnerability. Even though swaggering, there is comprehension of how we simply play a part in a huge play filled with a wide array of beings. No matter the point of view, this film touches a deep place still vibrating with life blood.
