If you enjoyed all 4 movies of Superman than this is the set for you (cheaper than buying each movie individually).  However, if you only like 1 or 2 movies; you are better off buying the ones you love only.
The only real star in this set is the first DVD; which is packed with alot of extra features (added/deleted scenes, movie score, screen tests, behind-the-scene documentaries, etc.) However, I wonder why they were unable to incorporate the deleted scenes back into the movie as they did with the added scenes (ran out of space on the DVD?).  Even the short intro to the DVD menu of Superman the Movie was very nice to view.
The other 3 DVD's to follow were VERY disappointing, especially after viewing the first DVD.  All of them only offered a theatrical trailer to the movie and nothing else.
Overall, this set is more for the hardcore Superman fan.
P.S. If you loved the musical score to Superman; consider buying the 2 CD special edition set that is now available (comes with a small booklet).
Also does anyone else remember a scene in one of the Superman movies where Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) types very fast on the typewriter?  A few my friends and I remember seeing this scene when we were kids, however, were unable to find out.  :)
