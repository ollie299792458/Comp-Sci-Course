So yeah, saw the preview and of course James Cameron's (Alien's, the Abyss, and Terminator 2) name attached to it and felt pretty confident this would be a well done thriller. Well, looks were deceiving in this case. First off, this is one of the worst blu ray transfers I have ever seen. Most of the visuals were still amazing, but it was disappointing that they were grainy. Second, the acting and writing here is extremely poor. It's hard to care about any of the characters or believe they are actually in peril when you're constantly cringing. Third, the story never reaches its potential...it doesn't do enough to hold an audience for more than five minutes at a time. I understand that the intent was to make a realistic movie, but come on, even if they had thrown in some cheesy cave monster or some tribe of underground cavemen at least the movie have been interesting. I'm not saying that this movie necessarily needed a major plot change...it's just that I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen that would make me care, it never did. I am relieved that I picked up a used blu ray copy rather than spending over $20 for a new copy I will probably end up giving away.

The blu ray extras where nothing to get excited about. There is a short documentary featuring the actors and of course James Cameron talking about the making of the film. Most of which centers around the actors talking about their experience working with green screen/CGI technology and whining about how difficult the stunts were.

In the end this is a movie you can feel free to skip. If you really want to see a movie about people trapped in caves then considers the movie "The Descent".
