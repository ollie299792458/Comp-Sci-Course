the interviews with the members of the band are excellent. as for having them sitting in a tree with a phone and all that other BS, that was really stooopid. does john french really live in a tree? oh, how nutty! do the neighboring squirrels approve? the opinions and insights of the british music nitwits were beyond IRRITATING. buffoons! you'll want to hit the mute button when they are talking!  ergh!  complete NITWITS. the footage & interviews of the band(s) are great, though just quick snips of music performances. the velvet underground "under review" dvd suffers from the same mentioned above,... though i really wish moe tucker could have been interviewed at the kenmore vacuum repair center wearing scuba gear. too bad the last velvet underground/doug yule 1973 LP "squeeze" was ignored AS USUAL! GEEZ! . if you like VU's "loaded" era, you'll like "squeeze" - it's a good f-ing record! anyway, the 3 star DVD ratings are for the band members interview info and the brief video footage of the bands. keep the remote control in your hand while watching these dvd's.
