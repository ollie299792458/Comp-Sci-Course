When Reds was realeased in theaters, I saw it and was blown away, by the subject matter, the acting and the use of "witnesses" who commented on the historical John Reed and Louise Bryant.  The movie holds up surprisingly well.  The lead performances are indeed superb.  But the special edition is ultimately extremely disappointing because the special features are a squandered opportunity.  Warren Beatty says in his interview he doens't really care for DVD intervierws.  And after hearing him natter on about production trivia, neither do we.  "The making of.." could have been a single interesting feature, not all the features, as here.  Where is the documentary about the real John Reed and Louise Bryant?  Where is the feature explaining who these "witnesses" are and how they were chosen?  25 years later all the producers could come up with is Warren Beatty, diminishing the power of his own performance by his own self-involved chatter.  Jack Nicholson says "Reds" is educational, but its real educational value could have come with thoughtful DVD features tilting toward actual historical reality.  This DVD is really a shame.
