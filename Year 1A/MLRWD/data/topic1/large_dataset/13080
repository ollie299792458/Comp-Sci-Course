The fact that you are reading this shows your interest in this film.  I can tell you now that you should purchase this DVD as soon as you finish reading this.  Not only do you get two films on one disc but there is an excellect commentary track as well as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I find the 1932 version the better of the two.  Not only are the special effects better but so are the acting and pacing.  For example, early in the 1932 film Dr. Jekyll makes his ideas known in a dramatic speech to a group of university professors. The 1941 film has Dr. Jekyll making his comments over a dinner conversation, it doesn't hold the viewers interest as well as the older film.  Also, the makeup of the 1932 film turns Mr. Hyde uglier after each transformation.  This helps to emphasize his more horrible behavior as the film goes on.  The makeup on the final transformation is so extreme that, according to the commentary, March had to be hospitalized in order to prevent his face from being scarred for life.  The older film also makes good use of several scenes with split screens.
The best way to compare the films is to see them for yourself, so do yourself a favor and order it now.
