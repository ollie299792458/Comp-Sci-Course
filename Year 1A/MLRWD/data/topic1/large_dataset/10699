Other reviewers( Lucie) have so brilliantly described the contents and lengths of each section that I can't improve, so I'll go on.
What I enjoyed about this DVD is what I enjoy about all of the Ravi/Ana DVD's.  I like the positive speech.  In this DVD particularly, you are encouraged to be a better you.  You are great now, but you can be even better.  I think that the general population needs to know this because of all of the negative speech we're hammered with daily from the media, family, etc.
I also felt like this DVD gave me tools to use to "purge" (for lack of a better word) the past negatives in my life and focus on the present.  Purify your Past was most favorite segment of the DVD.  The physical actions are difficult for me, but I translate that to the working through past mental/emotional pains and when the physical pains is gone, so is the past mental/emotional pain.  I plan to use this segment frequently, even if I only do the one segment.
I, as always, appreciate the ability to manage my time by only practicing segments time allows for on that day.  The matrix options on the Ana/Ravi DVD's are still my favorites of all DVD's.
The music is beautiful, the cueing is great, the reasoning for the asana is appreciated...over all a great DVD practice.
