What a treat it was to introduce my wife to the original Stargate movie after we had already begun buying and watching the boxed sets from the television series. We enjoyed it immensely. I'd always wondered why this movie didn't get the same appreciation as other classics such as Star Wars, Terminator, and maybe even Dune (mini-series). It is interesting to see how the original characters brought to the screen by Kurt Russell and James Spader were carried forward by Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks.

Amazon's review calls this 'hokey' and that's a shame. It's just a lot of fun and shouldn't be taken any more seriously than Star Trek or any of the other films in its genre. In fact, I appreciated that they didn't try to caption the other world denizens when they spoke their language; their faces were expressive enough to convey meaning. I always liked James Spader's passionate sincerity.

The Blu-ray re-production is nicely done, retaining its film grain and theater feeling. I would have liked some extra features but I'm appreciative that it has been released in this format.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HIVOI2">Stargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray</a>]
