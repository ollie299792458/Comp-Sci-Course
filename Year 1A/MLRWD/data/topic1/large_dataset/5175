Not since Steve Mcqueen in "Bullitt" or Paul Newman in "Cool Hand Luke" has there been a movie that can stand shoulder to shoulder with these two classics. Through circumstances beyond the titles roles character he becomes a hero/leader not because he wants to  (because he doesn't) but because he is his "own man" willing to stand against the wall of establishment for what he believes in (think of the Chinese man standing if front of the Chinese army tank in Tennemen Square blocking it's path during the political chaos there) Tigerland is the first movie shot digitally and transferred to tape.  Tigerland is a "mock" Vietnam jungle  and the last phase of training for these marines before they are shipped off to the real Vietnam. Set in the last phase of the Vietnam War prior to the pullout,Colin Farrell the loner, enters helping other recruits get a military discharge who do not want to go Vietnam for fear of coming back horizontally in a body-bag. Himself,against the war,  becomes the center of focus as a leader of his platoon by not wanting to be one. All the characters are well defined. This is not a war movie,but what happens or could've happened and represents the thinking of that time,that being that America was questioning why are we involved in this war as well the recruits who didn't believe in blind faith anymore. Through Colin Farrell they are given eyes to see as well accepting destiny himself.
