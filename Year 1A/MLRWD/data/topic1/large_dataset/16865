The Battle for Terra was an independently produced 3D animation film that was in theaters in May.  It played in some festivals like Tribeca and won Best Animated Feature at Ottowa Animation Festival, which is THE animation festival (Oscar nom Persepolis won the year prior). It got rave reviews from film critics like Ebert and Variety, but was purchased by Lionsgate who didn't market it properly, hence a disappointing box office for this gusty little animated film. Which is especially a shame because in 3D it was achingly beautiful, definitely the very best use of 3D I've seen. Felt like you were swimming right along in that other world with gorgeous creatures like winged blue whales that roam among the clouds.

Also notable was the top notch casting. Evan Rachel Wood is especially excellent as the voice of adorable alien heroine, and Brian Cox haunting as the creepy Bush-like warmonger General. David Cross, one of the the best comedians out there right now, gave brief bits of comic relief as testy robot sidekick.

A great movie for families, who can enjoy the visuals and drama while giving kids an intelligent intro into ethics, environmentalism, ethnocentrism, and more. This is how family movies should be--entertainment that challenges kids to think.

Despite the poster, this touching film is much more than an action movie. Highly recommended!
