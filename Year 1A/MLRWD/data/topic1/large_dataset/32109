This is a magnificent British comedy that is all heart. From the stodgy weekly W.I. meetings to the globe trotting gals with a cause, the story of Chris and Annie will truly show why we do the things we do for those we love.

Based on a true story, these women brought art and humor to what is traditionally a difficult time. After Annie lost her brave husband to leukemia, she and Chris set out to make a difference for those who will have to face the same in the future. Told from the point of view of Chris, who masterminds the photo shoots, press releases and gives a stirring speech in front of the congress of the W.I., Helen Mirren delivers a top notch performance that will have you rooting for the girls in no time.

There comes to be a bit of a rift that the celebrity status the women gain to those who chose to be on the calendar. In the small town in England where they live, many people shook their heads and said the most unpleasant things. As we all know this can be difficult on families and we see the bond the women have to help triumph the greater cause while coming together to support one another.

I must also mention the bonus material on the dvd. It includes interviews with the real women and some background on the calendar that the film was unable to cover. The material is very well done and adds a delightful bonus to see the actual women that brought this all together.

The performances in this film were excellent and the English countryside that we are treated to as the ladies do their Tai Chi is breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would proudly stage the same rally for such a worthy cause.
