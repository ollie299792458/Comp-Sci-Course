This is a great example of a Euro-Western that delivers on the hype and/or reputation that surrounds it.
I heard and read about it and was curious despite knowing the outcome. [People can't seem to help giving it away.]
Most Westerns suffer from being saddled (pun!) with repetitious plot elements. If you watch enough of these you can get a little bored with almost endless variations on revenge and money grubbing along with characters who can shoot six flies out of midair.
All that is overcome here by all of the various things that make certain Spaghetti Westerns stand out.
An excellent hero by Trintignant who delivers despite being given a tough task by not having any lines. Kinski's amoral villian I liked mostly because you understood him to a degree. Nasty, yes, but having decent bounty money waiting to be had is just asking for men of his caliber to come calling.
[Note: If you recall, this was Gene Hackman's Sheriff Daggett's prime fear in "Unforgiven".]
One his best Western roles and he did many.
Need I mention the Morricone score? Did he ever do a bad one?
But ultimately what did it for me on this movie were the spectacular snow-bound settings. Breathtaking...worth viewing for this alone.
