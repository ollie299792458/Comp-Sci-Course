I might as well add my voice to the mounting chorus of "Where are the rest of the seasons?"  Leave It To Beaver is one of those special and rare sitcoms that you can enjoy with the entire family and remember those good 'ol days where boys listened to LP records, had "crushes" on teenage girls and had to wear nose-gear(Wally):), skipped school, or just simply threw baseball against the side of the house.  Beaver was funny but at the same time very respectful of the era that it promoted:  kids respected their parents and parents were very clear on rules, obedience, and manners.  For example, Wally asks his mom if he can get a tattoo - and mom simply states "Why of course you can't". - Wally simply replies "ok, bye Mom" (or something similar to that effect) - these were typical replies of the show which made it even funnier and to the point.

Leave It To Beaver is such a great show and with only 2 seasons released, one can only hope that with more and more complaints, the "powers that be" will hopefully listen and bring on the rest, so that we can all enjoy more of Beaver, Wally, Lumpy, Eddie and the rest of the gang.  This show is worth every penny that it would cost to be released and it is only fitting and proper that it be done with grace and dignity since Beaver has been promoted in re-runs and syndication for over 40 years.  "Hey Beaver.  We Miss Ya!!"
