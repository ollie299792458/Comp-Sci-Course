I don't recall Captain Nemo (as played by Patrick Stewart) being this pouty, petulant, or quite as childish.  I also don't recall his being relegated to a special guest star role.  And while I'm at it, that bandana was a bit off-putting.  Even his man servant Joseph (Roy Marsden) was more sinister.  This was more like the absentminded professor living in Jurassic Park.
Even more unsettling was the jokey approach used throughout, even while a praying mantis was biting the head off the confederate soldier.
Daffy pirates in never ending supply, an island that looked tiny from the air but boundless on the ground, humongous monsters roaming freely (and their food supply was?); this was the Classics Illustrated version of the novel (for those who don't recall or aren't of a certain era, Classics Illustrated were comic book versions of great novels published in the 40s through the early 60s.  Think of them as Cliff Notes with pictures).
I won't say this was the worst version ever made of Jules Verne's work but it certainly wasn't the greatest either.  To say a great deal of license was taken is putting it mildly (under the circumstances, maybe their license should be revoked?).  It was watchable, I'll give them that.  I don't believe, however, that should be one's goal when making entertainment.  No one involved seemed inclined to aspire to anything higher.  Hallmark aside, this looked like something the SyFy channel routinely showcases.
Not a keeper but I'm not sorry I watched it this one time.
