I just watched this movie for the second time and I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the first time and now I can say that it's a very good movie!

Usually when I read a review for a scary movie, I want to know how scary it is, so that's what I'm gonna tell!

I'm definitely not someone who gets scared easily. I've seen over 1000 horror movies and the only ones that I find scary are The Eye and Shutter (both are asian and are about ghosts)! Movies like Ringu and Ju-On are also fairly scary, but not as scary as The Eye and Shutter. I have to say that, usually, before I watch a movie that is supposed to be scary, I put myself in the mood to be scared (I just love to be scared) and it worked really well with this movie! There are a lot of unexpected scenes in The Eye 2, the sound effects are really freaky, a lot of really weird stuff happens and there are a couple of scenes with a lot of tension! Most of the scary scenes made me jump only, but there are some that made me feel pretty damn uneasy! I don't think that there's anything scarier than a good ghost movie because no one knows if ghosts exist or not and the idea that maybe they exist is scary as hell!

Scarier than any American horror movies coming out these days for sure!

Note: This review was written in 2007. Before one of the scariest movies ever (Paranormal Activity) was released!
