(Assuming that the reader has read the synopsis...)

Wow, Jennifer Aniston actually CAN act and Jake Gyllenhaal was very good, (pay attention to the little things he adds to the story and his character). I personally wouldn't have even watched this movie in the first place if it wasn't for the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors, but I am glad I did. The story really isn't that complex or abnormal, just one of one woman's unsatisfaction with her life, and how she realizes that she has the power to make life what she wants it to be. She thinks she has found someone in Holden who, unlike her stoner husband, can really understand her. The end is the unique part, you can make of it whatever you choose. You can look at it as dark, a comedy, or light with its dark parts. This is a film that will leave a lasting impression on you, and make you take a step back and look at your own life. Basically, the story isn't complex, but the insight to the deepest of human emotions and tendencies make this a worth-while film.
