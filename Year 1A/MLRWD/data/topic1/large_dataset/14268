Seth Rogen is getting quite a resume started these days. He has starred in such films as 'Knocked Up', & 'Zach and Miri Make a Porno.' He's also made cameos in 'Step Brothers', 'AnchorMan', and 'You, Me and Dupree.' With that in mind, you can guess Rogan's new project, 'Pineapple Express' follows on par with his other films, truly making Mr. Rogen as 'The King Of Stoners' the world over.

 There is no way you could see "Express" as anything but face value; two losers witness a murder, and go stupid. Punchlines range from funny to really funny, and everything in-between. Pineapple was made, executed and approved by guys who are blazed, so this audience should be strictly for druggies only. But if you're not totally baked while watching this flick, never fret for you and I would see this as a documentary showing a full 2 days in the life of roach rollers. Be warned: if you're not a fan of the likes of 'Moonajuana', you're gonna think of Express as a serious disappointment (what were you looking for, a comedy that the whole family can enjoy?) You would be wrong, because it's constant bong jokes from start to finish. Seriously, that's 100 percent of the goods so it's definitely a love or hate experiance.
