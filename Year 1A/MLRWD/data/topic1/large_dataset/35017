I won't repeat what most of the reviewers have written except to underline the fact that this film was very moving. Telling loved ones their spouse, child, sibling or sweetheart has been killed in combat has to be the hardest task outside of actual combat. Personally, I'd rather take my chances with combat.

Something that added to the realism of the film, of course, is the reaction of the bereaved families. What is not widely known is that neither Harrelson or Foster knew what the reactions of the families would be. This put them in the same position as actual military "messengers" when they encounter families of the fallen soldiers/sailors/airmen/Marines. No script, just raw emotional responses. I've never seen Woody Harrelson better.

I have a son currently in Afghanistan (for the third time) and I felt tugging at my heart every time they walked up to a door. While the "Hurt Locker" was a great film, its' emotional impact paled by comparison with "The Messenger".
