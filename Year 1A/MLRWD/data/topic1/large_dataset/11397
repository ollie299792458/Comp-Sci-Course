Clint Eastwood surpasses the realm of just a "good classic western film," here he has managed to create a masterpiece.  Eastwood himself refers to this as one of his most important films, following the equally great "Unforgiven."

The 1976 film opens with Josey's family being violently slaughtered, sending the Outlaw into a remarkable wrath of revenge.  Without giving too much away, the road to death soon becomes the road to redemption.

Eastwood and company incorporated wonderful two handed gunplay, laugh out loud humor, magnificent character development and overall a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.

The remastered edition is a God sent.  The anamorphic widescreen has never looked better.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack brings new life to the picture.

I personally loath the Warner Bros. snap cases, but the Clint Eastwood Collection is well worth the frustration.  Eastwood's films deserve so much better, such as the treatment of the 2004 3 Disc set release of the dark and spectacular "Mystic River."

The Outlaw Josey Wales throws away the formula of the standard "Western."  Maybe that's why it's charm and the power and patience of Eastwood is undeniable.
