Few animated movies can produce such remarks.

It has toilet and slapstick humor for kids, smart references to Clint Eastwood and Apocalypse Now, and every scene had a grimy but extremely realistic attention to detail that made this film stand out compared to other animated movies.

It is not good as Toy Story (what will?) but at least one director and one studio isn't afraid to make (giant) leaps in the animation genre to produce a timeless and entertaining film.

Sure some kids won't understand the true "spirit of the west" or the countless references to high noon or The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, but for someone looking for an animated that has more than just stellar animation (Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon; all good movies mind you), Rango nails it.

This is what I would love to see from every movie. Pushing the boundaries so when we go to the theaters we are overflowed with originality.

P.S.

For all the other movie goers who are out there rating one star because of fowl language, etc., you might want to look at the content descriptors on the movie site or a poster. It clearly states language. And a giving a film 1 star because they say Hell or damn or there is roadkill in a road just shows ignorance.

Rango easily rounds up a 5 star review.
