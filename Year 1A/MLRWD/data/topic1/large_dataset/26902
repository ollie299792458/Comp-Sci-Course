I saw this movie when it came out and fell in love with it.

It doesn't try to overwhelm you with a liberal agenda of some sort.  (Becoming a lesbian doesn't inherently make you liberal, although, in my world, it would.)

It doesn't revolve the story around a lusty sex scene.  (I enjoy them, but there's something to be said for the romantic simplicity of the kiss.)

It doesn't try  to squeeze in every single member of the lgbtiq community like we're an amusing freak show.  (With some movies, I find myself yelling, "It's a gay movie, I get it!")

...This movie simply tries to tell the story of two girls in love, nothing else.  It does it in a quirky, Notting-Hill type of way and that makes it all the better.  At least for people like myself, who are sick of imagining Harry, of When Harry Met Sally, as a curly-haired butch.

By being so formulaic and true to the romantic comedy genre, this movie becomes radical.  You WANT Rachel to follow her heart and get her mate, who just happens to be another woman.  It doesn't even dawn on you that what you're cheering for is lesbianism--why is this such a dividing issue again?
