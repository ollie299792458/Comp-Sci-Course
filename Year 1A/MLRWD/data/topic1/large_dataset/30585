Here is how I would rate this product:

- Packaging......: 8 / 10
- Video Quality..: 10 / 10
- Arrangement....: 10 / 10
- Overall........: 9.5 / 10

For anyone who purchased the previous Complete Series which was released in 2008, you know how horrible it was arranged and packaged.  Most people who ordered the old version received it in shambles.  The discs were scattered throughout the box and many people reported scratched or damaged discs.

The packaging for this new product is much better.  Each season is packaged in its own rigid plastic case (same style as most DVDs come in).  Each case has an individual cardboard sleeve, and all 4 seasons fit into a simple cardboard cover.

I purchased my copy off a store shelf (I didn't have it shipped).  At the store, there were 3 copies on the shelf, and unfortunately, all three copies "rattled" when I tipped them over, which indicated to me that there were probably loose discs inside.  I chose the copy which had the smallest "rattle" to it.  When I opened the product, I found that Seasons 1 and 2 were packaged with a foam cushion which prevented them from moving around.  Seasons 3 and 4 had no cushion, and 3 of these discs had come loose. There was no damage to any of the discs.

I found the packaging to be satisfactory, but if I needed to buy a 2nd copy, I would most likely purchase it from a store where I can "shake" the product before buying.

In regard to extra features, I personally will not rate this.  I don't usually watch the extras, nor do I care about the table of contents and other inserts that come with these kinds of products.  I was only sharing my experience with the packaging of the product.  I hope this information is helpful to anyone who may be hesitant after the horrible quality of the 2008 product.
