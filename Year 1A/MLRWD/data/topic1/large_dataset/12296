Okay...where to start...Guy Ritchie's camera work and script are tight and intense.  The dialogue's very well-written and quoteable.  The acting is great, especially Brad Pitt's turn as a barely understandable gypsy boxer.  Jason Statham (Turkish) has built a burgeoning career off his two Ritchie movies, and it's well-deserved.  Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones are great in their roles, and Benicio del Toro does well in his rather understated role.  Rade Sherbedgia is hilarious as Boris the Blade.
The camera work is excellent.  Guy Ritchie uses some great camera techniques that work well and really throw you into the movie.  The soundtrack is varied and excellent.  You won't see a song from The Specials and an Oasis song on one soundtrack very often.  The music is used very well and sets the tone and pacing for the scene.  The sound quality is excellent, and the transfer, even on the regular release, is one of the better ones I've seen.
The special features are interesting...not too involving, but some of the deleted scenes are hilarious and really should've made the final cut of the movie.
I'd recommend at least renting this movie.  It's not for everyone, but it's got classic British humor and a twisting plot that's really several sub-plots that end up being tied together in one scene and then branch back out again.
