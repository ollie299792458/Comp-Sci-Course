Although I am a Shakespeare scholar, I am not what one might call a "purist".  That is, I can enjoy film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays which do not include every word of the text, which rearrange lines and/or leave out dozens of lines at a time.  Such an adaptation is Trevor Nunn's.  He even includes Shakespeare-LIKE added dialogue at the beginning of the film along with scenes which Shakespeare did not write, since, unfortunately, Shakespeare did not have the advatage of cinema.  A professor once told me that Shakespeare would have loved film, especially for Antony and Cleopatra, which jumps back and forth frequently between Alexandria and Rome.  The same may be said of Twelfth Night, which "cuts" from various outdoor settings in Illyria to Orsino's dwelling to Olivia's house to Olivia's grounds.  Trevor Nunn's adaptation takes full advantage of these cinemamatic advantages.

I have one quibble, however, and it is considerable.  I know that actors in a film should not "declaim", in stagey deliveries of lines from plays, especially Shakespeare's.  However, I do expect the speeches, however "naturally" they are delivered to be intelligible, at audible volume.  Such, it seemed to me, is not always the case with Nunn's adaptation.  Actors often mumble or practically whisper their lines (especially true of Helena Bonham Carter), and if I were not familiar with the play, I would have no idea of what they are saying.  I find it disappointing that the director should not have noted this during the rushes (or whenever) and sharpened the delivery so that more of Shakespeare's irreplaceable lines could be distinctly heard and understood.

However, Trevor Nunn's film of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is remarkably successful in most instances, and this is largely due to the perfect casting.
