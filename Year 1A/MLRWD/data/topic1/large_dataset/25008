Although the last of the Magdalene laundries shut down in 1996, their driving spirit is with us today across the globe.

 Religious fundamentalism thrives on two core concepts: that those who profess its beliefs have been blessed with an insight into the mind of God that eludes people of different viewpoints; and that all deviation in thinking or action from the proscribed path must be stamped out, with the force of the state -- or with violence -- if necessary.

 And the upsurge of this fundamentalism is a global, pan-religion phenomenon in 2004. The Taliban would enforce the subjugation of women. Al-Quaida would reverse the flow of history and create a medieval theocracy across the mideast. Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel would proscribe people of insufficient racial purity from holding high office. And conservative U.S. Christians would lay claim to tax dollars for their faith-based initiatives, consign the Bill of Rights to the dustbin of history, and ban all relationships between consenting adults not to their liking.

 For anyone who thinks the stakes are not high in this struggle, let them watch The Magdalene Sisters. These events happened. They happened at the hands of an ostensibly charitable church sanctioned by a state that delegated its power to judge and punish to religious zealots. Imprisonment without due process. Presumptive guilt. Total conformity in thought and behavior imposed arbitrarily on one person by another. Brutal punishment brought down on the slightest breath of protest or disclosure. A few escaped. Most withered into spiritual nothingness to grow old in an isolated, perpetually gray world of fear and endless slave labor.

 The movie lasted two hours. The events it reports lasted lifetimes. This is the scariest movie I have seen in years.
