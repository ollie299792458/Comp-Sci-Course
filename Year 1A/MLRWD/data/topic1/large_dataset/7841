The film claims to be based on Barbara Branden's book but from what I've seen of it, it also draws heavily on Nathaniel Branden's "memoir" of his symbiotic relationship with Ayn Rand.  A previous reviewer complains of words put in Rand's mouth that were not in Barbara's book.  They all seem to appear in Nathaniel's.  
Ayn Rand worshippers probably will hate the film because it does seem to emphasize her hypocrisies.  But hey, nobody is perfect and Rand still comes off as a very vital woman and an uncompromising intellect.  Well, uncompromising until she starts rationalizing her increasingly emotionally dependent relationship with Nathaniel.
I find the story to be mostly balanced and of course the talent in the film is unsurpassed.  Put that together with the compelling story and I have to give it 5 stars.  
The only disquiet I may have is that viewers who may not have read the 2 books will not have an appreciation for the charm that her 2 foremost disciples claim Ayn Rand to have had, despite her often icy exterior.
