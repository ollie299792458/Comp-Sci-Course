Back in 1994, I went to see this movie on a whim because there was nothing else playing at the time. I tell you, I was so  thoroughly pleased, entertained and touched by the perfomances and storyline, I went back to see it again!  At that time, the only actor I knew of any fame was Terrance Stamp, but the other two gentleman (Pearce and Weaving) have both gone on to be huge actors in their own right.  Each of these gentleman bring depth and consistency to their characters and you find yourself really pulled into their journey across the Outback. You find yourself laughing, rejoicing, crying and just feeling wonderful when they perform their acts and interact with each other and those around them.

Watching the growth and the bonding between the characters is quite touching.  And just when you think, the movie will take a full sappy/serious turn, it instead injects light-hearted comic moments which pull you in even further.

This is a Cult Classic and a genuinely terrific movie!  The colorful costumes, the music, the acting and the many characters they meet alone the way truly is a feast for the eyes and spirit.
