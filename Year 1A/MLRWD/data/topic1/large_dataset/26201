Saw this movie when it first came out and bought it on VHS and then DVD so I've watched it quite a few times. Sure would be interesting to find out how it came to be made right in the middle of the Vietnam conflict - with no typical Hollywood political message that I can discern. It's like as if a bunch of old school he-man actors got together over beers one night and suddenly declared, "Hey guys! Let's make a war movie!" You can tell these guys are having a great time. The whole "band of brothers" kind of bonding. But there is one thing that makes this movie special and unique in the annals of moviemaking, and it took me several viewings to suddenly go "aha!" And that is, no woman has a speaking part in the narrative. (Unless I missed something, and not counting the crowd scene) Now how did that happen? A war flick with no females? Just a bunch of guys with guns? No worried mothers or abandoned girlfriends or weeping widows or "Hotlips Hoolihan" nurses or local girls on the prowl for nylon stockings and Hershey bars? Just Clint and the boys killing Nazis and having a grand old time in the process? What's up with that? Of course a film like this could never be made again. And that is what makes it The Ultimate Guy Flick.
