I saw this film during the few hours it was in the theaters.  Gods and Generals has a profound emotional impact if you are willing to let it in.  The massive sacrifice made by both sides is made very clear.  If you dislike religion and are so thin-skinned that you can't let that go in favor of a realistic portrayal of the times then this film is sure to rub you the wrong way.  Technically, the film had highs and lows, but overall we were treated to some amazing views of our history.  However, the cannons used in the Civil War did not gently recoil 1 to 2 feet as shown, and, when firing grapeshot at 100 yards, the result was a huge swath of bloody destruction, not just a few men falling over. On the minus side, it is true that the film depicted a remarkably genteel relationship between slaves and their owners, but perhaps something of a contrarian view on this subject is not such a bad thing.  I think we all understand now that slavery was a great evil.  This movie is not going to reverse that understanding.  Also, let's not forget that the overwhelming majority of the South's soldiers were there to defend the homeland, not to specifically uphold slavery (Of course, the result was the same, and we will have to let God sort out their responsibility). I personally thank Ted Turner for this fine film with its unique perspective, and I hope that its poor reception by the critics will not deter him from completing the trilogy.
