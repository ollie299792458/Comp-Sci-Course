Contrary to a lot of people's beliefs, this movie is not a rip on Total Recall, just merely along the same lines of internal conflict.  People who have recently seen the outstanding "I Robot" will no doubt see where some of the inspiration came.  Just as Will Smith is wary of the robots, Schwarzneggar's Adam character is wary of a pet-cloning company called RePet.  The plot goes that the president of the most powerful cloning company is assasinated by anti-cloning radicals in a helicopter with Adam's friend, who was identified to be Adam.  Because of this, the President and Adam are both cloned and Adam comes home to find his clone celebrating his own birthday through the window.  Arnie then goes on a hunt to track down the cloning operation and get to the bottom of the huge mess that has been thrust into his life.
Like "I Robot", the movie has a great amount of twists and turns, and like "Total Recall", Arnold wonders who he is (6th day- Am I a clone?  Total Recall - is this real, or just part of the Recall program?)  The movie is also fairly family friendly (save for a few violent but bloodless/suggestive scenes) and is PG-13, an absolute rarity for an Arnold action movie, especially considering the graphic and gratuitous violence of "Total Recall".  Arnold also plays an average joe, not a killing maching like in "Commando", which is refreshing.  Having said all that, this is a great rental movie for average viewers, and if you liked "I Robot" or "Total Recall" (or love Ah-nuld, hey, who doesn't? :-)  then this is well worth the price of admission.
