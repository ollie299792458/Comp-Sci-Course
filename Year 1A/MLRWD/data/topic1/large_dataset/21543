I was in my early twenties without kids when the "Iron Giant" came out at the movies so I missed out on seeing this at the movies.  Well, recently I picked up this movie for my two year old son (who loves this movie), and I was completly amazed at how good this movie is.

When I started watching this movie I forgot that it was animated and was completly sucked into the story, and for me the story is the best part of this movie.  I expected a cute little buddy movie about a boy and a robot, but what I got was a story about friendship, and being whatever you want to be.

This really is a great movie for kids, but not just kids for adults as well.

The characters are nice, and well developed.  I love Harry Connick Jr's character, and the little boy (Hogarth).

And if all that wasn't enough to make it a good movie, the movie is really funny.

The part where Hogarth is praying, had me rolling on the floor, as did the part where they all go swimming.

Please do yourself a favor, pick this one up and watch it with your kids.
