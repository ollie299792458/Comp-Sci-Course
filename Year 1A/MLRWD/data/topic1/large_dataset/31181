Here's about all the general information you can know without seeing this film yourself:

-The names of the characters and the plotlines in the film use a heavy amount of Jung's psychological work.  Look up the Wiki on this movie and there's a little section to give you an idea.
-The film is most explicitly about the search for meaning in our lives.
-The film is implicitly about the need to stop searching for meaning and, in so many words, follow the stage directions.
-These concepts have both been covered, albeit in different ways, by others before Kaufman.
-The film jumps vast lengths of time between scenes, often at unlikely points.  In one scene, the main character begins making love with a woman he has just begun to date.  Cut to a three-second shot of their marriage.  Cut to a conversation in their home; they now have a four-year-old daughter.  Skip four or more years in a matter of seconds, with no warning or change in rhythm.
-The film is complex.  Characters are played by actors who are themselves characters.  Identity crises happen regularly.

That's a really general idea.  Honestly, I recommend you see it.  The reason I recommend it has something to do with it being my favorite movie, or close to it at the very least.  I like the narrative oddity because as much as it surprised me, it never lost me.  I was able to stick with it all the way through, and I feel as though if you can, it's rewarding.

But seriously, if you haven't seen it, what are you doing buying it?!  Rent it.  Watch it.  Love/hate it.  Decide whether or not to buy it accordingly.  What are my reviews to you?!
