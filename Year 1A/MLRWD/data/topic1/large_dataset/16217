I personally am not a superhero comic book reader, nor am I really a fan of the genre.  This movie changed my perspective on all of that.  I had been skeptical of even watching this particular film.  Before this movie I honestly didn't find Robert Downey Jr. to be a compelling actor.  Boy was I wrong.  Downey is spectacular as Tony Stark and has proved to me to be a very capable iconic character actor. (His portrayal of Holmes was great too but that's another review).  He's funny, snarky, flawed, and not the traditional hero that we are all so used to, which made me root for him even more.  He makes us love Tony despite the fact that the character's demeanor is meant to not be liked.  The graphics are great, the story is strong, and kudos for Gwen Paltrow. Her role as Pepper Potts is also nontraditional.  She's not the damsel in distress we're all use to, and is the perfect opposite for Downey's role. This is a refreshing new take of a superhero story and has thrown me head first into the whole Marvel universe as a new fan. Strong Cast and just a fun movie to watch.  Highly suggested for everyone, even the non superhero types out there.
