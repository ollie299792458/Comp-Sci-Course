Closer struck me as a cross between Anna Karenina, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and modern society, cinematised. It's unusual; that much is certain. It has four characters, most unlikable, though Natalie Portman gives her character a charm that merits her Oscar nomination.

The film is undeniably explicit and confronting, and, for an eighteen year old, watching it with one's parents is not quite ideal. The script is lined with a very sexual vocabulary, more so than, perhaps, any other film I have seen thus far. My parents thought this was unnecessarily explicit, while I felt it gave the film's relationships more grit and complexity.

Closer entices and repels simultaneously, drawing the viewer's interest whilst pushing away their sympathies. It is littered with beauty, and a kind of gritty, repulsive sort of tragedy, the result being something that does not glorify the ugly, but that captures the complexity of life, with its sprinklings of whimsy amongst the ashes of grotesquery.

All in all, Closer is art. It has artistic sensibilities and tone to it, and should be viewed not for entertainment, nor as beauty, but for the simply astounding clash of experiences it offers.
