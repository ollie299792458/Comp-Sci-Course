'Igby Goes Down' is an unsettling dark comedy about Igby (Kieran Culkin), a young man raised in the cold and hostile environment of the amoral super-rich. The only positive influence in his life is his father (Bill Pullman), a schizophrenic who rebels against the dictatorship of his wealth and his icy wife (played by the excellent Susan Sarandon), only to dissolve into a catatonic state. Taking after dear old dad, Igby makes one attempt after another to break free from his family's clutches and their ironclad expectations of how he should act and who he should be. Enduring military school and near homelessness in New York City, Igby experiences some of the more mundane aspects of a coming-of-age film (love, sex, violence). 
But 'Igby Goes Down' is far from a mundane film. Igby is an imperfect hero, not surprisingly because he was raised by the original Ice Maiden. There are elements of this coldness in his own character, which makes it difficult to sympathize completely his plight.
For that matter, there is coldness in all the characters, save Sookie (Clare Danes). Jeff Goldblum is surprisingly perfect as DH Barnes, an indifferent wife-cheating "friend of the family" who treats Igby with only the barest of interests. Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is Igby's perfect older brother, accordingly cold, calculating, and ever-opportunistic. Rachel (Amanda Peet) and Russel (Jared Harris) make up Igby's surrogate family in the City, and despite drug addiction and various dementias, actually seem better suited for Igby than his real family. 
This film has been compared to the classic novel, 'The Catcher in the Rye,' and indeed, there are some similarities. Igby is a saner, heartier Holden Caulfield, who survives on wit and a callousness to the savage world around him. A stunning and often funny film, that, like Igby, just seems unable to pull free from icy wit into real brilliance.
