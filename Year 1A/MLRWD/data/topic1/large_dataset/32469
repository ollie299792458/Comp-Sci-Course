It was definatly time that Warner Home video release Lust For Life, but for all that wait they have given us what can only be described as an adequate presentation of one of MGM's true gems.  The picture quality of film's transfer is unjustly dark throughout, deminissing the intended luminus pallette of colors that one would associates with the work of Van Gogh and the innovative process of  MetroColor.  It appears that no effort was taken to restore the film at all, and to add insult to injury, on an other wise extra-less disc Warner as found a way to create a digital looking transfer with macro blocking and edge enhancement throughout.

Even the lack of such simple details as the ommission of an insert card or disc artwork showcase yet again Warner's complete lack effort when producing this DVD.

The only bonus allotted, is a wonderfully dense commentary by Minnelli Historian Dr. Drew Casper.  It's a very dry, but informative track that would seem more at home on a Criterion Collection DVD rather than the normally lighter-fare Warner commentaries.  Its inclusion here only serves to taunt the buyer by giving them only a tiny morsel of what could have been a smorgasbord of extras.

Anyone who has seen Lust for Life on Tuner Classic Movies has seen the wonderful period making of documentary they bookend the film with, so why is this not included on the disc. With a track record like Warner's, the lack of extras on this disc is inexcusable.

Do I recommend you buy the DVD?  Emphatically, YES!  The cheap retail price and importance of the film for both Kirk Douglas and Minnelli fans make it a must buy.  If only someone at Warner showed this release the love that its many fans have for it we might one day see a better edition.
