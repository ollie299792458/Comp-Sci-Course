Most critics and audiences find this an extremely satisfying movie.  But one common criticism is that the science in the science fiction is illogical.  Thing is, not so much.

A large number of cosmologists have recently been exploring the idea that the seemingly inexplicable nature of creation of the universe might best be explained by an infinite (not "large", but infinite) number of universes.  Where everything that could possibly happen has happened.  Two recent books about this by _very_ serious guys are Stephen Hawkings The Grand Design, and Brian Greene's The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos.  One variant of the theory has each universe splitting all the time into more universes going down different paths.

Most all people find it very difficult to wrap their brains around these concepts (which Greene acknowledges and tries bravely to overcome).  It's that difficulty which many of the negative critics have.  As well as some of the characters in the movie.

But personally, I see the most difficult bits of Source Code for critics to accept as a very clever riff on the possibilities of these theories.  There's more to the movie conceptually, and the way that the hero visits the multiple scenarios is properly described as pure magic (the major similarity between this movie and Groundhog Day).  But both the multiple scenarios and the possibilities of those scenarios are actually grounded in cutting edge science, and while it's a science that many find hard to swallow, some very serious folks are exploring it seriously.

So, if you're not a science fiction fan or a scientist, see the movie simply because it's real good.  But if you are, there's relatively little that will annoy you as unscientific, and much that will delight you.  It's top notch science fiction, and, in my opinion, it bats in 2001's league.
