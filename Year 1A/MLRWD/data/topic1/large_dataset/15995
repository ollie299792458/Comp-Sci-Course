Don't watch this movie expecting a great horror movie.  This isn't it.  This movie is formula horror with nothing original or unexpected, but with  some of the greatest special effects I've seen.(ILM, you've done it again.)  First of all:  Why do people in horror movies always read aloud from  "The Book of the Dead" knowing that something is going to come  back to life and that very bad things are going to happen?  Will they never  learn?  Second:  Why must there always be a damsel in distress type?  I  guess that's so there's a reason to be a hero.  Third:  Do they not know  that when you cut up these revived dead people the separate parts always  seem to be able to go on with their evil deed without all parts being  present?  Sheesh!  We've got our standard hero, our standard greedy fortune  hunters, etc.  This movie has been done many times before in many different  forms, but the comedy elements make this one fun.  No, it's not great art.  There aren't any great performances.  But if you're looking for something  to do on the weekend, this movie is worth checking out.  BTW:  Quicksand in  the desert?
