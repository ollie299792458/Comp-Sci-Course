Love, Love, Love this movie. It is the archetypal scary house movie and yes, the characters are stereotypes and look more like they're hitting 40 than college kids, it is a definite must for any old school horror fans. Fortunately, there is no gratuituous T & A, no stupid sex scenes (except one scene which feels like an eternity as the two idiot characters roll around on a bed and do nothing but giggle for like 5 minutes) and just a lot of good,creepy scares that will give you chills. As one reviewer mentioned, this isn't a particularly realistic movie, as the characters act in typical horror movie fashion (going back into the house several times, investigating dark catacombs after they know there's a psycho on the loose, acting pretty calmly after finding out several of their friends are dead, etc.) but the plot twist in this movie could be lost on you as it is somewhat unclear who the killer is. There is a quick revelation by Linda Blair but it is garbled and confused by the monster's banging on the door that it could get missed.  SPOILER: so, if you're somewhat confused by the ending, there were actually two "monsters" living in the house (presumably Andrew and Raymond) as we know that only 3 out of 5 bodies were recovered at Garth Manor after the murders. But it is still somewhat unclear to me because we know the guy Seth kills is Raymond, but the monster who throws Jeff out the window and the one that Marty impales on the roof of her car do not look the same at all which leads to me to think that there were actually three psychos in the house? Not sure. But it's those unanswered questions that will leave you intrigued and wanting to see this one again.
