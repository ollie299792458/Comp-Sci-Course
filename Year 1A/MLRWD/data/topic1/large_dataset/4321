One of the nice things about DVD and foreign films is the subtitle and audio options.  The movie is in French, with English subtitles, but that is fully at the viewers discetion now as to how they view it.  I had previously owned 2 VHS copies, one in French with subtitles, the other in dubbed in English.  Few differences between the two audio wise, and it holds the same for the DVD.
About the film itself, the story and camera work is outstanding.  I am not the biggest fan of the main leads, however, they are outstanding in their roles.  Many of the shots you will see in the film you will see in other action movies later, such as the bullet from a gun shot that got John Woo so much noise, although I think this was done before Woo used that shot.  I could be mistaken, though.  Either way and anyhow, this has a great script, a very capable cast, and was filmed better than 99% of the A-list movies available today.  This is quite simply a text book example of how a great action movie is made.
