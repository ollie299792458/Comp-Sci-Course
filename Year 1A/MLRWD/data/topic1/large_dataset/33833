I really enjoy the Inner Sanctum collection,these were set up to be Channey Jr.way to do something beside horror films.The first one made was,Calling Dr.Death which is Lon plays Dr.Mark Steele a neurologist who has a cheating wife,she gets murdered and Dr.Steele is suspected,J.Carroll Nash plays the detective who suspects Lon,nice camera work and weird angles make this a very nice entry in the series.Weird Woman is entry 2 in the series Lon plays a college Prof. who has awife who practices witchcraft,Anne Gwynne is good as his wife,Evelyn Ankers is the jealous old girlfriend who causes lots of problems for the couple including murder,over the top at times but good fun.Dead Mans Eyes is a weak entry but it has Aquanetta in it,Lon gets blinded by mistake,murders ensue nice scene at the end with a mirror though.The Frozen Ghost is my favorite one in the series.Lon plays Gregor the Great a mentalist who thinks he killed a man with his mind,to get away he helps out at a wax museaum,Martin Kosleck is Rudi the desinger of the wax figures who doesn"t like Gregor being there,lots of strange things going on,Milburn Stone plays Lon"s manager who is involved in trying to drive lon insane so he can get his money.Strange Confession is a remake of the Man who reclaimed his head also stars Brenda Joyce and J.Carroll Nash.Pillow of Death is the last one in the series,Lon"s wife is murdered with a pillow and so on,well worth 67 min.of your time,so kick back and enjoy Inner Sanctum,CALLING LON CHANNEY JR.
