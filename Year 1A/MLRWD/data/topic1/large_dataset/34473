When I first picked up Dark Ride in the bargain bin at Walmart, I had this general idea that it might be worth the 12 bucks I was about to dish out on it; I had been hearing about these "films to die for" for quite some time, and I took a pretty general interest. While the film looked amazing, having all other movies in the set of 8 pale in comparison to its grafic quality, it was quite lacking in almost all other factors. Characters, all of whome you recognize, but don't really know, were in a somewhat stale stereotypical grouping that you'd expect from ANY slasher flick. The story line is rather bland "look, a somewhat interesting place to stay for the night", and way too overdone. I'm hearing lots of reviews comparing it to 80's slashers, but i'd say its more like the recent hollywood movies Black Xmas, Hills Have Eyes 2, and See No Evil; which, i guess if you think these movies had complex and compelling story lines, you'll like this, but, much like any movie that runs off from nothing but the gore factor, i didn't. The only scene that really catches my attention is the one where the bad girl is blowing the stud, and has her head cut off half way through, only to have the audience watch blood and semen drip all down the man's lap and onto the floor. What I'm trying to say is, its really only for those of us who have nothing better to do than watch a gore fest with little to no story line, zero plot, and a twist that makes you kinda go "well... I kinda guessed that in the 2nd scene" *Two Stars- With 12 bucks and a trip to walmart, you're better off buying a beta fish and a hand help mirror, it'd be much more entertaining for the general audience*
