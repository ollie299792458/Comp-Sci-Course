My main problem here is WW's powers in this movie, she is powerless. She can't fly? Since when? I know that was the original WW in the late 40's all the way to the 70's but that changed in the 80's if I remember well. Now WW not only can fly but she is as fast as Superman in flying.  What is with the silly see through jet that nobody cared to see in the movie?

Not even mention her strength, in some scenes she is super strong but in other she needs to be saved by Steve, in fact she was saved by him so many times that got boring and kind of humiliating. How come the male super heroes in DC movies don't' need to be saved by others but the poor, overlooked, defendless only woman that was one of the original members of the Justice Society of America and after that the Justice League needs to be saved all the time? It's just very annoying and disappointed, in this movie she is not other than weak.

Why would they make previous JLA animated movies showing a more powerful WW and on this one the decided to do a weaker one? I don't get it. This is why WW has been overlooked all these years beacuse her powers, abillities and story always change....they should come up with a more permanent one like Superman has. You will never see a Superman movie where his powers are different, we get pretty much the same story, powers, background, etc., with him; so why should we get different versions with WW?  At least if they are going to change her try to do her better and not worst, more appealing for the new generations. It is hard for a female super heroe to be popular and sell comics among the young audience and if they choose to go with just an average WW with nothing especial then people will not be interested anymore.

And last but not least, the story is kind of boring also, not very creative, making the Amazons to look more like mercenaries never searching for justice and peace. If they make a new movie hopefully they correct all these terrible mistakes.
