Michael Cunningham interweaves a beautiful tapestry of the timeless intricacies of a woman's soul.  We go on a journey with three generations of women who all find themselves at a pivotal point in their lives. They have lost themselves in the noise of everyday routines and are left to try and discover where their true contentment lies. The three women are find themselves in a state of emotional paralysis and cannot seem to articulate their deepest desires to those around them. They begin to detoriate one by one until an unexpected twist and resolution descends upon them. You will have to watch it or read it to find out! Clarissa Vaughn(Meryll Streep), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) show us that the pains of the human spirit remain constant throughout time. The cords that run through all of us continue on and we will find strength from one another. I loved the intertwining of Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway", a truly ingenious technique that seem to be popping up in many screenplays this year.A must see!!!
