This is a decent movie, but because it follows the same plot and story of "Tombstone" and "Tombstone" is a thousand times better, there is no reason to bother to watch "Wyatt Earp".  Dennis Quaid  is LAUGHABLE as Doc Holliday, and he fails to convince. In "Tombstone" Val Kilmer displays his incredible emotional range and his part allows him to be serious and hilarious at different times.  Kilmer actually smoked several packs of cigarettes a day to give himself a raspy voice and a sickly appearance.  The chemistry between Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer is what elevates "Tombstone" far above ordinary action films.  In "Wyatt Earp" there is little chemistry between Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid.  The characters are wooden and underdeveloped.  The filmmakers of "Tombstone" took real risks to make the true story exciting and profound, while "Wyatt Earp" spends too much time developing its story, so that by the end it has lost its impact.  "Tombstone" is great because it is not afraid to alter history to fit the legend, but "Wyatt Earp" is bad because it is too realistic, and realism is not what film is about, if it was then noone would watch.  If you have an imagination and enjoy complex characters watch "Tombstone", if you are a historian and like to wear tight clothing and study encyclopedias watch "Wyatt Earp".
