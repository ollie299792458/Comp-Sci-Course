I love Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock, but they were not the real reason I went to see this movie.  I went to see it because it looked really funny.  Which I must say, I did laugh A LOT. So I would reccomend it for anyone who wants to get a good laugh.

For those of you who do not know what 'The Proposal' is about: A pushy boss (Sandra Bullock) who has been threatened to be deported.  The only way she can think to get out of it is to get married, to her assistant (Ryan Reynolds). The assistant decideds to go along with a few demands of his own, one of which is a promotion. With the news of the marriage, a sneaky immigration clerk tries to get proof that the marriage is fake. Bullock and Reynolds try to show off the marriage to his family in Alaska to have some proof.

Basically thats the jist of it. Anyways, i liked the movie a lot, and the only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the movie is predictable. The ending is anyways, but other than that the movie is great with a ton of amazing laughs.
