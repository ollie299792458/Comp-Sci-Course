The first 20 minutes of this film are brilliant. Purely brilliant. Nothing can compare with the sense of gothic horror and mystery the viewer experiences during the journey to Dracula's castle, and our interview with the first vampire. I watched the beginning in a dark room, just after the sun had set and the lands about my house were shrouded in darkness. It's an experience I'll never forget. As I have said twice before, pure and simple brilliance, and nothing less. Unfortunately for the expectant viewer, the film begins to slowly slid after the first 20 minutes. A real shame, since, if the entire film had been as excellent as the first 20 minutes, this would indeed be a timeless classic. The movie is worth viewing, if only for the first part. The price of the film is worth that alone.
The DVD itself is wonderful. It comes with three different versions of the movie: one the original, the next with a new (but horrible) score, and the last with a completely different Spanish version of the film which is longer and, in some people's opinion, much better. I'll comment on the Spanish version since it seems to be a pretty popular one: I personally didn't like it very much. The detail is better, as is the quality, but the actors really killed the movie. Who can compare with Lugosi?  The actors are simply terrible. Even the beginning scenes can't save the film. Still, it's interesting to see, in spite of the poor actors. The extras included on the DVD are OK. The documentary is pretty lame, and I've heard better commentaries before (such as "The Wolf Man".) Still interesting for those vampire fanatics out there.
All in all, I would definitely purchase it. No matter how bad most of the movie might be, it's still a horror classic, and the beginning anyone could like. Buy it for that.
