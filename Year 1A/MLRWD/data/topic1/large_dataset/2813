Sad, disturbing, and powerful are all good words to describe this beautiful motion picture directed by David Lynch. Filmed in black and white, it tells the true and altogether touching story of John Merrick, a young man so grotesquely deformed he was forced to spend most of his short life as a carnival sideshow attraction.
  Though he is looked upon and treated as an animal by both those who put him on display and others still who pay money to see him, Merrick's fortune soon takes a turn for the better in the guise of Dr. Treves. Treves, portrayed brilliantly by actor Anthony Hopkins, takes John into his care and tries to instill within him a sense of love, dignity, and acceptance.
  You won't see a more emotionally draining movie than this one. It's an important film and one that I truly believe parents should watch with their older children, especially given that it's based on a true story and would do well in teaching them acceptance for differences in others.
  Very well made and highly recommended.
