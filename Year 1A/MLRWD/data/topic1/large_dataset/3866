4 and 1/2 Stars.

The story of a 44 yr old black woman struggling to get over a criminal past and a mid-life crisis serves as an unlikely follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's enormously successful 'Pulp Fiction'. This film, a much more character driven piece, is probably his most realistic and linear of the five he's completed.

The plot revolves around a gun-runner's attempt to traffic his money while being pressured by the ATF. But the clever part of the movie has to do with it's shift from the initial plot to the lives and relationships of it's characters (all of which come off very naturally). And because the pleasure of the movie lies in the relationships and dialogue of the characters (all of which is dynamic and plot-driven), the film is ripe for repeated viewings.

There's not much else to say here. The movie is very entertaining. The heist plot is terrific but the 'hang-out' scenes really make the film great, utilizing incredible dialogue and acting prowess (otherwise unseen from this group of actors and actresses, sans DeNiro) to tell a typical genre story in a much more subtle and personal way.

Funny, sly, clever, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. Recommended.
