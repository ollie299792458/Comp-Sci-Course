I ordered these DVDs several years ago and never used them. Recently I had a health scare that made me realize I needed to exercise. I started walking on the treadmill and developed plantar faciitis. I needed to keep exercising without making my foot worse and remembered the WATP DVDs. I started with the 1 mile walk which was pretty simple and best of all it didn't aggravate PF. The next day I used the 2 mile and did that every day for a week. Today I did the 3 mile walk. It was difficult but I made it through.

I like this program a lot. First of all I am really uncoordinated and so aerobics and jazzercize would be really hard. I didn't want to spend time learning new "routines". This program consists of 4 moves...even I can do these! I can exercise without worrying about weather and can do it anytime I want. I don't have the exercise balls, but I already had some 2# weights and I just use them and I would assume it works pretty much the same.

Leslie Sansone and her "posse" kind of get on my nerves but I can tolerate it as long as I am seeing progress...and I am. Once I have the routine down a little better I'll just mute her.

I have ordered the 5 Day Slim Down DVD and after I am comfortable with the 3 miles will move on to that one. All in all I think this is a really good program. I would recommend it.
