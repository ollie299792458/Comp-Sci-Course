I love Halloween. No other horror movie holds my favor like this one does. I saw the original when I was about 8-9 may be a little older perhaps 10-11, but I never forgot that white mask or the eerie music cue that signaled The Shape was close by. Towards the end of the 90's I found out there was going to be another Halloween movie released (not knowing there were about 6 other films out there, I assumed this was the sequel at the time). H20 automatically became a favorite after I saw it in the theater, and now at long last I own the DVD (which makes me extremely happy). I had forgotten all about this movie which I consider as I think most/some of the fans do THE END of the Halloween story. I've always counted this as the final chapter since it had a pretty clear cut ending if you'll forgive the pun and even though I don't like to see that certain someone die, I thought this was the right way to go with it. This film is one of the "must see" ones for any fan of Halloween, I highly recommend it!

PS: I did see Ressurection: Didn't care for it all that much but it made me laugh and it kept me entertained for about an hour or however long it was. I also saw Rob's remake: I loved it. Yes, I said I LOVED IT and it's now in my Halloween Collection.
