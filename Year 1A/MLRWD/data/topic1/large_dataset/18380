This is a movie based on things that happened in real life, sighting that people have seen of a monster, lots of the information provided here was taken from many sources!!!The Mothman saved some from the hands of death and sent others to an early grave. For 3 years a dark apparition terrified a sleepy West Virginia town, many citizens claim they saw him, is it true? What The Mothman is we will never know, though he hasn't been seen in a long time. From the first time the Mothman appeared in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in early 1964, people have been supplying their own theories about what 'it' was, where he came from, and what his purpose was. Some thought the Mothman was an angel or a devil. With all the UFOs people spotted in the skies, some thought it only natural to assume the Mothman was an alien. Others believed he was the terrifying climax of a 200 year old curse. The truly skeptical decided it was nothing more than a bird and a dose of wild imagination... until the Mothman appeared to them. But in the absence of hard evidence, one guess is as good as another and we may never know...
