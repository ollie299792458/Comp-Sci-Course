If you like the premise the series will not disappoint you.  That said ever since I got a DVD player I find it hard to go back to the VHS tapes.  I watched highlander for the first few seasons when it was on TV but eventually lost track of it.  I had seen the video collections out in stores but did not like the price or the idea of pulling my old VHS player out of the closet.  With the release of the DVD set for season one I decided to see if it was as good a series as I remember.  Amazingly it was just as good - if not better.  After the first season Duncan will forever be the real Highlander and Conner just a distant cousin.  Adrian Paul takes over from the start and becomes "The Highlander".  The supporting cast and guest stars are also great but it is Mr. Paul who keeps you coming back.  My only gripe with the DVD's is that they did not have more interviews with the actors and the writers.  For a show that has taken on such a cult following it would have been nice to hear some of the early history about the first season.  My other complaint is not about the DVD set which I highly recommend but about the slow way the DVD's are hitting the market.  Season 2 is slated to come out in July 03, and as of yet I have not heard when the other seasons will be released (if at all) on DVD.  I guess I had better dust off the VHS player.
