For me, "The Third Man" has everything needed in a movie. It has Romance and Adventure, a man from America visiting his friend in a war torn Vienna and the realization that his friend was apparently murdered. It has mystery, excellent dialogue; it is filled with humor and surreal depth as well as an amazing chemistry between all the characters. Orson Welles plays the perfect role of Harry Lime, the primary character that the movie is all about.  Alida Valli plays a superbly charming Anna Schmidt.  How can Joseph Cotton's character not fall for her hopeless romantic character?

The movie has historical fact and significance as it was filmed in Vienna shortly after the end of World War II and gives us information about the city just after World War II. I never knew that like Vienna, like Berlin, was under Russian, British, American, and French control at the end of the WW2.

On top of all of this, there is an amazing moodiness to this movie in both  the lighting, music, and acting.

A movie I watch all the time, it is one that has to be with your collection.
