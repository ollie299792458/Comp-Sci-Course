The Blind Side is a wonderful story about love and humanity crossing borderlines. Michael Oher- marvellous: Quinton Aaron- is a seventeen year old homeless black boy with as many possessions as you can put in a plastic bag. He is sensible and intelligent, but not in the way society expects. He can barely read and his marks are more based on the schools trying to get rid of him than on his real knowledge. His mother can't even remember his father's name, because her life is controlled by crack. But one thing changes "Big Mike's" life forever. His neighbour applies for his son's and Michael's education to a Christian school. As Michael is an extraordinary talented football player, the school remembers its Christian roots and gives him a chance. There he meets the Tuohy family. Lee Ann, the mother - Sandra Bullock at her best- fights against all prejudices to give young Michael a proper future. Finally the Tuohys adopt Big Mike as a legal member of their family. With some help of his tutor Miss Sue, Michael gets the chance to be admitted by several famous colleges. So he achieves everything he never even dreamed of, a beloved and loving family, a great and strong mother and a way to live his life. This film, based on a true story, shows us in an absolutely wonderful, silently funny and heart warming way that fate doesn't have to be unchangeable.
I recommend this film to anybody who'd like to get back their belief in humanity.
