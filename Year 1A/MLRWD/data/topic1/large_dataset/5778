This movie is warm and humorous but there is a more serious theme at work here and that concerns a person in the process of discovering God. If you watch the movie carefully, you will see the slow awakening of Mary throughout the course of the movie. She learns about God through watching the nuns (their love and devotion to God and to each other) and from being exposed to situations that aren't what they appear to be. Mary is bored when she has to "volunteer" at the old age home but is moved when she sees the Mother Superior giving comfort to an elderly woman who has been forgotten by her family. She is further awakened when she learns a beautiful nun is willing to sacrifice her beauty because of her love for God, and finally, at at point where she thinks the Mother Superior is made of ice, she is able to see the depths of feeling that lay beneath her cool surface. There are many indications that Mary is growing spiritually and is struggling internally with something that the viewers can only understand fully in retrospect (because it is not revealed to us until the end).

I am not Catholic but this film transcends any denomination. It is a beautiful love story that celebrates youth, friendship, kindness, understanding and devotion to others, but especially a devotion to God.
