Reading other reviews of this movie I am surprised that I am the only one who felt pretty offended by this movie. I read the book just a while ago and loved it. So, I was excited about seeing the movie. Big let down!

First of all they change one of the main character's names and for no good reason that I can see. There is no relation between the Allison McKenzie of the book and the one in the movie--they are completely differenct characters!

When I read the book, I felt that I was reading a serious piece of literature that was uncovering a small town's egotistical, self-important view of itself which, let's face it, is pretty common in many human societies. Metalious was making a  commentary on how her community was repressive of individuality and free expression. The movie seemed more concerned with whether Lana Turner's character was ever going to get a little action. Moreover, the most commonly used words in reviews of the movie are melodrama and soap opera. Now, when I think of melodrama and soap opera I think of Dallas, Days of our lives and 90210. Basically, trash that presents mindless, unbelievable situations.

Metalious' book was done a grave injustice by this movie. I am still trying to figure out how she was a script consultant and allowed this to get to film!
