I can't get over how thoroughly this film transported me back to 1969. I was eleven that summer, and I recall the time vividly. Everything about the production design of this movie is amazingly accurate - from the black and white TV's that only give you a viewable picture if you smack them on the side to the tie dye clothing. Viggo Mortensen and Diane Lane provide the gentle flames of this bittersweet (and clearly temporary ) romance. Liev Scrheiber gives one of his best performances as the betrayed husband, and Tovah Feldshuh is wonderful as the mensch mother in law. Ann Paquin does a terrific turn as the adolescent daughter - there isn't a bad performance anywhere here. 
The music adds to the overall impact of the film with carefully chosen snippets of Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Ritchie Havens, etc. Maybe this flim won't do it for those less nostalgic for the 60's, but this movie struck me as an affectionate look back at that period. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it strikes me a a real 'sleeper' film. Not to be missed.
