In all honesty, I bought this movie only because I knew Jesse Eisenberg is in it. Ever since Adventureland, I've been a little obsessed with his subtle quirkiness and hilariously real awkwardness. He gives such a truth to films, like nothing I have seen before. The best way for me to describe it is as though one of my friends scored a starring role in a major motion picture. Tremendous acting job, but I still feel attached to him as an actual human being. Don't get me wrong, it does not take away from his performance by any means. If anything, it adds to it..and this is why you've gotta love him.

If I find him so amazing, why did I only give this movie 2 stars?... Good question.

I was confused by the way things played out (Don't worry- I will not give the ending away). I was just so distracted by something. Now, this may seem strange to some of you...but I really felt this strong sexual tension between Charlie and Mick. The whole film I kept focusing on it, and I was left with the feeling that this huge part of the story was neglected. It bothers me that no attention was paid to that.

And for that, an unforgiving let down - I give it 2 stars.
