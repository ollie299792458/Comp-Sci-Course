This is a really funny show! My niece gave me the first season and I was really taken away by it. It is snortingly hilarious and I've learned NOT to eat popcorn while watching it as it usually ends up flying out of my nose as I double over in laughter.
If anyone out there wants a great TV show at their fingertips they should fork over their dough and buy this baby. Watching it live can be a real bummer with all the commercials so its worth it to buy it.
The show sounds simple enough as it is about a five person family and their relatives. The father is an adorable dork who loves his wife and kids more than he does himself. He thinks hes cool but hes really a lovable cad that I can't get enough of, while his wife is a hot control freak who micromanages everything. The oldest daughter is a queen with a dolt of a boyfriend, while her younger sister is a brainiac who can't figure out why everyone loves her older sister so much. The son is a dimwitted little prankster who is screamingly appealing. Throw them and their relatives in a pot and stir it up and you have the best comedy show that TV has seen in years. We watched this second season in like three days as it was even better than the first. This is truly "feel good" TV so buy it if you want some good vibes! :)
