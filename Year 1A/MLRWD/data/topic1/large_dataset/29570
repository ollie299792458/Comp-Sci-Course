This is a rediculously underrated and little-seen gem of a movie. Scorsese, just coming off of the comparably subdued Kundun and Age of Innocence, returns to his roots recruiting fellow outlaw Paul Schrader for a crazy, religious, surreal film full of everything that the New York night has to offer. The story is basicaly the archityplical Scorsese situation: the lone social misfit must travel a road of violence and guilt to find redemption from a woman who is the embodiement of madonna/harlot. In Taxi Driver a taxi was the hero's chariot that takes him on his journey, in Casino it was an exploding car, in The Aviator it was the dream of the spruce goose's impossible flight, here it's an ambulence that carries him into the night. This film's night pulses with an insane energy and life-force and Scorsese captures every dirty, gritty, lunatic moment of it and throws it back in your face with an obscene relish. Nearly every frame of this movie throbs with electricity as Cage's character is tempted to do the right thing, the apathetic thing, or (literally) throw down the gear-shift and speed off screaming into the night (upside-down no less) in a scene that is remniscent of "Slackers" where a camera is thrown off of a cliff. Now sure this film is extremely kinetic and the in-your-face grit and violence won't do anything for anyone who gets excited at the thought of staying home on a Saturday night for a Merchant-Ivory marathon, but if you're willing to take the plunge then Scorsese is more than willing to light some fire works in your brain.
