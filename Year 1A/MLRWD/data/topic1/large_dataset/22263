The sounds of bones snapping at awkward angles, dead bodies shuffling along the ground, arms being cut off, and screams of terror and delight welcome you to this film. Despite a low budget, Splinter offers up everything that horror aficionados look for. Strong tension, a creepy plot, and plenty of gore!

This is a great new take on a 'zombie' like film. But don't take the zombie idea too far, what we have here are bodies that are essentially reanimated by some sort of symbiotic biological mystery. And, convenient for us film watchers, it has an insatiable taste for blood. What could be better?

Wilkins has done a wonderful job with this film. It is short yet action packed, offers plenty of scares, and it does not rely on an abundance of special effects. This allows the film to excel in what it does best, scare you and make your skin crawl. The acting is above average, with Shea Whigham excelling in his role. The idea and story is fresh and interesting as well. The film work is well done, but it is a bit shaky. This is an intentional effect obviously, and it was not an issue that I even noticed when watching the film. If anything it adds to the effects and also allowed them to pull of some effects without the creatures looking cheesy or fake. It is not a hand-held camera and nothing like Blair Witch or Cloverfield. A film camera that moves with the action is perhaps the best way I can explain it. You can see examples on IMDB or YouTube trailers.

All in all, a well done film. I hope to see some more fun works from Wilkins.
