Indisputably one of the best films of the 90's, and, in my opinion, to date. Just reading a few of the reviews, each with its own interpretation of the themes and motifs, is enough for anyone to figure out that this film reaches out to every individual in a different way.

Leslie Cheung (RIP) forever set the standard for genderless beauty. Cheng Dieyi himself is an artwork, and is beautiful and captivating in the same way as a masterpiece. I find it interesting that some people see Dieyi and Xialou as the main characters, when others (esp Chinese) think it's Dieyi and Juxian. I personally think it's Dieyi and Juxian, and that Xiaolou is there less as a character in his own right (since he really doesn't have much of a personality, imho), but rather as a symbol of something that Dieyi and Juxian revolve around and can be easily replaced with another average man.

To fully appreciate the magic of this film, you really need to be willing to sit down with an open mind and be ready to pick up on small details, and then think about it as a bigger picture. It's not surprising that some people are turned off by the themes of homosexuality, abuse, and joyless sex. These themes are exactly what make this film so haunting. It's completely pointless to get offended by these themes, because Farewell My Concubine is not there as a reflection of anyone's political stance or moral values, and even less is it propaganda. Rather, it's an honest portrayal of the effects of having to live a life of betrayal and inner turmoil.
