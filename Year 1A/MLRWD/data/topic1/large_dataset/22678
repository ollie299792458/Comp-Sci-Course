The film itself was pretty good.  Though I sincerely hope they finish the story of the series with a third movie.

But, on a spiritual note, this was an interesting idea.

Scully, who is now working in a hospital, is contacted by the FBI in hopes that she can help them find Agent Mulder, as they need his help on a case involving a missing agent.

Enter Father Joseph Crissman, played here by the wonderful Billy Connolly (Boondock Saints, The Last Samurai). He is a disgraced former Catholic priest who left the church because he was caught performing pedophilac acts with choirboys. It seems that Father Joseph has been receiving visions from God about the whereabouts of the missing agent.

Mulder, of course, looks at this with the usual cynicism he has for so-called psychics.  Scully, who was raised Catholic, refuses to believe that God would send visions to someone who had done something so horrible and had disgraced the Church in the process.

But eventually both are convinced as to the legitimacy of Father Joseph's visions.

This was wonderfully done, especially when it is revealed that the former priest has more of a connection with this case then he realizes.
