There are two screwball classics of the 1930's which stand out above all the rest, Capra's "You Can't Take It with You" and Gregory La Cava's 1936 "My Man Godfrey".  Although I love both of them dearly, it's the former 1938 Capra film which has all the magic.

There are plenty of plot synopses here, so I'll just comment in general.  First, the cast could not be better.  Every single actor here takes the art of comedy to new highs.  Some of the staged comedic routines are so complex one wonders how Capra could ever keep track of all the goings-on.  These show just that the brilliant magic of the ensemble can outdo individual efforts.  Not that there aren't standouts here, but, other than Barrymore and Byington, one is hard-put to pick one out over the others.  The ensemble work is perfection.

However, this is a Capra direction.  The script crackles with social commentary.  This carries things forward in spite of the near total lunacy going on around it.  Capra knew what he wanted here and successfully weaves together the two tapestries into a stand-out of the genre.

Forget that Capra changes the Kaufman-Hart play.  That doesn't matter.  If you want to see the play, it's also available on video.  Both stand on their own.  However, this film is a must-see.
