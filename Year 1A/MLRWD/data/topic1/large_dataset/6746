Despite having plot twists that might divide the public, The Disappearance of Alice Creed remains a decently executed film and also an entertaining one. While it doesn't renew the genre of abduction thrillers by blending other genres like Twisted Seduction, The Disappearance of Alice Creed hopefully has a leg to stand on. In fact, the most enjoyable moments are definitely the ones when Alice and each of her two kidnappers psychologically confront each other.

However, while the film is quite entertaining, it's very likely to divide the audience, because it's hard to decide how to react after we had seen the film's plot twists. Given that these plot twists are references by the two kidnappers to their original plan and that they've been witheld from viewers from the beginning, one might wonder if these plot twists are cheap shots. I personally thought that these plot twists fitted in the story, because Martin Compston's and Eddie Marsan's performance, from the beginning to the end, makes these surprises somehow believable.
