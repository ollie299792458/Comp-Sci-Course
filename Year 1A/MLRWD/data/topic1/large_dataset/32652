It is really amazing to think about how old this movie is, and how it really is one of the groundbreaking horror movies of the time.  By today's standards, the look of the movie is quite archaic.  The scenes jump and seem to be cut together at certain points, but it takes away very little from the movie.  The acting is somewhat hokey, but again, the plot makes up for it.  Upon watching this movie reminded me of the original Nosferatu, though this movie does have sound.

Bela Lugosi, in a very early role, barely recognizable if you ask me, portrays a 'Prince of Darkness' character.  He is able, through voodoo, to create zombies and have them under his control.  A plantation owner comes to him and begs him to help him win the heart of a women who is betrothed to another.  Soon after the wedding the bride falls dead, or does she?  It seems that Lugosi has been able to make her fall into a coma-like state and later with the assistance of zombies, and the plantation owner, they steal her body from the crypt.  Her husband, sensing foul play, enlists some individuals, knowledgeable in voodoo to follow him to Lugosi's castle  to get his wife back and free her from the zombie hold.
