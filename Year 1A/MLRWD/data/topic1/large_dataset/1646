Since John Barrowman is an openly gay actor in England I knew this movie had to really be bad. Understand that actors are only as good as the material they have to work with and the director directing, so I blame these for how well the movie turned out. We are talking about a bad rip-off of the Jaws movie, with dialog and special effects that obviously were done by very underpaid filmographers. Cheap, cheap, cheap!

The only redeeming value of this movie is the one line that John says to the leading lady after they have worked up a plan to kill the shark. He says, "I'm really wond up, so how about if I take you home and eat your pussy?" John dear, that is the worst pickup line I have ever heard and when you are licking her neck in the following shower scene, you are no where near the the object of your characters final goal! A straight actor might have called the writers on this line, but as pretty as you are none of us would have not been charmed into bed with you.

John Barrowman rocks!
