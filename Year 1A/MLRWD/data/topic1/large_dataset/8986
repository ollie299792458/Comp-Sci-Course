Many people who went to see "the village" were expecting a bloody, suspenseful and eerie horror film - those people would be disappointed. Other peeple went in "plot-guessing", simply making a game out of trying to figure out the plot twist. Those people were also disappointed by the relatively guessable twist.

However, I watched the movie apart from all preconceptions. I watched it as I would an independant movie from an unknown director. And it was a simple amazing film. The cinemetography is gorgeous - sweeping, clean, and photographically amazing - it captures the cold, rough atmosphere of the town perfectly. The acting is amazing - people have often said the lines seem wooden - when you take into account that the characters are actually 20th century people who have to speak in old english, you realize they are actually acting superbly. And the musical score is one of the best of the past 3 years, rivaled only by LOTR.

If we go into a room expecting to see God and instead find $100,000,000, we will be disappointed. The same happened with "the Village". It is not horror, it is a deeply moving commentary on modern society, innocence, and courage. It is rich, intelligent, and emotional, and for me is one of my favorite films of all time.
