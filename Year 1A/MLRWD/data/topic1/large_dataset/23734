Not since Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver have I seen a film that explores the furious rage of an alienated man on the verge of insanity so well. The only difference is that the subject matter of I Stand Alone makes Taxi Driver look like an after school special. I Stand Alone is one of the most taboo breaking films I have ever seen. And even though it may not be as taboo breaking as films like Salo: The 120 Days of Sodom, I Stand Alone is not exactly the kind of movie you want to show your entire family.

I Stand Alone follows the story of a misanthropist simply known as the butcher. I won't divulge into the back story of this charming fellow too much, but he is quite possibly one of the most bitter and utterly malicious characters I have ever seen in a film. If you thought that Travis Bickle was a disturbed individual, then you should see this guy. Basically, throughout the film he goes around ranting and raving about how much he hates everyone and everything. He denounces morality and sees it as nothing more than a restraint upon the poor. He fantasizes over and over again about murdering people he meets along the way to his own self-destruction. The butcher is a man with nothing left to lose. He is an ugly, primitive representation of what humanity really is -- man is nothing but an animal that struggles for its own survival in an otherwise indifferent universe. In the end, the butcher is a man without a god and a man who has been abandoned by his own society.

I Stand Alone is a slab of human misery caught on film. If that is not your kind of thing, then I suggest you steer clear. This film does not have an ending where the main character, despite his complete and utter hatred for humanity, redeems himself.

I Stand Alone is nothing but a spiral downwards.
