Great show! I loved the series and had to have it.  However, do not buy the smaller boxset.  Buy the larger one instead, with the obits and CDs.  The DVDs in the smaller boxset come in sleeves.  There weren't enough sleeves, so four of the sleeves had two DVDs crammed into them!  This resulted in the ink from the bottom DVD to transfer to the silver side of the DVD stacked on top of it.  This caused three of the DVDs to be completely unreadable!  The larger boxset is organized by by season and each disc is protected by its own panel.  (See customer images on the other boxset).

In addition, I copy the DVDs to my media server so that I can watch them without getting up to change the 24 discs.  I noticed that the DVDs on the smaller boxset are only single layer discs, 4.7GB.  The DVDs on the larger boxset are dual-layer discs, up to 8.5GB.  The content is the same, but of course the material on smaller boxset has to be compressed to fit on the lower capacity discs.  I did not perform any side by side comparisons of video quality, as I had already returned the smaller defective boxset, before buying the bigger boxset.

Buy the larger boxset.  It's beautifully and well packaged.  The video is less compressed.  The larger boxset has been discontinued, but it's still possible to find new from various sellers.  It is more expensive, but it's worth it.  Great show!  Everyone should watch it!
