.....what is?  Schindlers List?  C'mon, look at how TERRIBLE it was to be a kid in the suburbs?  I'm being facetious of course.
This movie brings back so many memories.  I'm 32 and my older brother was the embodiement of this movie.  My parents were pre-baby boomers and had no idea how to deal with the drugs, the hair, the clothes.......people then really thought that their kids were aliens. There was none of the innocence that kids in the 60's had.  I was 7 in 1979 and remember the teenagers.......hanging out everywhere!!  The high schools in Long Island NY where I grew up were a disaster.  The kids REALLY seemed this out of control!!  It seemed so dark back then, but looking back what was the big deal?  Kids will be lazy screw ups, especially if you let them.  There was still a lot of this in the early to mid 80's when I was a teen, amongst some segments of kids, but there was a bit more optimism.
Anyway, this movie is a pure, dark, cultural time capsule of the late 70's.  The kids were about as real as they could be, everything is exaggerated and blown out of proportion, and it is pure genius!!  I played this movie for a friend who is English, and he just didn't get it.  Life in England in the 70's must have been different.  The sprawling suburban landscape is a pretty American phenomenom.  When is the DVD coming out?
