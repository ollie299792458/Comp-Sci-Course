This review is from my old review 3 years ago Universal Soldier definitively is in Jean Claude Van Damme's top 10. Directed by Roland Emrich he directed Indepdence Day, Godzilla & The Patriot. Stars Jean Claude Van Damme as  Luc Deverux Dolph Lundgren as SGT Andrew Scott & Alley Walker as CNA reporter Veronica Roberts Ed O' Ross as Colonel Perry & Jerry Orbach as Dr Christopher Gregor. The story is  in 1969 Private Luc Deverux & SGT Scott are in Vietnam they don't get along while Deverux is clearing out a village he discovers what Scott is doing we learn that Scott is a psycho he has killed members of the platoon & killed a Vietnamese civilians & Deverux just wants to go home Scott accuses him of treason while Deverux is trying to escape with a Vietnamese woman Scott shoots him in the leg & tosses a grenade at the woman killing her Deverux & Scott kill each other at the same time. The next morning  The Military has the incident wrote up as an MIA they pack Deverux & Sergeant Scott in ice. The opening is cool when they zip up Deverux's body bag it flashes Jean Claude Van Damme when Andrew Scott's body bag is zipped up it flashes Dolph Lundgren then it flashes Universal Soldier. It's  25 years later they have been kept alive all there memories cleared as part of the Universal Soldier program. Luc Deverux is now GR 44 Andrew Scott is now GR 13. There's a hostage situation at the Hoover Dam The UNI SOL's are sent in some nice stunt work with the bungee cords. The UNI SOL's go in & kicks @$$ take names Deverux see's a terrified Husband & Wife & Deverux has flashbacks. Next we meet Veronica Roberts & in this scene she's fired from CNA & she wants her job back so she wants to find out what the Universal Soldier project is she is caught on camera & her & her friend try to escape but are captured held at gun point Scott murders Veronica's friend Deverux has a Nam flashback & takes Veronica with him eventually he starts getting his memory back a little. Scott gets his back. Deverux just wants to go home Scott thinks he's still in Nam & thinks Luc Deverux is a traitor still. So Andrew Scott just goes psycho & provides the dark, sick & twisted humor. Then it becomes a action/chase movie in the American south west. Bar fight Van Damme kicking a lot of @$$ the grocery store scene with Dolph Lundgren was bad @$$ he provided a lot of humor that was dark, sick & twisted. Van Damme had a pretty good character & was back when he had a name people recognized. Dolph Lundgren crazy as h**l during most of the movie. There is a scene where Deverux gives Veronica a bus ticket to gp tp LA & try to clear things up with CNA. She stays behind about a dozen cops are there to arrest them. While their being taken off to jail Sergeant Scott comes in with The Military Truck starts ramming the bus he takes out an M60 & opens fire he kills the driver Scott tells them "Excuse me you should check on your driver he  don't look too hot!" He starts throwing gernades at the bus he yells "Do you want to play catch!?" You have Deverux trying to get into the drivers seat on the bus while Veronica is tossing the gernades out of the bus. Deverux gets into the drivers seat he has Veronica jump out Scott throws another gernade the blast knocks it on it's side Scott tells The UNI SOL driving to knock the bus off the mountain Dverux gets out shoots The UNI SOL driving & Dolph just sells it when he's freaking out. Deverux gets to safety where Ther Military Truck & the bus crash down the mountain. A Cop tries to arrest Deverux & Veronica they knock him out & take the cop car. Veronica tells Deverux that she's taking him home. He runites withg his partents & then we have the end fight scene that is like 7 & half 8  minutes long & it is epic.  The ending fight scene is d@** good. I know a lot of people like their fight in Universal Soldier Regeneration better I disagree that fight was lame all it was, was this 1 minute fight them going through walls & you can tell it's stand in's. This fight had story & build up  you knew it was Van Damme & Lundgren making full contact. Roland Emrich did a great job directing. Jean Claude Van Damme was good Ally Walker is good you know 2 likeable characters. Dolph Lundgren was good the character of Anderw Scott is definitly in the top 3 best villains in a Van Damme movie. Ed O'Ross was alright. Jerry Orbach was in a small role but he did fine. All the features carry over from The DVD to The Blu Ray the features are great it also has the alternate ending which I'm glad they didn't go with it feels like an ending to a chick flick. The picture quality is well done the best it's ever looked.  The next 20 years ago review will be Cool World & I'm not looking forward to it at all.
