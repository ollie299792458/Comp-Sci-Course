BEELZEBUB: "You will be watching the movie 'The Hellcats' over and over again for all of eternity."
MR. VEGAS: "I remember this film from watching Mystery Science Theater 3000. It was a biker movie with lots of mindless violence. When two characters have a motorcycle race, they show them zooming away until they're off camera. Then, you only see the rest of the biker gang hanging around drinking beer for a few minutes. Then you see the first biker (the winner) followed by the other biker (the loser) zooming back. Actually showing the race would have required more cameras and used extra footage, which would have cost too much money!"
BEELZEBUB: "My favorite part is where they have the guy's hands and feet tied up to the back of two motorcycles going in different directions. If you can hold on until the count of 15, you've proven your manhood, they shut off the motorcycles and you can get it on with your favorite biker chick. If your hands let go of the rope before the count of 15, the other motorcycle drags you around by your feet until you're bruised and battered. That's entertainment!"
MR. VEGAS: "Thank goodness it's the MST3K version of this movie. That's the only thing that could make watching 'The Hellcats' bearable."
BEELZEBUB: "You're going to watch the original version of the movie. Where in hell do you think you are?"
