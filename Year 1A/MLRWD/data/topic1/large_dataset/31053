Beautiful.  Stunning.  Astonishing.  Heartwrenching.
All these describe The House of Mirth, the movie based on Edith Wharton's 1905 novel, a piece so utterly overwhelming in its visual and literary beauty that the viewer ends up feeling somewhat drained by the experience.  Drained in a wonderful way.
When was the last time you sat down and watched a movie and connected fully with the main characters?  If it's been a while--and I know it had been for me--then this movie is for you.  The film follows the beautiful Miss Lily Bart, a twenty-nine-year-old single socialite who cannot be accused of having good luck...at all.  The film is based upon Wharton's novel, and the novel must be classified as a naturalist piece, even by the most optimistic of critics.  Viewers find themselves drawn to Miss Bart, even as they want to cry out, "No, Lily!  Think!"  Lily becomes the most intriguing, endearing character due to Gillian Anderson's astonishing portrayal, the perfect combination of poise, restraint, and emotion, not to mention the feminine wiles that characterize the always beguiling Miss Lily Bart.  Anderson, the long-time star of the cult television classic The X-Files, won the best actress award for the film at both The Village Voice Film Critics' Poll and The British Independent Film Awards in 2000.  And trust me, she deserves it.
Other than Ms. Anderson's lovely portrayal, the film also includes performances by Dan Aykroyd (and he is surprisingly wonderful), Terry Kinney, Anthony LaPaglia, Laura Linney (of You Can Count on Me), and the gorgeous Eric Stoltz, whom many have called a younger Colin Firth/Mr. Darcy of The House of Mirth.  They all put in beautiful performances.
Simply trust me when I tell you that this film will change your way of thinking, not to mention your way of feeling.  It's worth the buy.
