This is a delightful film about a misunderstood character who just wants to create a good time for everybody, but unwillingly ends up destroying everything. The character is Jack Skellington. As mayor of Pumpkin Town (in the land of Halloween) he has gotten tired of his everyday routine and the annual celebration of Halloween no longer gives him any thrills (it's the same year in and year out for him). So in order to spice up his life he decides to take over Christmas. Henry Selick might be the director of this film, but it's clear that he's gone to great length in staying with producer Tim Burton's original vision for the film (this has been a pet-project of Burton ever since his days at Disney). This film is as Burton-esque as BEETLEJUICE, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BATMAN RETURNS (and everything else that Burton has done). And Danny Elfman (of course) provides a great score for this film (I highly recommend the soundtrack CD). Plus (if you're a true Burton fan) you'll be happy to know that the producers of this disc has chosen to include two of Burton's earliest projects (which he did while working for Disney as an animator): the lovely VINCENT and the James Whale tribute FRANKENWEENIE are both on this disc!
