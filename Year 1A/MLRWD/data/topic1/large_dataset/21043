I'm not sure which film most of the other reviewers below have seen, but this clunker easily earns its reputation as David Fincher's "bad" movie. Where "Fight Club," "Se7en," and even "Panic Room" were all more or less successful in portraying engaging characters, setting convincing moods, and effortlessly bringing the viewer along with the narrative (all signs of a truly great director), "The Game" lamely prods us through just over two sadistic hours of largely predictable plot points. I've heard others claim that this film references "The Trial" or the story of Job somehow, but this story is fully spiritually removed from either of these sources--especially given the unbearably treacly ending.
It probably wasn't Fincher's fault -- it appears that he just got caught up in what he thought to be, at the time, a really revolutionary script -- so I'm willing to forgive him this one. (No surprise, incidentally, that this is the only one of his DVDs without commentary or other features.) The actors nearly rescue the situation, although not too well. Douglas warms over a chilly re-hash of "Wall Street"'s Gordon Gekko just for the occasion, Sean Penn embarrasses himself in every scene right up to the horrible denouement and "surprise" finale, and Michelle Unger... well, she looks nice. Which was enough to merit a star more than I thought this deserved. 
In short: if "The Matrix" totally blew your mind, this will too. If you have anything left to bother with, that is.
