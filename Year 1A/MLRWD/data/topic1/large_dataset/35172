Anyone purchasing this movie and expecting a typical adaptation of Austen's novel will be disappointed. Unlike the BBC productions and the recent Gwyneth Paltrow adaptation of "Emma," "Mansfield Park" is more experimental, much more risque - and these differences, in my opinion, only enhance the experience. I consider myself a diehard Jane Austen enthusiast and an avid supporter of the traditional Jane Austen movies. Even so, I feel that this film presents a likeable heroine in the revamped Fanny Price. She is bolder, more assertive, and her biting sense of humor makes her more like an Elizabeth Bennett than a Fanny Price. Those who resent this remolded character will undoubtedly be annoyed with the entire film. But why get bogged down in the traditionalist view? The new Fanny Price is endearing, the lesbian undertones perplexing, and the dark genocidal issues intriguing. The love story between Fanny and Edmund grabbed me from the very beginning. As opposed to many of the other Austenites, I feel that this movie does not betray the Austen tradition. It rather pays homage to Austen through the marriage of new and old.
