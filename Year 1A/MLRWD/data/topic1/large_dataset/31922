I really love this BBC TV series that was written by Neil Gaiman.
Neil himself was disappointed with the production value and the fact the encounter with the Great Beast at the end lacked dramatic punch due to the low effects budget. While all this is true, in my opinion the writing and the amazing actors made up for all of this.
  It is a classic fish out of water set up with the main character being drawn into the Underground world of London because he saves a girl's life. Neil does a perfect job of setting the landscape of this fantasy land and making the characters there come to life. What stands out the most is his crafting of the main character. It is always hard to write it so the main character is helpless but not so helpless and bewildered that they come across as whiney and dense. Neil balances this well so that we sympathize with the main character and his adjustment to this new world comes across as natural.

I would also recommend buying the book since it adds to the series and allows the reader's imagination to correct for the low budget special effects.
