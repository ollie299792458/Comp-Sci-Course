Hitchcock is without a Shadow of a Doubt one of the most influental directors ever. Some might think he would have been The Wrong Man to direct a movie with such pregnant Psychology and I Confess that i might have been one of them, being Young and Innocent at the time. Vertigo is a sort of Family Plot where James Stewart is the unwilling alibi to a man murdering his wife. He is hired to follow her but becomes Spellbound by her.  As she appearently falls out of a Rear window of a bell tower, he spirals Downhill into an abyss of mental darkness in despair. When The Lady Vanishes from his life he seems to have no reason for living, but the chance meeting of the spitting image of the woman acts as a Torn Curtain and pulls him out of his misery. Is soon clear that Stewart was a Man Who Knew Too Much to rest easily after her sudden death. He courts the woman and in a Frenzy he persuades her to transform into the dead woman. She agrees to this, but the concession is like walking a tight Rope. She is of course the same person,  the woman he loves, and she is well aware of his Suspicion. As she pretends to be another person while withstanding his Notorious cravings for transformation, her whole life becomes a Stage. Fright is what she feels, there is no Easy Virtue, but at the same time her love for him is like The Birds and the bees. In the end he realises that he has only been a pawn in a chess game of Murder! Highly recommended.
