I'm an avid Scuba diver and the summer I dove the wreck of the U853 off of Block Island, Rhode Island (the last German Uboat sunk in American waters), the film DAS BOOT was running in my head as I touched the outer hull of the U853, now in frigid and deep Atlantic waters.
I had seen DAS BOOT many years ago on the recommendation of my brother.  We saw its first release (at "the movies") which was in German with subtitles.  Even so many years ago, it stuck in my head right awawy... it was my first movie with subtitles, but I never remembered even reading them.... I was so caught up in the gripping drama and action of the film.  What a tremendously powerful statement on war this movie makes.  It was profound for me, even as a teen ager.  Many years later, having studied the German language now for over a decade (I wanted to know what those Germans were *really* saying in that film!).  I just LOVE the DVD edition because I can watch it in English OR German, with or without subtitles.  It's fabulous to have fun watching a movie AND improve your German language skills at the same time. At least FIVE of the original German actors were called back to do the English dubbing (the five lead actors)when the film was re-released in English... so their voices are very authentic indeed.  I love submarines and this is the BEST SUBMARINE MOVIE EVER MADE and one of the most profound statements ever made about war in general.  An unforgettable film.
