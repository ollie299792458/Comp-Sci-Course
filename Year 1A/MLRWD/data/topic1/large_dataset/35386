Here's a quick review of the latest "Dead Zone" DVD rerelease:

PICTURE:

Pretty good actually but a little shoddy in select spots. Not crystal clear but the movie is over twenty years old, so it's probably as good as it's gonna get. An acceptable transfer.

AUDIO:

Nice usage of the surround speakers in several scenes. I had no problems understanding any dialogue and in my opinion, a better than average sound mix. I think the music definitely benefits from this new audio remastering.

EXTRAS:

Cronenberg appears here in several featurettes and I always enjoy listening to whatever this man has to say about anything. He is one of the most engaging speakers I have ever had the pleasure of listening to and he hides nothing really, providing interesting insight into the film and how he approached adapting King's book. Several other members of the crew are present and pop up to chime in on their memories of shooting the film. Most notably absent is Walken himself and I would have loved to hear his recollections on playing Johnny Smith.

OVERALL:

This is a very nice reissue of the Dead Zone which for the price it's going for, is a steal. I think the extras are worth the cost alone and the film still manages to choke me up even after all this time. If you ask me, they should've gone with a different cover because quite frankly, it's just plain ugly.
