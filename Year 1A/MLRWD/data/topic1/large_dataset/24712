Whether or not you buy this film's premise as to who Ludwig van Beethoven's "Immortal Beloved" is, one can not help being swept up in the passion and genius of this, one of history's greatest musical masterminds.
Historians may debate this Bernard Rose interpretation of Beethoven's life -- in fact, most contend the composer may never have known the love of a woman -- but Rose and actor Gary Oldman do an outstanding job of showing the passions and depth of emotion of this often tortured man, struggling with deafness, who funneled his tempestuos spirit into every note of every composition.
Immortal Beloved is not as grandiose a film as Amadeus, but manages to reveal the spirit of Beethoven through the unravelling of a mystery -- the composer's last will and testament and it's reference to an unknown "Immortal Beloved." As Beethoven's close friend embarks on a search for the mysterious love, the composer's life is revealed, bit by bit, with the maestro's music following in step as the film's soundtrack.
All in all, an inspiring film that is true to the spirit of a man whose music grew in greatness as his world around him faded into silence.
