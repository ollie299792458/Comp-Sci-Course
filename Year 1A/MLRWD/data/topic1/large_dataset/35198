So I will refrain from making too many comments on the production, writing, acting and so on and so forth.
I will say this: hoax or no hoax, the book still creeps me out. The movie just doesn't do what the book does, but hey- it's a cult classic. You either love it or you hate it. Sure, it's a terrible movie, but it's nostalgia, baby! I was my daughter's age when it first came out. It brings back fond memories.
Now for my review. I owned this movie on VHS and the quality was very poor. The colors were off. The sound and video quality was poor. It was as though they stretched the picture out in order to make it fit your screen. The DVD rocks because it gives you the option of watching in letterbox. Whether you thought it was a bad movie or not, you can't argue that they did an excellant job transferring it. The picture is super clean. The colors are where they should be. Watching it on DVD was like watching it for the first time all over again. 
I would recommend this disc, because if you're considering buying it, you've probably already seen it and feel the same way I do about it. I just wish it had more features, but for the price I payed, I'm just happy to have this movie in my collection.
