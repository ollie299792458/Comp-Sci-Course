Is the rhetorical question asked by Renton (Ewan McGregor) early on in the movie.  That sums up the complete hold that heroin exerts on the lives of main characters of the movie and the horrendous consequences of this  addiction.
I have heard that Trainspotting has been criticized as  glorifing drugs.  People making this comment must be out of their minds.  I  have never seen such a powerful indictment of heroin and its effects and I  ever had any inclination to try the stuff then a single viewing of the  movie cured me forever.  
Most movies that I watch leave no lasting  impression on me but many of the scenes in Trainspotting will stay with me  for a very long time.  There are moments that make you laugh out loud  (Spud's job interview for example) and others that are some of the most  powerful and disturbing film images that I have ever seen.
Danny Boyle  and co. have do a marvellous job of making a film about real people and  real lives while making it compelling viewing at the same time.  The  soundtrack is excellent just to round off the experience.
