Beautiful to look at, listen to, and study. A FABULOUS
example of French cinema.  Bravo!  I quickly obtained the
double import cd soundtrack by the brilliant composer of
this - Michel Legrand.  And Deneuve has never looked so
gorgeous.  A breathtaking, flawless, incredibly cool film.
EVERY single word is sung, and it WORKS!! I NEVER tire
of seeing and hearing this masterpiece.  I still have the
laserdisc of this, and even still play it now and then.
Cinema and art at its finest by French director Jacque
Demy - a 1964 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize Winner.
For more fabulous work from Demy, Legrand, and Dene-
uve, check out "The Young Girls of Rochefort" from 1967-
another French musical masterpiece that also includes
Gene Kelly in a starring role. Tragically, Deneuve's real
sister, Francoise Dorleac, who plays her twin in "The
Young Girls", was killed in a car crash three months after
its Paris premiere. Also, for a look at Deneuve's FIRST
screen role, check out "The Twilight Girls" from 1957,
an art-house lesbian nudie from Radley Metzger with a
VERY young 13 year old Deneuve (and an early Georgina
Spelvin, the legendary 70's era porn star).  500 million
stars for the stunning, brilliant, and beautiful "Umbrellas
of Cherbourg". They don't make them like this anymore.
