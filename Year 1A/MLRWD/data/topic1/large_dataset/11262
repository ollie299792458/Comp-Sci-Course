Sometimes it's a single word: "Plastics." Or two words: "My precious." Or "Bond. James Bond." (Is that two words, or three?) For movie lovers, some words or collections of words are magically evocative, forever associated with whatever was immortal about the films that featured them. A few days ago, four more words entered this privileged lexicon for me. My son, who will be 13 in September, wanted to see "The Superhero Movie," starring Drake Bell. My son has been a fan of Drake and Josh on TV. We rented the movie on our cable system. It comes in two versions, a PG-13 version and an unrated "Extended" version. Not aware that I could rent the PG-13 version, I rented the extended version for $4.99. The four words that I'll forever associate with the movie came about 10 minutes in. A snail was among a diverse group of animals frenetically attempting to have sexual intercourse with Drake Bell's character. In a subtitle, the snail said the four words: "Take it all, bitch." I was transfixed. The line so overwhelmed me that I found myself unable to watch more of the movie. I turned to another channel, and my son's only reaction was, "Dad, I'm surprised it took you so long to do that." Today, before writing this review, I took the trouble to rent, for another $4.99, the PG-13 version of the movie. The same scene, and the same line, were there. I'm not sure what else to say, except maybe, "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"
