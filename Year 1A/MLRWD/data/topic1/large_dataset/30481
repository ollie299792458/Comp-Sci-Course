This was a very interesting experience for me. I think I've seen collections of animated shorts, but never a collection of live-action shorts combined by one theme. It definitely deserves a watch on a quiet Sunday evening. Paris is beautiful! Most stories are quire sad, but it's a fitting theme to the French cinema. There are some that are very simple in their narrative, and others, like with a nanny, are very deep. Sometimes the short would end so suddenly, that you thoughts are playing catch up with what your eyes just witnessed on screen - it's quite cool experience.

Then there are some stories that are quite banal: like a story of a potential relationship between a conservative Muslim girl and a blond French teenager, I'm sorry but that's just PC. There are others though, about mother's loss of a child, which give you some glimpse into the horror of such loss . All in all, I like most of the stories told in this set, and few that are ok, still watchable and don't deserve a skip button.

As far as the subtitles issue. I agree that it's an oversight to force the hearing impaired subtitles for anyone who's just want to understand whats being said in French. I've never seen that done before and to me it's clearly a mastering mistake. Still, it's not that bad and I would go for a Blu-ray edition over DVD because to me, picture and sound quality improvement  outweighs the occasional "Door Opens, footsteps" on the bottom of the screen. For the record though, I have not compared to DVD version, just can tell you that Blu-ray picture is outstanding.

Enjoy the movie. If you planning on buying, I would probably recommend renting it first.
