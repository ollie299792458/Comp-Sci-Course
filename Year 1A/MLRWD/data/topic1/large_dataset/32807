It is unfortunate that this film is so difficult to find: it has not yet been released on DVD and the VHS has long been out of print. It is a great film.

Diane Keaton turns in a solid, admirable performance as the lead character - an insecure woman who turns to one-night stands with seedy men encountered in seedy bars in seedy lower Manhatten neighborhoods for validation and affection.

This an important depiction of the darker side of the Women's Movement: the negative effect of multiple, casual sexual encounters outside of marriage leading not to empowerment and pleasure but rather to emptiness and, in this case, horrific tragedy. While birth control allowed women sexual freedom it did not lead to only positive results - here, we see a woman choosing to be sexually free only to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous men. And, in the end she is the victim of unspeakable tragedy.

The scenes of 1970's New York are gritty and realistic; the casting is spot-on; the writing is solid as well - all though sometimes too literal especially in the case of the main character's father.

The soundtrack is a true "blast from the past" with - among other classic songs of the era - sultry, memorable tunes from Donna Summer in the days before she hit the pop charts.

This film really should be restored an released via DVD.
