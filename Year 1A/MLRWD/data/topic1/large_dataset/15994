This movie is the equivalent of a Sigur Ros cd.  It puts together a few elements:  superb multi-ethnic futuristic realism, the incomparable Samantha Morton, and some genetic "rules" plot basics, and then weaves nothing more, nor less, than a purely emotional exploration of two lovers.  No Gattaca plot twists, a thorough absence of conventional story telling, no attempt to incorporate the audience's expectations -- only their emotions.  The sountrack, ambient Silver Mt Zion type music, is the constant as we watch Samantha Morton to Tim Robbins straight man explore their emotions.  As strange as it sounds, the movie should be classed with "Crazy/Beautiful" and "Lost in Translation" rather than with "Gattaca."  Like the first two, it centers really on a young woman exploring her emotions and questions about love and life, putting her conventional thinking largely on hold.  It's equally as poignant, though far less accessible than either of these.  All three movies rely on whether you can be swept away by the magnetic performances of the female leads.

The movie will disappoint you if you're waiting for it to meet any of your expectations, but if you can open up to something purely emotional, it rewards richly.  Like "Lost in Translation," it can be a very personal experience to watch.  Never use it as a Friday night feel good date-movie!  My only minor complaint is that I don't think the two actors, Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins, have much chemistry, and this does detract from the movie, since we must believe they do.  That aside, it is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking.  Put the left brain on hold.
