I'm a bit surprised by some of the very negative views of this movie. While it is derivative from Rosemary's Baby, it is still thoroughly it's own plot, complete with a very surprising ending. The underlying premise is  also very interesting, and is an unusual spin on alien invasion. Sparing us  some of the bloody details of movies of this type, it still builds suspense  and terror, feeling both real and surreal at the same time. Depp's  character evolves slowly into the sinister being he has become and I felt  was done convincingly, even though I'm not particulalry a Depp fan. Look  for a very interesting supporting character in the NASA scientist who tries  to help expose the nature of the offspring, complete with some surprising  and believable plot twists. All in all, this movie should appeal to anyone  who has an interest in science fiction/horror. The military weapon that is  the purpose of the alien being's incarnation is an intersting idea, but the  use of that weapon is not entirely clear. Are they developing it to  dominate the world? That's left for the viewer to decide.
