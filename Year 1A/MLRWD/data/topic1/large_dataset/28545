Okay, if your idea of a good movie is one in which you get to do nothing more than swoon at the male lead, this must be your dream movie. On the other hand, if you like your movies to have a story, character development, suspense, intrigue, action, great dialogue, interesting locations... well, just about anything other than a hunk to stare at, you are seriously out of luck here!

This is a truly abysmal movie. Not least because the writers/director/producers just went through the motions. For example, on countless occasions the characters tell us about some absolutely impossible problem they're up against and yet, within seconds, they've overcome that 'impossible' problem with almost no difficulty or thought. There is never any 'will they succeed or won't they' suspense created. There is no action to speak of. There is no intrigue surrounding the characters or story. There is not cunningly elaborate scam. As for character development? Okay, you don't always need a great deal of that to make a great movie, but here there's just squat! Really, the characters all appear - all cardboard - go through the motions with a plot that gives them nothing to work with, then the movie finishes. That's it.

This is one of the worst movies of recent times. It offers nothing. The only people who may like it are those who are easily satisfied by being able to drool over Clooney, Pitt, or Damon for an hour or two.
