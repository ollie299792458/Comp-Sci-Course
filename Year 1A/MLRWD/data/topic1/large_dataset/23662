"I wish more than anything, more than life..." sings the soprano Cinderella tying in Jack, the Baker and his wife.  In the first segment of this brilliant musical the audience learns of each character longing for something: Cinderella: A prince, Jack: His cow, Milky White, Jack's mother: Her son to quit being so dependent on a cow (and to figure out Milky White is a GIRL), the Baker: A child, his wife: again, a child and maybe some more bread.  It's simle just as the originals are.  Other characters stroll in, including Rapunzel, her prince, Cinderella's prince, a witch, a wolf, Little Red Riding Hood and a hoord of fairy tale creatures.  And, like the originals follow the tales fairly well just intertwining them.  
But, the funny thing, aside from the actually stories are the dysfunctional problems these people have!  Cinderella: She's compulsive but regrets her decisions in the end; Jack: co-dependent on an animal and can't gain his man-hood; His mother: Can't let her son go; the Baker: Come on all guys want to keep their lineage no matter what! His wife: thinks a baby will keep her marriage together and ends up ruining it wih Conderella's prince; Rapunzel: Severe depression; the Witch: over-bearing mother who lives through her child.
And on and on...
This musical is so funny and such great performances!  Joanna Gleason really shines as the Baker's wife as a sort of sarcastic, take no guff girl with a romantic underside as she gets seduced (willingly) by the Prince and a soft side for her husband (Moments in the Woods).  Bernadette Peters is great too (as usual) and I love how she talks to the audience.
It's truly a great musical!
