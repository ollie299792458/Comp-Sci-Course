Criterion's release of Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound has a slight flaw. 74 minutes into the film we get a shot of J.B. (Gregory Peck) holding a razor blade, whilst hearing Brulov's (Michael Checkov's) line off screen 'Is that you Mr Brown?'

We then cut to Brulov for his next line 'Oh I thought it was you.' Simple, no? Well, the Criterion DVD cuts away from the razor blade too soon, and then

has the footage of Brulov mouthing his 2nd line, whilst overdubbing his !st! Then we get the 2nd line properly. In other words, the footage of Brulov's line

'Oh I thought it was you' is spliced together twice!!

So far I don't know if the Criterion disc is the only version affected.

If you don't mind the glitch, then Criterion's version of Spellbound is the version to collect (great extras and picture quality). And if you can still find it somewhere (since it's now Out of Print)don't hesitate to buy it, it's still a very good disc and those extras really make this DVD into a true collector's item. Just don't throw away that old VHS tape!
