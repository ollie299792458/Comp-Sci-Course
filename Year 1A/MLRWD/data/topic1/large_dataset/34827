The Cold War history of Germany continues to rise through the political smoke screens and fears of two generations.  Films like this celebrate the normal people who won those small but important victories that sapped the Communist state.  After all, it was not just Western military determination and the Communist economic stupidity that doomed the East but the determination of normal people to escape or go around the rules of that society.

This film is one of those must sees for anyone wanting to learn of anguish of Germany from 1945 to the 1989.  A German man tries to reunite his family who are trapped on the other side of the Wall after he escapes.  He finally decides to dig a tunnel from the French sector hundreds of yards into East Germany and bring her and others out.  The movie follows the months of digging, planning,the parallel hunt by the Stasi, financial & engineering problems to the edge of the seat ending.

One thing I found truly amazing was the US media involvement.  A US network found out and offered to help finance the digging while keeping it secret from all but a handful of their own.  It's hard to believe sometimes that the media once used to have that capability of honor.

A good movie and one that had us looking for the site when in Berlin.  We had no luck but it was still fun hunting!
