This movie is the shiznit.  I know everyone says Super Troopers was better, but that's because they didn't think this would be a different movie.  I like the way they were able to make such big character transitions for this.  It really amazes me how people didn't like it because it was also a horror movie.  They stepped into a territory that many can unsuccessfully stay in, but I think they really pulled it off.  The characters and dialogue were pretty funny, especially Machete Phil.  That scene surprised me.  I couldn't believe what I had seen.  These guys are the funniest group since Kids in the Hall and Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  No movie scares me much anymore so I watched this to laugh, see some gore, and also, unexpectedly, see the diversity of characters they can play.  I'm really surprised with Kevin Heffernan.  He seemed natural as Farva, and then he is very smart in this one.  I liked Putman because his humor was more of a subtle thing than blatantly obvious like the others.  Him and Jenny was a hilarious running joke.  The killer surprised me.  I didn't expect it to be him.  He really creeped me out.  This movie is definitely worth a purchase, and also people should watch it like they have never seen Super Troopers.  It can still be very entertaining.  I hope to work with Broken Lizard one day.  They inspired me to pursue my dream of making movies, one I had been debating over for a long time.  Thanx guys if u ever read this review.  Keep up the good work and I hope to see your next movie pretty soon.
