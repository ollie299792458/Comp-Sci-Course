This was a great a show and the year was in fact 1976 in Houston. This was before my time but I saw this show years ago before it was available on DVD. Pure Funk! For me, the highlight of the show was watching the profound performance of Glenn Goins. Goins took over Parliament's "Mothership Connection" with a musical baptism during the transition to "Swing Down." Watching Glenn, with his eyes closed and hands raised to the sky, fully immersed in musical freedom, it is hard to believe that he was only 22 years old at the time. It is even harder to grasp that 2 years later, this young man that declared, "I think I hear the mothership coming," would truly ascend to the mothership and be dead at 24, succumbing to Hodgkins disease. Glenn declared, "After the mothership comes, there will be no second coming." He was right - He was one of a kind. Like Quincy Jones once said: "If we had lost Oprah Winfrey at 25, we would have lost a relatively unknown, local market TV anchorwoman. If we had lost Malcolm X at 25, we would have lost a hustler named Detroit Red. And if I had left the world at 25, we would have lost a big-band trumpet player and aspiring composer -- just a sliver of my eventual life potential." While Jones' reference was to the tragic death of Tupac Shakur at 25, the parallel can be drawn to Glenn Goins who lost his life at 24.

This is a worthwhile DVD for all funk lovers. Definitely a keeper for the archives.
