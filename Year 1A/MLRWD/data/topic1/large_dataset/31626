If only I had seen this price than at Walmart, I would have waited, but at least I have it instantly ;o)And it's worth it, I"m a big grey's fan, so this is the only dvd set I'd get for this price, anything else would be a rental! I am impresssed that with the writer's strike, they managed to have a 5 disc set, i was expecting 3 at the least.

I think the reason why half the season was better than the first is due to Shonda Rimes focusing most of her attention back to the show.  The first half of the season, she was mostly in the private practice lot and wrote more there. I just hope she does a better job at multi-tasking for both shows, this upcoming season.

I love Meredith, my fav charactor, she has gone through a lot and now she realize she can't run away from it, and she has to go after what she wants.  The season finale is awesome and loved how everything came at a full circle!

Would I suggest others to get it? It depends on how much  you love grey's, if you've dedicated a lot of time watching greys, then add this to your collection.

I'm still in love with the dialogue, the symbolism that the writers put to the show to make you think, the awesome characters that make up the show.  I'm not that disappointed with the show other than the strike that put a hold onto it for awhile.
