you can't compare this movie to any other movie about vietnam.  it does stand alone, to be sure.  funny thing, though, in the video hound guide to war movies they gave the Deer Hunter only two and a half bones, saying the movie was racist, depicting the vietnamese as beasts and savages.  Meanwhile, they give Siege of Fire Base Gloria 4 out of 4 bones.  That movie was terrible.  Anyway, i just don't get how people can say that the vietnamese are a gentle people who are only victims.  That is the other side of a coin, and that's it.  yeah, i'm sure there are some decent vietnamese people.  yeah, they've been fighting with china and themselves and the french and us and whoever else for the last 1000 years.  Claiming superlatives only belittles them, whether you call them the worst or the best.  by the way,The Deer Hunter also showed slews of dispossessed vietnamese peasants walking the roads.  Ask Philip Caputo what he thinks about the vietnamese, and he'll give you a complex response.  And that's what The Deer Hunter is: a complex response to possibly the most complex situation this country has been involved in since our own Civil War.
