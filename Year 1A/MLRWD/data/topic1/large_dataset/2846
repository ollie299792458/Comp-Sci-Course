Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, stuntmaster, and comedian?  Of course he is all of them!  In most cases, good martial artists aren't Jerry Seinfield; look at Bruce Lee for example.  This movie is one of the top three funniest films of all time in my opinion along with "Rush Hour" and "Spaceballs."  It has very funny sequences and not to mention action-packed.  The movie also has crazy stunts which is normal in a Jacki Chan movie, and Owen Wilson makes the movie more...  Let's just say interesting.  The fight scenes look realistic, except for the style, and the acting is well done.
The movie is about an imperial guard (Chan) along with a relative of his and a few of their best men trying to find the Princess of China (Liu) and go to the US neogiating a ransom deal.  I highly recommend this movie beause the characters are stuck in some deep sh** and the outcome is funny.  Screw the movie critics who say that it's bad blah blah and it has a bad storyline yadda yadda and it's not funny and the movie didn't let him be himself and all that crap because they have no idea what a good movie is, don't like Chan because 60% of the critics are classified as a beached whale from all that snacking, don't get any of the jokes because they don't know what they mean, or are just dumb.  Watch the bloopers, a registered trademark of Chan!
