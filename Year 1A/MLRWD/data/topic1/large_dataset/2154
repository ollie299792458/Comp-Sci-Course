Is bigger better? The people behind TITANIC 2 are hoping fans will think so. Arguably the most eagerly-anticipated sequel in cinematic history -- James Cameron's original was the first movie to make over a billion dollars world-wide, remember -- TITANIC 2 arrives on dvd (sorry kids, no sign of a blu-ray yet) in a visually opulent widescreen presentation that's sure to please fans and historians alike. While no one could have expected this belated follow-up to surpass Cameron's Academy Award-winning classic, TITANIC 2 nonetheless has a charm all it's own; the film is lightning-paced (you won't need to set three hours aside to watch this puppy!), and while Brooke (BAYWATCH) Burns is no Kate Winslet, her performance is riveting and real. Also, special effects have come a long way since TITANIC smashed the box-office record book over a decade ago, allowing director Shane Van Dyke to do things Cameron could only dream about in 1997.

So, is bigger better? According to the producers of TITANIC 2, the answer is a resounding yes, and while no one's going to forget Kate and Leo, TITANIC 2's greatest strength is that, unlike most sequels, you don't have to have seen the original to know what's going on.
