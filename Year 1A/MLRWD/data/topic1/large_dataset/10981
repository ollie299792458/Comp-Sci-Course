Oh Lordy.... this film is pure camp. It's like a parody of every southern story ever told. It's Tennessee Williams on steroids....with some cream gravy. Every cliche is here complete with all those "charming" southern details anyone from the south would verify. If only the South was like this! The details are right....the big picture is way off. It also includes every southern stereotype: The fast talkin', good lookin' drifter, the "Big Daddy" who owns the county, the hot dumb southern babe [the men folk even come out to the big house at night to try to lure her out....even though she's married], the cold sensible southern girl with repressed sexuality about to burst from her...well.... It's got the lame brain son & heir too stupid to carry on Big Daddy's empire, and the mother's boy son of the old-money family who looks down on the Big Daddy's folks, and Big Daddy's mistress, who's gonna trick him into marriage. And let's not forget the compliant but wise negros and the dumber than dirt hayseeds [and Mexicans] that populate the town. The fact that all these cardboard cutouts are played by huge actors is a big laugh....even they can't save it.

You'd have to be as credulous as the town folk in this film to be taken in by it. Still, it's campy fun. File it under "so bad it's good" along with "Valley of the Dolls". Yeeee-haw!
