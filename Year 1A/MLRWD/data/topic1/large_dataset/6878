What can you give to some one who likes Classical and at the Same time heavy metal music? Solution: Metallica S&M. This DVD features one of the most notorious heavy metal Band known to America accompanied with one of the best organizations of all: The San Francisco Symphony. It is to no surprise that after viewing this videos or listening to the CDs much of the heavy metal fans opened their taste for classical music and the same goes for the classical music fans towards heavy metal. Three of the most awesome features of this DVD are the composition Ectasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, wich it has been heard on Clint Eastwood's "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly". Also the display for the song "One" Wich had a mayor impact of the view on the military; And last but not least the best feature ever is the release of the song "No Leaf Clover". This Song has a mayor view on hardship and the short rewards of Life. Overall this Volume of the carrer of Metallica will have a long and steady hold for years to come. I rate this product a ten but unfortunatedly there is only a max of five
