In Insomnia, Al Pacino is an LA cop of dubious reputation who is called upon to investigate a crime in Alaska.  Some call this a more conventional effort from Memento director Christopher Nolan, yet it doesn't play like a standard thriller.  The landscape and especially the long days in Alaska are as much part of the film as the characters.  Pacino is a top notch investigator but is also a fish out of water away from the big city.  He becomes involved more directly as events occur, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how things really happened partway into the movie.  Enter Robin Williams, who plays a solitary writer who comes along to "assist" the investigation of a girl's death.  
Williams has done great work dramatically before, and he fits his role in Insomnia perfectly; he plays off against Pacino very well.  Hilary Swank is a local cop, relegated to minor insignificant duties by her male colleagues, and she both idolizes Pacino's character as well as being a determined investigator on her own.  
There are some great scenes here, the chase across the floating logs, the shooting in the fog, and Pacino's great difficulty at adjusting to the midnight sun (to say the least).  It's a thriller but a bit different.
