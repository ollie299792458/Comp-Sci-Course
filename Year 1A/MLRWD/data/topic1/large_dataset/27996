I love work-out DVDs where I can pick and choose different segments because most days, I don't have time to dedicate myself to a full hour of exercise. This one is a great video to have because you don't need a lot of time, or a lot of room.

The first time I did this work-out, I didn't think it did anything for me. I barely broke a sweat and I was only a little out of breath. However, after showering and relaxing for a little bit afterward, I really felt the areas that I worked: arms, stomach and thighs. I was impressed.

I also like Janis as an instructor. She's not cheesy, or cheerleader-y at all, but she's enthusiastic enough to keep you motivated. The time clock on the bottom of the screen helps, too.

The only complaint I have about this work-out is that after a while, it isn't as challenging. But if you add 1 or 2 pound weights to your ankles or legs (depending on which area you're working), you'll definitely work up a sweat!

Bottom line: Great for those who need to customize their work-out to fit their lifestyle.
