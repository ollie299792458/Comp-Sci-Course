Hope that helps you. Seinfeld is hilarious. For example in the Bubble Boy episode "Moops" is the answer to the Trivial Pursuit question "Who invaded Spain in the 8th century A.D.?" according to George Costanza in the episode The Bubbleboy. The Bubbleboy contested the answer and suggested it was the Moors (which is correct). George, being the stubborn individual he is, refused to accept the response as the card clearly said Moops (presumably a typo).
