This was a wonderful beginning to what I hope is a more open-minded approach to romantic comedies--two strong, reletively secure, stable women who fall in love.  There are obvious neuroses (what would a romantic comedy be without it?) but the two women, Helen and Jessica, are impressively "together" all on their own.
Jessica Stein is a brilliant, but bored, copy editor whose boss happens to be an old flame from college.  Just when she has convinced herself that she isn't the problem--blaming everything the non-commital ...men of New York--her brother announces his engagement.  Mortified and a little worried about her own single status, Jessica makes a life-altering decision:  she answers a singles ad placed by another woman.  
...I won't leak any details (because it's too funny to give away) but they're hilarious as they fumble through their relationship, learning as they go.  
This movie is laden with great actresses, many of whom I've never seen before.  We'll doubtless see more of Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen (hopefully as a team, since they write and act exceptionally well together).  The wonderfully quirky performances of Jackie Hoffman (Joan) and Esther Wurmfeld (Grandma) are hilarious.
The most refreshing aspect of this movie is that it doesn't acknowledge the "femme" and "butch" stereotypes of lesbian relationships.  Also, Westfeldt and Juergensen have written a screenplay that beautifully depicts (FINALLY) a long-neglected truth:  sexuality is not black and white but rather fluid and ever-changing.  I'm sure this "type" relationship is more common than anyone likes to admit.  This movie is funny, quirky, fresh and all-around fun.  I highly recommend it!
