Okay folks, the first half of Species, the original movie actually made a genuine effort into being a "good movie".  The "b horror flick" ending we were given let open the door for a downgraded cast to return and plod through a mish-mash plot just to get to another alien sex-hack-fest.  Now we roll around to Species III, which probably broke its budget convincing Nastasha Henstridge to come back as a corpse "just one more time... I promise".  If you bought this or are going to rent this with hopes of seeing her run around naked for half the movie, go back to species I and II, she doesn't do much of anything in this flick.  Taking the "species" genre yet one more direction it shouldn't go, this junk adds the element of "half-breeds".  Half human - half alien messes that run around with bad immune systems that need their genomes jacked up and patched in order to live.  The crux of this movie is a bunch of grad. students and a professor trying to make a pure strain of "the alien" that can live on earth.  (cause the fame of creating a new species is totally worth wrecking the native population of a planet)I'll spare you more wonderous plot points and just get down to brass tacks: The goods: Yet another naked chick running around being "an alien".  The bads: H.R. Geiger did enough when he helped inspire the whole "alien" series of movies... (the first 2 are excellent).  But the species movies are just cheap knock offs that have sexual overtones and "alienized" human bodies fight and have sex a bunch of times. (hmmm... maybe that isn't too bad...)The uglies: We are treated to no less than 4 takes of a gate to the dorm room of the "grad students" opening and closing, poor rubber suits (species II atleast had CGI), an even MORE retarded ending than species I or II and of course the opportunity for a species IV!!! Oh NoOOooOOOoooooo!!!!! Its crap folks, but its good crap to goof on some nite with friends and pizza.
