I know those who read the book first are greatly disappointed with the movie, but as is said in the dialogue, "There are many paths to Fantasia."  Many people who aren't into books would miss this terrific opportunity.  I *am* "into" books, and I still missed this one, and if it weren't for the movie then I wouldn't have enjoyed one of the greatest stories I have ever seen on film.
This movie isn't just for kids.  It is rich in symbology that will amaze you as it slowy dawns on you just how multi-layered this story is.  An example is The Swamp of Sadness, and how it symbolizes the "Dark Night of the Soul" that we each ultimately have to journey though in our own lives, as we face our adversities that we think we cannot possibly overcome.  Our weakness is an illusion that we must not give in to, or we are lost.  Amazing symbology; truly outstanding.
It is like this throughout the entire movie.  One of my favorite scenes involved looking into a mirror. But I won't say more because I don't want to risk spoiling the story for you.
This movie is terrific and will mesmerize both kids and adults, alike!
If you are looking for a movie that is more than just fluff and will touch your soul, reach for this one.  You won't regret it.
