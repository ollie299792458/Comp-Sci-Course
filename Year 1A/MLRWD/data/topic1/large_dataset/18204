The title of this movie is "Street Fighter", it's about a dictator trying to take over the world... Where are all the fights? It seems the writers spent their time figuring out ways to stop them, por ejemplo: Ryu vs Vega, and when fights do happen then you understand why they were being stopped in the first place, almost no one is a martial artist in this movie. Watching Ken's Carradine inspired sidekicks is horrible. Also laughable is how everyone conveniently finds their costumes throughout the movie, in one scene Dhalsim mysteriously walks out in his diapers, Where did he find the clothes? I don't know but at least he is quickly blown up. There are hints of special moves throughout the film, in one excellent example of fight choreography gone bad Ken does this pathetic spinning uppercut that's supposed to be a dragon punch, others are less subtle like Bison flying around on wires. Instead of spending their Bison bucks on a fight choreographer they spent it on explosions, fake looking sets, an invisible boat, and blue camoflage?! I give this piece of [junk] a two for laughs.
