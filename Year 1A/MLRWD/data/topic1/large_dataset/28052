I write this review in order to encourage people to buy this as a gift for families with children or for their own family or kids. I remember all the songs I was exposed to over and over from when I was little, don't you? From Anine, and Grease, and Sound of Music, and Fiddeler on the Roof.

This is such a positive, fun, heart-warming movie with such great and simple songs for any kid to learn and sing. I think it is a must to counter-balance the world of video games, and violent and mindless T.V. to expose your kids, other's kids to something positive like this, AND, importantly, something they will enjoy!

What a wonderful present.

Here are some of the things this DVD will hold for you:

The movie, of course

Wonderful surrond sound, and sing alongs to the songs!

Commentary by the actors and directors for those of you who want to get into the movie even more deeply...maybe because the wondeful memories you have of it!

Still photos of behind-the-scenes and some screen tests and other storyboard stuff, which makes learning about the production of the movie great.

Also, some previews too, which is a great walk through history.

All and all, give a wonderful postive gife to any family, this is a great one!

Lastly, I am in a review writing competition with some other people, so if you liked this review I would love your Yes vote, I write this review though with sincerity and hope for that the kids in the world will find the positive joy of musicals, before they run into the negative elements waiting to take their minds and money later. Take care and best wishes!
