The yang to _Forrest Gump_'s yin in 1994, _Pulp Fiction_ was Quentin Tarantino's breakout movie, drawing waves after waves of eager viewers to the theatre without the marketing bonanza of the Tom Hanks feel-good fiesta.  Dark, sometimes disturbing, and altogether different, Tarantino's masterpiece broke all the rules of how to make a blockbuster movie, with tremendous relish.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not do such an outstanding film justice.
_Pulp Fiction_ is still here in all its letterboxed glory, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet should do so.  Tarantino's acting is the only performance that does not border on amazing, and Tarantino can be forgiven for that for writing such tremendous characters, gritty dialogue and avant-garde plot.  Unfolding the storyline in a non-linear fashion works wonderfully, creating a tremendous climax at the end of the film and adding more to its mystique.  Some may not be able to follow the story because of this, and others may not be able to stomach the abundance of violence and dirty language, but for those who can, the movie itself is cinematic gold.
But _Pulp Fiction_ enthusiasts looking for the "royale with cheese" DVD treatment will not find it here.  Despite releasing both laserdisc and VHS editions of the movie filled with extras, the DVD features only an alternate Spanish audio track.  The absence of special features, especially for a movie with a large established cult following, is almost unforgivable, particularly as they were already there to be added.
If you have not seen _Pulp Fiction_ yet, or you absolutely have to have a DVD copy of it now, purchase this disc.  If you can wait, however, Miramax should release a "special edition" laden with bonus features soon (if they have any sense), and you should save your money for that.
