I had forgotten how much I enjoyed "Speed" until I saw it again in its newest DVD transfer.  Forget about the plausibility of the plot, since if that were the standard to judge action/adventure movies, how many would qualify? Instead, enjoy the non-stop excitement, with "Armaggedon"-type pacing where each solution is followed by another problem.  
The movie is basically all-action, all the time, and that's what those of us who love this genre want.  If you're looking for profound dialogue or character development, you won't find it, but you will find lots of humor thrown in to lighten things up.
Keanu Reeves gives a glimpse of the sort of intensity that he would bring to the "Matrix", and Bullock is about as believable as anyone could be behind the wheel of the bus. The two of them establish a good chemistry and this definitely lifts the film above the run-of-the-mill.
Dennis Hopper is his usual maniacal self as the crazed villain, and Jeff Daniels does a credible job as Reeves' partner; the two of them had some great lines at the beginning of the film.
The DVD transfer is excellent;  the video is clear and well-balanced with minimal digital artifacts, and the audio will give your surround system a real workout.  I haven't looked at the second disc yet but it's loaded with extras.  
Bottom line:  for a classic adventure flick with an outstanding new remastering, this Five Star version of "Speed" can't be beat!
