Its been over 20 years since I last seen this film. It still

retains its strangeness, quite a different style of film making

but it came out in the earlier 80's and the video craze was taken off so I can understand where it was coming from.  It has

many great shots thanks to the wonderful lighting and music through out. Catherine Deneuve is an underated beauty and steals

any scene shes in. This is one of Bowies best, the two night

prowl for victims and give another twist on the vampire legend with the Egyptian mini daggers that takes the place of fangs??

Susan Sarandon took some chances on this movie, but I've always liked her

style, she doesn't give a crap about the hollywood lifestyle,

she just likes to act and this was a brave great earlier vehicle for her talents. The movie makes its way slowly but

its interesting all the same, moody, sensual, highly erotic scenes, pretty wild stuff for 83' but you can't even show

a boob anymore without people flippin out??  Full of great angle shots from above this movie was a groundbreaker even though the critcs pretty much hated it, I thought it was well

worth checking out for the whole arty stuff going on.

 I wonder how Alfred Hitchcock would have improved this one?
