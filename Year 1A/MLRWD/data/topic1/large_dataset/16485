I watched this movie because it was said to be a good example of a contemporary Australian film and won several prizes. I was sorry. Unfortunately, many artists today - in this case the director and writer David Michod - think their goal should be to show that "everything in society is bad," but to do so with high technical polish. Can someone explain to me why is it that, with all the interesting adventures people have in life, crime is thought to be the only story dramatic enough for the movies?

The acting is excellent, the photography is excellent, the production is excellent - but the content is unrelievedly depressing, negative and black. There is one heroine overdose death, four gunshot murders, one strangulation of an innocent teenage girl, corrupt police, and hints of incestuous sexual behavior in the first hour. And don't look for a happy ending either; the last act is a fifth gunshot murder. Oh, did I forget the psychopath? The cocaine abuse? The general air of fear and menace? After you watch this, you may want to get some counselling. Or perhaps go out to a movie. The inspiration for the film is said to be a period in Melbourne history when the city was overrun with violent crime. Perhaps. But as a film watching experience, a downer and just not all that interesting.

One more thing; the actors speak in strong Australian dialects and it is impossible to understand a significant part of the dialog.
