The sequel to the groundbreaking original takes the Batman series to another level. What's so intriguing about this film is that it has a personality and style far more intense than its predecessor. It has its own flavor. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to piece together the ambitions of the mysterious Penguin (Danny DeVito), and the sexy, sultry Catwoman (Michelle Pfheiffer), and keep Gotham City streets safe. The Christmas season flows with an aura of darkness, thanks to Tim Burton's visionary direction, and the movie just flows smoothly. Keaton gives another solid performance as the caped crusader, DeVito is great as Penguin, and Pfheiffer is scorching in that cat suit. Some fans were disappointed in how the atmosphere's a little different in "Batman Returns". There's no wild parade, no Joker, no Prince songs. But fans who really appreciate an interesting drama mixed in with breathtaking action will love "Batman Returns". This new special edition of the film does it some justice, remastering it in high-quality and packing in some interesting documentaries on the second disc. A must-buy for Batman fans.
