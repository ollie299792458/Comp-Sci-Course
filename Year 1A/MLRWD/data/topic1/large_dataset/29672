This was an old favorite from when I was a kid and it still is I found after buying this great set!  The theme song at first as an adult I found kind of corny, but as I watched more episodes, it started to grow on me and it brought with it found memories of my youth.  The main extra was fine to me, the retrospective from the original season one cast.  It was fun to see all of them a lot older.  But I have to say, each on of the main cast still looks good for being 20-30 years older.

I wish we had shows like this still on tv.  It's really sad to me that family sitcoms are basically dead and that hour long crime drams are king.  But as the "westerns" age of tv shows showed us, nothing last forever on tv, so maybe shows like this may come back a few years from now, who knows?  But, even more then that and especially if that doesn't happen, I hope we see more season of this on DVD!  While it has been a few years since this release, I have heard rumors that season two may come out in 2011.  Crossing my fingers!
