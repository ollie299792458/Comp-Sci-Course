This set includes two terrific movies, Henry King's THE GUNFIGHTER with Gregory Peck and Henry Hathaway's RAWHIDE with Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward. The third film, Hathaway's GARDEN OF EVIL with Hayward and Gary Cooper, is much the least of the lot, but at least it has beautiful CinemaScope cinematography that the disc captures very well. It's also regrettable that GARDEN is the only one of the three with a commentary track, doubly so in that the three commentators discuss nothing but Bernard Herrmann's musical score -- a subject in which fans of westerns, Cooper, Hayward or Hathaway will have no interest whatsoever.

On the plus side, as noted, the other two films are terrific, with one of Peck's best-ever performances in THE GUNFIGHTER. Also, the package includes several extras to compensate for the snooze-fest Herrmann commentary: featurettes on Lone Pine, CA, a popular location where over 400 movies were made, on GUNFIGHTER cinematographer Arthur Miller, and on Henry Hathaway, a director whose career and work are decades overdue for the respect they deserve.
