"Songs from Tsongas" is a superb document of an incredible tour by the world's greatest progressive rock band. It's one of Yes' two best DVDs, second only to the magnificent "Symphonic Live."

First, the awesome, moving Roger Dean stage set makes this a true visual experience. The set, which is sort of an undersea garden/mystical landscapes hybrid, fills the imagination. Dean, if you recall, did the artwork for many classic Yes albums, and looking at this stage is like watching a Dean painting come to life.

The set list is absolutely, positively spectacular. Yes was much-maligned in recent years for their stagnant, predictable set list, but on their 2004 tour they aired music that never been played live in their 35-year history, most notably the stellar mid-90s epic "Mind Drive." Other songs - ranging from "Going for the One" to "Sweet Dreams" - hadn't been visited since the 70s, and obligatory pieces like "Roundabout" were given fresh arrangements. And there were the 20-minute epics - in addition to "Mind Drive," the show features an excellent version of "Ritual."

The musician line-up is stellar. While the Yes line-up seems to change as frequently as the weather, on this night it was the classic line up of Anderson/Howe/Squire/Wakeman/White. The performances are excellent, but again, when isn't a Yes performance excellent?

The filming and editing are professional and unobtrusive. Quite simply, you feel as if you are there, on a magical and exciting evening.

The downsides? None. I do get tired of whiners who complain that their Personal Coliseum Dolby Spherical Total-Immersion System version 9,000.0 was lab tested in Switzerland to find this DVD is mixed infinitesimally to the whatever (detectable to radiologically-mutated chihuahuas and Borneo guano bats, but not humans of course).

So again, this is an awesome tour of the one of the greatest musical forces of all time, on one of their greatest tours. Highly, highly recommended.
