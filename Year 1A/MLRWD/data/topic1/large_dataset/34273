This dvd is worth every penny spent on it. When you look at other musical dvds being released, near the same price, and how lax they are in the content, this is very refreshing. The audio and picture are very crisp on disk 1, the picture is some of the best quality Ive seen in any musical dvd I own. I think the reason for camera shifts and location shifts is to add to the experience, Ive seen it done with many other live dvds as well, and this one doesnt make a gigantic habbit of it (Like the Guns, God, and Government DVD released by manson) The second disk is a little misleading in terms of promotion, but, we should be grateful for what we are given. Even though the camera jumps around constantly on the Archival footage, its not meant to be a preformance of the song played, its suppost to give us a look at the concerts of the  era. The Documentary is very interesting, but Ill admit I ended up getting a little bored with it near the end. The highlight of the 2nd disk would have to be the Eurotrama. This gives us an excellent behind the scenes look as well as some very old footage. The only complaint I have is no where with the dvd, but in that I didnt get to see Skinny Puppy last go around, but, thers alaways next time.
