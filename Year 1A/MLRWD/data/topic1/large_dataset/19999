This was a very good movie. Starts off a bit slow with the relationship between the two leads, but picks up once Ash (as Namrata) 'helps' him to find a persepctive bride. And of course instead he falls in love with her, not knowing that she's already married with a little boy. He meets the son by chance separately, and loves him as well. I think I liked the realtionship between Raj and the little boy almost more than the romance. The boy (Adi) was a very good actor for someone so young, and it made the story so much more interesting and endearing. It had my husband and I both laughing through the whole first half with all the supporting cast and their wit. As with any Bollywood, there is romance, song and dance, and a weird twist at the end of the film. The song and dances were engaging, and lighthearted. Supporting characters were fun and deep (Raj's family), and the evil villian at the end, is of course the dead beat husband who abandoned her seven years ago-whom you love to hate, and who appears out of the blue demanding his family back, when he has no right to. I could see how this would be seen as a controversial movie in India, as there is almost never divorce, and why it proved such a problem for Ash's character to fall in love with someone new, even with her husband long gone. The highlights for me were when Raj goes to Adi's school as his "Dad", and the chemistry between Raj and Ash, especially in the "video" scene when he wraps the veil around her. It's easy to see how they came to be together later on in life, as a real married couple with a family of their own now. Raj's character is loving, and brilliant as the "good guy". And of course as always Ash is gorgeous, funny, girl next door, and dazzling all at once. Raj's daydreams about Namrata (Ash), and the ending credits with their family in the future were also extremely fun highlights. If you pass on this one, you will be missing a major classic. Going to buy it on DVD now. I loved it.
