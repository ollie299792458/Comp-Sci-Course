When I grow up, I want to be just like Maude.

This movie dispelled my fear of growing old, and turned me on  to Cat Steven's super great music and lyrics.

This is a black comedy , a cult classic. I used to gauge my future romances by whether my date liked (and got) what this film was all about.

This is my favorite movie of all time. At first I liked it, but each time I saw it , I enjoyed it more , until I fell in love with it.

It is offbeat and quirky, with snatches of dry humor and profound truth.... so if you are looking for a comfortable neat and tidy movie, look elsewhere, as this will irritate you and you won't know why.

 For , as Jack Kerouac said so eloquently:

  "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!"

Yeah, you know who you are, and you know you will watch this one..
