It was a Friday night, and there didn't seem to be any good movies out. So I went to see "Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets" and just expected to think it was silly and immature. I was completely blown away! I never knew anything about Harry Potter before I saw this movie, and I was hooked by the end. Now I'm a huge HP fan.
And now, after watching the first movie as well, this one was even more incredible than the wonderful first one, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." I have to say, wow, did those kids grow! David Radcliffe, Tom Felton, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are big kids now! Well at least...bigger than before. And my, has their acting improved. I have never seen young kids perform so good in my life. They truly made the "Chamber of Secrets" a real gem.
What I loved about the movie is how they stuck true to the novel. Yes, some things were changed and moved around a bit, but I think they did a much better job than with the first one. 
The acting was great. I mentioned the kids already (man, they were good!), but I can't forget the superior acting talents of the adults in the movie. Maggie Smith, Richard Harris (rest in peace), Jason Isaacs, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Kenneth Branagh, and all of the other fabulous actors suited their role perfectly. 
The special effects were great (as you would expect). The quidditch scene was one of my favorites...as far as FX go, they seemed utterly flawless. 
It was darker than the first (once again, following the novel. Can't imagine how dark the fourth one will be...), bolder, and better in every way. One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. 
You don't have to be 12 to love Potter! I give it to 2 thumbs up and definitely recommend adding it to your collection.
