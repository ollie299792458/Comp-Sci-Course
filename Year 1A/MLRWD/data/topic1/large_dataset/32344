A low budget British horror movie, it is exemplary of some of the excellent entertainment that comes out of the UK.
A squad of British soldiers are out on manuvers in the wilds of Scotland, and stumble over what turns out to be the remains of a Special Forces operation to capture a werewolf. From that point forward, they are fighting for their lives against a pack of howling nasties that are merely annoyed by bullets. After holing up in a farm house, they struggle desperately and wait for dawn.
The movie is a modern spin on the classical werewolf story, and is certainly among the single most gory films I've seen in years. It is a great example of how good an indie film can be, even in a highly commercialized genre like horror. The makers' of this film pulled no punches in the sheer bloody nature of the work of a pack of ravenous werewolves. That aside, it is also a solid, fun exercise in storytelling.
I would not recommend this movie to everyone, but fans of werewolf stories or horror movies MUST give this movie a look.
