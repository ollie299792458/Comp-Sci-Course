liam neeson as always gives a stellar performance but the directing and story flounders.  it was too much of a documentary and less of a drama - there isn't much a critical point that the director is trying to teach.  i like the story of the real kinsey whom i view as a man who in his studies of the flesh and the appetites eventually becomes consumed by them and dies a miserable death, mostly due to an addiction to masochism and for being an iconoclast but this film didn't really explore that avenue.

 lust, megalo-turbulo, apoplexic, cutting, whirlpools consuming sailors, hurricanes slasho-destructing beaches, lust, banishing all other thoughts to the periphery, wrapping one in single-minded obsession, lust, sexual activity being one's only pursuit, the thrust of the pelvis, the iron of the erection, the pleas&agrave;ntica of the groan, lust, warmed and soothed in spite of the surrounding tundra, sufficient in spite of one's poverty of relationships, coyote-howling with piercing joy in spite of the junkyard of grime, lust, when its pussance vice-grips us and we obey its splurge how we feel invigorated with energeticum!  how we bathe in crysto-shower!  how prime we are for the mega-titan ultra-astoundican!
