I'm not going to recap on the movie since it's been done in most of the reviews. The movie had a great soundtrack and really great actors. However, I didn't really care for this movie as much as I hoped I would care. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone in England and was really looking forward to this movie. I felt like I didn't understand or connect with the couple. I actually connected more with her and Simon's relationship due to the fact that he reminded me of my ex. Simon was not as great as people have said. He overdominated the conversation and it was always about him. It was obvious in the parents' reaction that they didn't like him at all whereas they seemed to love Jacob.

I hated how we as viewers missed important conversations. One scene she's being deported, then they are missing phone calls in the next scene, and then he's telling his partner that he's not going to England, because they are just friends. Another missed scene...they get married, they fight about obvious jealously and being insecure and angry, and then they are shacked up with another person in the next scene (with no concept of time, except that she had dated Simon for 6 months). WAIT...WHAT? What they hell just happened? And are they still married?

Also, they didn't seem to like eachother as much when they got together after a long parting. I mean, when my man leaves, I'm not sitting on the otherside of a train smiling at him. I'm holding on to him as much as I can before I have to leave his side. And then, it just ends with them remembering how it used to be that summer (with the exception of Jacob remembering the wedding...I assume). They didn't even seem overly happy to FINALLY be together after all that time.

All in all, I was very disconnected from this movie whereas I shouldn't have been. I just felt like it could have been and wanted to be so much more.
