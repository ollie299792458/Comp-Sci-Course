This two DVD set is so terrific, I hardly know where to start.
The film itself, which has received another remastering, from the LaserDisc release ten years ago, never looked or sounded as good. I doubt if the original release had a DD 5.1 real stereo soundtrack. And this not only applies to the songs, but the entire score. This gives the Halloween sequence a realistic quality that makes it truly terrifying. A great visit as to what Halloween used to be before candy. Super closed captioning as well, along with terrific audio commentaries by those who knew best, including Margaret O'Brien. The soundtrack is also available for playback, minus vocals, so you can sing along, or just listen to the terrific stereo sound.
The second DVD contains not one, but two different documentaries on the making of this classic film. Plus the short "Bubbles", which the Gumm Sisters appeared in in 1929, long before Garland was a star. Also there is a 1966 TV pilot, in color, with Celeste Holm, Shelley Fabares, and Reta Shaw. One very interesting note, is that the actor that appeared in this TV pilot that played the "boy next door", is named Blodgett! All Judy fans will recognize that name from the famed A Star is Born. A bit of coincidence?
There is also a re-creation of the deleted song from the film, "Boys and Girls Like You and Me", plus a very rare "soundie" featuring the songwriters, and the very excellent "Becoming Judy" with Robert Osborne, which includes many of Garland's film trailers. It goes on to explain why trailers are called that, and gives tremendous insight into the publicity or exploitation department of MGM.
There is more..........the original Lux Radio Theatre production of "Meet Me in St. Louis", with the original cast.
I couldn't recommend this release more, and there are lots more extras that I did not mention. A super job from all involved -- fully expected from a musical of this caliber. Highly recommended!!
