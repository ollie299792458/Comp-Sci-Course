PEOPLE:

The DULCIMER is not ON THE VARESE CD but it is on other cd which is accompanying a book. You can buy here on AMAZON. The book with the 16-track cd calls:

"CASE HISTORY OF A FILM SCORE - BY HENRY MANCINI - EDITED BY ROY PHILLIPPE.
WARNER"
IT SAYS: "the book and cd are specially rewarding for Thorn Birds fans who spent $25 on Varese Sarabande's 2-CD soundtrack only to discover that the dulcimer- the central instrument of the score - was inexplicably missing from the main-title track and that the extensive liner notes barely discuss the score (and don't include a single quote from the composer about his music, despite the fact that a little resarch would have turned up three extensive interviews that Mancini gave about the music of The thorn birds). Both of these omissions are rectified by the book and accompanying CD. The main title is intact, complete with dulcimer overlay, and Mancini's discussion of the project is so thorough that all of our questions about this remarkable score are answered at last."

Plus the Dulcimer the book "Case History of a film score" has more: the piano when Ralph sees Meggy slowly coming down the stairs at Mary's birthday party... . This music is missing from the Varese cd, but it is here on this extra cd - Case History. It's wonderful!!
