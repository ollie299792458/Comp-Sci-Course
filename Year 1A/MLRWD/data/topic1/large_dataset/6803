As a kid I loved the 3 Musketeers and the young witty teenager who became the fourth.  In this version there was good, bad and UGLY...

The good. Action, sword fights scenes, acting and logistics (the set, the colors, the cloths and scenery were first class.

The bad. The plot started-out well enough and then CGI computer effects, writing shortcuts and flying boats made a promising movie just plane lame and stupid. As a Syfy nut myself, I can leave reality at the door, but I cannot suspend it to a point of total stupidity, and you can not fix stupid.

The ugly. About 30 minutes before the movie ended, I could not help but think the writers wrote this movie into a corner. Instead of thinking a witty and/or plausible way to tie up all the loose ends they made, the writers figured the average person is a dolt (idiot) and if they threw a bunch of CGI and lame excuses and bizarre explanations that people would become confused and forget how bad and implausible the story became. What I am really disappointed in is with a movie with as many good to excellent actors, that none of them went, "You got to be kidding me!" and forced the writers into fixing this honorably story line. Well I guess I can now assume all parties involved in this flop were only too happy to cash their pay check versus delivering a real memorable and classic film.
