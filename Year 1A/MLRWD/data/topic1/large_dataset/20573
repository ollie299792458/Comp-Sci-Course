I am a Christian. I watched this video because while I believe in the existence of God and Jesus I am completely against organized religion. Bill brings to light the consequences of humanity taking their religious beliefs to an extreme level and brings very tough questions to the table. It seems that some people leave, saying they're offended by his doubt, but in reality they are just not prepared to answer those questions or are too ashamed to admit they don't know. Perhaps they felt like their faith was threatened by Bill's skepticism. But someone who is secure enough in their beliefs, like myself, should sit down and listen patiently to what he had to say. A Christian should meditate on all these tough questions and answers may come, but they may not... but simply running away just makes you look like an insecure coward.

The important thing a Christian must do, above all things, is to love one another and do unto others what we want done unto us. To stray from destructive ways and embrace what brings love and peace into the world... side with those who want to create and preserve rather than obliterate and devastate. Be rational and logical.

The end was very anti-climactic... Bill was making good points up until he said we all must doubt. Doubt can be destructive too.
