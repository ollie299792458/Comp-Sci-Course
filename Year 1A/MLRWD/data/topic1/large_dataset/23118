Well, everyone who has seen the three movies by now will probably agree that the first spidey was good, the second was great and the third was a letdown in comparison to the first two.

This set has the three films, so I think it would be unfair to punish the first two because of the third (like many reviewers have done by now). To watch Spider-Man 2 in full HD glory is going to be a blast for every Spider-Man fan out there.

The first movie is a very good movie that is worth enjoying in HD, the second is one of the best superhero films in history and the third... well, the story falls short after the big anticipation generated by Spidey 2 (to many villains end up being a mess like others have put it), and in some points it just becomes too campy to endure, but nobody can deny that in terms of visuals it is still worthy of HD. Add to this all the extras on HD as well and you've got yourself a nice package.

The trilogy as a whole is entertaining, and Spider-Man 2 has story, deep villain, epic moments... (I know, I can't spot praising Spider-Man 2), and despite being weak in comparison to the others, the third film isn't that bad. It just had a lot to live up to, and it failed to do so, but you still get some awesome action sequences, and this set in particular includes the other two films.

So, the question you should ask yourself: Are three movies worthy of being seen in HD worth of the price?  If you enjoyed the Spidey trilogy enough to want to buy it, and if you appreciate High Definition, then I think the answer is definitely yes.
