I'm a huge Carrey fan! I remember him from the days of "In Living Color," when I was a kid. I actually didn't see this movie until just recently! These days something that makes you laugh is a hot comodity, and Carrey is the one for that. This movie has such a strong story that it almost makes you assume that it's from Disney. Put a movie with a strong moral at the end of it, and throw in Carrey's status-quo of antics... I actually watched this movie once a day for a long streak of time. I can't remember when I did that last. Oh, yeah, Napoleon Dynamite. Anyhow, it's unique to put the two concepts together. It just makes Carrey's antics even funnier when put against a serious backdrop- that being the serious story of it. Carrey learns that whatever "losses" are assumed to be attained through telling the truth, equal advantages are enjoyed. Afterall, more often than not, you have to lie to cover up the lie before it, and that can be a lot of work! Maybe more than telling the truth. It just makes me chuckle to think about the facial expressions Jim Carrey comes up with. Often I do this at the most out-of-the-blue moments, and the person next to me has to be thinking, "What's his problem?"
