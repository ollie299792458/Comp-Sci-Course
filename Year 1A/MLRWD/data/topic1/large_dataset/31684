Wreslemania 24 was a great Wrestlemania but was not the best..You had some great, some good, some bad. Here are my match thoughts.

Finlay vs. JBL (Belfast Brawl)..It was a good match. A good street fight, not the best. It was passible, but with the wrong person winning.
On a scale of 1-10..............................7.0/10

CM Punk vs. Kennedy vs. MVP vs. Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Chris Jericho (Money in the Bank Ladder Match)
This was a great match, you had ladders breaking with Sheldon Benjamin, acrobatism by John Morrison with the equipment, even an awesome use of ladder by Matt Hardy when he interfered, ...I love Carlito spot in the match where he did the back cracker......I had someone else, but  I am satisfied with the winner also.
On a scale of 1-10.................8/10

Batista vs. Umaga...(Battle for Brand Supremacy)...Batista second worse wrestler all time to me. Umaga tried to hold is own, oh well....bad match.....bad winner..
On a scale of 1-10............5/10

Kane vs. Chavo Guerrero (ECW Championship)...8 seconds or so. Not worth rating but I am cause of the winner.
On a scale of 1-10......................3/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair (Career Threatening Match)....This was a very emotional match from the beginning...At the end where Shawn Michaels is a finally about to put Flair down with a third superkick he says "Im sorry I love you"...very touching moment....End of a gret career...2nd best match for MOTY in 2008.
On a scale of 1-10............10/10

John Cena vs. Triple H vs. Randy Orton..........(WWE Champioship)...This was good. Not great...Nice spots, like the Tower of Doom and much more...Wrong winner...
On a scale of 1-10................7/10

Floyd Meriweather vs. Big show (Big Money vs. Biggest Athelete)

Floyd Meriweather  did everythng he needed to do to win, Big show was dominating.
On a scale of 1-10 .............5/10

Edge vs. Undertaker (World Heavyweight Championship...Undertaker was robbed out of the Main event spot at Wrestlemania last year.. They got it right....No way he was going to lose...This was third best match of 2008, would have been number one if it wasnt for Hell in a Cell at Summerslam. Undertaker wins his sixth title.
On a scale of 1-10.........10/10
