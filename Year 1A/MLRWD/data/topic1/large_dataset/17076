First saw this having low low expectations (a feeling warrented, and im sure shared among horror fans when the announcement was made to make a sequal to one of the most NON-sequal friendly movies EVER).  Within the first ten minutes I had my foolish expectations thrown in my face as the hellride began (no hyperbole needed, the film has a very fast moving, w/ a paranoid feel to it).  

A great psychological film, with a thick but respectable "figure-it-out-yourself" aspect, that lended hand to the film rather than using it as an escape.  It compliments the first film well, and without using it as a crutch presents the next logical step in evolution (rather then the usual redundant sequal).  
The problem of how to resolve a reality based first person perspective film/pseudo-documentary and parley it into a real movie format (third person) is solved within seconds of the opening of the film... simply enough the first was just a film, they claim, and this is the real deal (and, consequently, about the hysteria the film provided in its opening weeks).  
The editing is choppy, scenes change quickly, and the viewer is left with no choice but to stay on the edge of their seat.. in this way, the movie draws you in to it.  The editing can tend to be confusing, but thats what makes the second viewing all the more fun ! :)  Its horror tactics mostly rely on hallucination, claustrophobia, and asphyxiation (and, of course, I applaud them on all three fronts).  
The ending is solid, imho  (and thats all im gonna say about that).  
My only problem is that I found the acting a bit dry at times, but, of course, that might just be all part of the game the producers are playing with you throughout...  a second viewing will shed light on that.
