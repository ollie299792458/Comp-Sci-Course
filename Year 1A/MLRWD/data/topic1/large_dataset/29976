"I'm going to be late...very late" is a quote from Alice in Wonderland that I think I have heard almost all my life.  Alice in Wonderland has captured the hearts of generations because Alice's dream seems so real yet so different from she is used to.  Alice is a child who is being pressured to act and enjoy things that older children enjoy and her dream puts her into the world of childhood fun and adventure.  Alice in Wonderland has now released for its 60th Anniversary on Blu-ray with never before seen parts and stunning color.

Synopsis: ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a story about a young girl who grows bored listening to her older sister read aloud from a history book about William I of England. While dozing off, she dreams about falling down a rabbit hole ("Wonderland") that is populated by a peculiar series of misadventures. The always sensible Alice whirls through a world of contradictions, imagination and surprises where she encounters amazing creatures - including a pocket watch-toting White Rabbit, the imperious Queen of Hearts and her army of playing cards, a Cheshire Cat with a lingering smile in an unforgettable fantasy, and the off-kilter Madhatter - and tests her sensibility and courage. In the end it's all a dream, she is awakened by her sister's voice, and as the two of them return home for teatime where she realizes that perhaps logic and reason exist for purpose. And in return, her sister realizes affectionately that Alice is still young, but will grow-up in time.

My Opinion:  It had been a long time since I had seen Alice in Wonderland and viewing it from the eyes of an adult versus a child made the movie watching completely different for me.  The White Rabbit has always been my favorite character.  His veracity for time makes him lovable yet obnoxious.  It made me think that the White Rabbit really relates to many adults as we rush around with our time lines and agendas.  We never have time to play and enjoy life.

Alice shrinking has always been a favorite part for me especially as a child because I dreamed of being a smaller size and entering a different world other than my own.  The Queen of Hearts also scared me as a child and I believe that a small child could definitely still be afraid of both the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter.  It is not a movie that my children any time soon because of their age and lack of understanding.  I love how Alice's sister realizes that Alice is still just a child and not to rush her into adulthood.  This is something that I need to remember as I work with my children.

Disney has taken Alice in Wonderland to new heights of color, sound, and quality by putting her on Blu-ray.  I loved seeing the movie in a new way.  This special edition with its new games and special intro by Walt is definitely a great addition to collector's edition and for those who have never seen the classic Alice in Wonderland.
