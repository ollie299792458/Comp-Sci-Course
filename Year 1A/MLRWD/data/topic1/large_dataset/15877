First let me say that I saw the original uncut 1945 version instead of the theatrical 1946 version. I'm kind of glad I did. I think the 45 version is a little less confusing. The acting in this movie is top notch but what else would you expect from Bogart and Bacall. Bogart is especially good in this film and their chemistry is very natural. The direction is good, it is shot well, and the dialogue is very good! My problem with "The Big Sleep" is that it is very hard to follow. There are an awful lot of characters and names to remember and throughout the movie it's not glaringly clear which "rackets" everybody's in. You don't know why, they're considered shady characters. Also most of the answers just seem to come to Marlowe with very little reasoning.

I also really don't understand why this is considered "noir". It doesn't have many of the characteristics used to define noir. I made the accidental mistake of watching the remake with Robert Mitchum first which is a horrible movie. So I found myself unable to not compare the original to the remake. It did however make it slightly easier to understand. All in all I think this is a good movie and a must see for any Bogey fan. As I said before I think this is some of his best work. The acting gets 5 stars the story gets 3 1/2.

Also I think the DVD is very good quality! I see nothing wrong with the transfer other than the sound is a little low. All you have to do is turn the volume up.
