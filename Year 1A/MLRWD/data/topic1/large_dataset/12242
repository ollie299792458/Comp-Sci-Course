Climbers have always felt there was no need for the embarassing antics displayed in absurd films like Vertical Limit, MI-2, and Cliffhanger to get across the at-once dangerous and beautiful aspects of their sport.  In fact, it was believed that a truly talented director could convey those things quite well through a little creativity rather than resorting to nitro-glycerine and cheesey free-soloing scenes to add suspense.  So it was with great anticipation and a bit of skepticism that the release of this movie retelling the classic story of Joe Simpson's epic in the Andes was anticipated.  No one was let down.  This is a brilliantly done film, at the original scene, with the real climbers doing much of the legwork.  The climbing scenes are shot with authenticity, and even the actors portraying the climbers did a good job.  The horrible situation Simpson finds himself in and his deteriorating physical and mental condition are palpable and nerve-wracking.  The feeling of desperation and hopelessness reaches the same heights achieved in the book, as does the anxiety and anguish of Simon (his partner).  This is a classic film rendering of a classic book.  This is one movie you must see; who knows if another climbing story will ever be done as well.  And whether you're a climber or not, you will be just as close to the edge of your seat, all without the insulting Hollywood silliness.
