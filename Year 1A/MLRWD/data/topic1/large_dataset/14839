This movie was it back in 1987 for 10 year olds like me! The opening sequence that has Cobra launching an all out attack on the Statue of Liberty while the Joes fight them off is unforgettable and one of the coolest movie intros ever. Then we get the fantastic assault on Cobra Island by a seemingly unstoppable assailant that ends with Serpentor's throne room being infiltrated. Classic. The intro of new Joes and Cobra La didn't sit well with some but the movie itself is full of great action and dramatic moments. The scene where a blinded Roadblock barely escapes Cobra La, rescues an injured and left for dead Cobra Commander and carries him piggyback style to safety is a great example of this. The animation is the best it ever was for the series with alot of cool effects. Although the origins and histories of characters in the cartoon differ greatly from Larry Hama's excellant Marvel Comics series of the 1980's and early 90's G.I. Joe was one of the finest action cartoons of its time which was a golden age of after school viewing with great cartoons like He-Man & The Masters of the Universe, Transformers, Voltron, Thundercats, Robo-Tech, MASK, Wheeled Warriors, C.O.P.S., The Real Ghostbusters and Duck Tales. This is a must have for kids of the 1980's!
