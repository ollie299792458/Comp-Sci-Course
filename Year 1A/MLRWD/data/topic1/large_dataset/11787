Before the Berlin Wall fell, East Germany is ruled by Communist Russia and its citizens were forced to live a lie- a society that is supposed to be based on equality and social justice. Alex Kernel (played by the amazing Daniel Br&uuml;hl) is a young disillusioned young man who, together with his fellow East Germans, are on the verge of a revolution and social change.

While walking together with fellow rallyist, Alex was arrested and his mother, who witnessed the scene, suffered a heart attack. While his mother survived, it left her in a coma and for 8 months, Alex and his older sister Ariane took care of her. As East Germany became no more and the reunification of his homeland was completed, his mother woke up. What follows is a hilarious, amusing and at times serious and thought-provoking attempt to shield his mother from the sweeping changes and their altered life as citizens of the newly unified Germany.

Director Wolfgang Becker spared no expense to capture a time and place that now exist only in old, yellowed newspapers and history books. The finished product, a film that is not only a realistic social commentary but also a love story between a son and a mother, and the journey a young restless soul need to travel to discover himself.
