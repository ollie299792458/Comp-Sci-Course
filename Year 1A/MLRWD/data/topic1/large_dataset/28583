The novel that spawned this movie was one of the more vapid releases in gay literature (and it pains me to even apply that word to the book). The movie works better. Is this because some of the vapidness depends on the attractive features of the cast (which, in my opinion, are nicely varied and very handsome) or the shallowness of the dialogue and plot work better when seen and not thought?

I would not call this a gay romance film. Do I believe that any of the main characters are 'made for each other' or their love will endure past the credits? No. Of course, most relationships don't last years in real life. But one goes to the movies for escapism, I think. The escapism in this film is that male prostitution is romanticized. While I am sure there are some guys that come close to X's level of professionalism and success, it seems that it would always cause some mental/social problems.

Casual sex is both demonized and lauded in the film. Less demonizing, believe me, as the camera and eye lingers on tricks going in and out of character's lives. The movie cannot have it both ways - no one is hurt by their demons (falling asleep by GHB is the worst event and seems laughable considering the dangers of the drug and its cousins, crystal meth, coke, and so forth).

Yet, the film is a feast to the eye and the actors do enjoy their rolls. I did like the interaction between the older 'patron' and X. The idea of seduction via storytelling is an enthralling one. Perhaps this is the theme of the movie, that, if you tell a juicy story with details that spark the imagination and ignite the mental libido, you can seduce the audience. For that notion, even if it's more my own than the director, this film does earn 3 stars.
