Carnival of Souls is an old B-film that you might have seen on old Saturday night horror shows. As Herk Harvey (the director) said, this film was shot on a budget that wouldn't have sustained the opening moments of  Back To The Future. However, this film is able to sustain a creepy and  oppressive atmosphere throughout, and that is the major achievement. Even  though I knew when every "scary" moment was coming, and I guessed  the ending 20 minutes before the film actually ended, that knowledge didn't  ruin it for me. That's how strong the movie is, that you can enjoy the film  even if you knew everything about it. The acting is stiff and the dialogue  is often stilted, but that just adds to the strange and dark atmosphere of  the film. And the Criterion release is a real gem. Two discs, the first has  the theatrical release of the film, and the second has the director's cut.  The film looks incredible. I've yet to see such an old and cheaply made  movie look so good. And the extras are also great. Documentaries, outtakes,  interviews, and oh, that organ music. If you're a fan of horror, you must  own this film. If you're a film buff, you must own it. If you're a DVD  afficionado, you must own it. If you're just looking for a good movie to  watch on a Saturday night, then please, choose this one. It delivers.
