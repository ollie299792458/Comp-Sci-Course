Watch this film after you've had the first knick in your side door!  In other words, when you've reached the age of wisdom. Or in the words of James Woods, "Son, after the first (dent?), the rest come easy". If you have recently lost someone, as I have, I suggest, this film will be viewed with the essential element of thoughtfulness about the meaning of home and soul, and will thusly, alternately give you not only some serenity-- but also, comic relief.

Watch this film alone to truly absorb it.  I found it, unlike, previous reviews to the contrary, to be an amazingly expansive capsule of reality.  I needed to assist someone close to me in dying and Nick Nolte's performance & love for "Sir,Irwin" (boy-angel) so mirrored my anguishing experience in letting go.

I recommend this movie.  I intend to purchase it and send it to my health care proxy (who is also grieving) and put a copy in my locked safety deposit box to be discovered at some later date..."when I pack my good memories".
