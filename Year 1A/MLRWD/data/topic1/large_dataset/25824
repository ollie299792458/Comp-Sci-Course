I grew up reading the comics of the Ghost Rider and loved it.  So, when Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes were cast in this, I was less than hopeful.  Didn't even see it in the theatres since I was expecting something along the lines of Daredevil, ie. a horrible adaptation serving as nothing more than a vehicle for the actors in the movie.  I gotta say, I was very surprised.  It was faithful to the comic while giving the story it's own spin.  The casting and the effects was great and they even tipped their hat to the original Ghost Rider comic which was a western.  Nicely done!

Watching this in Blu-Ray was amazing!! The colors, clarity and sound sucked you right into the movie.  I hope they make another and take full advantage of what a great character they have.  Just make him a tad darker in the next one.  I'd like to see the flaming skull head that laughs as he sears the souls of his enemies.
