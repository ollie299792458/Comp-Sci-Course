Sure, we hear about "The Birds," "Psycho," "North by Northwest," "The Man Who Knew Too Much," and "Vertigo" until our ears bleed, but Hitchcock never surpassed the passion and intrigue he pulled off in this one.  An excellent cast led by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains; love scenes hotter than any of the semi-nude sax-underscored things we get today (sometimes just the sound of Bergman breathing); and a solid nail-biter plot make this one of his very best.
Fans who prefer the platinum blandness (sic) of Kim Hunter, Grace Kelly, or Tippi Hedren may not be satisfied:  Ingrid Bergman actually has some fire!  Cary Grant was better only with Katharine Hepburn, and really shines here with his portrayal of a prejudiced, tough as nails special agent who must team up with a woman whose past he is so revolted by that he can't see the forest for the trees until it is nearly too late.
The Criterion edition has some very impressive special features, and is a must-have for Hitchcock fans.
