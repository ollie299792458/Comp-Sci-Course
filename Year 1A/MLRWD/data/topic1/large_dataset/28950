I just watched this movie an hour ago.  Obviously the folks who vote for the Oscars were incorrect.  Well, consider the fact that Jennifer Hudson was voted out pretty early in American Idol.  That was a precedent.  I knew how good Hudson was back then.  Well, at least Hudson deservedly has an Oscar now but the movie should have won Best Picture simply because it WAS.

As a biracial person, I love how this was a Black movie.  The producer/director did not find the need to put in a white character that the wider/whiter audience could relate to.  If the movie was released even 10 or 15 years ago that may have occurred.

The movie didn't need a white character because anyone can relate to the various themes that the movie covered: ambition, love, entrepreneurship, exploitation, drug use/abuse, family, hurt, pain, pregancy, welfare/unemployment, fame, racism, fatphobia/sizism and of course, music - from the chitlin' circuit through disco.

And Eddie Murphy.  Unbelievable.  I haven't been a fan of his for YEARS - since SNL circa early '80s - so I was stunned to see his performance.  Wow, what a stroke of genius in casting Murphy in that role!

Jennifer Hudson's "And I Am Telling You" was incredible.  It may wind up being a landmark in movie history just as we remember how Jennifer Holliday made the song famous in the Broadway version.
