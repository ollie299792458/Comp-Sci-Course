This is truly one of Irwin Allen's best sci-fi series. This show had a great spectacular and memorable opening sequence of dazzling color and lights of two men tumbling back and forward in time and space. The Time Tunnel complex was fantastic to see on your living room screen for that time perior of 1966-67. The quality of the episodes were very inmaginative and filled with excitement aimed at grabbing the attention at the time of another hit show of the same year, Batman, both of these shows where shown on ABC-TV. If these episodes are remastered from

the original 35mm prints, then this will look great on the new  plasma tv's.........I really hope that they are released with the original opening tag of..........."The Time Tunnel in color" which preceeded each opening episode, although short lived as a series, The Time Tunnel was really a very cool show...........if this one sells and I'm sure that it will.......this can only lead to the release on dvd of another great IA series "Voyage to the bottom of the sea"...........wow!!!!.........please bring them on with lots of extras while most of the cast are still here, we fans have been waiting too long!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you!
