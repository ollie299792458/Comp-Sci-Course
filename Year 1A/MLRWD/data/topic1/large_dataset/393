Sorry Sean Bean your a fine actor but, your no Rutger Hauer. Hauer nailed that role as "John Ryder" no one else can play that part. Rutger Hauer performance is so amazing as soon as he gets in that car he steals the show he plays the villain very well. Hauer and Howell were so good together it was so real. The car seen between the two in the beginning of the movie was so well done they have very good chemisrty together. In the new movie they added a third person makes no sense at all. It's about a young man driving a drive away car to California, he get's tired so he sees a guy hitching a ride on the side of the road he looks normal and picks him up all he wanted was some one to talk to and keep him a wake. The guy gets in the car and he just happens to be a crazy psycho killer. Having the third person (Remake) in the car took away from the movie. The guy is driving scared out of his mind because, he has a knife in his face the hitcher (Hauer) is crazy your sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see if this poor guy makes it or not. No need for a third person very bad move. Why make a remake of this classic? They should of played it in the theaters again like they did "Jaws" for it's 20th Anniversary. Don't mess with perfection especially if Rutger Hauer is in the movie.
