This film is, of course, a sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002235PS">Merlin (Special Edition)</a>, a fine movie. Unfortunately, the sequel isn't all that compelling as its progenitor.

The Story: At the outset, Camelot is up and running, King Arthur and his nights of the Round Table are at their pinnacle, peace flows throughout the land, and the Holy Grail is in place. So Merlin needs a rest and retires to his cave where he pulls a Rip Van Winkle and sleeps for 50 years, (and he doesn't age much beyond growing a long beard.) When he awakes, everything has changed, Arthur is dead, the Holy Grail is lost, pagan scoundrels rule the countryside and a new king (nice guy) is making every attempt to revive Camelot, but without much luck. The remainder of the film is devoted to that end. The afterthought of Merlin's new apprentice presents us with the stereotypical bumbling sorcerer's apprentice.

What wrong with the film? Frankly, it's fairly boring and the comedic slapstick moments aren't very funny. The acting is inferior (stilted) and, given today's technology, the special effects are just so-so. There are additionally lots of redundant script issues, ("Take the spell off the secret tunnel, Merlin!"), and the great numbers of flashbacks to Merlin's earlier days simply manifest a distraction.

This isn't by any means the worst film I've ever seen but, now that I've purchased it, I'll likely give it away because I really don't care to see it a second time around. The camera work is pretty decent and the locations are interesting -- beyond that, you may just wish to rent it and take it back to the video store when you're done.

Not recommended.
