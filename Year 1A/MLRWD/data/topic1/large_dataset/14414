Why did HBO cancel "Deadwood" before David Milch could finish his beautiful story? It's the second-highest-rated of all HBO's "Quality Programming" hour-long dramas, and deservedly does very well in DVD sales. I personally have bought several DVD sets for myself, my family, and friends.

This show's fans (myself included) are rabidly passionate about it, and grateful for every word, every scene, every episode we've been blessed with so far. "Deadwood" is delicious and disturbing, the way great art always is, and we all hoped it would go on forever. So, of course, we were disappointed when HBO and Mr. Milch discussed ending the series after only four seasons. But it was creator Milch's choice, and his decision to make.

So what happened? Why isn't Mr. Milch going to be allowed to finish his masterpiece?  Can you find out for us?

Many of us fans are so angry and disgusted that we have decided to cancel our HBO subscriptions after the third season. This is what you do when you feel personally betrayed by a trusted resource. There is also talk about organizing a "National Cancel HBO Day" to be held at the end of Season Three ... and it's a movement that seems to be gaining support.

Recently, someone at the HBO Community Board established a website as a clearinghouse for ideas. It's at [...] and it's for folks who want to help in a massive grass-roots effort to bring HBO back to its senses, to its long-held mission, and to its loyal fan base.

It's time to make a few demands of HBO.
