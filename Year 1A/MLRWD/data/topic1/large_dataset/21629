Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

I can't believe I am the first to review this Blu-Ray (it was released on Tuesday the 8th, and this is 11/13/2011).

The video quality varied.  The beginning had a lot of grain, which soon disappeared.  I sit about 7 feet away from a 52" LCD, and I didn't notice any grain during most of the movie.  The lowest rating I have ever given to a Blu-Ray movie was 4.0 on a 10.0 scale.  The beginning was about a 6.5.  Most of the movie was about 8.5.  Some of the indoor shots were about 9.5.  Overall, very good for a movie made in 1970.

I was happy to see that there was DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio; it just wasn't that good.  They didn't put much effort into the surround sound.

The movie lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes.  I believe the aspect ration is 2.40:1, but it could be 2.35:1.  I was glad to see the widescreen format, instead of the 1.77:1 that is listed in the product description.  The movie had credits at the end.  The only person in the cast that I recognized, besides Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, and Chief Dan George, was E. Emmett Walsh, who was the "Shot Gun Guard".  I wish they had the credits at the beginning, so I would have known to look for him.

This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I am satisfied having it on Blu-Ray.
