But it's ALL worth watching it !!
Think about it ,
it's full of cliches
and you can predict most every move they'll make without watching it .
But Nic Cage ,
just him in general
makes the movie's attitude so changed
I mean
Throwing a guy out of the plane to deliver a note?
Only Nic Cage would ever accomplish that.
And I know ,In sight of recent updates ,
Con Air will either become a cherished memory for thousands
or
Be something people are discusted with
now that John on his 15th birthday
finally admitted
that this movie
SUCKS
but all the same
this movie has moved millions ten years after it was made
but it's years are comming to an end
so
I'm afraid it's time to say goodbye Con Air
All of us will always remember you
and still glance at your poster when we walk by
maybe even giggle a bit
And you'll always be there
waiting for one last sing-along
of "How Do I Live Without You?"
and one more rendition of put the bunny back in the box .
We will always remember Con Air .
