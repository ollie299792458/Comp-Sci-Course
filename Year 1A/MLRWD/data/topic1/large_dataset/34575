yeah it sounds like good ol doug thomas is a little bitter about the fact that he's writing movie reviews for amazon and not screenplays. this movie does actually rock, and is one of the best for those that enjoy movies about the hollywood scene and LA in general (The Player...etc). yuppies abound, and yes they are pretty shallow and are also a bunch of whiners. but what makes the movie, aside from the outrageously dope cast, is the acting. you start to wonder how close to right on these characters are, since it's kind of obvious that the cast have extensive dealings with these types in "real life". sean penn definitely comes off as the greatest ever, and seeing him in a comedy is a good thing with all the really heavy stuff he's done recently, which is also great (21 Grams). kevin spacey never seems to fail, and he gives us a really killer performance as a yuppie bastard a la Swimming With Sharks. of course anything anna paquin does must be seen, usually repeatedly, and this is no exception. and to top it all off, where else can you see meg ryan playing a hooker that gets thrown out of a car by chazz palmentieri? that should sell it right now for any sane person. of course, there are a lot of words spoken in this flick, so if you cant read too good, maybe skip it. this is the thugness. just buy it.
