Among the classic installments which aired on PBS Masterpiece Theater over the past 25 years, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is one of the best.  Although this series first aired in 1984, this multi-layered story about life in India during the 40's continues to pack a powerful and complex dramatization about inter-racial relationships, social and cultural prejudice, classicism, bigotry, hypocrisy, and the effect of imperialism of the British Raj on India, its princely states, and its people.

This ambitious epic tackles intricate details about the lives and customs of the ruling high caste Hindu class, and the British who ultimately control and rule their country.  Yet, accurately interwoven is the story about the political mood of India; clashes between Hindu and Muslim, strife between the militant rebels and the followers of Gandhi at the height of India's struggle for self-rule and independence.

Equally compelling, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is also a story about the idiosyncrasies and fallibility of human nature; expertly portrayed by a cast of exception actors: lust for power, hedonism/sadism, vanity, narcissism, deception, cruelty and envy, but also honor and loyalty.  The host of characters are unforgettable, and you will long remember the interrelationships of the many individuals who emerge as heroes/heroines, conspirators, villains, martyrs, and the 'righteous'.

This DVD mini-series includes four disks, and the quality was very good.

If you are a fan of classic PBS mini-series, I urge you to include this DVD box set in your collection.
