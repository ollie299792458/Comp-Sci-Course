No, I don't say don;t go and watch it. find a good movie with huge screen and lates sound equipment, leave your IQ at home, and go enjoy it. But I'd not suggest anyone to watch this film at home on a tv set, or even on a  usual home cinema system. The effects will not work out (in the movie the  UFO really falls on you and the hall almost jumps) and all you get is the  extremely dull story. 
Beware the other production of this film's makers.  Stargate had a dumb story but at least you could watch quality desert  shots. ID4 had an extremely dumb story but you at least could enjoy the  effects. Godzilla had an even more dumb story, and nothing good to talk  about. That is the real crap, better not watch that at all. And there sure  will be Godzilla 2 soon, I fear to extrapolate te trend... 
This new  release claims to have additional footage and other extras. Well, I better  wait it come out and listen to other people's comments what is really  there. 
And one more comment: after you've seen ID4 go and watch Mars  Attacks! That will worth your money and time. Quack-quack.
