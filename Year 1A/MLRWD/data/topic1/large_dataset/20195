This movie kicks butt. Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely terrifying as Ace. That guy can act, no s**t. I totally forget I am watching an actor. He is so cruel that his presence hangs over the whole movie and meshes with the summery-yet-dark atmosphere that it gives it a great flavor. You just know they're going to meet him at the end the whole time, and that creates great suspense. Wil Wheaton pushes a line or two but does OK, he has a tough role. Much better than Wesley Crusher.

The best part of the movie is that it is so true to life. We were all ten years old not so very long ago and that person still lives in all of us.
The lighting is really good: most of the film is shot outdoors and if it's augmented by stage lighting they did a good job, it looks like natural sunlight most of the time.

I just have to say this. When River Phoenix fades out at the end it is just plain CREEPY in light of what happened to him later. I get the shivers every time I watch the whole movie only to come to this part. A completely unintended piece of writing that became the twist that just makes watching this movie an unreal experience. This is one of my favorite movies. :  )
