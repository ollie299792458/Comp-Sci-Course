I was really expecting to enjoy this movie. Alas, it starts out with what seems like a good premise but before you know it Russel Crowe is doing prat falls in an empty swimming pool. Ouch. (French pools apparently don't have a shallow end OR ladders, so if you fall into one you're in for some laughs until someone throws you a rope)

 Some of the plot is downright inexplicable. (The vintner is trying to convince Crowe NOT to sell the land by conspiring to make him think that the wine they make there is terrible? Huh?) At one point Crowe's love interest even acuses him of being, "Another one of those people who thinks I live in Provence because I have to!" Oooookay. Do a lot of folks look down on people who are FORCED to live in Provence? Is having people scoff at you for living in one of the most beautiful regions of France really a big issue for the locals?

 Throw in the obligatory uncouth American tourists, some nonsense about lavender and scorpians, and some silly fast-motion driving in circles and what you end up with is a jaw dropping disapointment. (Let's face it, when a director stoops to fast-motion footage of a car going in cirles it's time to raise the white flag.) I got the feeling that everyone just wanted to spend some time in Provence and churned this baby out so that they could expense it all. Oh, and the award for the most inappropriate and god-awful sound track goes to...
