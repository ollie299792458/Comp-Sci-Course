First off this is not for the squeamish, this movie will make you vomit out your shoes. So don't buy this if you don't like gore. I mean the unrealistic stuff in it is amazing. This girl gets her arm cut off and bleeds and keeps talking after she loses like 10 gallons of blood spraying out all over everything and everyone. Her boy friend or brother gets shuricans threw him and he keeps talking then falls apart in to multiple peaces. Wow the kicker is when she chops off this dudes head and then drags his corps to the bath room to squeeze his body on to his brother so the blood can spray all over him. What Horrible junky crap is that. I mean like come on!!! There is no real plot and no real dialogue. But there is allot of action that is why I gave it 1 star. Its not all lost. I promise you multiple night mares and sickening of your stomach if you see this wasted red paint movie. The girl is slightly cute but after that the rest is simply GARBAGE! I want to write more about it but I have to run to the bath room to go vomit. Wow just thinking about this move makes me sick. I couldn't make it the entire film. Just to much gore to make it appealing. I'd rather watch night of the living dead at least those zombies can act. Blooaahh!
