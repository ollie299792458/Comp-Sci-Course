Glory is an incredible war film.  What more can be said?
THE GOOD:  Edward Zwick's directing is superb.  Glory has a gritty and violent look that captures the brutality of the Civil War like no other.  This is a film that needs to be heard through the stereo system.  The sound effects are incredible and James Horner's score is the best of his career.
THE BAD:  While dramatically strong, the film has some minor historical inaccuracies.  The recruits of the 54th are mostly depicted as runaway slaves and illiterates. In truth, most recruits were educated free-men with a lot to lose by joining the Army.  Broderick's Shaw is also flawed.  His depiction of a man with Abolitionist sympathies is untrue.  He was a more complicated leader with more internal conflict about his position than the film depicts.
THE UGLY:  While the film is noble in its efforts to honor the fight for freedom, it falls into the age-old trap of so many other Civil War films in its depiction of Confederates as evil racists fighting for solely for the preservation of slavery.  In an age of modern sensibilities, such generalizations do not help endear Confederate soldiers to the modern American in the way that they deserve to be.
Regardless, "Glory" is a must-see.  In company of its present competition it is indisputably the best piece of Civil War moviemaking ever attempted.
