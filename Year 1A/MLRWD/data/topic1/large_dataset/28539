Black Rain, of all of Ridley Scott's movies, would also be remembered as that bastard cousin of Blade Runner - at least in its setting.  Referencing his own classic noir style, Scott finds himself shooting in the real town of Osaka, with Douglas playing the devil-may-care, gung-ho, I'm-gonna-kill-that-sonuvab*tch cop on the loose.  Shafts of light through rotating fans and blinds; neon lights in a dripping wet environment; and steam through manholes - Black Rain refers visually to Scott's earlier incarnation, but also feels more like brother Tony Scott's production because of the hard boiled slam-bang action.

Michael Douglas is in his typical 80s tough guy stance in this one, but has a great counterfoil in his Japanese co-stars - good cop Ken Takakura and villain Yusaka Matsuda - along with a few other dour Yakuza actors.  Andy Garcia still looks fresh as the sidekick.  All give great performances, so while the film is hackneyed in its own way - Black Rain is certainly watchable and rises convincingly above potential cliches by characterising the Japanese in a more well rounded way (- a rarity these days with Asian bad guys).

Will you learn anything about Japan here?  Well, just a little.  Douglas doesn't profess to show his Japanese friends that Americans do it better, but that co-operation is the key - and hence the end product feels a bit more genuine and balanced in terms of its portrayal of the East, in spite of the cowboy overtones.  Other flicks to catch in this vein are Rising Sun and of course The Last Samurai. 3 1/2 stars.
