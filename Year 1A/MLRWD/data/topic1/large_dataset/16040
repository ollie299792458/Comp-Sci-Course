I had never watched this movie from start to finish until I was in my early 30's. When I finally DID watch it, it blew me away.
Every scene that takes place in Grafton's store/saloon is riveting. And the final gunfight is one of the most classic scenes in all of movie-making history. I heard that they intentionally increased the sound of the gunshots in this film to add to the impact.
This movie might be a little too wholesome for some people, especially younger people who are used to watching constant action and violence.  You'll almost feel as if you are watching a clean-cut Disney movie.  And there are a couple of slow spots, such as the 4th of July party and the burial scene.  But, what sets this movie apart from most others is the story itself, the morality, the beliefs, and the human interaction. In the movie, you have a hard-headed father who wants to fight for his "claim".  You have the frontier mother who develops a crush on Shane.  You have the big, bad cattle rancher who is trying to get rid of all the homesteaders who are encroaching on his empire. You have Jack Palance as the fast-gun villain. You have an aging gunslinger who is trying to turn over a new leaf. And you have a little boy who envies the man they call Shane.  This movie will be retained in your memory for a long time to come. If you want to watch one of the finest Westerns ever made, watch Shane from beginning to end.
