This is quite enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fictional heroic movies (i.e. everything from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings). I absolutely love movies with three dimensional villains. Too many super-hero movies have villains that are simple and easy to understand. The Green Goblin in the first Spider-man movie was a good step away from this, but I don't think we saw enough of his personal struggle against the Goblin. However, in this movie we see the transformation and eventual return of Dr. Oct in full color.

I also thought that the transformations that Peter went through were very interesting to watch, and there were many scenes that had nice touches. I also loved the introduction of more characters that play parts in Spider-man's world, like John Jameson and Dr. Conners. However, the producers had said that there will only be three movies total, so the series might end of up being a disappointment because there will be only three of the many villains showcased.

Overall, watching the movie was a quite enjoyable experience, but there were a couple things that annoyed me: elevated railways in manhattan? That's Chicago! And the "fusion" reaction was really unbelievable. Spider-man always has some degree of suspension of disbelief, but it isn't too outrageous (for example, by simply inserting spider genes into goats they produce spider silk). However, the so called "sun" was completely unbelievable and has no basis in fact whatsoever. Oh well, it's just a movie and as such was very good.
