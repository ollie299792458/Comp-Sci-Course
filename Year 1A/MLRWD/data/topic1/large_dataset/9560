This DVD is part of the 10 minute solution series, there are 5 ten minute segments on this DVD. The first is Flat belly fast, the second is Pilates perfect abs, the third is Belly fat blaster, the fourth is Ab ripper, and the last one is Six pack abs. Flat belly fast is a great segment to use as a warm-up. The exercises in this segment are definitely the easiest. The Pilates segment uses very traditional Pilates exercises to tone and tighten your abs, not really anything new here, but all very effective. The Belly fat blaster is a cardio segment to help you burn calories and fat, the moves were pretty inventive and different and it really gets your heart rate up in a short amount of time, which is great. The Ab ripper segment combines all of the other segments into one, so there will be some repetitive moves in this segment from the other segments, but with some new twists. My favorite segment is the Six pack abs segment- it is KILLER! The whole ten minutes you are constantly tightening your abs, it is relentless and you seriously feel the burn, you know for a fact you are getting the most out of your ten minutes! I really like this video because it's not just the usual crunches (although there are those in this video too), but the instructor, Suzanne Bowen, uses some really inventive exercises to give you the most bang for your buck. She also has killer abs, so she's a great inspiration and she's calm and easy to listen to. Her cuing and explanation of the exercises is also spot on. I will be coming back to this video often, it's a keeper!
