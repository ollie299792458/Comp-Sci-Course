Get out your flamethrowers, Senna fans. I just watched this documentary, and after all they build-up, I've come away a bit disappointed. I can't jump blindly on the five-star wagon. Some background:  I got hooked on F1 while watching Mario race a Lotus in the Long Beach GP. I've attended a few F1 races, along with watching them religiously when they were live on ESPN, and now on Speed. Also have done a bit of road racing in my 72 Datsun 510 painted like a BRE car; point being I'm not an expert or a wanker, but somewhere in between. I remember the race in Monoco when the called it, and thought at the time these Senna and Bellof (no mention of him in the documentary) guys were going to be great.
The good:
-Had forgotten the details of the 1st wreck with Prost, and now have to agree that Senna got a bad deal, but also think he made up for it the next year by taking out Prost.  So, call that one even.
-Some of the early shots of karting and personal interviews are great - gives you an insight into the man's thought process
-Although probably unintended by the documentary, I though it showed Prost to be the better man (maybe not the racer) in that he did not seem to make the rivalry personal, and was big enough to be a pallbearer.
-Was not aware how deep his love of country and the less fortunate - that was touching

The not so good:
-It downplays the skills of his nemesis, Prost - they were both great drivers, just went about it differently
-The documentary also fails to present anything that would show Senna in a bad light - no mention of his aggressive driving that at times was reckless. In fact, hardly anything negative is said, which is required to present a true picture of the man.
-Not enough in-car stuff for me; expected more. Perhaps that's my racing bias.
-Complaints about politics in F1 - that's been going on for years, so just deal with it.

In closing, I plan to watch the film at least two more times, so my opinions after the initial pass may change.
An F1 documentary I would recommend is "Jackie Stewart - The Flying Scot" available on Amazon.  It's fair to say that Jackie created the modern F1 driver image, and had the skills to back it up. He came from humble beginnings, both personally and professionally. I really enjoyed the shots of him with Ken Tyrrell at the old garage, and the fade-in sequence of him driving the car again at Monaco years later over top the original race.
