Wow. First word said after playing the last episode of this series.
It was near flawless of an anime. Usually a heart of stone I have.
Have to admit, I cried towards the end. Anyway.

First and foremost. What you actually see before the anime, the art box.
Its a great box, has metallic effects on some parts. The DVDs fit nicely.
Certainly worth buying.

Now the anime. Look at my first paragraph for emphasis. Everything about
the series was top notch. The story, the characters, the artwork, the voice
acting in English (Perfect if you ask me). Excellent soundtrack. Only small
con, easily overlooked by the end. Is that, the middle portion of the anime
is a little dry. But the characters keep you going. The last 3 disks felt
like one movie cause I did not want to put it down.

Conclusion. Buy it, you will then know what a real anime is. It doesn't follow
any common trend that you see in a lot of today's anime for popularity. It
strictly uses characters, story, unique art style (trust me, its unique)
and music to truly entertain you. Give it a shot, you will not regret it.
