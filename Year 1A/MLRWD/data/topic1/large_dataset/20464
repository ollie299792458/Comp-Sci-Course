Okay, we all know season 3 sucked, but we just couldnt stop watching because we all secretly wish that maybe,just maybe, next weeks episode would be so amazing and it would be like we were back in season one...

that never happened. and it probably wont happen next season either, but that wont stop me from watching. I love this show.  Yeah, Killing Marissa was a dumb idea, even though I disliked her, but it was dumb- she was in the core group.

I love this show. I love Seth,Summer, Sandy, Ryan, Kirsten,Julie... I love the original lineup.  the fact that next season is going to follow kaitlin pisses me off. She is not that great of a character,she was annoying last season and she will be this season.  But, Seth/Summer will still be there, same with Sandy, Ryan & co. so it cant be that awful.

Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 or 2, but hey, its still going to make big bucks.  Fans are going to buy it because thatst just what we do. Season 2 wasnt all that, but I still bought it.  It sucks that this bright, hilarious, mind-blowing every week program is now this dull, predictable, dud.....

This show has the potential to be just as good as its' first season.

I'll get off my soapbox now and get back to the point... If your even looking at these reviews, obviously you're a fan and you've been watching since the beginning.  you love this show even if it disappoints you. it's like a relationship. you love what it use to be, you love the familiar faces, and you keep going back even if it lets you down.  so stop reading these reviews, if you've got the money- buy it.

its not the most awful thing out on shelves. it's the OC. and The OC= Seth Cohen. Sandy Cohen. Summer Roberts.Ryan Atwood. Julie Cooper. Kirsten Cohen.and oh yeah-marissa (for the fans of that one out there) and they are amazing and they make the show.
