This film is a drama, character study, thriller, among other things. It is a tour de force, near magna cumme laude. I enjoyed the brilliant acting of the sometimes, slightly, overrated Al Pacino. He is in top form here, rarely ever overacting, or letting down the character. He really does a superb job; a performance to study.

Because life itself is a very complex thing, it is all the more astonishing that they managed to pull this off so well. Typically, film makers/Hollywood have a tough time with recreating true-stories. For one thing, they always come off as hard-boiled and flat. Again the complexity of life is what is needed to do a film based off of life. Hollywood, when even well-endowing one of these films, usually fail. That is why this film is so impressive.

Another reason why this film is so successful is, simply, the courageous story. It is just a well-written movie that takes great pains to study character.

It is pretty simple, really. A great story that pays homage to its own material; the complex nature of a persons character.

Just get it.
