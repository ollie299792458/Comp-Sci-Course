Director Ron Howard's acclaimed 1995 space drama about the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. This has been one of my favorite movies since the first  time I saw it in the theater. High drama, great character moments, and an  exploration of the human spirit, all brought together masterfully on the  screen with innovative filmmaking techniques, great special effects, and a  brilliant score by composer James Horner.
Ron Howard captures the spirit  and reality of the Apollo era in an amazingly accurate and entertaining  film.  There are certain sacrifices in accuracy for dramatic value, but  overall, the message and story are delivered intact.  The work and  attention to detail put into this film is phenomenal.
The DVD release  doesn't disappoint.  This was one of the first "fully-loaded"  discs before special edition releases became common.  First is a very  interesting an informative documentary on the making of the film.  There's  not one, but two commentary tracks included (one with director Ron Howard,  and one will real-life hero Jim Lovell and wife Marilyn).  Commentaries are  my favorite aspect of the DVD format, because they allow the director  and/or people who worked on the film to provide the viewer with their own  personal perspective on their work.  Both of these commentaries are  informative and interesting.
The acting is great.  The story is great.  The DVD is great.  Pick this up - you won't be sorry.
