I'm not sure I understand why a few people here seem to be upset that a) the two main characters are totally moronic and goofy. They're -supposed- to be. They're supposed to be the type of kids you laughed at in school because they were just such losers (but hey, loveable anyway)

b) That's not what would 'really' happen if such characters from history met! Of course it isn't! This movie wasn't made to be a history lesson any more than 300 was. It's supposed to be all out silly. I suppose if you can't let yourself just be silly a while, you won't enjoy the movie.

That being said, I think it -does- help if you grew up with the movie (I first saw it when I was 8 or 9 I think... ) and know the nostalgia behind such phrases as ' radical dude' and all that really awful 80's Valley Slang. Watching it now, almost 20 years later, it's even more amusing because I remember my friends and I thinking Bill and Ted were awesome and copied them using such words as 'Bogus' and whatever. Kids of a newer generation or people that weren't really growing up in that era might not find it so charming or a trip down pleasant childhood lane... but hey, for those of us who did grow up with it, most everyone I know loves the movie for what it was. Stupid, silly, entertaining.

Plus the part where they introduce Ghengis Khan as  Bob Genghis Khan always made me laugh.
