It's been put succinctly by others who've rated this lowly.  But KC summed it up best: "It should have been called `The People Who Search for Aliens of the Deep.'"  The launch is expected - drama built up falsely.  Will the mission succeed?  Will they have to turn back?  Equipment malfunctions just at the start, even after careful preparation, cause the focus of this drama.  Naturally, you have to go with it even knowing there would be no DVD if they had simply gotten to the middle of the ocean and then made a U-turn and headed home.  Or maybe there would be.  Because, except for a few hopeful glimmers of the `ethereal' critters thriving at the floor of the ocean, the critters are missing from the footage.  Most of the footage is obligatory repetitions from one scientist (?) to the next.  "Ooh", "Wow!", "It's like being in space", "This is what it would be like to land on Mars (or Europa or your-favorite-planet-here".  The footage is of the people sitting around and chatting about their dreams of what would be found on a planet if it could support life.  The conversations revolve around the notion that the life on the ocean's floor, especially the extremophiles they are searching for, would be the most likely examples.  There are maybe 4 or 5 promising shots of ghostly fish, swirling translucent masses, a curious and dangerous looking squid.  Mostly, its just the people, some unneeded footage of the Mars landing, and lots and lots and lots of shots of eyeballs pressed to the submersibles peephole, followed by the above-mentioned "Ooh", "Wow!", "It's like being in space",  etc.  The film loses its focus, it sorely needed an impartial narrator to inform and explain the animals that were seen.  Instead, it's an ego trip, it's not scientific, and it is a film that has missed its own boat.
