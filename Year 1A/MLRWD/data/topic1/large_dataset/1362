I give this DVD set 4 stars more because these characters feel like old friends, rather than for the series breaking any new ground. Previous seasons focused on cutting edge legal dramas ripped from the week's headlines. This truncated season is more like our friends from the show playing hookey. But it's all in good fun.

As with the previous seasons, this show is one long campaign commercial for the Democratic party, and even works overtime to promote the Democrat line after Obama is elected president! Watching Candice Bergen urge the formation of a "Tea Party" to protect our freedoms is quite humorous, given what happened since this originally aired. There are also many (unintentionally) humorous moments where Alan Shore (James Spader) complains about Bush administration policies that his Democrat successor continued without apology. Oops!

The show gets a bit hokey trying to tug at our heartstrings over the cast being laid off at the end of the series, forgetting all the cast members they fired as the seasons went by. And why is Alan Shore lecturing us every week about electing a black President, when his law firm fired the only black guy on the cast (cross-dresser Clarence)?

Ren&eacute; Auberjonois (Deep Space Nine, Benson) rejoins the cast when needed. John Larroquette really surprised me as his regular replacement. He is a fine dramatic actor, and had to play the straight man to class clowns Denny and Alan. He was a great addition to the cast, it turns out.

So what is there here? Melvin Palmer has two great turns this season ("You're a hoot, that's what you are!"). First on a trip to the dude ranch for our heroes, then in a touching Thanksgiving episode. (Hint: This is more of a Roseanne Thanksgiving than Waltons Thanksgiving.)

For our heroes, there's more fishing at Nimmo Bay, and a double wedding finale! It's worth the trip for those who watched the previous seasons, and if you haven't done that, check out season one.
