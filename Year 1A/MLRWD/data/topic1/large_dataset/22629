I was anticipating this movie so much that I didn't even bother trying to find someone to go watch it at the theatre with me...not that I need someone to go with me but... Anyway, enough of my sad story, this movie is fantastic.  The DVD has a lot to offer in the "behind the scenes featurettes" department - lots of details on how it all came to be.  But, I suspect that there will be an even sweller edition released at a later date - probably just in time for the Christmas spending season.  If you have a chance to read the graphic novel adaptaion of this movie I recommend that as well - it's a slightly different take on the film and just as surrealistic.  The movie itself is quite magical - not quite in the fairy-tale sense yet still mind-stretching and very touching.  Hugh Jackman owns his role just like always and you get to see him as "action guy", "romantic lead", and "brooding/pensive" all in this wonderful film.  Rachael Weisz is just as outstanding in her double roles making us guys fall head over heels for her.  The only reason I only allow four stars is that I can forsee this becoming a double-dip when a Special Edition DVD is released in the near future.
