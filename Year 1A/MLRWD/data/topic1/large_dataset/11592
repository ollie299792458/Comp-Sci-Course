The photography is breathtaking at times, and the movie itself, emotionally powerful -- regardless of your feelings towards the film's attitude towards Native Americans.  The number of divergent reviews suggest that Ford intended John Wayne to be read simultaneously as the monomaniacal racist mindlessly shooting buffalo in order that the "Commanche" not have a source of food for the winter, and as towering figure who relentlessly searches (hunts?) for his niece. In either case, Ethan is the exceptional figure who never quite fits in civilized society. Ford's brilliance was to dramatize the ambiguity with which we view such characters, at once a threat to the order of things and its savior. As for the film's treatment of Native Americans, I think that it stretches one's credulity to claim that their treatment was "realistic" and devoid of racist stereotypes. What is true, though, is that Ford quite consciously calls into question the validity of the stereotypes used in the genre. Which is to say, that while the movie is not free of some disturbing representations, it certainly recognizes the injustice of some of the representations. This recognition of sorts, coupled with the complexity of Ethan's character (I've always wondered how aware Wayne was of the "dark side" of Ethan), is why I consider it to be Ford's greatest work (certainly a debatable claim).
