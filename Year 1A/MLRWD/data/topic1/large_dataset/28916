I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Paranoia Agent. It appeared to be sort of a horror show, which I am not a big fan of. I bought the DVD anyway and when I put it on, I was completely shocked by the show's beginning theme song. Are those people laughing? Is that a happy catchy toon I hear? What is this?! I couldn't help but to laugh at the nuclear explosions in the background.

Paranoia Agent isn't exactly a horror show (why would it be since it's impossible to get scared off of animation), but it has plenty of weird creepiness throughout. Each episode in this DVD centers around a different character as he or she goes insane such as having multiple personalities or having hippi-like illusions. The story behind each show is very intriguing and unique. The best way I can describe it is like a Pink Floyd music video (strange to be more simple).

What makes this DVD even better is there is a very interesting plot twist at the end that makes me begging for more. I can't wait to see the next volume in this DVD set.

This show should satisfy pretty much everyone unless you are a stickler about mature content.
