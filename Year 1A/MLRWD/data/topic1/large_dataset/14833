I remember liking this when it first aired as a mini-series on NBC in 1998.  My recent reading of The Mists of Avalon (and the inevitable compare/contrast-a-thon with the TNT mini-series version of that book) as well as a recent viewing of the 1981 Excalibur movie, prompted me to buy the DVD.
The Arthur legend in itself is a rich story filled with plot twists, intrigue, manipulation, deceit, religion and magic.  And, in my limited experience with the legend, no two stories are exactly alike.  The Merlin mini-series, told from the Wizard's point of view, is a very enjoyable version of the legend that keeps you interested.
The acting is mostly first-rate.  I was particularly surprised and pleased by the performance of...Martin Short(!) as Queen Mab's sidekick, Frik.  Frik appears in several guises throughout the film, each played with gusto.  The only detractions were Morgan Le Fey's (Helena Bonham Carter's) forced lisp and Queen Mab's (Miranda Richardson's) scratchy voice.  Was that part of the legend?
The writing was well done...way better than Excalibur (Excalibur's corny Arthur: "We shall all sit in a circle as equals...why, I shall build...a round table!"  Merlin's less-corny Arthur: "Let this circle be a symbol that we are all equal.").  Some parts were a bit slow, but the splash of humor here and there adds to the overall fun of the film.
The special effects are great because they are mostly subtle and don't upstage the actors or the story.  I particularly liked the bits with Frik's turn-around-costume-changes.
Overall, this epic overview of the King Arthur legend is lots of fun...and family fun at that!
