It was a great book turned into a good movie with a fantastic cast and wonderful cinematography. Much has been made about parsing away the extraneous parts of the story and I get some of that (Mikael's fling with one of the Vanger clan for instance) but Blomkvist's motivation for taking on the investigation was Vanger's promise to give him the goods on Wennerstrom, the man who put him in prison.It doesn't seem like it would have been that difficult to include this critical bit of information.  Mikael's relationship with Erika Berger would have brought more depth to his character and the whole subject of Vanger becoming a board member to keep Millennium (Mikael's baby) from going under could have been a way to introduce that. Noomi Rapace was a good choice for Lisbeth she does a wonderful job capturing her absolutley fierce sense of justice and her seemingly aloof personality born from the personal trauma of her life. An introduction to her first guardian would've added a bit of depth to her character as well because he really gets her and understands how ridiculously smart she is. I understand these suggestions would add more time to an already long movie (at least for an American audience), but the truth is I didn't find the movie overly long. I saw it with a friend of mine who had not read the book and he felt there were parts of the story missing. Movies often become Cliff Note versions books, but this one was better than most. I am anxious to see what they do with the second book which really lends itself to a straight-ahead action thriller. Also if the setting for the
American version of TGWTDT is moved from Sweden it is doomed. When was the last time someone went to prison for libel in this country?
