Shane is for me the greatest western film of all time. It has much emotional depth, and stands as a great work of art. Alan Ladd, in my opinion, is perfect in the role (regardless of his size). Shane's nobility of character in spite of hard circumstances is a marvel, making him one of the most memorable characters ever on film. The music (which is always an important part of any movie) is also very good, capturing the whole feel of the movie from the more wistful scenes to the more violent scenes. The movie also has some very interesting realistic moments for a movie made in its time such as the little girl's behaviour during the funeral of the one sod buster that was killed by Jack Palance.

The movie has a quiet yet stirring quality rarely found in other movies both in the western or other genres. Not only is the central character very well played, but the direction is also superb. Every detail of the movie was carefully thought out. Compare this movie with a couple of the other highest acclaimed westerns. High Noon had a great start in the movie, but by two-third's of the way through, the central plot had become somewhat overdone, and even the inevitable climactic gunfight didn't offer any real surprise in its action sequences to the modern viewer. The Searchers had an interesting central character in John Wayne's Ethan, who is the real highlight of the film, but the story meanders somewhat between the subplots, and the quick reversal of Natalie Wood's attitude towards the two Searchers at the end is clearly underdeveloped. But Shane is in a different league, being brilliantly thought-out and executed from beginning to end with no filler. It is an absolute masterpiece.
