This film was made about 65 years ago, so those looking for explosions, bullets, and butchery had better go with something more recent.  For modern viewers to watch this, they'll have to have patience.  Most of what you see here has been replayed many times over since this came out.  There's the rag-tag bunch of prisoners in POW camps; the escape attempts; the prisoner/captor repartee; the escapee/refuge love interest.  Once you get into though, it becomes engrossing.  
And when it's over, you'll find this a beautiful film.  And I'm not talking cinematography (although it is very good).  I'm talking about the beauty of humanity.  There is something about this film that displays humanity in its noble, respectful glory.  You don't see the hate and violence of war; you see the duty and honor of country and individuals.  People are treated like fellow humans, not like cattle let to the slaughter.  It's actually quite touching, I must say.  Althought, while not being totally naive about the horrors of war, since this film was set in WWI and came out prior to WWII and most of the Nazi abominations, that may explain some of its respect for life.
Ok, back to beauty.  Criterion has done a magnificent job with this transfer.  The picture is sharp and, for the most part, scratch-free.  The before-and-after comparison is impressive.  There are the typical extras found on the DVD, including an introduction by the director himself, Jean Renoir, and an interesting story about the film's history.
Typically with Criterion DVDs, it is expensive.  But for those who want a cinematic classic and aren't concerned with the price, it's a must-have.  Five-star recommendation.  At least try to rent it.
