I am actually rating this film from a standpoint of a Russian soul that loves Russian history and is proud of my heritage.
So much has been torn apart as far as Russian history is concerned within the past 15 years, and 70 years before that, I really did not know what to expect when I sat down in the theater.  Will this be popularist Hollywood type dancing through the Winter Palace with scenes of epique, Gladiator-type battles unfolding on the walls of the Palace?  That is what I kind of expected - why would a movie any different from that make it to US theaters?  
Well, that is not what I saw.  I saw a nostalgic, often out of place in time, view at what I learned for so many years.  I saw director's cry for times long gone, I saw the emotion, love and understanding, of little, seemingly insignificant pictures of Russian history, flash before my eyes.  
I think reviewers who rated this movie as boring or without point, grossly misunderstood the idea and the goal.  Throughout the movie, you see a series of little re-enactments that often ended in a pose that is similar/same to the paintings located in the Hermitage.  That is where the paintings come alive.  Like the whole scene with Nicolas II's family gathered around the dinner table and as the camera pans out, everyone turns and looks into the camera.  I vividly remember the painting, and only then did it hit me - the meaning, the tragedy, the emotion.  I understood the painting! 
Same thing can be said for many other scenes like that.  But the most powerful scene of the movie is at the very end, everyone is leaving the ballroom, the awkwardly translated phrase "This is the flower of young Russia" and finally, the stranger saying I'm staying...
I'm staying with 5 stars here ...
