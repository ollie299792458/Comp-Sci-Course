When I first watched this show I adored it.  Battle for good and evil, good music and cinematography, Clancy Brown, etc.

But my concern with the DVD was the expense, and the desire to watch it over and over.  I am currently on viewing four in the last month, and I can attest to the fact that it actually improves upon rewatching.  Though other reviewers complain regarding the pacing (and I did the first time through) it is truly where the genius of the series lies.  Unlike more traditional serials, the writers do not need to show all their cards immediately, and while on the first watching I was saying things like "don't dwell on this subplot, tell me about the bear," it makes the inevitable explanation that much sweeter.  Also, unlike the X-Files, the show has proven to me in only 14 episodes (time of this review) that there will not be a forgotten symbol or plot point.  The black goo will not be different in two seasons, and while I may know more about the tree tattoo by the end, it's meaning will not change or be lost.

In the first episode when Hawkins gets his tarot reading from Sophie.  She asks him if he wants his past, present, or future, and he dismissively says it doesn't matter.  He then gets a reading which is clearly his past.  But each time you go back and watch the first episode, it is clear that it actually doesn't matter.  That what she tells him is true of the past, present and future.

And because I will watch it again and again, looking for and finding new things, the original cost is more than worth it.
