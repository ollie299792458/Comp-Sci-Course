All great works of filmdom are controversial because they demand more than mere attendence. I guess like any great work one gets it or one doesn't. From some reviewers I guess having read the book makes it very diffcult to get into the movie. That's unfortunate because it is worth the viewing again and again. From the cinematography to the acting it is a seemless piece  of genius which I will take years to fathom and fully understand. Several people reported serious problems with the dvd itself, either with sound distortion or faulty tracking etc. [....] Someone referred to the movie as  a story of Eden lost. I guess that sums it up in a few words. I think it is the roll of the viewer to find Eden revisited. It is a symbolic view of life and the clash of two diverse cultures as experienced by youth, innocence both imprinted by the reality of their respective cutures. Answers are not always there in black and white but they are there. I hope all viewers will give this film a chance. The rewards are enormous if not attained at the first viewing.
