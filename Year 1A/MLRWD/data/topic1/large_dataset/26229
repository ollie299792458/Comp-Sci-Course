Ok, so I was having a...shall we say...EMOTIONAL day, and thought the night would be spent crying at stupid commercials or something like that. HAPPY TO REPORT I WAS WRONG! I turned the movie channel on and this was already playing. Having seen and loved MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, I thought I'd give it a try. (I didn't like her other movie...don't recall the name but she was a tour guide in Greece.) ANYWAY...I literally BURST out laughing...repeatedly through out the movie! Sure it has it's corny moments...but there are some seriously funny lines, faces, and even a few noises that had me unexpectedly bursting out with laughter...I'm afraid this did cause my cat to dive off the couch and run for her life on more than one ocasion...but I'm happy to say she'll be fine with a few weeks of therapy ;)
If you don't mind a little cheese in your romantic comedy (they pretty much go hand in hand anyway)...and if the scene in MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING where Tula's aunt is talking about the "bibopsie" and how it was her twin, made you LAUGH...then give this movie a try! I was pleasantly THRILLED.
