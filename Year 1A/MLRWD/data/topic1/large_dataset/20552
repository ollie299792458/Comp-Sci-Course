Yes, this was a genuinely different movie that deserves credit for the storyline more than the acting.  This is one of those sci-fi's that make you think it could actually happen with technology in constant progress.

 If you've noticed, a lot of Robin's recent drama movies, he really doesn't do much in the way of acting other than appearing extremely introverted.  These are the movies where he gives a cheesy smile, a chuckle, like he's uncomfortable and wants to shy away..then you see him running from someone.  He doesn't seem to talk much.

Robin Williams is probably the best stand-up comeidan I've ever seen.  He's completely opposite of characters like these if you've ever seen him in interviews, etc. He put out an outstanding stand-up performance on DVD a year or 2 ago, something he hadn't done since some 16 year earlier.  It wasn't one of those rentals that fill up an entire wall case (to get you to rent it), although it should have.  When I rented it there were only a few there.

Don't know why he keeps doing these strange, perverse dramas but I cannot give him credit for excellent acting talent here.
