At first I watched this movie and thought that it does not fully explain why Hannibal Lecter became Hannibal Lecter.  I read all the books as well and never got it until the other night I watched Silence of the Lambs again, and it hit me.  The stories between Lecter and Starling are similar, yet they chose opposite ends of the path.  Here are their similarities:

When they were both young they each became orphaned.

When they were orphaned they each had a charge to take care of, Starling trying to save the lamb, Lecter and his sister.  Which incidentaly, were both eaten.

This fractured Lecter while it steeled Starling and this is where they separate.  Starling is what Lecter could have been and he loves her for it.

So when I came to this realization, this movie made more sense to me and now I like it.

I'm still wanting to see Hannibal at his prime, between his begining and then right before his capture.  The murders that made him infamous, I hope Thomas Harris writes that.
