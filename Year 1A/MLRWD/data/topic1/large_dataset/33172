Tom Fontana is a remarkable and imaginative writer but he really slipped on the final series of Oz. A huge fan, I eagerly purchased the entire series 1 to 6 and have watched them from beginning to end loving each minute. Until, that is, series 6. What happened? Why do I get the feeling that Tom, knowing this to be his last series, got a 10 year old to write it for him? Where in the previous seasons he had managed to get in a hint of something and build up on it weeks or even a series later, everything is disjointed, nothing is explained and a mismash of ideas obviously planned for the next 2 or 3 seasons are thrown together in a poor imitation of the star writing of before.

Series 6 is a bit like eating a divine cake and savouring each minute to taking a bite at the end and finding someone didnt stir in the lemon flavouring!

As disappointed as I am in this series I can still give the others 5 stars in every respect from writing to acting and Oz will remain in my memory as one of the best TV series ever.
