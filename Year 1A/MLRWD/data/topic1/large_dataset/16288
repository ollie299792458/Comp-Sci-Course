First of all, I must say, "Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!" to the fact that Ratner's hack-job on "Red Dragon" will be dropped, kicked and forgotten for ever, and thank goodness. As for the last in the series of the Hannibal as a child in "Rising" was a decent film but was also not a Fox movie, therefore rightly not included. I am, like I said, so very very glad that Ratner's "Red Dragon" will be done and dusted for ever, that piece of crap.
Now, back to this BR collection - sure it doesn't have any extras, but at least "Manhunter" gets more exposure, and Michael Mann did a brilliant job of it, of making it a cool, 80's iconic movie with the smooth music to boot!, with his slick cinematographic style carrying on the whole Miami Vice feel. To tell you the truth, I loved the movie and still love it and it ranks up there as one of my all time faves - I mean it's the 80's! I grew up through all that! Cool stuff. Brian Cox nails it in this film, and the sanitary, cold cell in this version was right for the time. To go to the dark and dingy in "Silence" was right for its time as the whole grunge thing happened in the 90's and that was appropriate for its time. I mean you look at William Petersen's acting style, and subsequent  FBI CSI-tech thing, he made a living on that! How cool is that? In fact, if you think about it, Michael Mann really was a pioneer and he really gave the cinematic world so much with his signature as well.
I'm glad this is collection is the way it is.
