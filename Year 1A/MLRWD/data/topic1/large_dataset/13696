That particular sly ad campain line heraladed the  summer 62 release of, Kubricks film vision  of author  Nabakovs, tart  writers exercise in memory.The public, teased into  theaters, hoping nudity, and or foul language were to be presented, left befudled. Large lobby posters of a sunglassed Sue Lyons sucking  a heart shaped lollypop didnt untangle this coded classic.The film; full of elegant framing, and brimming with witty, urbane language and action, not only retains its sublime seductiveness, but positively glows in its DVD form. The stark, pristine black and white image,transfered from what appears to be orginal master stock is a delight;  as much a delight as its original "lollypop"promise. The intimacy of the new technology, welds itself to the intimacy of Humbert Humbert's diary, allowing the viewer to enter this made up "writer/filmakers collaborative world , and enjoy this meditative piece,about the impossibility ,though never escapable attempt ,to control an intrusive outside world through  creative invention.
