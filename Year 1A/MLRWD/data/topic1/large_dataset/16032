I don't care to look at movies over and over again.  Most of the time, once is enough for me.  My in-laws don't look at movies at all, unless it is one that they come across on television.  And my father inlaw is not a movie lover at all, but let me tell you - I watched the Blind Side on a movie channel, then I purchased the Blind Side.  After reviewing it again, my husband took the movie to his parents house and they watched it.  Then I had to purchased another copy because they decided to "keep" that one and watch it with some friends.  I really enjoyed this movie, because is showed me alot about people and no matter where you come from, what you look like or what you are capable of doing, remember you are someone that can do anything.  I would recommend this movie to all ages.  This is one movie that eveyone should see and see what kind of differnece it would make in the world today.  My hats off to the producers, writers and the family that allowed the production of their life story.  Remember that inside everyone is the same and maybe if we all had more "guts" to take on life's most daring challngers, we, too could make this a better society.
