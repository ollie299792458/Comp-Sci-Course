To make Shakespeare accessible, you have to make it entertaining.  Not just entertaining to those who already know and love his work, but entertaining to those who have never picked up a Folger edition of anything in their lives.  
I teach English to teenagers.  Teenagers, who gasp in horror at the mention of Shakespeare.  Teenagers, with their 30 second attention spans, faulty grasp of the modern English they supposedly speak, and affection for the physical comedy of the likes of "Jackass."
So, how do we make teenagers like Shakespeare?  We edit.  So, naturally, some of the best speeches are missing or drastically shortened (remember, 30 second attention spans); the physical, often silly humor is accented; and the women mud wrestle.  So what?
This movie is entertaining.  At times, it is enchanting.  It is fast-paced, visually interesting, and funny.  The emphasis is shifted away from the complexities of the language because it is the language, the very thing we love about Shakespeare, that makes these plays inaccessible to the majority of the American movie audience.  
I use this film because it is easy to understand.  The actors have faces my students recognize, and it gets them excited about Shakespeare.
What this film does is to put the content of the play within the grasp of its modern audience.  Shakespeare himself would have done no less.
