I loved the punisher, and I would definatly own it on DVD.  Now this one kid who said better than daredevil, I agree all the way, better than spider-man, agree again, better than batman, hey watch it again.  Now I am a big fan with my man, Travolta and his character did not suck to the moron that said it.  A calm, upper-class, respected, own his own corporation, god that's Travolta.  swordfish, broken arrow, face-off, pulp fiction, all of characters fitted the profile perfectly.  Now Thomas Jane, yes meant for the action not for the acting, but you just can't blame him for being an awesome punisher.  Now the suit yes is gone, to alot of fans out there to the comic book series caused a huge dissapointment for the movie, but hey look at daredevil.  Now the skull, oh you had to have the skull, symbolizes the punisher, gives Frank Castle a meaning, death is coming for those who do evil unto others, I love that.  Insanity is in this movie.  John Travolta suddenly throwing his wife over the bridge landing on the tracks, still living, and gets roadkilled by the train.  Truthfully how many of you was surprised, stunned on that.  Fear, the running through the woods breaking the guy's neck with a huge rip scene, just calmly suddenlly shooting his friend in the head at the ending insanity, that's insanity.  Throwing a political story, before stabbing to death your best friend cause you believed with the evidence that he slept with your wife, pulling off slowly earings off your eyelash, your chin, your bottom lip with a pair of plyers, shooting every relative, every family, wife and son run over by a van, thats insanity.  Now I like the plot I really do, even though it's a popular plot, guy's family gets brutally killed, goes out for vengengence for the guys involved, difference from all the others, it made the plot better, and more stronger.
