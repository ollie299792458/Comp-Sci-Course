One of the main things I've noticed about this series is that it has had a tremendous effect on the self-esteem of young African-Americans, who so rarely get to learn about the vital importance of their predecessors. It is wonderful that this series was made, demonstrating how brilliant and ingenius these people were (I would say "are" but it mostly covered musicians who have passed away) how important they still are to the development of music, and hence, to our daily lives, and how exciting they and their lives were. As as a musician, I found the series perplexing. Why has Ken Burns, who has access to so many brilliant theorists, limited his scope exclusively to the opinions of the "Wyntonites"? And, most of the interviews were not about the actual music or the musicians, but repetitious anecdotes from non-musicians talking about social events. While I appreciated the historical perspective, I wondered why he didn't interview more working jazz musicians for their ideas about the music itself. Of course you will get to see and hear great clips by all the greats, though you won't get to hear Jazz violin, which is too bad. On the whole, though, I think this series is extremely important and I hope everyone gets to see it at least once.
