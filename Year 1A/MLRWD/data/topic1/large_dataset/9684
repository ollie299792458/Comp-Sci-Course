Cherry Blossoms is an oddly absorbing film. The story is presented in two parts: The first half takes place in Germany and focuses on the inter-generational tension resulting from a visit of the patents (Rudi and Trudi) to see their grown children, who are too busy and do not want to be bothered. In the midst of their visit, Trudi unexpectedly dies in her sleep and Rudi is devastated (not so much out of love as out of need: Rrudi is a rather self-absorbed and selfish person). This part of the film is entirely too long and could easily be cut in half (but suffer through it. The second half is a gem). The second half, which takes place in Tokyo after Trudi dies, focuses on two people: Rudi and a young homeless girl who practices modern Japanese dance in the park in order to communicate with her dead mother. This is where Rudi begins his journey of self-discovery from his self-adsorbed personage into a more spiritual relationship with his dead wife.  The Japanese scenery brings the spiritual themes into sharp focus. Cherry Blossoms has an unexpectedly strong emotional punch.
