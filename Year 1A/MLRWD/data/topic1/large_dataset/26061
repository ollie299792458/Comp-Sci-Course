I'm not sure why there are some people who don't seem to have enjoyed this film
I absolutely loved it.
I first had the chance to see it in my english class back in 2004 during my junior year of high school.
I fell head over heels for the party scenes and the delightful music.
In my opinion, Gatsby's parties are the heart of this book.
For it is due to these parties that he is constantly throwing that turn him into a renowned figure among the populous of long island sound.
It was at these parties that people began to speculate about his mysterious nature.
It was at one of his parties where Gatsby meets Jordan and finds a way in to Daisy's life.

I loved the portrayal of Daisy and Jordan specifically.
I just love almost everything about this movie.

I felt this film was pretty true to the book as well in terms of character.

I wish i was a lot more articulate so that i can better defend this movie but i will just have to end this review with my stamp of approval.

Great flick.
