First rate study of the strange direction that isolation and loneliness can take.
 THE MINUS MAN reminds me of another study of a killer's mind, TAXI DRIVER. But where Travis Bickle will never "fit in," will always go against the tide and be rejected by others, Vann blends into social circumstances and is apparently accepted by society. In many cases, people actually gravitate to his character and reach out to him.
But he has an empty heart.
 Travis Bickle's heart is filled with rage and violence that explodes outward in vengeful murder.
But Vann seems to just suck the life out of his victims, more an implosion of emptiness and despair. When someone tries to "move in closer," there's just a vacuum. Look in his eyes when Ferrin tries to get past the surface chit-chat and become more intimate. His eyes are empty. He just shuts down.
 Both men seem so different on the surface. But their deadly reactions are to the same problem-  the inability to "only connect" to their fellow man. With thanks to Forster.
 "Only connect!... Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die."
 How much Vann and Travis are like each other- their spartan, monk-like daily existences marked by the occaisonal emergence of "the beast."
Stunning lead performance by Owen Wilson, as well as a finely tuned cast.
 The music is an important reflection of the key ideas in this film, rather than just a tacked-on score.
A very important film.
