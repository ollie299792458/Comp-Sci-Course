The star power alone is enough reason to watch this delightful movie. Yes, it's saccharine Hollywood sentimentality and little of the over-the-top dares that made "Priscilla" what it was. But...

  "Too Wong Foo" is more than worth watching, especially for the performances and the countless cameos. Kudos to all the stars for taking the risk and bringing this story on screen, and for giving performances that dare Hollywood stereotypes about "star image," when there was no Will & Grace. John Leguizamo walks away with the movie, effortlessly. If Naomi Campbell was a dragqueen, she'd be Wesley Snipes -- sure enough, she's the one who taught him how to walk in heels, rumor has it. Patrick Swayze has great moments, at times elegant, and then at times reminds one of Jack Lemon in "Some Like it Hot." What can you say about Stockard Channing except that she wins your heart.  Among the most memorable cameos, the innimitable Robin Williams. And if you watch the camera pan in that same scene, you might chuckle as you catch a glimpse of none other than George Costacos.

  The film's color, costumes, the unbelievable makeup and hair transformations and off-the-cuff theme, are best when they don't try to pass for real. Give me the fairytale, give me the glamor. A fun reminder of the RuPaul days.
