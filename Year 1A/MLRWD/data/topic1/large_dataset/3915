And there is a reason why. In the ever growing rush to "push the envelope" and "narrow cast" a demographic, most of today's comedic directors either try to out gross their audiences or create pieces so targeted there is no appeal to the public in general.

"The Great Race" along with "It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World", "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines" and others from their time remind us how great comedic writing used to be.

Right from the beginning, the character establishment vignettes set the tone for the classic conflict of good and evil between Tony Curtis' "The Great Leslie" and Jack Lemon's "Professor Fate". The movie is a non-stop comedy that has some of the finest moments in comedic film. Featuring wonderful appearances by such character actors as Arthur O'Connel, Vivian Vance, Larry Storch, and Ross Martin (as the unforgettable Baron Rolfe von Stuppe); the Great Race still holds up well after 40 years.

For no other reason, buy this DVD to see THE greatest pie fight ever to be caught on celluloid.
