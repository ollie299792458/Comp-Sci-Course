The drifting music of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008LDNZ">Laura (Fox Film Noir)</a> melts us into the portrait of a murdered beauty. We are infatuated. Vincent price walks into the scene and all we see is his usual handsome, tall and most charming presence. Judith Anderson claims your attention as she did in another unforgettable movie "Rebecca." Laura is cool and ravishing.

After all though, I was subdued by Clifton Web, as the splendidly audacious Waldo Lydecker. His words are choice and saut&eacute;ed in lemon juice; a wonderful contrast to Laura. I must agree with him, when gum-chewing Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson has become infatuated with the portrait of Laura, he sneers "Have you ever dreamed of Laura as you wife, sitting by your side at the policeman's ball or in the bleachers... or listening to the heroic story of how you got a silver shinbone from a battle with a gangster? (pauses) ...I see you have." Laura's image does not transform into a housewife.
