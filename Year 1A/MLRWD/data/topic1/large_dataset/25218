I have a special fondness for the Hellraiser movies, especially Hellbound.

3 is more of a traditional splatter film and less terrifying, mysterious, and nihilistic than most of the other ones, but it's still interesting since it's still Hellraiser-as-splatter (and has the requisite moral grappling at the limits of humanity that makes the series interesting) and not splatter with incidental Hellraiser elements. It's also fun. Of course some of the cenobites and gore is so ridiculously over the top (all of the new cenobites are particularly stupid) that it stops being scary.

The heavy metal music hasn't held up well either, but that was when it was released. It also reinvents the rules of the series in a somewhat contrived fashion, though we do get to see Bradley sans makeup, which is interesting and it adds a new dimension to the Pinhead character.

This is one of the good ones, though. Bradley turns in his usual solid performance and the male lead is good as an arrogant sociopath. The female leads are kind of weak, but it's a horror movie, not Shakespeare

In short, if you like Hellraiser movies, you'll like this one too. If you don't, I doubt this one will do anything to convince you otherwise. .
