An educational, eloquent, emotive, engaging, enterprising, expertly narrated, organized and written, exclusive of politically or theologically conservative viewpoints, extensive 9-part documentary examining baseball's role as a mirror of American culture. When the token conservative says that his friends grew up as happy and liberal Cardinal fans and he grew up as an embittered and conservative Cub fan, and that he is a semi-Marxist, you know that the program is tilted toward the left. Nevertheless, the view of baseball from left field is still breath-taking. It's worth it just for the visuals. It's worth it just to be introduced to some of the interviewees. My favorites are Red Barber, Charley McDowell, Daniel Okrent, Buck O'Neil and Vin Scully, but there are also gems from Bob Costas, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Manuel Marquez-Sterling and others. "Baseball" is so full of treasures that it's hard to select a favorite, but the poetic, poignant coverage of Jackie Robinson and the Negro Leagues is at the top of my list. The extras include an illuminating interview with Rachel Robinson.
