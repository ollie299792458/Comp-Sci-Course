So maybe this movie is dark, and spoils the fairytell ending of aliens,but what's the problem.  This movie is better than Resurrection and at times I like certain aspects of this movie better than Aliens.  Alien 3 again relies on atmosphere and the superb acting of Sigourney, to tell a story of hope that is surrounded by despair.  In the movie "Spoiler" Ripley survives the aliens encounter to crash land on Fury 161.  During this time she finds that she is the unfortunate victim of the queens last remaining egg(there is confusion here, is it one or two eggs) and finds that she is the last remaining hope for the survival of the prisoners and all of mankind. Most of the actors are british and that is one of the few negatives of the film.  You can't go ten seconds without one of them shouting something raunchy in a dialect you cant understand. I found that turning on the subtitles will let you pick up certain tiblets of info that you may have missed during your theatric or home viewing of this film. The performances by Weaver, Dutton, and the actor that plays 85 are on the money.  Some people think that this movie is somehow less believable than the other ones, but I feel that it is more real(not realistic)in the fact that you can sense the urgency of the situation, and feel the gloomy loss of hope that the characters in the movie are feeling.  All in all I like the movies as they go in order, but I do think that this was a perfect way to end the trilogy. One womans sacrifice to
save mankind.
