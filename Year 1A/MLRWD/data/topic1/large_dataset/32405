That song will never leave your head after seeing this film; what a beautiful song!  This is the last of Peckinpah's films I have seen, and I must say, it is the best, followed by "Straw Dogs", "Pat Garret" and "Ride the High Country." Cable Hogue found water where it wasn't - and thus begins "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" (1970). Jason Robards delivers one of his best performances, similar to the character he played in "Once Upon a Time in the West" (1969), in a film that is perhaps Sam Peckinpah's best! Left to die in the desert by his so called friends (L.Q. Jones and Stother Martin), Cable wanders about asking God for a helping hand. Near death by thirst, Cable finally stumbles upon water, and begins an enterprise called "Cable Springs"; a reststop for weary travelers along the stagecoach trail. Once in town he falls in love with Hildy, "the ladiest damn'd lady" - a whore nonetheless, while befriending a wandering preacher who expounds in theories of life and love. Peckinpah's lyrical poetry is extraordinary as it is both charming and fascinating; brought to life with the wonderful photography by Lucien Ballard, and the heartwarming score by Richard Gillis.  This is a film you will thoroughly enjoy, covering themes often familiar to Peckinpah's films, as the old west dies out, while the heart and spirit remain intact.
