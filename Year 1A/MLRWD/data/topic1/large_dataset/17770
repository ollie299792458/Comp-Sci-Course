I was watching this movie on tv the other night and I was rather miffed that I caught it in the middle. I wasn't feeling to good (a little dizzy) so I was in no condition to watch the movie-which I later found in my collection-in its entirety.
Boy am I relieved that I watched all the way through. I hadn't seen it in a really long time and I was blown away by the its depth and twists. The acting of the Willis Pitt tandem is awe inspiring. If you are a fan of some of Pitt's other roles (Fight Club) then you will definitely see some cross-over with his anti-establishment attitude, though in this movie he is much farther off the deep end.
Not to ruin anything I'll just say that the plot, which will crush you in futility, is Bruce Willis traveling back in time to research a virus which has sent man kind under ground. His travels back in time aren't an exact science and as such His mind isn't exactly right. Couple that with trying to track down the insane Pitt it makes for a dizzy bit of acting. I think that this movie is a great mind-mess and should be watched again and again.
