To be honest I like this film because of all the films i nthe thriller genre where you can almost predict the ending and the upcoming twists and turns in some parts than this is one of those films but with it's great cast, state of the art cinematography, the movie is made as complex as can be for this simple plot. Michael Douglas' character is a total hardass that is pure and simple...business day and night. His brother played by Sean Penn gives him a gift which is a game in which they get involved in Douglas' character's life and play games on his mind. That can only happen if he (Douglas) visits the office in which they have to get information on him and do some health examinations. The people in the building start even playing mind games on him after hours of testing by just letting him stay in a room and leave him there forgotten to the world. Well after that you just have to watch for yourself but I love how the movie makes his life twist and disappear like nothing... a good film!
