Any film will flop without a good story to tell. Even great actors can not help a film with a weak storyline. This is what makes Master and Commander so compelling. Watch it repeatedly and  the chances are good you will get some meaningful new impression. Director Peter weir has seamlessly put together many sub plots against the background of the Napoleonic Wars at sea, and a deadly competition between a French and an English warship. Viewers learn of tense and tender relationships between officers, officers and enlisted men, and between the English Captain ( Russell Crowe ) and a civian naturalist ( Paul Bettany ). None of these fascinating stories overwhelm the principle story: wartime competition. The cast is truly fine, the settings are fascinating, battle scenes are not numerous, but are convincingly and ( sometimes ) wincingly staged and photographed. In my view, this film surpasses "Gladiator" for story and photography. The film's gifted story telling easily wins the audience, more than would gratuitous violence. Even the dvd extras are fine and informative. I have seen the dvd many times; I will view it again.
