This is a great film for everyone, especially if you lived at the time of SECRETARIAT.  This was the first movie I have seen in about 2 years, and the first in a long time that I was excited about and truly wanted to see.  In 1973, Secretariat touched everyone in this country.  Just about everyone was talking about and rooting for this horse.  But, in addition to telling the story of a champion Triple Crown winning horse, this film tells the story of just how implausible the events behind the champion were.  While taking a few moments of dramatic license, it effectively tells the story of the background of this thoroughbred legend as was brilliantly laid out by William Nack, in SECRETARIAT, THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION.  I have heard about and read reviews that this was more Penny's story than Secretariat's story, maybe so, but the truth is, without Penny, there would be no Secretariat.  This is no different than SEABISCUIT, which was as much the story of the three individuals who brought immortality to that horse as well.  In short, this is a must see film, and is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.  For once you can see a movie and feel good about what you have seen; the story of a horse with a tremendous heart nurtured on by people with the heart to believe.  HE IS MOVING LIKE A TREMENDOUS MACHINE,(from Chic Anderson's immortal call during the Belmont Stakes).
