Excellent quality DVD from the great era of Hollywood movies when you didn't have to worry about filthy language every other sentence.  Well-known actors/actresses, great costumes, humor and absolutely NO bad language.  A movie you can enjoy with the entire family.

This is the premiere sword-fight movie for swashbuckling enthusiasts, with a number of duels and what is probably the longest sword duel in movie history.

"Scaramouche" is a classic tale of revenge set in latter 1700's France, just before the French Revolution.  Stewart Granger portrays Andre Moreau, whose young friend is goaded into a sword fight and killed by one of France's premiere duelists.  Moreau vows vengance.  Having no skill with the sword, he must find training, while concealing his identity as the stage clown Scaramouche.

Stewarts's love interests include the glamorous Eleanor Parker (later to portray The Countess in "The Sound of Music" and a young and equally glamorous Janet Leigh (who later became famous for the shower death scene in Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho").  Ms. Parker also adds humor as Moreau's jealous lover.

You will recognize many great actors/actresses in this movie, both young and old, including the great Lewis Stone, who played Scaramouche in the silent film and was also Mickey Rooney's father in the Andy Hardy movies of the 1930's.
