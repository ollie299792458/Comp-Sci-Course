I must admit, I DID go into this movie already biased based off of the reviews that are on here. Nevertheless, I liked the cute lil' flick! I LOVE SJP, so anything she's in, no matter how boring it may be, will always keep my attention. The movie is a good flick for a quiet night at home with a glass of wine. However, I DO agree with the majority of reviewers on here who said that in their opinion, this movie's "stereo-type" was on-point: the blonde chick who was the "stay-home-all-day-who-drop-her-kids-off-at-school-and-then-stay-committed-to-the-gym-more-than-she-shows-committment-to-her-OWN-kids-mom"-is a joke. I mean, who the hell are YOU to critique SJP's character, when in essence, you're doing the same thing? You drop your kids off at school, and when you had anything to say, it was always said while you were hopping up and down on the friggin' stair-master! I mean, I didn't see YOU really spending any quality time with your "little ones", either! I know it's just a movie, but sadly, there really ARE air-headed women out here in the real world who does that! SOME things the red-head said(SJP's friend in the movie) were true: there ARE certain things that men can do and be praised for, while the woman is shot down continuously for doing the same thing....I think the only difference with that is, she just DOES IT BETTER!!!

Cute flick...just check it out and judge for yourself.

PS: No, I was NOT feeling the "narration" theme, as if everyone was on a reality show of some sort....
