This movie epitomizes the literary phrase "Suspension of Disbelief", which means absolutely preposterous. That doesn't always mean terrible. This movie has the craziest and most implausible plot point in movie history. They get good actors to sound excited about the perils and pitfalls of drilling into magma. Coring to the center of the earth!!

This was my number #1 bad movie of all time until I rented a wacky space drama with NO movie stars at the Red Box machine, and the previous renter even wrote "This is the worst movie ever" right on it, it was. Without really good actors here, I guarantee you that no one would ever have given The Core more than one star. Reviewers and fans hate giving movies bad reviews that have good actors being caught in bad movies, because they have done good or great movies. Swank and Eckhart are the only thing buoying this movie from sinking to the center of the earth without a drill.

The number three worst ever, I'm watching it right now, until something better jumps out, Day After Tomorrow. Fun scenes of diaster in 5.1 sound, but ridiculously unbelieveable. Armageddon, on last night, could be tied with Day After Tomorrow for third place. In fact, you can't give any movie a "NO STARS" review at Amazon, and this one deserves it too. The sequel to The Core might as well be Core 2; Mission to the Sun, LOL.
