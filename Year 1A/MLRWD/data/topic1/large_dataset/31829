I picked up this movie from the local library to watch with my wife. My wife couldn't manage to sit through the entire movie, though! She found it a bit too intense in the suspense department. She got up once and said "I need to go empty the dishwasher! I can't watch this!" Then she got up again, later, and said "I need to fold some laundry! Tell me when they get out of this!" In total, there were three times she had to leave the room because she couldn't take the suspense. I was lying on the couch, watching her, at one point, and when I saw how big her eyes were, I just started laughing out loud. She turned to me and asked what I was laughing about, and when I told her the reason, she just said "Why are you making me watch this crazy movie?! you know I can't take movie like this!" It was hysterical!

Seriously, though, if you want to watch a movie with plenty of action, suspense, beautiful wonders of nature, and great filming of it all, this is a good movie for you! Very solid movie!
