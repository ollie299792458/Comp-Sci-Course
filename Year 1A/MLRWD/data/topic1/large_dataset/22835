this is quite an interesting film...mostly pointless? yes.  rather cheesy acting? somewhat.  too much gore to be taken seriously? i would say no...as odd as it seems, i would say this film isnt run by its gore-factor, which is a damn high one, possibly the highest ive ever seen...it uses the gore-factor in a way that can be viewed as actually frightening, such as in a scene where a girl gets HARSHLY stabbed in the ankle with a pencil and they just focus on it and the blood oozing out for almost 30 solid seconds...long enough to make you at least get a little squeemish, if not freaked out from thinking "who would think of putting that in a movie", but you'll be thinking throughout the whole movie, such as the vine-rape scene, the evil screeching of the possessed demon-kids, and just the horrifying appearance of the kids when possessed...i've never seen zombies, demons, or whatever look this cool...Evil Dead 2's demon's looked cheesy, but these ones were gruesome...i liked Evil Dead 2 cos of how funny it was, but this movie is a pure favorite of mine and i reccommend it to anyone, either people just starting into the horror genre and looking for a GOOD start, or horror fans who havent seen this and are looking for something "new"...it is the ultimate in the genre of pure horror
