Now, I'm not the biggest fan of mob-flicks [the only other mod-movie I've seen is Suicide Kings], but I know that this is one of the best films, regardless of genre, that I've ever seen! DeNiro's performance is next to the best, and Pesci just can't be stopped! The film starts off giving the viewer a sense of amazement as to how Las Vegas functions, seen throught the eyes of a gangster. Also, it's an interesting approach having "Ace" and "Nikki" both tell the story in their own view. Anyway, Ace sets himself up as one of the greatest mobsters in LV, and it seems his indomidable presence can never be wounded. However, after firing a certain "yokel" who wasn't performing up to par at his job in the casino, Sam gets in trouble with the Senatory [also a yokel]. This leads to a hearing about his gaming-license, which in turn becomes his great downfall.
People: This movie's a classic. Probably one of DeNiro's greatest films ever. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a DVD that they'll watch as soon as it arrives, and then keep watching it ever 10 years, just to be reminded what good movies USED to be [Hell, I know I'm going to]. Also, let it be known that some of this is, in actuality, true. Of course, as with most films, a lot of it is just pure DeNiro magic.
