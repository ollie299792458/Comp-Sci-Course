Manhunter suffers from some of the problems that arise when a novel is adapted to the screen: it's generally too talky, and it attempts to work every scene of the book into the film.  This is especially true of the  first half of the film, where you'll often find the characters are telling  you things the film should be showing you.  This drags down the pace of  individual scenes, though overall the film moves from scene to scene at a  breakneck speed, trying to fit in as much of the book's content as  possible.  The end result is disconcerting.
Things improve quite a bit in  the second half, where the screenplay eases up on trying to fit everything  in, and a few haunting scenes show Michael Mann's visual skills to best  advantage - but ultimately, the (apparently) low budget and the cast (which  is competent, but not really memorable) keep the film from the heights it  could have achieved.
The full-screen VHS cassette of Manhunter has a few  drawbacks that deserve mention here, most notably that it's in EP mode,  which harms the quality of the image. Because the film was photographed in  the Super 35 format, the transfer is made without too great a loss of  visual information on the sides -  but by taking in more information on the  bottom and (especially) the top, the composition of the frame is too loose  and uninteresting, and a boom microphone makes occasional appearances at  the top of the frame.  Whatever flaws this film may have, it deserves a  better presentation than it got here.
