I loved this series as a kid and was waiting for it com e out on DVD. I was so excited to find that it holds up as an adult! Yes, the acting and dialogue is a little awkward for the first couple episodes, but the story is compelling and well written & the characters develop really well  - enough so to capture & sustain the interest of several friends of mine who are not typically sci-fi fans per se.

Basically anyone I've shown this series to becomes addicted and we are all left wanting more - and there is more! but it's not officially available which is a crime.

I loved how dark the second season got, so I don't really understand why a few people here dislike it. As the series went on, it developed a very dark and more realistic feel - our heroes lose their cushy funding and facilities and are forced into the sewers to wage guerilla warfare ("i Didn't know they used real gorillas!") or should i say more like gang warefare to combat the aliens.
PLEASE, if anyone's listening/reading, PLEASE RELEASE THE SECOND SEASON!!!
