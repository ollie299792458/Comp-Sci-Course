I never intended to sit through Days of Heaven. I'd heard it dismissed as a postcard movie, beautiful but empty. And let's face it, it has Richard Gere in it. But I finally sat down with the film, and was surprised to discover that it tells an extremely moving story.

To anyone out there who, like me, is allergic to this reptilian actor, Days of Heaven is exhibit number one in Richard Gere's defense. He's perfectly cast in it. He has very little dialogue, and communicates everything with a mood of self-regard (is this acting?). Sam Shepard plays against him as a modest, stoic man who invites sympathy. The story of their competing love for the same woman is fragmented and impressionistic, and strangely anti-dramatic. There are no scenes, just moments, and the whole film seems to play as if from someone's memory - the overall effect is unlike anything I've experienced in movies.

Despite the film's placidness, when the story does finally build to a head, it results in two scenes that knocked the wind out of me, as the emotion built up gently over the film is suddenly released. I've never been so affected by a Hollywood film before, and so completely without the sensation of being manipulated.
