Only intellectuals can write such drivel. Bill Nighy's character says to his daughter who is a member of a new Luddite artistic class: "You'll have to explain this to me, I'm afraid" -- when he sees paintings done by his daughter. How pat, how unoriginal can you get? As though ill-informed 12 year-olds had something important to contribute to the world of art.
Then, the heavy plot starts getting fleshed out: straight left-wing (British version) propaganda about the most mundane things in the world. No one can ever explain why the Israelis kill people and why the Americans are torturing just about everyone they can get their hands on. What happens with movies like this is: if they have explanations then the reasoning that is projected onto the enemies (Israelis and Americans) is so absurd and childish that it makes one cringe. So, instead, we find our mind filling in the blanks anyway and then we cringe. Don't bother wasting your time with this movie. You already know the story. It's in most papers' front pages and editorials.
