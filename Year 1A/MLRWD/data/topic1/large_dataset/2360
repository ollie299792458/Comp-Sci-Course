The Murder of the four members of the Clutter family in 1959 was an incident described masterly by Truman capote. In 1967 the director Richard Brooks decides to put together his filmic experience and Capote's master piece to make a film recreating the event with a very realistic touch that makes this movie needless of blood and special effects to consider it disturbing.
The director makes a very realistic job by filming the movie with actors that look identical to the real murders and the clutter family members. He couldn't make a more faithful portrayal of the event in 1959 by making the movie in the same house where Mr. Clutter, his wife and their two young kids were murdered with a shotgun scarcely a few inches from their head.
When the Murders get into the house, they don't use much violence but the setting of the scenes make them chilling throughout the terrible event. The shots are heard, but the faces of the Clutters being blown up are not shown. This doesn't take any disturbing element from the scenes.
The combination of realistic components, and descriptions made by Capote make this movie have no need for blood in order to make it disturbing during the entire movie.
