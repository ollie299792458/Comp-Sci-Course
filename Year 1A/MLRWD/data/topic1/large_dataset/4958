this is what blu-ray was meant for.journey is based on the jules verne book of the same name.360% diferent then the 1958 movie with james mason and pat boone.
  without getting into the story,which won't burn deep in anyone memory
bank it does do what it was meant to do, intertain!this blu-ray comes with a slip 3d case,2d and 3d versions and a bonus digital copy.
  the 3d is first rate,most likely better then the sd dvd.
from the opening new line cinema[which come right at you]to a t-rex that wants to eat you!flying fish with huge teeth,sparks from the lava that come at you and around you,its 3d at its best.the 3d process,well there is a trade off,colors are not as defined as a 2d movie and some ghosting acures,but all in all its great fun,the surround sound is active in all speakers,but no dolby digital true hd.but a dolby digital 5.1 which is at a higher bit rate then  on a sd dvd.
to sum it up this movie is a hoot and if you never have seen a 3d film this is the one!
one more thing, with blu-ray players prices dropping like a lead baloon[500.00 to a 1000.00 last year],this year a couple hundred and big friday around the corner,it makes sense to jump to blu-ray...enjoy
