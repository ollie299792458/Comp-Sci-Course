You will generally be pleased with this DVD edition of one of the all-time greats for just about everybody. Picture transfer is O.K., and it's great to see it in full wide-screen after all these years; the picture does have  some artifacts in it throughout (those little sparkly things you see on  older films), but its not enough to be distracting, especially after the  shark arrives.  A buyer of this DVD should be prepared for what is not  included:  no director's commentary, writer's commentary, or isolated music  track--all of which seem artistic naturals for this release.  My guess is  they're already planning another release to include more outtakes (there  really weren't all that many) and probably Spielberg's commentary--I notice  they are careful to call this release "Anniversary Collection's  Edition"; I'm sure there will be other versions in the future.  Also,  be prepared for a little odd-ball fact and maybe disappointment related to  the sound:  5.1 sound is just fine, I'm sure.  The stereo, 2-channel  version I found very lacking in depth and separation; and, most notably,  you can't select Dolby Digital Sound (the older 4-channel surround sound)  unless you also choose subtitle captions--this is strange.  Finally, the  picture, with also about 75 minutes of additional features (making of...,  etc.), is dual layer on one side. Sure wish they would give us something on  the other side of these DVDs--even a modified TV version would be  appreciated and a better comsumer value.  But, on balance, DVD is worth the  price.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it--but don't take it near the beach.
