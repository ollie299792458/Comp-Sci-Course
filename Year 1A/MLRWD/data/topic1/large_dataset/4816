Scream 2 is on a par to its predecessor. Its as scary as part one and dialouge is more witty. The cast members are also eye candies to viewers. Even I was actually quite surprised when I noticed Rebecca Gayheart, Heather Graham, Jada Pinkett and Sarah Michelle Gellar have small roles in the movie.

The story continues as another killing strikes again after the horrific events in part one. All the 3 main characters have grown to a more serious and the writers put a more in depth personality rather than one-dimensional. Sidney (Neve Campbell) have grown more stronger this time. She's no more the "I-Am-Helpless" lady. Gale (Courtney Cox) seems more sensible and less sacarstic to get whatever she wants. Infact, she outgrown herself and her character are more in depth. Same goes for Dewey (David Arquette) no longer the idiotic hobo but a macho man.

Some of the guest roles are interesting too but rather too short. Sarah Michelle Gellar is on example who own her death scene. Its the 2nd best chase sequences in the Scream series and Sarah's 2nd best in all of her horror movies she's in (1st being I Know What You Did Last Summer) (1st being Rose McGowan death scene in Part one and Drew Barrymore's gutted scene). Jada Pinkett smith opening scene was a jaw dropper as well.

This movie is well crafted just like the 1st and the story line doesn't gets confusing for viewers. The writer's just keep it simple and stick to where part 1 left off and also twisting some characters which you didn't expect them to be what they are.

This is one of the most entertaining horror flicks of the year 1998-2000.
Scream series is definitely original, lots of slapsticks and lots of eye candies for viewers to google at and have them playing a guessing game of who lives and who dies.
