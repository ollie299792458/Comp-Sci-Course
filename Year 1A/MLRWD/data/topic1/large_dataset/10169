Knowledge of the anti-consumer and anti-human stance of "tort reform" by its proponents becomes apparent in the documenty--they refused to be interviewed in producing the documentary.
I've bought this documentary and now await its delivery.  I plan to show the documentary to students in my marketing classes--undergraduate and MBA students.  The documentary brings to mind a sentence in Garrison Keilor's Home Grown Democrat (book) about the evil of the Republican national platform.  With the support of big business interests, "tort reform" (really "tort deform" as Ralph Nadar identifies it) is almost impossible to stop.  Too much money is behind the movement to pass "tort reform" laws to stop these campaigns from succeeding--especially when a Republican is in the White House.  G W Bush appears in the documentary delivering a speech on "tort reform" with teenagers and young adults appearing behind him--they reallyl know not what they are doing there.

Tort payments represents very small percentages of profits for the firms found guilty of doing such harm in court cases involving torts.  The documentary deserves a follow-up documentary confirming this point. Juries are making sound judgments.  Hot Coffee is on par with Academy Award Winner, the "Inside Job".
