Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great movie historical movie with excellent sound and video, but crappy sub-titles.  The cool thing about this version is it has both Japanese and Theatrical versions, and I like that it has the small picture book.

My main complaint is the sub-titles on the Japanese version are not always visible.  One would think the film editors at 20th Century Fox could have made sure that the bottom of the sub-titles didn't get cut-off the bottom of the screen!  One can see the top of sentences when the text is long enough to have two lines of text, but the bottom line is cut-off.  On one line of text sub-titles, one can't see any of the text at all.  This is a major problem, because on the Japanese version there are a lot of conversations between Japanese speaking actors, that unless one understands Japanese language he will not be able to understand what the actors are saying.

I watched the only the Japanese version, because I had not seen that one yet, but I sure hope the problem is on the Theatrical version too!
