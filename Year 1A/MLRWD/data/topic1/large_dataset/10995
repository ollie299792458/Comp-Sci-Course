This is the greatest music DVD ever.Slipknot has been one of my favorite bands for a while now and I've been waiting for something to watch besides "Welcome to our neighborhood" The first disk is awesome! It opens with some carnival music and shows shots of the band signing autographs, warming up etc. Then it cuts a shot of the stage. You can hear the introductory (515) playing. The lights are going crazy. Then the screaming of (515) comes to  sudden stop. you see Jim Root play the opening riff to people ...  and it's just chaos. That's an awesome moment. I am the owner of a number of concert DVDs and this is the only one that actually makes you feel like you're there.Slipknot is total chaos live. The thing they do during "Spit it Out" where everyone gets down on the ground then jumps up is crazy. The second disk is also very cool.It has all the bands videos to date(all of which rock). The "Wait and Bleed" animated version is cool. The multi- angle feature is not as great as people make it out to be. You don't really need it all. Overall it's a great buy, and I would reccommend it to any Slipknot fan, or any general metal fan. This is what it's all about!
