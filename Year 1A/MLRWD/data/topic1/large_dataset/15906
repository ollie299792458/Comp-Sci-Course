The protagonist of this story is an ungrateful traitor. The communist party trained him to be a great ballet dancer. They gave his family and the majority of chinese people a decent stardard of living compared to the pre maoist hell on earth society.  Housing, work, universal healthcare, education, political power, cultural enrichment and food. Things they didn't have in pre maoist china. The partie's ballet model works were beautiful moving politically and culturally uplifting works of art. Not robotic party propaganda. They glorified the workers, peasants, women, and soldiers. As opposed to glorifying emperors and concubines. I dare anybody to watch video of THE RED DETACHMENT OF WOMEN and THE WHITE HAIRED GIRL ballets and tell me they are not amazing. The protaganist of this story didn't appreciate none of this. He didn't want artistic freedom, all he wanted was greater financial wealth for himself. He is no hero. His story is disgusting and should be disregarded as capitalist propaganda.
