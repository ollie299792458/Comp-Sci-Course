I had seen this DVD many times while I was in stores.
I was trying so hard to lose weight.
I was taking an aerobics class, pilates, and yoga at the same time, but it seemed that none of that was working, it only made my muscles bulky, which doesn't look well on a female, it's supposed to make you thin.
So I decided to try this out.
I did this for 3 weeks, 5 days a week, and I definetley saw results!!
My thighs got slimmer, my butt got smaller, and my waist, not to mention it showed me ways to move in which I never could have before.
So, not only did I lose weight, see results, but in the process I learned to dance!
In the video Carmen is very comfortable talking to you, you feel like a friend and not just someone she is instructing or bossing around, she is much more personable.
I actually prefer her video to an actual aerobics class.
After trying this I bought DVD's 2, 3, 4, 5, and even the new one " In the bedroom".
I love it!! And my boyfriend loves it too ;)
