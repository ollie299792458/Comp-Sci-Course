Following in the wake of Easy Rider and other movies of the same genre, Billy Jack seeks to leap head first into the turbulence of the early 1970's. It's themes of pacificism, open education, and Native American liberation make it a rather intriguing period piece . And while much of the work is marred by gratuitous violence and melodrama, the plight of disaffected minorities is showcased with a raw, unabashed energy. Like a kick to the head, the movie challenges its audience to consider the chaos of the early 70's and the end of American innocence. The protests and the killing of wild horses are clumsy at times but also deliver a feeling of authenticity--since real life is never choreographed. This was a time when All in the Family and Good Times were daring to make TV audiences feel uneasy. This was a time when TV's Marcus Welby was discussing impotence and sexually transmitted diseases. In short, Billy Jack is a thread in the tapestry of protest that was being felt all over America. Its influence and lasting relevance transcend its weak cinematic acting and direction.  This is not great cinema or quality acting but there is a lot of viscera spilling forth in this film and it shouild be watched with other pieces that capture the disillusionment of the time.
