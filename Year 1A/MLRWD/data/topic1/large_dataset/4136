From all the rave reviews I've read about this movie, I was expecting a lot better.  I was envisioning this wicked vampire hunter wading through legions of lesser vampires to get at the count.  I was expecting a huge body count and rivers of blood.  What I got was D, who was definitely well designed, fighting a bunch of freaky mutants.  What's that all about?  He's a vampire hunter, not a mutant hunter.  You would think that a vampire aristocrat would have vampire bodyguards.
There are other small complaints that I have:  1)  When did the vampire hunter ever introduce himself as D?  I didn't see it, but, all of a sudden, everyone's calling him D.  2)  Why does the little boy call him brother?  I didn't get it.  3)  They didn't explain the world very well...if it wasn't for the blurb on the box, I wouldn't have known that vampires had taken over the world after a war.  4)  Was the dialogue really cheesy as it was written or was it just bad translation for the subtitles?
Finally, the animation seemed very mediocre.  The effects were kind of lame (especially lines representing wind and the close ups of people when they're on their horses...they should be swaying, but it's like they're sitting in a chair in their living room).  After seeing animation in such films as NINJA SCROLL and GHOST IN THE SHELL, I think this movie could have been much better animation-wise.  As a tangent to the production of the movie, I think the music that they selected was pretty inappropriate...it should have been dark and brooding, but it reminded me of music from RANMA 1/2.
Despite its shortcomings, the story was pretty interesting and the characters were all well designed.  I think the telling of the story could have been a lot better and the film as a whole had a lot of weaknesses.  I enjoyed watching it, but not as much as I'd hoped.
