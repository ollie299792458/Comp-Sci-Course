Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film To Catch a Thief is a light, fluffly picture that differs in content over much of the suspense masters other pictures. Cary Grant stars as a former thief, and patriot of the French Resistence, who is currently suspected of a new series of crimes. Grace Kelly plays the beautiful daughter of a rich American woman who is high on the list of possible victims of the new cat burglar.

The plot is all cotten candy. Shot in the French Riviera, Hitchcock allows his camera to take all of the beauty in. There are simply lovely traveling shots of the location. Hitchcock follows cars driving the streets in high crane shots, simmers through the sea on a boat ride, and stops to take in the view with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at a picnic overlooking a stunning valley.

Cary Grant is playing Cary Grant at this point, but that's perfectly fine since their are few actors I enjoy more. Grace Kelly is simply gorgeous. Hitchcocks camera is as admiring as a new suitor. Their interply is fun, witty and sensuous. A famous scene between them intercuts their developing romance with fireworks and is pure sizzle.

If you are looking to write a thesis on the genius of suspense then you should look elsewhere. But for a beautifully shot, light hearted romance for a Saturday night it would be difficult to find a better picture.
