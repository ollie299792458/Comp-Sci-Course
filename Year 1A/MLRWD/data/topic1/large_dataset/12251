If you do a little research, you'll discover that the original screenplay for this movie was called "Nottingham."  It was superbly unique and followed the sheriff as the protagonist (instead of Robin Hood) with tons of period research, original direction, and excellent storytelling.  In fact, the script was so good that everyone wanted it!

The bad news was that Ridley Scott got it.  Now, Ridley Scott is a terrific director but he makes big mistakes (see also the theatrical versions of "Blade Runner" and "Kingdom of Heaven", which aren't a tenth as good as the revamps).  What did Scott do?  He erased everything original from the script and made it just another bland rehashing of the same ol' Robin Hood.

This movie is completely flat and the scene of Marian in armor, charging into battle, is so laughably absurd that I have to believe someone held a gun to Scott's head and forced him to include it.  Scott's desperate attempts to make medieval characters act with 21st century ideals is all the more ridiculous because there's virtually no character development in this film--and I'm speaking of both the theatrical and the unrated versions, which really aren't all that different.

If you're expecting a totally different, much better movie here (like you got with the director's cut of "Kingdom of Heaven"), prepare to be disappointed.  This movie is derivative, unoriginal, and offensively stupid.  I feel very sorry for the writer of the original screenplay!
