Martin Scorsese says it himself in the special features section of Disc 1, there have been other historical films done on the blues, this isn't one of them, at least for the most part.

This film, instead, is a colage of different ideas about the blues, where the director's preferance is the guide. It's more about a snapshot of moments than any kind of real history. While some have argued that the directors spend too much time on "insignificant" bluesfolk and not enough time on popular bluesmen of the time. That's really the director's perogative and overall the collage format works.

There are a couple films that overall are just really, really slow "The Road To Memphis" (Featuring B.B. King) and Clint Eastwood piano bit seems like an odd way to end the series. But, it once again falls into the over all theme of the project, 7 men painting what the Blues is for them.

I would have loved to hear more about Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter, but he was mentioned briefly in the first film. What I got instead was a wider perspective than my own small view on the Blues before hand. And I'm no slouch either. There are plenty of people talking up John Lee Hooker, Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton out there, this series hits other spots, some of which I didn't really know about.

There are some complaints about talking over musical performances. All that is easily mended when you venture into the Special Features and Song Selection options on each disc. Uninterupted footage of the performances within each episode. Maybe it's not the most time efficient way of getting what you want, but seriously.

Ken Burns I think is a bit overrated and other reviewers pleas to him to do a Blues series, will probably never happen. He did Jazz and that's really all he's going to do on music. I'd love to see one the other said films on Blues history, but Blues to me has always been more about feeling than accuracy or chronology.
