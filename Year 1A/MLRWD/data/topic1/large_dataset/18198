GoldenEye is quite simply the best 007 film ever made.  In terms of plot realism, villains and action, it stands out against the rest.  The film sees James Bond take on his former best friend Alec Trevelyn, otherwise known as agent 006, who plans to seek revenge on the world for the loss of his parents through the use of the deadly GoldenEye satellite.  Trevelyn is THE best Bond villain ever, and has not been matched since- he knows Bond back to front, and proves that he is a more than worthy adversary (unlike certain other Bond villains, not mentioning any names).  Some may believe the plot is a little far- fetched, but such satellites do actually exist in the real world.  Other villains such as USSR General Ouromov and Xenia Onatopp provide endless excuses for Bond to blow things up, which of course he does in style, and within numerous locations including St. Petersburg, Russia; Havanna, Cuba; and England (watch out for the scene where Bond drives a fully armed tank through the streets of St. Petersburg!).  This time, the Bond girl is Natalya Simonova, a computer programmer who knows who plans to use the GoldenEye and how to disarm it.  She inevitably falls for Bond's charms.  And as for Pierce Brosnan,  he blows the audience away as he takes on the role for the very first time, and proves that he has the ability to compete with even the likes of Sean Connery himself when playing Commander James Bond.  Again, this is the very best James Bond film to date, even better than the new Die Another Day, which was quite frankly very ordinary.  If you are a 007 fan, look no further than this film- it put the Bond franchise back on its feet, and showed us that after forty-or-so years he still has the ability to keep us shaken and stirred.
