The thing that strikes you when you when you first sit down with this film is, "Elliot Gould as PHILLIP MARLOW??  Didn't Bogey nail that role so well that he owns it?"
Well, he does and he doesn't.  Gould is a brilliant casting-against-type, and Altman admits in the supplemental materials that it was this casting that finally drew him to the film.
Gould's Marlow is subtle, understated, and very casual.  He spends most of the movie giving the impression that nothing gets to him, that he is above all the lunacy that goes on around him.  Yet, in the end we see that his moral foundation runs very deep, and his sense of justice is stronger than his malaise.
Altman's direction is the true star of this film.  As is said in other reviews, this film only works in widescreen.  It's a stylistic triumph, and the camera work is particularly evocative.  Viewing this film today, we might see these unsteady, roaming images as passe, but in 1973 this technique was groundbreaking.  [It disturbed the critics so much that they didn't "get it" (of course, they didn't "get" 2001 either...).]  Yet, Altman's treatment - so new in 1974 - is actually far more mature than most of what passes for modern cinematography today.
It will take you about 15 minutes to make peace with Gould's Marlow, but only one minute to realize you are in the presence of something very special.  This is one of those buried jems waiting for your discovery.
Relish it.
