Vagina with teeth was all I thought I needed to know when I heard about this film. The idea intrigued me.  I wanted to know what a toothed vagina would look like and how it worked. For all I new the thing could have had a mind of its own and be something like the plant from little shop of horrors.  It was nothing like that though.  The teeth where more or less like a defense mechanism for her and you never get to see her vagina ether.  With that out of the way I have to say the movie wasn't a total bust. It was able to keep itself away from being a  feminist movie, or at least as much as a film about a toothed vagina that eats penises can be.  I'm not big on films like hostel and saw that basically just try to gross you out but if you like that kind of thing this is a good film for you.  There where a few points ware every one in the room watching it with me was ether screaming or turning their head.  One of my friends even had to leave because it was just to much for him. All together it was just an ok film.  If your a big cheesy horror buff like myself, you might be better off looking for another flick.
