From what I've seen, the Criterion label is reserved exclusively for groundbreaking and historically incredible films.

"The Rock" isn't one of those (though I heard somewhere that a possible justification that Michael Bay will have a place in movie history years from now).

But it is an entertaining ride of an action flick. It's definetely better than your standard action movie. The car chase scene is one of my favorites and city of San Francisco looks great.

There's no point in rehashing the plot summary. It's given above but I will say a few things about how the studio went about this release.

I have the original release and it's just terrible. In fact, it's worth one star because it's a lousy non anamophic release. It's a got a good DD 5.1 track, but a DTS certainly wouldn't hurt for this. Several films were released like this (especially a few early ones by Touchstone and Hollywood). Two other good action/suspense /thrillers released that way are "Crimson Tide" and "Enemy of the State", both being re-released as 'extended editions' in the next few days.

Looking at it one way, it wasn't a particularly bad idea on the part of the studio at the time. After all, practically no one had a widescreen television at the time (and few still have one now) but it's catching on as more people buy HDTVs.

In the end I'd rather give this a 2 1/2 star rating, but I'll be generous and give it a whole extra star. This film isn't Criterion "worthy", but it's entertaining and the bonus disc has a huge amount of extras. I just wish they released a decent edition of this film by itself with a DTS track and anamorphic transfer for a much cheaper price. I'm not convinced this is worth paying anywhere near what it's asking for unless you either completely love this film (I like it's soundtrack and would buy it if it included that by itself) or don't mind shelling out money for a good but, not extraordinary piece of work.
