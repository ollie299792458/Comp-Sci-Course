I'll admit that only morbid curiosity led me to watch this movie upon it's initial release.  The premise of this remake sounded interesting, but the over the top costs and production problems had been tabloid fodder for months. When it didn't do blockbuster business, not many people were surprised.
It's a shame that this movie didn't do better than mediocre reviews and lukewarm boxoffice receipts. There I sat in the audience marveling at the gorgeous design and antiques, not to mention the exquisite costume design. So many films these days go for established designers, but this movie used a studio designer much like the days of the old Hollywood system. The attention to detail is exquisite.
As for the acting, it all boiled down to one scene for me.  Anthony Hopkins describing the first time he'd ever had a lamb sandwich to Brad Pitt. It turns into one of the most beautiful remembrance speeches of a widower for the wife he still grieves.  Needless to say even this heartless cynic got a bit misty. To have a man express such love without sounding condescending or corny is quite a feat. It's enough to make you believe in the power of a good actor.
Brad Pitt also deserves kudos for this role. Despite living through a personal hell and sustaining an injury, he does a great job in his double role.  I thought the scene in which Death says good bye to Claire Forlani's character was some of his best acting.
