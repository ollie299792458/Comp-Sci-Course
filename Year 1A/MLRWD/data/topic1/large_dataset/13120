When James Clayton (Colin Farrell) is recruited into the CIA by a mysterious agent, Walter Burke (Al Pacino), he is quickly thrust into a world where deceit and manipulation are the only two constants -- a fact that is reinforced constantly at the Agency's training center aka "The Farm".
Clayton proves himself to be an exceptional trainee and catches the attention of his instructors but none moreso than Walter Burke, the head instructor and man with decades of experience in the field.  Clayton is officially pulled from the program but later learns that he has been assigned to deep cover clandestine operations -- the first being to track down a mole within his own training class.
Plucked from training where "everything is a test", Clayton soon finds himself in the shadowy world where everyone is a potential mark and nothing is as it seems -- a world in which the "mark" really depends on whose side you're on.  Spy versus spy versus spy.
Without a doubt, "The Recruit" is not only one of the best films I've seen in awhile, but one of the best spy thrillers I've ever seen.  Both "Spy Game" and "The Bourne Identity" are movies I had great things to say about, but this movie takes it to a new level.  I see a lot of movies, and many of them are great, but this is one of the few movies after which I left the theater feeling like I had just come off one of the best rides in the world.
