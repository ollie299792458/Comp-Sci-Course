"Harlan County USA" is an excellent, compelling documentary. Depicting a strike by coal miners in West Virginia in the early 70s, the film gives a snapshot of arguably the last years of the "organized labor era" that began in the 30s. We see how the miners' families lived- they were very poor even by the standards at the time; mothers give their children baths in tin tubs, for example. Despite the poverty and hardship, the community sticks together, and eventually wins.

Particularly interesting was how larger social changes are reflected in the strike. For example, black miners are welcome and included in the miners' community. In addition, the miners' wives play a very big role in organizing and generating support for the strike. At one point, some of them directly confront the sheriff about the picket line- women would probably not have done that, especially in West Virginia, 20 years earlier. Further, it will probably surprise a lot of people to know that there was a grassroots labor movement in the south, but there was. How "union" became a dirty word in dixie even for those who would benefit from one is a complicated subject outside the scope of the movie.

Throughout, we hear the inspired folk labor songs of the great Hazel Dickens. It's almost worth the movie just to hear her sing. Dickens herself is a daughter of a coal-mining family, and is very familiar with labor struggles.

In sum, watch this if you want a real-life depiction of a unique American time and place.
