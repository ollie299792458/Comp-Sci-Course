With all the junk Hollywood churns out nowadays you always know that anything from Charlie Kaufman will be a thought provoking and refreshing experience.

**SLIGHT SPOILERS**

This movie is about what would happen if you could erase the memories you had of whatever worried or depressed you.  It's an interesting premise and one that many would jump at the chance to do.  I, however, would not want to have the procedure done because I feel your past experiences are what make you a stronger person.

Joel (Jim Carrey) meets and falls in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet) and it's an incredible relationship.  I found myself noticing things that only people truly in love do.  But, it does go sour and things end badly.  One person chooses to have their memories erased of the other and the other person chooses to do it as well (out of spite?) but regrets it during the procedure.  I won't get that far into the plot, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the ending is well worthwhile and meaningful.

Another great part of the DVD are the deleted scenes.  I was really moved by one in particular and I felt it should have been included...

Supporting cast is great, especially Kirsten Dunst.  She's so emotionally needy in the film and she plays it very well.  Elijah Wood is good in a mostly negative and backhanded role.  It's good to finally see him play something other than a Hobbit. As for Mark Ruffalo, he's a great actor but I wasn't really impressed by him in this flick.

I can't wait to see what Oscars this gets nominated for.  Be on the lookout for Jim Carrey to receive a best actor nod.  This is probably his best dramatic work yet!
