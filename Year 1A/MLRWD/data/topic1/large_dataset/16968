I am not a mathematician. However, I can usually see how things work, the schematics, the overall structure of something. Looking for the structure of a thing,the theory, the pattern, is something that fascinates me. It is part of the work I do. This film is therefore very appealing to me. No, a better word is compelling. The young man in this film is searching for a (or THE)pattern, the structure of random numbers, the web inherent in Chaos theory. Other, more selfish people in the film try to use the protagonist, but those people are also searching. The Hasidic man is searching for the structure of the Deity, the numeric key to the name of G-d. The stock broker is searching for the overall numeric pattern of the Market. All seek an explanation, born out of Wonder. So, I can't bring myself to dislike any of the people in the film who are searching for the Answer, the Structure. All of us, to a greater or lesser degree, are searching for answers, the why of things. The search for the why or how of things is what enobles men and women. As a Buddhist, I should say "the path is the Goal," but that is too pat an answer, even if it is correct. This film is a wonderful examination of our shared obsession of Seeking. It explores both the depth of mind and the limitation of Mind. It is as engrossing and compelling a film as any I've ever seen. I recommend it. It deserves (and requiries) more than one viewing.
