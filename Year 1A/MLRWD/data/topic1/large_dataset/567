The focus of this brief window into the lives of Lola and Manni was not the situation that they found themselves in, but how the effect of each instant of our existance can impact the rest of our lives. Through  miniscule changes in timing, we witnessed a domino effect that ended each  vignette drastically different.  Have you ever narrowly missed being in a  car crash? What if you had dropped your keys getting into the car, adding  several seconds that would eventually cause your course to parallel  anothers and converge in an auto accident. In the film, we see snap shots  of others lives as Lola runs past, the kid on the bike crashes, meets a  nurse, they marry, they live happily ever after.  Another vignettte, he  doesn't crash, and winds up a junkie.  In my humble opinion this is the  best movie I have ever seen that was able to illustrate how each day our  smallest deterances and decisions and those of others, can re-route the  course of things and ultimately change the course of our lives.
