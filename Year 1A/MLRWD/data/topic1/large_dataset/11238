For years, this has been one of my favorite films, and it has aged remarkably well in its 50 years. However, the picture and sound quality had not fared well over the years. This restoration makes the film look better than it has ever, ever looked. It looks like it was shot yesterday. Even the subtlest of hue differences stand out. For example, two men, standing next to each other in one scene, both have dark suits. Previously they both looked like black suits, but now I can see that one was a charcoal/black suit while the other was a very dark navy suit. It's incredible. Even the sound has received great improvement. Although most of the sound tends to come from your center speaker, there is now true surround sound, and I have noticed some very well done spatial balancing in my home theater -- remarkable considering when the original audio track was laid down and what technology they were using at the time.

In short, if you like this movie, buy it and prepare to be awed by the restored picture and drastically improved sound!
