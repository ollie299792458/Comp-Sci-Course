I thought this film was a wonderful introduction to an exceptional man.  After see the film I felt inclined to look this figure up in order to know more about him and his most interesting yet troubled life.  
What after all makes Marquis mind work the way it does?  On one had he writes like a madman about appalling acts that would make even the devil himself shutter; he then suprises us with a twist of philosophical genius that applies to reason and shows us that he has the sort of insight into human nature that tends to disturb us.  Is he truly a madman who intrigues us?  or is he a persecuted genius?  of course we will never know.  
The Marquis at the very least makes us think and examine ourselves and what's in our "particular" nature. We all have some fantasies that might not be deemed as normal, but we of course don't have the courage to "amuse" them as he did for fear of being shunned or even condemend by society.  
In conclusion whether you hate him or love him the Marquis de Sade is not a character that can be easily dismissed or forgotten.
