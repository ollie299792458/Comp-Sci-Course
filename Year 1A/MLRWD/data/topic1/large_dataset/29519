I thought the "Back to Future" twist given to the coming of age story line of this movie is very promising.  Here are my ratings of the movie:

Story Line - 4/5
Interesting supernatural premise and the interwoven lives of all the characters are very well done.  I just wish the ending is more defined or they will come up with volume 2 because I really want to know how the futures have changed for the characters

Casting - 5/5
All the actors are well chosen for their parts. Not only are they beautiful but are they simply unforgetable. I must confess I have rewinded & watch my favourite romantic parts (the kisses among the boys) often!

Acting - 5/5
There is substance behind all those pretty faces. Both main & supporting actors seemed to breathe & live their part so effortlessly. I adore the delicious sexual tension and bittersweet atmosphere as the character Daniel is paired with Zach (his future self), Chris & Shane.

Soundtrack - 5/5
The music and songs chosen really enhanced the atmosphere in this movie. I bought them from AMZN & listened to them over & over again during my long daily commute.  Each time I hear "Crash" or "If I Fall", they conjured up images of my favourite scenes from the movie.

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to any yaoi fan out there.  It every single indie or major gay romantic movie can be this visually beautiful, it may make me give up my yaoi manga collections!
