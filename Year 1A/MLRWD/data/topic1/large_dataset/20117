I Don't Yet Have The Sufficient Blu-Ray Viewing Experience Or Knowledge,That Previous Reviewers Of THIS Particular Blu-Ray Obviously Have.

But As HARD As I Tried, I Simply Couldn't See ANY Difference In This Blu-Ray Transfer Of A TRULY Great (& Smart!!), Suspense Movie.

Seeing Scratches Right At The Very Beginning With The Warners Logo, Certainly Didn't Help. And The Less Said About The VERY Ridiculous "Phone Call" Featurette Between Director Davis & Tommy Lee Jones (Interspersed With A Clip Of A Grouchy-Acting Harrison Ford), The Better!!

I Can See Why, This Blu-Ray Has Been Marked Down;But Won't Go Too Far In My Critique Here, Considering It Is A SURE Bet That Warners Is Probably Prepping A 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray With ALL The Trimmings, For 2013!!

My Only Hope Is, That They'll FINALLY Decide Whether To Keep In, Or Remove, The Extra Who Pops His Head In At The End Of The Train-Wreck Scene (Kept It IN, Here)!!
