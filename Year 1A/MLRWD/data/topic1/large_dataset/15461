In the Mouth of Madness was one of our favorite movies to watch in college. Never had I seen so many guys in their 20s tremble like babies in the same room (not including finals week). I watched this with my brother who jumped three or four times, insisted he thought it wasn't that scary, and forced us to immediately watch Deuce Bigalow after the movie was over. 
This is probably Carpenter's scariest movie since The Thing. It's a great tribute to the work of H.P. Lovecraft (as many reviewers have already pointed out), and Carpenter seems to have a ball playing with Lovecraft's sense of nightmarish reality (or rather unreality?). What's real, and what isn't? What's fact, and what's fiction? These are the themes that Carpenter hits upon, but to be honest, I didn't feel that they were fully addressed. 
But the movie's more about chills and thrills than anything else, and Carpenter has some great moments in the film: a creepy old man on a bicycle, a painting on the wall that seems to change appearance, the sweet old lady who runs the hotel... actually, she's not that scary... (gulp!)
Sam Neil puts in a good performance. He's not all that sympathetic, but I don't think he's supposed to be (at least, not at first). He goes through most of the movie insisting "this isn't real!" and while that gets to be tiring after a while, I realize that anyone who went through the kind of insane voodoo that this character goes through... well, they would probably be in a state of denial as well.
One problem: Carpenter has said that he felt the first cut of this film ran flat. There are several montages in the film, where Carpenter uses bits and pieces of scenes from the film over-and-over again. I can't help but wonder if these montages are what he used to spice up the film. I found them distracting, and I didn't like it.
Overall, a great creepy movie. Carpenter fans, Lovecraft fans, and fans of good horror will probably approve. The DVD also includes a Carpenter commentary track.
