Could not resist adding my praise for such a superior motion picture.  Set in a violent, unstable time of frequent wars and unrelenting political machinations, "The Lion In Winter" captures a vivid 12th Century  reality.  A story set in the latter part of the reign of England's Henry II  (Peter O'Toole), it explores the convoluted dynamics of royal family  politics and medieval intrigue.  Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn),  Henry's Queen, is  released from her confinement in an English castle to  join Henry at the Christmas court in France (at this time, Henry ruled  large parts of modern France as well as England).  Eleanor was confined due  to her support of Henry's sons in their uprising against him.  Henry does  not want a reoccurence.  Their sons included Richard, the Lion-Hearted  (Anthony Hopkins) and the Magna Carta's King John, who are also at the  Christmas court.  A truly amazing cast of characters are propelled by  magnificent performances and just about the best written dialogue ever put  on film.  Miss Hepburn's Eleanor won her an Academy Award for best actress.  A terrific accompaniment to the movie is Alison Weir's recent book  "Eleanor Of Aquitaine".  Eleanor was the wife of two kings, the  mother of three kings, the great-grandmother of two saints and lived  through two Crusades.  A fascinating woman, she lived into her 80s,  outliving eight of her ten children.  Henry succeeded in building and  holding together an empire that stretched from Scotland to the south of  France.
