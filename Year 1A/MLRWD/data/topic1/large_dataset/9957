This movie first of all was directed by Stanely Kubrick, who in my opinion is the best director of all time.  This movie begins where other movies never begin... Training camp, in this case Parris Island.  The drill sergeant, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is by far the most "inspirational" speaker I've ever seen.  His wasy of demoralizing troops is unsurpassed.  Heres a small excercept from the movie. Seargent "Where are you from Private?"Private "Texas Sir!" Seargent "Holy dog**** only steers and queers come from Texas and you don't look too much like a steer so I guess that narrows it down a bit!" As you can see the language and themes used in this movie are so entertaining that you will probably fall out of your seat laughing.  The movie shows the horrors of war and such and Gustav Hasford a man who knows quite a bit about war reveals an unseen side of Vietnam.  Soldiers that enjoyed it, soldiers who called it great times and such.  I felt this movie deserved to be worshipped it was a masterpiece...
