I had to be convinced by my sister to watch this movie because I'm hard to persuade when I am not too familiar with the actors/actresses. But my sister has a keen eye and once again was right on target with the "greatness" of this film.

 Hugh Dancy is the epitome of the kind of guy that you want to find but cannot because they just don't exist in reality. He actually notices someone that is in need and affectively helps those needy individuals because he believes that people are inherently good. He does this without agenda or discrimination. He is no respector of persons, but he knows a foul character when he sees one.

 He has a terrific scene with his guardian who reveals to him the truth about his mother and the fact that he (his guardian) is not his father. Daniel Deronda's (Hugh Dancy) reaction to this news is priceless. You see his hurt merely through facial expressions and body language. Likewise when his mother reveals to him about her past and her heritage he reacts with such maturity and sensibiity.

 The actress that plays Gwendolyn does a great job as well especially for her age. You genuinely feel sorry for her despite her previous selfishness.

 The music in this film is something else, that being a good thing. I think that the music really helps you feel the mood of specific scenes. The music will stick with you.

 Though I love this movie, I know that there are many people including myself that are disconcerted about how things end up between Gwendolyn and Daniel. I'm sure that the book makes it a more settling ending. But as a whole this is a must see and once you gals catch a glance of Hugh Dancy, you will not regret ever venturing.
