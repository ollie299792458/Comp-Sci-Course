The bonus disk of  interviews, auto biographical features and deleted scenes  (complete with (ir)rationale for editing) really is worth the price; even if you already own a fuzzy copy of this Schlock classic. The video quality on the blu-ray is stunning, the sharpness,color saturation, and musical score remastering are unbelievable! Particularly when you consider the  original editing job. Among the thorough entertaining extras, Carolyn Monroe  dishes on her career, and the many scenes they shot . And we get to see these scenes that never made the choppy final edit. Is it the over editing that delivers this fun romp into contention with Planet Nine from Outer Space for best worst sci fi ever? Is this storyboard hodgepodge in dire need of a new directors cut?  It's like a glitzy comic book with half the pages missing. Oh well, it certainly  doesnt seem to bother Marjo, Stella or any of the stellar cast.  The beautiful music score  contrasted  to the horrendous voice-overs, has to be  heard to be believed. Somehow the flaws are overwhelmed by the great costumes and space battles galore, in this ridiculous joyride.  It aint Star Wars,its Star Crash and its a sight to behold on blu-ray!
