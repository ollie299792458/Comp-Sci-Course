Regardless of how you rate the feature itself, this so called 'directors cut' is a complete waste of cash! I was excited to hear about this 'new' version of Elektra and so ordered it straight away. But unlike the Daredevil directors cut, that added new scenes, and effects and plot re-workings, all you get is Elektra pretty much the way you saw it in the cinema..there are only blink and you miss it changes that are so subtle it begs the question as why they bothered releasing this in the first place. Although that question seems to be answered in two very lengthy making of features where the self gratuitous Director treats us to his insight, and lots of screen time of him sitting in his editing suite looking bored, talking about the x-files, leaching over Jennifer Garner, telling us how he got all his friends jobs on the film etc...and you cant help wondering if he hadn't been so proud of NOT audience test screening this film, how it may have benefited from fans insight and critique.......save your money there is nothing new or worth note here....if you haven't bought the film yet buy the regular UK version..it has all the extras you need, without the waffle!(this review is for the directors cut dvd)
