I don't understand why everyone is giving this movie such high reviews?! This "Winnie the Pooh" movie isn't like ANY of the others Disney has created in the past. I will agree that the plot and story of the movie are fine. However, the characters aren't anything like the original characters. Rabbit is animated and, quite literally, acts like a "Looney Tunes" character with over exaggerated and unnatural facial expressions. Kanga and Roo have pointy ears...when they have always had round ears. And Kanga is super animated in personality when she is usually a calm character in the movies. And Christopher Robin looks nothing like any other previous movie either.

The movie seems to be written to over entertain kids with goofy jokes and being super silly, just like all of the other movies being made now. "Winnie the Pooh" movies have always strayed away from that, being calmer than regular kids' movies and relying on the characters to be funny themselves. This movie was trying way too hard to fit in with the general genre, and lost everything the series is known for in the process.
