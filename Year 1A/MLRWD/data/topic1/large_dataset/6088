Who can not remember Steve Irwin, who died doing what he loved, sometimes risking himself in possibly reckless ways. Granted, Irwin was more grounded in reality, and his death really is more closely deemed 'accident', but the sheer joy is what's the same. Treadwell is not a statement as people make him out to be, so much as he his the embodiment of childlike play, where your parents were counted on to protect you. Here, with no parents around, his fantasy that he is on equal footing with these animals is a clearly risky one.

Some of his genius was the ability to assimilate, and communicate on a fundamental level with these animals, in terms of space, and personal boundaries, and yes respect. He demonstrates the principle of Requisite Variety - his ability to vary his responses (tone of voice, gestures) beyond the range of those the bear could express, as a way to control the system of him+bear. He had tremendous empathy - he understood what would be and not be a threat, what would be and not be a challenge. He danced the bears.

We all could learn to empathize, be bold, and break the rules like Treadwell. Do it smarter, if you think you can.. But the only guarantee is that we are all going out somehow - how will you ?
