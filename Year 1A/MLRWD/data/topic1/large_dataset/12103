As many of you probably know, this movie was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. That was the top reason why I went to see this movie, anyway...but it also has so much more humor than I exspected. The basic story line is a twin girl dresses up like her brother. Much confusion and hilarity ensues as a result, of course. Yet the story is also widened with the beginning relationship and soccer dream of Viola. Then you have Duke Orsino (yes, Duke is his name, not his title) as the best soccer player that can't talk to girls. And you guessed it, they room together. The whole girl dressing up as a boy theme in modern society is the catalyst for some realllllly funny complications such as community showers and kissing booths. I highly recommend this movie both for the humor (I was laughing during 3/5 of the time) and the Twelfth Night references such as the Illyria school and Cesario Pizza and the quote about greatness (Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them). They even have a tyrantula named Malvolio. Funny and educational...sort of. Anyway, it's great stuff. Go see it. Now.
