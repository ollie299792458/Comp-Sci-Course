I bought this movie after the disappointment of watching Payback Straight Up: The Director's Cut.  Now, seeing the words "director's cut" one is generally inclined to believe there are added in deleted scenes and maybe a slightly tweaked story line from what was shown in theaters.  Not so.  It turns out that the "director's cut" was the original version of the movie.  The original was dark, evil, and maliciously violent.  My biggest disappointment was that Porter(the protagonist) didn't die in it, I hated him so much.  The studio agreed, so much so they completely changed the tone of the film, creating a stupendous movie. The studio cut contained the "missing scenes" and revamped story line.  Yes, the studio had to reshoot the ending.  Yes, they had to add in characters.  Yes, they had to change dialogue and modify scenes.  But it was well worth it.  The movie maintained it's action heritage, and became light hearted.  Dare I say fun.  This version is one of the best revenge action movies of all time.
