Both the video and audio of this Disney classic have been well restored in this Diamond Edition release.  Contrary to what another reviewer here has written, the colors, IMO, have not been made overly vivid.  This restoration retains the look of classic cel animation yet has been refreshed to look how I imagine it must have appeared when this film debuted in 1937.  After all, Disney would know better than anyone what the original colors would have looked like and applied that knowledge in the restoration process.  In addition, the audio has also been well restored and sounds remarkably good for a film that is over 70 years old.  I did not watch the included DVD version of the feature in its entirety, but I forwarded through it enough to tell that it looks very good, too.  If you have yet to buy a Blu-ray player but want to future-proof your purchase, you can enjoy the DVD version now and the Blu-ray version later when you have a Blu-ray player.

The bonus feature I enjoyed most was two scenes that had been cut from the original release for pacing reasons.  One is a soup-eating scene where the dwarves eat soup Snow White made for them while they sing a song.  The other is a bed-making scene where the dwarves make a bed for Snow White as a gift.  Fortunately, the dialogue, sound and music tracks were recorded at the time, so you can watch the scenes with the audio that would have been used had the scenes been included.  Unfortunately, the animation never got to the coloring phase, so the animation is just pen and ink (and in a few spots there are only static, non-animated sketches).  While I understand why these scenes were cut, they are still enjoyable to watch as extras and provide a fun look at what might have been.

If you're a fan of this Disney film, you'll enjoy watching it in its restored state on this Diamond Edition release.
