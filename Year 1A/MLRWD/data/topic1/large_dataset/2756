This movie tells the story of students who gain admission to a prestigious institute of Engineering. The competition is tough, the pressures are tremendous, and the Head of the Institute is relentless in ensuring that "this place practices survival of the fittest". However, there is a skeleton in the Head's closet too.

The Head is exasperated by the 3 protagonists and terms them "3 idiots". However, the "spoilsport" is Amir Khan (Ranchod), whose "fundas" are clear and who can grasp and assimilate more by being relaxed and by laughing it over.

Their super competitive classmate Chatur provides great hilarity and fills up a very important part of the mosaic. He challenges the 3 idiots that he will "go far" in his life, and sneers "where will you be then"?

The story is deep and has many twists and turns and layers. Rachod vanishes after graduating, and this puzzles his 2 friends no end. A further story unfolds then. The 2 friends learn to follow their passion, one of which is wildlife photography. The story is rich with several climaxes, big and small! There are songs which have become very popular.

Boman Irani, the Head, is very effective as the snarling, arrogant academic. Aamir Khan beats everyone hands-down with his great acting. We don't expect less from him, though! Good support has been provided by Kareena Kapoor. Javed Jaffrey, awesomely talented, delivers a small but memorable performance as the "benami" Ranchod.

Nobody can miss this movie! It has excitement and action and surprise at every turn! It is a collection item!
