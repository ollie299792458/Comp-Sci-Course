I have only seen this movie once, and I only wish to see it once.  It is a terrific, terrific movie--one of the most unflinching and riviting movies I have ever seen.  But it is a very difficult movie to watch.  Once is enough; I feel as though I have been run through a ringer.
Three small things bother me: First, Stanley Kramer's directing is often times stunning, startlingly so.  But in a few very prominent cases it is distracting, especially during the 360 degree courtroom shots.  Second, the script has an annoying habit of tying scenes together with visual puns.  For instance, there is a scene in which Marlene Dietrich begins to pour a cup of coffee which quickly cuts to another scene where a fellow finishes pouring his cup of coffee.  I find this habit odd and unnecessary.  This is a serious work of art--and a highly successful work of art.  It does not benefit much at all from such pointless cleverness: the subject matter does not call for bludgening the viewer with visual puns.  Third, I cannot stand William Shatner's performance.  It is hollow and unconvincing.  This is a small matter, however, in light of the rest of the movie.
Aside from these really quite small objections--annoyances, really--I found the movie to be practically irreproachable.  It is a film everyone ought to see: an amazing achievement as an artwork and also as a document.  It handles the complexities of these trials, and the confused emotional atmosphere that went with them, to incredible vicarious affect.  I recommend this movie without significant reservation to absolutely anyone--we all must consider the questions that this movie raises if we are ever really to move beyond the twentieth century.
