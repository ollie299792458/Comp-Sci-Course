I don't understand the reactions many people---audiences and critics alike---had to this movie. It was made in black and white and set during the war, so therefore it either had to be as good as "Casablanca" or "The Third Man," or it was a piece of junk. I don't follow this logic at all. Was every film-noir movie made in 1945 a five-star masterpiece? I don't think so.

This is a really good movie! In fact I'd put it up there with the director's best work. And not just in terms of craft, which is first-rate, but in terms of the whole package. The acting is excellent, the dialogue crisp and perfect, the pace and structure of the film, everything.

The point is, they tried to do it in this movie like they'd have done it back then, and they did a wonderful job. This movie is a great piece of cinematic storytelling, if it had been released in 1945 it would have been a hit and we'd remember it as a great or near-great film. We wouldn't tear it apart by the seams like people do today. Long story short, see this movie not because it resembles the film noirs of Ye Olde Hollywoode....see it because IT'S A GOOD MOVIE.

My only problem with it is, no extras? Was Soderbergh so incensed by the hostile critical reception to the movie that he refused to put together a commentary and a documentary detailing the making of the movie? Speaking as a fan, I'd like to see what he (and the cast and crew) has to say.
