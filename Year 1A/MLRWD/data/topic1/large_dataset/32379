I first saw the movie Capt Horatio Hornblower in the theater.  My father, who read the serialized version of the Hornblower in the Saturday Evening Post took us to the movie.
I began reading the book not long after seeing the movie and the mental picture of Peck as Hornblower was dominate im my mind.
I have read the series many time since those days.  The depiction of Hornblower I believe to be the definitive portrayal.
The movie itself may seem a bit stiff and formal to today's movie goers, but it was within the traditions of the high budget historical movie of the time.  While - after reading the books - I wished that the movie had more action, but as i grew older I understood.
As for the screenplay - who better to write it that C.S. Forester himself.
One detail I noticed in the DVD I overlooked in the theater, the patches and threadbare nature of Hornblower's clothes he wore "everyday" The change to full dress was noticeable - a type detail not normally seen in movies of the era
If you like the Ioan Gruffudd version of Hornblower, I think owe it to yourself to look at the original. (and maybe read the books) It is my belief that Gruffudd was highly influenced by Peck.
