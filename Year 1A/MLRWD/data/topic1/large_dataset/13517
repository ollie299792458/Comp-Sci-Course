I'm still talking about this movie 5 months after I saw it, I've only seen it once but have been tempted to see it over and over whenever I go to the movies. I saw Amores Perros (Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&Ntilde;&aacute;rritu)  when it first came out and I just thought it was a perfect film, it had this rough edge that seemed to just create the same affect to the audience and as soon as I heard that (Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&Ntilde;&aacute;rritu) was coming out with a new film I was just already on top of it. Then the actors (Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts) came into view and I was just extatic I knew it was something to watch. The film hit's you from the minute it starts to the moment it finishes. I caught the last show when I went and took some friends with me - they (seriously) had to throw us out because we couldn't find the feeling to get up from our seats, it left us numb and truely speechless. It's such a beautiful and powerful story with all the meaning it needs. I've recommended it to so many and have all come back with positive reviews and sleepless nights. It's deep and I know some people can't handle deep storytelling but it's a must see for anyone looking to be affected. So I recommend see it and if you like, recommend to everyone. I applaud the director and writer once again for a beautiful job well done. It's such a heavy and undescribable concept and when you finally reach to it it's incredible beacuse it's light as a feather but you don't want to let go (if it makes sense). Anyway bottom line I've never been affected this hard by a film, that tells you something.
