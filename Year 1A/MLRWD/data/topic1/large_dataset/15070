"Kill the Irishman" is a gripping film based on the true story of Danny Greene, a tough, intelligent, proud Irish thug who took on the Mafia.  Danny Greene's activities eventually brought down the old-time Mafia nationwide.  Danny Greene, a dockworker, brilliantly portrayed by Ray Stevenson, violently took over the longshoreman's union in Cleveland and became ensnared in a power struggle with the Italian mob. He is legendary because he survived four horrific attempts to kill him during the 1970s.  The film uses actual news footage from the era reporting on those gang wars. The acting is stunning, authentic and the cast includes one of my favorite actors, Vincent D'Onofrio, star of the erstwhile "Law and Order Criminal Intent" series.  In addition to D'Onfrio, the stellar cast features Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Linda Cardellini, Robert Davi , Tony Darrow, , Vinnie Jones, Tony Lo Bianco, Laura Ramsey, Steve Schirripa, Paul Sorvino, Jason Butler Harner, Bob Gunton, and the stunning Fionnula Flanagan as Greene's tough talking no-nonsense neighbor.
