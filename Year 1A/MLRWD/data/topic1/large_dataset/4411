I bought Bride of Chucky because I am a Chucky fan and a Katherine Heigl fan. If you don't know anything about the series, Bride of Chucky is the most recent of the Child's Play films starring a disturbing-looking doll named Chucky who has been possessed by the spirit of a serial killer.

Bride of Chucky is obviously not going to win any Academy Awards, but it does have some surprisingly good production, even though the script leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not going to write a synopsis of the movie because, if you are familiar with the Child's Play movies, then you've probably already seen it. And if you're not familiar with them, my scintillating recap won't do the film justice. Let me put it this way: possessed rubber dolls, plenty of gory violence, and the sublime Miss Heigl in all her Panavision glory.

The reason I titled this Who Knew is because I doubt anyone knew at the time this film was made that Alexis Arquette would eventually go full-on transvestite, or that Katherine Heigl would eventually star in one of the biggest shows on prime time television. I for one had a hunch she was destined for greatness, but I'm a sucker for beautiful women. One last Who Knew: who knew Jennifer Tilly would eventually become a professional poker player and win the WPT Ladies' Championship? Maybe she did...
