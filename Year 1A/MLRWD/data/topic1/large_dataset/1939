"The Whole Nine Yards" was different than the trailers suggest, in my opinion.  Sure it was about a hitman moving next door to a dentist,  but the storyline is very different from what you may think.  Bruce Willis,  being my favorite actor, I naturally checked this one out.  Matthew Perry  does a great job playing an on-the-edge dentist in a dysfunctional  marriage.  Bruce Willis plays Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a former  professional hitman who moves in next door to Matthew Perry.  Matthew Perry  almost instantly recognizes him and starts to get a little paranoid.  Performances by Amanda Peet &amp; Natasha Henstridge also make this a  must-see.  Amanda Peet gives a semi-funny performance as Matthew Perry's  receptionist who is more than meets the eye.  I liked the movie but I  didn't find it incredibly funny, as it was marketed as a comedy.  If you  laugh easily as semi-funny jokes then you'll love this movie.  If you just  wanna see a great movie with an all-star cast, you'll love this movie.
