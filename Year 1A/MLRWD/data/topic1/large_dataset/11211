Cameron had to cut an additional twenty minutes from the finished film due to his "final cut" contract with Fox. The result made a film that had interesting characters and moral complexity considerably weaker and  less interesting.
With the footage added to the VHS edition (it is  similiar to the laserdisc edition issued a  couple of years back), the film  actually becomes a richer, more consistent and rewarding experience. The  additonal footage adds clarity to the plot and also makes the characters  more interesting. 
The plot becomes a little predictable and run of the  mill by the end, but it doesn't make this flawed classic any less  compelling...just a little disappointing in the end. Although Cameron tends  to create films that run on a little too long, usually its justified by the  action and additional shadings added to the characters.
Although shot on  Super 70 (one of the first films to use this format to its advantage)so  that the cropped version doesn't suffer as much from the grain problems of  most video transfers, the wide screen version adds to the epic elements  that make this such a watchable film.
Highly recommended.
