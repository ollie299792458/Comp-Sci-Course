Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best gangster movies that i have seen in my lifetime. It has a amazing cast with performances from Tom Hanks who plays Mike Sullivan, the father and mian character of the story, Paul Newman as John Rooney, Jude Law, and a single performance by Tyler Hoechlin. What makes this film stand out is the cinematography by Conrad L. Hall who won an Oscar for his work. The world of the 1930's mob citys and country sides takes your breath away as you get immersed in this world of violence, betrayal, and a bond between father and son. The story revolves around Mike Sullivan and his son witnessing a murder that he commensed. What follows is betrayal, death, and a great ending to an excellent peice of work. The Blu-ray version is exceptionally well, showing off all the little details from seeing every rain drop in the gun shootout, to little textures that a dvd could never display. If you are debating weather to buy this movie or not, I reccomend buying it. It's an excellent movie, stellar cast, and dark story will keep you watching til the end.
