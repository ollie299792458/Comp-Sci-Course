In 1987, a new James Bond was introduced in the guise of accomplished Shakespearean actor Timothy Dalton, following fifteen years of the popular Roger Moore. The vacant part of the ever-smooth superspy had originally  been offered to the present Bond, Pierce Brosnan, but he could not free  himself from his television contract at the time. 
Dalton's arrival was  greeted with mixed reviews. Accusations of over-seriousness and dullness  may be open to debate, but one point is certain - Dalton injected an  element of danger into a character which had become predictable and stupid.  After years of the pantomine of Roger Moore, Bond had become a cold  assassin once again.
The complex plot involves Bond assisting the  defection of prominent KGB officer General Georgi Koskov (Jereon Krabbe),  but he is kidnapped by an arms group. Bond who believes that Koskov's  original defection was just an act, seeks out Koskov's girlfriend Kara  Milovy (Maryam D'Abo) to retrieve more information.
The performances are  excellent especially from Dalton, D'Abo and Andreas Wisniewski (as the  killer Necros). Although the movie does not run smoothly from scene to  scene, it is full of good moments and has a 'Lawrence of Arabia' feel to  it. All this and the great action sequences make this movie the best Bond  flick for seventeen years.
