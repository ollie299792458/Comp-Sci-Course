This is hands down one of the worst films I have ever seen. I used to be an Adam Sandler fan, but when he keeps pushing out garbage like this .... I have to seriously question my previous judgement. I loved some of his previous work, but this one was just way too much for me to take. I watched this with a large group of people, and we all agreed that this film just had to go. We made it to just under 40 minutes, so we gave it a chance.

I cannot stress enough as to how annoying this film got in just those 40 minutes. The voice of Whitey (Sandler) was like somebody taking a fork and raking it across a chalkboard, pure pain. The humor was few (and I mean very few) and far between. The deer licking poop from a frozen Whitey and a trouble making lead role (also Sandler) were the highlights, and they just weren't funny but were billed as some of the biggest laughs of the film? Sorry folks I just didn't see it, nobody did. I was severly disappointed.

In summary, skip this one and go buy/watch the Water Boy, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, or something else. Even that piece of junk Little Nicky was a ton better than this garbage.
