The only reason a person would have to watch this movie is to waste time. Which is exactly what I did. I decided to set aside a day because I wanted to watch some movies. The local library was my best bet so I picked up this and three others. This was the worst right next to Cabin Fever.

Well, getting into the meat of the movie, if there is any. Let us take a look at the corny plot, which consists of a young boy and a young girl being in love since childhood. The boy was hauled off for the murder of his mother, which, if you didn't see this coming, he didn't commit. Flash-forward to the "present time" and presto, her younger brother seems to have the same crap as he had when he was younger, night terrors. Well somehow she gets a hold of her middle school crush who, mind you, lives in an apartment that is full of lights, I mean there are no shadows here baby. Well to make this review shorter, they go after a cheesy looking puppet. **SPOILER** (If you really care). Well, you may have been able to guess this one, the two end up killing the thing in the end and get back together. Yay...Right.  
The one good effect this movie did have was the flashbacks or flashes of the "Toothfairy". Another good point was the background story in the beginning, I actually thought this had potential when that began.

One minor fault is where the hell are the boys parents. Not once do we see them, and I imagine any parent who child is seeing ugly women in the dark would be right by their side. 
Can I mention another great part in this movie, the song that plays during the ending credits.
All in all this film will not cause you to have a sleepless night, unless your one that has just lost your last tooth...
And remember don't peek...
