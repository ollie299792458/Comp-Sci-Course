I've owned a version of this movie for many years, beginning with the purchase of a VHS copy from the University of Washington in Seattle sometime in the 70s. But as I progressed to DVD versions, it wasn't until I got a colorized copy that some scenes made sense. For instance, the scene where Tiny Tim is looking through the front window of a toy shop -- there had always been toys I could make neither head nor tail of. Another was the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Past transported Scrooge into the snow covered fields of his youth. In that scene both Scrooge and the ghost were filmed to appear transparent and, so, were difficult to make out in black and white.
So the colorized version was a big improvement in so far as the ability to quickly identify the objects in each scene. Has this much improved black and white version eliminated the problem? It's difficult to say since I already know what the objects are. Do I believe the artistic intent of a movie is ruined by colorizing? No, that choice may have been dictated by the money available to make the film.
I have many older movies in black and white, which I have no desire to see in color. But in this case, I believe it adds to the movie -- it's not a horror film best seen in black and white only.
