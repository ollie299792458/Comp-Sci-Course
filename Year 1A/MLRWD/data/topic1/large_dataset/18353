Possibly Arnold's best movie since... well, T2, T3 is perhaps weighed down by the extraordinary levels of excellence established by it's predecessors.  As a stand-alone action flick, it delivers in spades but, sadly though somewhat predictably, it pales in comparison to its prequels.
The narrative is surprisingly taut and on the whole, bar a few lapses, well-told with even some sharp plot twists thrown in for good measure.  A glaring and significant omission from this latest sequel is Brad Fiedel's familiar Terminator theme tune, the inclusion of which I am absolutely certain would increase the success of the movie enormously.  Without the theme resonating through the action sequences, the movie certainly feels lacking.  In truth, I do not recall a theme at all in T3, so passive and understated was the film's score.
However, Arnold was at back at his best in T3 - re-enacting his role as easily and smoothly as if T2 was released last year.  The new Terminatrix was satisfactory, though never truly captivating nor menacing.  The support provided by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes was also passable, though it must be highlighted that Stahl makes for a much more believable John Connor than Edward Furlong ever could.
So, in conclusion, Terminator fans will be pleased by the storyline and performances of the leads.  They may also enjoy the action sequences which are par for the course for the trilogy.  However, the continuation of the saga has been made hollow due to the omission of the old Terminator theme tune which provided the previous movies with just the right tempo, while enabling the audience to cheer for the heroes.  Nonetheless, I do recommend the movie, as I had expected it to be much, much worse.
