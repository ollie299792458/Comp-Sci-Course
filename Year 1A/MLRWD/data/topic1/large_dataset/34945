This is such an amazing show--it looks and sounds stunning throughout. Megadeth is firing on all cylinders, and the Argentine audience is completely gonzo, singing along to the guitar riffs like a giant collective Beavis. The band feeds off the crowd's energy and just rips the stage up, while the outdoor venue allows that energy to multiply.

As for the new additions to the band, I actually think they sound heavier than ever. Guitarist Glen Drover used to be in King Diamond, and his brother Shawn on drums has a beefier sound than previous Megadeth sticksmen. Not to take away from from Gar Samuelson or Nick Menza, but they had a jazzier style that created a breezier, but not bone-crunching backbeat.

I've followed the four pillars of American thrash (Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Metallica) since the 80's. Slayer never strayed from its sound, Megadeth did for a while, but has come back to its brutal roots, while Metallica and Anthrax seem to have taken an artistic fork in the road and run out of gas. When I watch Dave perform on this DVD, I see someone still bursting with energy and anger, but time has allowed him to harness that and become, arguably, the best at what he does.
