Has there ever been a better actress to play a witch so wickedly

glamourous?  Could another actor be an unsuspecting boob so

perfectly?  Or have two of the biggest bumblers as relatives?

Happily not!  Kim Novac delivers a completely believeable

performance as Gillian, the beautiful lonely witch who wants a

"normal" life and can anyone top Jimmy Stewart as her clueless

prey?  These two should have done more movies together!  As for

the supporting cast, Elsa Lancaster (better known as the "Bride

of Frankenstein") is perfect as Queenie, Gillian's aunt, Jack Lemmon in a surprising role as Gillian's beatnik brother who befriends a writer (played by Ernie Kovacs) and offers him an "inside look" at the witchcraft crowd, the head of which is none other than Hermione Ginghold (in a particularly hilarious

scene with Jimmy Stewart - his facial expressions are priceless).

This movie offers comedy, sadness, sweetness and a tiny bit of

spooky plus a very crossed-eyed Siamese named Pyewacket. Great

movie to see anytime of the year but certainly Halloween and

Christmas fits best.  This was not the first movie produced

with this kind of storyline (Veronica Lake in "My Favorite Wife"

for instance) but altho made in the 50's still holds it's own

today. Even the fashions are timeless...as is this love story.

So Ring the bell, close the book and light the candle - you may

find yourself humming a little tune to your own cat or putting

out all the street lamps just for fun!
