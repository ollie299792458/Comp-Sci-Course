A good movie that showed a more realistic side of the German soldier than the typical "sergeant schultz" versions. My mother is from Germany, she was a little girl growing up during the war. She had 4 brothers fighting in the war plus her father before he was wounded. One brother is missing in action on the Russian front. This movie showed me no matter what uniform a man wears sooner or later he must battle himself as to the reason we wage war. I also think too much credit is given to the Russian Army in defeating Germany, you might as well say those on the western front just played bingo while the Russians won the war! Both the Germans and the Japanese were formidible opponents,they just didn't lay down easy. I am a peacetime military veteran, but today I think wars are waged to give people something to do, hold people down long enough,i.e.deny them food,heating oil,and other necessities and they will rise up and fight for it-wars! Because of world war 2 I have the the mother I have,but will never get to know 3 uncles who fought that war on the German side-irony I guess. Jim.
