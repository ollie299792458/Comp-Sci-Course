Initially, back when Spawn came out in theatres,i had never heard of it,let alone read a single comic book of the source material.But nevertheless, i was excited to see a comic book-based film other than Batman hit the screens.Sadly, i did not go to see it when it came out in august of 1997,but could not wait to see it still.When I finally did a couple months later on VHS, I was not dissapointed. However to this day, I think Spawn could have benefited from an R rating and more emphasis could have been placed on the action sequences(which were exciting but there should have been more).I would have thought that a sequel would come out in the years after but didn't.A sharp contrary when compared to Blade,which came out exactly 1 year after Spawn,and became a trilogy in no time at all.Even the actors and the acting(most importantly)held up-meaning it may have been a bit cartoonish, but never dumb and/or stupid.Lastly,it felt good to see for the first time an African-American superhero on the screen.P.S. the effects were great and the soundtrack(a mix of rock and electronica laced tracks)is a bonus if you liked the movie.
