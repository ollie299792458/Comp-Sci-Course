Dead poets society tells us about 2 things. One is Free-thinking. The other is "SIZE THE DAY". This film mainly take place in a preparatory school on the east cast of American counytryside. The main charactors are Mr.Keating who is a free- thinking teacher and some of his students. Especially,Niel is a very important character of this film.  We think this film is very good! An interesting scene is in at Mr. Keating's class,he tells students to rip out the text book. At first,they are confused about the way of his teaching.  But,they change their way of thinking step by step. We think this scene is important. This is because from this experience students find out their way or dream and they know to sieze the day. The other interesting scene is when Charlie meet Chris at her boyfriend's house and he fall in LOVE with her. From this scene,he widen his vision of life. Most attractive in this film is Niel's dream. Niel want to be an actor. But his father is very strict,so he gives up his dream. However he confronts his deam thanks to Mr.keating. He gets a chance to play a main part. This play was successful. From this scene, we can feel that he has a strong will. After the play the tragedy happenes. We think that's scene is not good. Because we belive there is another solution. But,we think this film is very good and very heart-warming film. If you search for human's quitessence,we recomand this film.
