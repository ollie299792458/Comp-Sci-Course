As a 46-year-old man, I'm not easily moved by many films.  I rented this new version of "Charlotte's Web" because I didn't see much else of interest at the video store, and I remembered liking the book very much as a young child.  I had no great expectations, just mild curiousity.

But was I blown away.  First of all, the book came rushing back to me as soon as the story started to unfold.  This version of the story is very faithful to the original work (ok, maybe the original "slaughterhouse" has been toned down [only somewhat] into a "smoke house," but nothing has really been diminished in the translation).  True to the original, we have a pig (some pig!) in trouble, and a lovable spider to the rescue. The same old story--- and thankfully so.  This tough, middle-aged guy was reduced to tears at several scenes throughout the film--- and that NEVER happens.  But the good news is, they were GOOD tears!  You'll shed them too if you indulge yourself in this amazing movie.  Oh, and kids will probably like it too!

P.S. Reluctant to part with my rental copy, I just placed an order for a copy of my own.  It's that good...
