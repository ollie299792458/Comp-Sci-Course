Artisan - Lions Gate typically puts out some pretty good independent films (or at the least, interesting ones).  "Haunted" (also staring Kate Beckinsale) and Adian Quin is a very well told story with a gripping plot.  "Angels & Insects" is another worth while film by this company.  However, "Uncovered" is roughly the worst film I've ever seen.  A complete waste of 2 hours, period.  In retrospect, there is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever.  The acting is dreadful on every account (even Beckinsale, whom I like most of the time.)  The characters are totally undeveloped and unlikable; Beckinsale's G.I. Joe Haircut sometimes made it difficult to distinguish her form the men.  Although I think the worst part about this film was the soundtrack, absolutely horrifying!  (And I DON'T mean scary).  It was a really bad jazz theme, like Kenny G converted to elevator music.  It was like going to the drive-through at McDonalds and getting someone else's order.  There must have been a mix up at the editing room, this music could not have possibly been scored for a supposed mystery.  The music set the scene for a cheesy B-level romantic comedy (seriously).  It did not ad to the mystery feeling at all.  About a third of the way through, a 12-year-old could predict the outcome, even with the high-school-play level acting.  One may think, "no, it can't be that, there must be a twist!"  There isn't.  More holes in the plot than a William Castle film (without all of the fun) somewhat resembling a slice of Swiss Cheese.
