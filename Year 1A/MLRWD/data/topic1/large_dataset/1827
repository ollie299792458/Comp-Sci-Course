This DVD was a very long time coming, but now that I have it, I must admit it was worth the wait.  There are 20 commentary tracks (out of 29 total episodes) and they have added to my knowledge & enjoyment of these wonderful shows.  The commentary tracks are completely entertaining & it's a real sneak peek at the wicked sharp sense of humor that the cast, writers & producers obviously shared! I'm hopeful that everyone buys this set & it forces Sony to produce the other seasons on DVD at a faster pace than it took to finally get this one!

I've really taken some time to watch my old tapes of Newradio lately & cannot wait until the DVD's are released.  What a joy to watch a show with timing, whipsmart writing & perfectly rendered delivery by a superb comedic cast.  It's a complete shame that more people did not get the chance to enjoy this show during its original run.  Release the DVD's!  I'll bet their unexpectedly high sales ranking will shock a lot of folks!
