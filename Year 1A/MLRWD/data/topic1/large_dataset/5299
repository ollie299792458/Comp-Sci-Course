This will capture you from the first scene to the last. Judith Vittet as Miette` is Captivating to watch. She is an Adorable Child. She was nine when this was made and chosen out of a huge group of girls that tried-out. You will see why. She has so much natural talent.  Daniel Emilfork is Great . His facial expressions are Incredible and show tremendous  emotion. Ron Perelman is Great and convincing. You will probably like the voice of Uncle Irvin, the "poor migraine-ridden brain" in a fishtank.The movie is very highly detailed and if you have a dvd and a really good surround-sound system you will really Experience this movie. I have seen it about 8 times and I have started to look around the screen at places you usually don`t look at during the first few times of viewing. There is such intricate detail it is mezmerizing.I highly recommend setting the language to English with English sub-titles. They are not that distracting. There are a lot of phrases that are difficult to understand with the translation from French. It is Definately worth putting up with these two things and follow the journey into the dark, archaic, bizarre world. It is humorous too.The first time I saw this without subtitles I didn`t have much of an idea what was going on. Gary Coladonato
