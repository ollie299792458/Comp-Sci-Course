I missed this series first time around on TV, but after seeing the DVD I realize it was no loss.  Besides the unending parade of stupid mistakes everyone continually makes on their trek across an UNEXPLORED ALIEN PLANET! (adopting cute alien "kittys", befriending  inexplicably encountered humans on a supposedly unexplored planet, lack of sentries, lack of leadership, etc. ad nauseam), I also had a hard time caring whether any of these schmucks lived or died.  I had hoped that Danziger (Clancy Brown, aka The Kurgan!) would take charge and beat this gang into shape, but he was just wishy-washy like all the rest.

  I won't go into detail either about all the basic science flaws except to point out that traveling 22 light years in 22 years (even assuming their dorky little ship could somehow manage this) brings up all sorts of cool relativistic possibilities which were conveniently skipped over.  Instead all we get is the convenient plot device of "artificial gravity" so they could avoid those pesky, expensive special effects shots.  Is that also the reason Earth 2 looks exactly like Earth 1?  >>sigh&lt;&lt;

  Overall this series wasn't exactly horrible.  With a little better character development I could probably even overlook the  glaring errors and cheap effects [Star Trek TOS comes to mind].  But if you can't empathize with the characters, is there any point in watching?  I guess not.

  Next up for review:  "Space, Above and Beyond"...
