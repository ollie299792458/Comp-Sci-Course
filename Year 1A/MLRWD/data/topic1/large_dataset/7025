I did NOT want to see this movie.  I have a special distaste for war, fighting and violence wrapped up in my entertainment.  Lucky for me, my husband insisted that our weekly date involve Behind Enemy Lines, whether I like it or not.  Fortunately, the end result was positive in every way.
Of course Gene Hackman was his usual high-caliber-acting self, bringing a degree of believability and solid character to the plot.  Owen Wilson was surprisingly good too, leaving me asking, "Where have I seen this guy before?"  Later I found out that he's known for off-beat roles, such as his supermodel status in Zoolander, which is where he'd previously caught my eye. 
The production of the movie was also above what I'd imagined, with interesting special effects and camera trickery.  What I really enjoyed was what was absent in this film.  Violence, blood and guts and manly macho-ism that peppers most war flicks seemed to be left out of this one, and in its place you get friendship, understanding and real character development. 
All in all, it quickly became a purchase for our DVD collection, where I further explored to find great commentaries, behind the scenes footage and extra scenes and sequences.  I guess it's not nice to pre-judge after all.
