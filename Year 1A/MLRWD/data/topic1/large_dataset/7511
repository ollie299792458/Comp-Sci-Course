I haven't seen a movie like this for years. It is full of comedy and you will keep laughing if you have a good sense of humor with open mind. The reason that many people here have given negative points is because it deals with the subject which makes many people uncomfortable, but as I said that if you watch this movie with open mind, you will definitely love it. The story is about a black girl (Zoe Saldana) who is in love with a white boy (Ashton Kutcher) and wants to announce their engagement on her parent's 25th marriage anniversary. Her dad (Bernie Mac) won't approve the white guy, not because he is a racist, but also uncomfortable about his daughter's relation with him. The movie is all fun, can be watched with family and as said before will keep everyone laughing.

Bernie Mac's character as Percy Jones is awesome, and he the one character you will keep watching the movie for. Ashton Kutcher, is all right and improvement in his acting is evident. Other actors are ok. Overall, this movie should not be missed, and please...don't take the jokes in the movie seriously.
