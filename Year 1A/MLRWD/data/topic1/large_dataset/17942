LETHAL WEAPON turns 20 this year and in fact,it was one of 1987's highest-grossing films next to DIRTY DANCING,THREE MEN AND A BABY,PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES,FATAL ATTRACTION and MANNEQUIN. In this Warner Bros. action-packed film,Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover) is a husband and a father of three who returns to the force after an extended hiatus. He is first seen soaking in his bathtub,then retreats downstairs to the kitchen with his beard shaved down to a moustache. He is far from enthused about his partner-in-crime,Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson). Martin is a mentally disabled individual who is a "lethal weapon". Martin often thinks he's a firearm of some sort. This behavior frequently aggravates Roger. But,they end up making a great team and becoming best buddies. Watch for a special appearance by Gary Busey(The Buddy Holly Story) as the criminal who's wanted. Darlene Love is Roger's wife Trish. Love is a singer as well who had a hit in 1963,(Today I Met)THE BOY I'M GONNA MARRY. Director Richard Donner reteamed with Gibson and Glover for three sequels released respectively in 1989,1992 and 1998.
