HiI know that the company that produced this film is out of business.I absolutely love this film and hate the fact that I passed up to pay $20 two years ago to get this.I am a broke college student.I think that this is a very inspirational story that should be passed on to many.Which is why eventually I wanted it to show younger folks & old.I feel that this story helps melt down the prejudices that we have grown up with and helps one understand that no matter how different we look and how young or old we are,We should understand that so many lives are significant in so many ways.Knowing this, it has taught me not to judge people I don't know because I don't know what life has put them through.Sometimes we all need a little break and understanding from others.I think it is a crime to take advantage of the fact that this dvd will be hard to come by and charge and arm and a leg.I thought this dvd was supposed to teach the opposite of this.I can by this dvd for $20-$30 if ur willing THANKS.
