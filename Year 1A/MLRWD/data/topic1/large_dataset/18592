I second the praise of earlier reviewers, so consider it reiterated here-but did anyone else mention the radical portrayal of a gay kid as the best player on the Little League team?  And he didn't even "look" gay, like his flaming friend Eric.

This rendition of the man-boy sexual abuse theme highlights the differing (though both pathetic) responses of two different boys.  It also distinguishes between two approaches of the male-on-male pedophile: the "grooming" and seduction of Neil versus the one-off (or maybe two, counting that Halloween) rape of Brian.  Survivors of childhood abuse will recognize many elements of Brian's experiences: the fragmentary and peripheral recollections (e.g., blue porch light), the nose-bleeds and fainting years after the fact, the desperate preoccupation with improbable, fabricated "screen memories" like the UFO abduction, and the absence of resolution at the end of the film. Finally, let me add: (1) Survivors should not watch this film unless they are VERY stable.  (2) Some viewers may find a few of the rent-boy sex scenes a bit repulsive. (3)  The book and the movie complement each other very well.  As always, more happens in the book than the film, including chapters from the viewpoints of characters other than Neil and Brian.
