Let me get this straight,first Tim Burton makes a film about Ed Wood,and now he wants to be him.Now I know this is a spoof,but it's a spoof of something that is usually funnier in the original versions.
You see,the  conceit here is that if you put big time stars in a movie that is knowingly  bad and you put state of the art(but knowingly cheesy)effects in it,it'll  be seen as just a bunch of great actors slumming but having a good  time.
Nice try but Burton misses the piont.If the makers of the original  50's Sci-fi oldies had the money to get good  actors,writers,directors,effects,and so on,there would be nothing to  saterize or pay homage to.The glory of these films is that even with the  extreme lack of talent most of them had,they are entertaining in spite of  themselves.All the badness can make a film go to a level of fun that no one  could have intended.
I've given the movie 3 stars for the effects  alone.they are cheesy,but state of the art.They really deliver.Watching  stars like Jack Nicholson(in 3 roles no less),Danny Devito,Micheal J  Fox,and a whole slew of others(Rod Stieger anyone?)go through these  ridiculous,predictable paces is a real waste.If your into special effects  it might be interesting,if not watch an old AIP Roger Corman flick.it'll be  funnier.
