My wife and I settled in recently to watch the original Sparkle movie.  The performances were tremendous - great singing, acting, and dancing on stage.  The film showed the positive, as well as dark side, of show business in Harlem and the corrupt influences and downfalls of that environment. This film is set in another time - in the early days of the Black show groups of the 50's and 60's.  This showed the good, the bad and the ugly of that scene and the aspirations of the young folks from poor backgrounds trying to break into the music business and be successful.  On the down side, the movie's plot development only took you so far and the ending came too soon and abruptly - leaving the viewer wanting more.  It left us yearning for a "Sparkle 2" to fill in the story blanks and complete the journey.  For that reason, I deducted a star.  Really enjoyed the innocence and hope of that era portrayed in the film and I felt for the dreams and aspirations of the young people yearning for a break in life.  The music and entertainment was great - they sure don't make songs like that anymore.  Highly recommend the film for what it is - a classic movie, but one that leaves you hanging at the end.
