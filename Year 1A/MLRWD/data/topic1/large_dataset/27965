I purchased this DVD performance of the Marriage of Figaro for a totally different reason. In the description page the language listed was English, causing me to understand that this might be SUNG IN ENGLISH. I therefore ordered it with this objective in mind, to have a performance of this Opera Buffa sung in English (very few performances in English exist, and it seems that none was captured on DVD). Any way, it turns out that the information page on Amazon describing the language as English is in error. Yes, there are subtitles in English too, but it is not sung in English. However, since it arrived I decided to check whether the exceptionally Good reviews are indeed correct. ... and what can I say but:  YES, they are more than correct. This was one of the best experiences I had in watching and listening to Opera. The cast not only that they sung and played Mozart they felt him being on stage with them. It is a miraculous performance, truly astounding. Despite the high price I strongly recommend this DVD to any Opera lover.
