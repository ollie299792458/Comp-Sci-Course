I give this movie five stars only because they put Stockard Channing in it. She just made this film. Yeah, yeah...Olivia was great singing by the pool and yes the song is great and all. But hey her acting chops arent' that great. Okay so she looked fantastic with the sandy 2 outfit. But Rizzo was actually the only character with some meat to it. Even though Stocard Channing was too old for the role she pulled it off and with so little to work with she actually makes the viewer care about her. While you forget the rest of the cast after the first ten minutes the movie is over. You kind of remember Rizzo. Maybe because she was the ho or maybe because...hey, she actually was the only who had to act in the entire movie. And that song "There Are Worse Things I Could Do". That such a great song and the emotions she put into it and the feelings one gets just hearing her sing. It is actually the only song I remember. The rest just goes out the door once the movie is over. You have to admit it the next time you watch "Grease" that Rizzo is actually the best role in the film.
