I was born in 1973 and this film won Best Picture of the year.
A film film in every way, great cast, great screenplay, great everything.
This one reunites the  Paul Newman/ Rober Redford Redford/Roy Hill team, the one gave us the stellar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014BQQYS">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid [Blu-ray</a>].
You cant go wrong with such acting greats as Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Robert Shaw, Charles Durning, Ray Walston, Eileen Brennen, Harold Gould, John Heffernan, Dana Elcar, Jack Kehoe, Damitra Arliss, Robert Earl Jones (James Earl's father), Sally Kirkland, John Quade, James J Sloyan, and more.
Also the ragtime piano playing of Scott Joplin tunes by Marvin Hamlisch is timeless, I find myself whistling the theme song every so often!
I have the original soundtrack on vinyl LP
add to that the great diecting talent of George Roy Hill and screenplay by David S. Ward and you have a winner!
