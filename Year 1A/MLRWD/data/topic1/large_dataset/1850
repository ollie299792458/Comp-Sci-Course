Truly a classic among fantasy films.  I used to watch this movie all the time a child.  10 years later, it's still as good as ever.  Very good storyline, decent puppets (good for it's time, and definitely still watchable today), and cinematography to blow your mind.

Like I mentioned, a great story.  There are 3 main species in this film, even though a few others are shown.  The Gelflings (we only see 2, the main characters), the Skekcies (not sure how to spell that), and the Mystics.  The Mystics and the Skekcies used to be one, but then the Crystal gets cracked, a shard goes missing, and it becomes the dark crystal.  The species that once was becomes seperated into skekcies and mysics, and the skekcies are in charge of the castle the crystal is kept in.  Mystics get kicked out, and travel long and far to find a place of peace.  From there, the world starts to get a little messed up in various places, partly because creatures the skekcies send out wreck havoc, and practically the whole Gelfling species gets killed off.  One Gelfling gets adopted by the mystics, the other by these other small creatures.  One day, when the Gelfling grows up, the mystics sense that it's time to search for the crystal shard and restore the dark crystal to what it once was.  As the Gelfling searches for the shard, meets up with the other Gelfling, and searches some more, the mystics journey back to the castle.  If you want to know more about the rest of the story, you'll have to see the movie yourself.  It can't be missed.

Since it's very difficult to find such a great fantasy film, 5 stars all the way!
