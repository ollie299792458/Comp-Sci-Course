A man attends a party where he sees the woman of his dreams from across the room.  They enjoy a dance together.  In fairy tales they would have lived happily ever after but this isn't a fairy tale.

The Painted Veil stars Ed Norton as Walter Fand and Naomi Watts as Kitty Fand.  The story begins in 1920 England where Kitty is being pressured to find a husband by her mother and father.  After the dance they shared Walter Fane is convinced Kitty should become his wife.  They wed only a few days after meeting.

Walter Fane takes his new bride to Shanghai China where he works as a bacterilogist.  Kitty is bored in her new home and instead of being the socialite she is used to she is shuned in the social circles.  She finds little in common with her husband who is very dedicated to his work and not her.  She finds the love and acceptance she seeks in an affair with the British vice consul (Lieu Schreiber).

Walter discovers the affair and gives Kitty her options: divorce because of adultery or to follow him to fight a cholera out break.  She follows and the two learn to get pass the anger they feel toward each other.  Their lives become interwined as they learn to love each other.

Very good movie but somewhat slow at times.  You easily become involved and won't want to miss a minute.  Based on the novel by Somerset Maugham.
