I am 33 years old and am African-American.  As a child, my three siblings and I watched the Sound of Music year after year after year.  We learned and sang along to ALL of the songs, knew the children's names, demeanors, as well as anticipated the entire plot unfolding each time it aired on TV.  My mother loved music, movies, comedy and fun.  If the Sound of Music was considered a "baby-sitter" back then to her, then she hired the right lady in Julie Andrews and the cast.  We would sit quietly and intently watching the movie only to make noise when called for (singing, laughing, and crying). 
As an adult, the love for this movie has never changed.  Julie Andrews' role as Maria led us to embrace life through sharing in her joys, fears, hopes, innocense, sorrows, and her journey to find out what really mattered in life in this movie.  
It is truly a classic that ALL people should watch, share with family, friends and of course their children.  When I have kids of my own, the classic edition will be one of their "baby sitters", and hopefully it will bridge a gap in communicating how life can show you many things about yourself and others.  
My sister and I introduced the soundtrack to our nephew at the age of 6.  He's 13 years old and was watching the movie on TV when it last aired a few months ago.  He loves the songs and I am sure, as it "stuck" to us, it has taken the same meaning to him.  I would encourage you to buy the video, DVD and soundtrack.  They are truly collectors items.  You will not be disappointed.
