The seven year itch is a really good film.And Billly Wilder and Marilyn Monroe were probably the best team of the fifties. Billy Wilder was the only one who could use perfectly Marilyn's sexuality on screen. Never was  it more compelling to watch her on screen than this film and"Some like  it hot". Though "Some like it hot" is much better, the best  comedy ever made, this one has a freshness to it and a sort of underlying  tone which is refering to Monroe's intelligence. Watching her films, you  always feel that she means what she is saying, but in this one, you think  that she knows better than what she is really saying. You feel a sort of  contradiction between what she is saying and what she is thinking. That's a  different Monroe.And what did it for me, was when Tom Ewell tells the man  spending time with his wife, that Marilyn Monroe could be in his kitchen.  I've been wiating all my life to hear this. Whenever a star is in a movie,  you always mention others stars, that have no links what so ever with the  film or the actor. But why not use the real stars. The one who is character  in the picture. This one does, and only Billy Wilder could do such a  brilliant thing. It's small alright. But so smart....
