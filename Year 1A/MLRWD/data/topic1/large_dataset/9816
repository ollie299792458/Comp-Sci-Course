Final Destination is an amazing curiosity-- a Teenage Death Movie with an original premise, intelligent characters, and honest-to-goodness respect for its audience.  It's like a slasher movie without the slasher, where literally anything can be lethal and the only limit is the writers' imaginations; that alone would be enough to set it apart from the rest of the '90s horror movies, but there's so much more to like about this movie because it's so well thought out and executed.  The plane crash at the beginning is one of the most believable disaster sequences ever caught on film, at least on the same level as the crash in Alive, and the rest of the movie holds up extremely well.  Surprisingly well-written dialogue on the nature of fate and mortality combines with meticulously arranged domino-effect deaths; despite the annoyingly perfect-looking teen leads, this is as far away from I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last and all those movies as you can get.  Still, Final Destination isn't perfect.  The funeral scene after the plane crash drags on too long, the explanations of death and "the design" are a bit shaky, the  FBI agents contribute nothing at all to the movie, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired (there is a more serious alternate ending on the DVD, though it still wouldn't have closed the film very well).  But if you like well-made, scary, exciting movies, FD is well worth the money.  In my opinion, it's the best horror movie of the year so far, and a must-see for any scary movie fan.
