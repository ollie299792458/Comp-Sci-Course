Thanks for making this wonderful video which delivers an important message in a humerous non threatening manner.
I do feel the production is almost too fast and wordy at times. As a 43 year old mother of a five year old I had trouble keeping track of the  various rules regarding the different types of strangers. I wonder if a youngster could be so busy trying to remember what the video said to do or not do that a child does not listen to that instinctive gut feeling that signals something is not right in a potentially harmful situation with an adult.

I remember as an 11 year old in the 1970's visiting my grandparents in Florida. I developed a semi crush on the 20 something son of neighboring retiree's. He had long hair and looked like a mixture of David Cassidy  and Jimmy Page.My ideal male at the time,(I still like that look),yet when he got me alone and asked me to meet him somewhere remote later that day the hair on the back of my neck actually stood up like you read in books and I clearly and forcefully said,"No Way."I wonder if I had seen the video if I would have been so busy trying to label him as a," dont know," or a,"kinda know." that I would not have listened to my instincts. Of course a relatively sophisticated 11 year old is different than a toddler or young school age child who probably have not  fully developed certain instincts yet.

My only reccomendation is a slightly slower paced less stimulating video for younger children or children with processing delays .
