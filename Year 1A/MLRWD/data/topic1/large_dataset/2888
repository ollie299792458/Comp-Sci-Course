Thelma &amp; Louise: , Ridley Scott's great direction of Callie Khouri's flawless scriptof and a fine cast, splendid photography, music that was right on the mark in every scene.
This is what great movie making is all  about, and this one was my idea of superb entertainment. Not one scene was  off a scintilla. The actors' every facial and physical expressions brought  forth the emotion called for by every last scene, voice intonations were  perfect.
When Louise cautioned Thelma against being so open, Thelma's  response, after revealing her inner pain with expression, was simply,  "Right!" with an emphatic little nod of her head. A tiny snippet,  but like every other part of the movie it was precisely right.  When a look  would do, there was no dialog. We got it.
After at least eight screenings  I can't point to a single flaw, not even a weak point. Such passing  characters as Harlan Puckett and the waitress at the Silver Bullet were  perfect, both in casting and execution. "Come on, Hal, not even a  teeny, weeny, weeny little drink?" She was a jewel.
Leonard Maltin's  parting comment about it being another road movie was imbecilic. Thelma  &amp; Louise was anything but a "road movie." It just happened  that much of it occurred on the road -- where else for two girls on the  run?
Thelma &amp; Louise has taken a slight edge off some of my old  favorites.
