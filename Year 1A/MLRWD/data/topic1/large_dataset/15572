A friend of mine described this era of filmmaking as "musty in the mouth". Not sure what that means, but it somehow captures the wrongness of this era, which was tame in terms of graphic violence (thankfully; I think gore is gross) by today's standards, but captures psychological terror very well. Or perhaps it's just my childhood memories talking. This era was very unique as the 70s had all that post-60s counterculture fall-out--- Manson, one cult after another, the weird juxtaposition of cultural ultra-wholesomeness of the Osmonds and the Carpenters alongside the decadence of glam and later punk. If memory serves, people seemed to be freaking out left and right in new and different ways..anyhow, this tale is a classic yarn about a sequesterd disturbed kid who lives under the stairs in a secret cubby and voyeuristically lives through the people he watches. There are nice little visual touches, like the 'peephole' camera framing. Also, I recall his room, with its demented art, being especially disturbing. A truly unique little story when TV movies were all about how messed up society was becoming. Excellent time capsule.
