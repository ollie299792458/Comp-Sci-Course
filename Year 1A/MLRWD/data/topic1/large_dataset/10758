This movie is about a girl that dreams of working in the publishing business her entire life.  She works hard at getting good grades in high school so she can get a scholarship at college.  She works hard in college and gives up on some of the more fun aspects in order to get good grades in hopes that she'll get the job of her dreams.  She does everything "right" and according to her father in one scene, she even "ate all her vegetables growing up".  This "vegetable scene" is meant to show that she takes herself too seriously and has been working too hard her entire life (she's 22 years old).  HUGE SPOILER ALERT:  She eventually gets the jobs of her dreams but gives it up in order to move in with her boyfriend who just got into law school.  Apparently she's going to live in his dorm room with him (which to me seems unlikely for a university to allow).  In the "you always ate your vegetables" scene, she asks her father if she should "give up on her dreams and move 3,000 miles away" and he tells her "yes".  So let me get this straight - you worked hard you entire life towards the job of your dreams only to give it up to be unemployed and living in a boyfriend's dorm?  This movie is a feminist's worst nightmare.  It's also a nightmare for anyone (feminist or not) who has a daughter.  Who exactly was the target audience of this movie?  I can't think of any group that would care much for it.  Maybe it's made for Archie Bunker or maybe the studio pulled an old script off the shelf that should have been made in the 1950's.  If you absolutely must see this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it.
