I read this book when I was a child and have always loved the story.  This film version is a very good retelling of the H.G. Wells Classic tale.  Rod Taylor does a very good job as the Time Traveler (who in the novel is unnamed, but is called George in the film), and a young, beautiful Yvette Mimieux is well-cast as Weena the child-like woman of the far distant future.  The Special Effects done by George Pal demonstrate his usual excellent work.  They are a little dated, but taking into consideration that the film was made in the early 1960's they are outstanding for the time.  The Morlocks look a little cheesy, but if one ignores these minor details, the film is a real treat.  After seeing this film countless times, I am thrilled to be able to share it with my grandchildren.  This film stays more or less true to the book by H.G. Wells and is a classic just like the book.  I am sure that Sci-Fi fans like myself will enjoy this film.  It is definitely worth the five star rating that I gave it.
