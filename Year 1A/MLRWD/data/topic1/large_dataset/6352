"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte" is one of THE finest examples of a psychological drama. In the tradition of Cukor's "Gaslight" and "What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?" the sympathetic heroine is  nearly driven insane by a "well-meaning" relative dripping with  arsenic. Bette Davis is at her versatile and incredibly engrosssing best as  the vulnerable post-Southern belle Charlotte Hollis, who for over thirty  years has carried the memory of a dead flame who was married at the time of  his bizzare death. When Charlotte's late father's mansion is to be  destructed, Charlotte calls for help from sweet cousin Miriam. But Miriam  is not as sweet as she makes out to be... she is in fact manipulating and  evil, and played by (BIG SURPRISE, but darn well) Olivia deHavilland. Don't  expect sweet Cousin Melanie when there is a vulnerable cousin... and  millions of dollars at stake. As Charlotte is driven out of her fragile  mind, she begins to come to terms with the death of her lover...and begins  to see Miriam for what she is.  From its intriguing beginning shot on the  Southern gothic palace, to the  ending haunting tones of its title song,  "Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte" is a film you won't soon forget.
