Well, I happened to go to their concert in Dallas in September, but it was in a monsterous arena with no seat being a "good" seat and Brandon got all mad when some folks on the floor started a big brawl and they stopped playing until the fight ended.  So, I didn't really get to experience Incubus in concert like I did in previous years.  But, I must say, this will be the only time I wish I lived in Colorado, b/c this concert was amazing.  I bought the DVD the moment the store opened, raced home (listening to the extra CD of course) and watched the whole thing all the way through.  It's just amazing.  Its so cool to actually be able to see Jose up close during the "Vitamin" drum solo.  I can't believe anybody can move that fast.  And of course the "Everything in Ebb" rock-out section afterward was flawless.  Other highlights include the Police cover in "Stellar,"  watching Mike switch from keyboard to guitar and back (sometimes playing both at the same time) during "Here in my Room" and "Drive," and of course "A Certain Shade of Green," is just great...especially when Kilmore takes over about 2/3 of the way through.  Oh yeah!!  Pantomime!!  That has officially become one of my favortie songs ever.  And the studio version is fabuloso!!!  Overall...an amazing show.  If you're not an Incubus fan or a so-so fan...get this DVD and you'll be converted.
