Younger audiences don't appreciate Tati's efforts.  They aren't old enough to remember the days when living was simple.  Crouded Buses, Trains, rattling backfiring cars were common and tolerated. They can't picture being in those circumstances and can't look back and laugh at themselves.

We old folks laugh at the people running in a panic between railroad platforms, but we can't figure out why that's funny, "everybody did that to get a seat".

An old dog sleeping in the middle of the road moving for a loud speeding honking car, then back in the road again and only wagging his tail when Hulot squeezes his little bulb horn.  But finally getting up and going over to the driver and getting a pat-pat then on into the store.  Little old time human behavior is Tati's receipt for humor.

Older folks can identify with every character in the movie as someone they have known in their lifetime even themselves.  Those old boarding house hotels at the beach, with everyone coming in to eat at the ring of the bell don't exist any more, only giant edifices with pools and servants.  Nothing is simple any more.  Tati banks on this.

At times Tati exaggerates human failings just to draw attention to them for humor, but that is forgiven.

Truly a master of his art and this one is better that his later efforts.

If you are over 60, see it and have a good laugh.
