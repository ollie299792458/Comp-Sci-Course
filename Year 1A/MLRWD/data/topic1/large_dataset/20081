The thing I love about this movie is that I think different people are touched by different elements and scenes of the movie than others. It has a large canvas of different kind of characters, and it seems like there`s someone thrown in there, whether it`s the stud Trip Fontaine, one of the Lisbon sisters, or even one of their parents, for everyone to relate to. For me the part that made me cry was when Lux`s mother forced her to burn her rock albums, but that`s just me. Then there was the part where Trip and Lux fell asleep in the football field together on the night of their homecoming dance and he left her there, explaining in his POV that to this day he doesn`t know why he did but something just felt wrong. I`ve kind of felt that way before, when something just felt wrong about a situation and I didn`t know what, and I abandoned people without even knowing why. It`s a horrible feeling and the movie captured that mood of dissapointment very well. The film`s very moody and in way aggressively tear-jerking in simply the style of it. In my point of view it`s right up there with American Beauty in excellence, and it`s something that everyone should see, a lesson everyone should learn, in a way. It`s a shame that there are people out there that just don`t understand these kind of movies.
