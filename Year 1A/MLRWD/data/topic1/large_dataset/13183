That is an undeniable fact. Unless he made some other movie about Las Vegas around the same time that his name wasn't attached to. Like Leaving Las Vegas, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Vegas Vacation. Even some dull video for the city to attract tourists would have been an improvement.

Imagine Goodfellas without Ray Liotta and his oddly charming narration. You'll end up with something like this. Basically a remake minus the only interesting character. It'd be like making Pirates with just Orlando Bloom and that anorexic girl and her freakishly long neck. EAT SOMETHING! Wear shoulder pads too. Every time I see the end of that movie where she's standing way up over the rocks it looks like her head is going to fall right off that skinny neck of hers. I just can't watch it. And I can't watch this either, but that's not her fault. It's just two guys doing the same thing they've done a million times before sleepwalking for 3 hours so they can pick up an easy paycheck while that guy with the big eyebrows sits back and tells them to hurry up and get it over with so he can ditch them and start a new life with Leonardo DiCaprio. And who can blame him. Leo is younger and much more handsome.
