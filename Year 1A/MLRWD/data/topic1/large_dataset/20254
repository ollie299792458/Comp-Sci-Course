Another good season,and a MUST BUY recommendation,however,one is left wondering......WHY didnt WB do a featurette on Coy and Vance...or at least have them do an episode voice over? They arent the bad guys they have been made out to be....and watching these episodes shows that they got better over time.Actually,with the return of Bo and Luke,there was not the massive improvement you'd think there would be...so...that proves that Coy and Vance held their own fairly well...even though they relied on more General Lee stunts and Uncle Jesse/Daisy dialogue to shore up their "weakness".

I think the facial expression of Christopher Mayer when Bo and Luke return says a lot...talk about not cracking a smile...he knew his big role was over,taken back by 2 guys who stiffed WB and their fans over some money.Waltzing back into Hazzard like nothing ever happened....greed will do strange things to people....I dont think Coy and Vance would have ever done anything of the kind (of course they didnt have the leverage Tom and John had),seems to me they were just glad to have the job.I think if Warner Bros had realized that,we would have had a Byron Cherry/Christopher Mayer appearance on the Season 5 DVD.
