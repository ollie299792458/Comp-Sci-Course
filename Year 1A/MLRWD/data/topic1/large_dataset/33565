What's great about Joe Cross and this video is that he isn't some skinny, vegan, commune-living, flower child who was raised on home-grown food, and treats his body like a temple.  I have nothing against that, but we Americans have grown used to our fast food, snacking between meals, meat-eating daily and taking for granted that as we age our bodies are going to break down and that it's all part of the natural course of things.  Not to mention, if we weren't meant to eat food, why does it taste so good?

Joe is from Australia and, as he puts it, is just a regular bloke.  After having some health problems and piling on a nice pot belly, he went to a doctor to see if there was a way to get healthy and get off his meds.  Fortunately, he went to a nutritionalist.  Regular MD's just wanted to put him pills.  He learned something very important: Getting fat, cancer, heart attacks, diabetes, constant pain or headaches, etc., isn't part of aging!  He learned all about juicing and how important it is to get micronutrients.  And that food in the grocery stores is so over-processed that there's no nutrition left!

Joe decided to juice his way across America for two months.  Along the way he talks to 'regular' folks about what he's doing.  Need I say that many people thought he was crazy?  Also, people felt that giving up what they love to eat would equal unhappiness and they would rather die happy - even if that meant hurrying death along.  One man hoped that God had ribs in heaven because he couldn't see going without his ribs.  As Joe loses weight during that two month trip and makes friends, it's kind of scary to listen to people talk about their food addictions and their health problems.  They admit knowing that if they ate differently, they'd live longer - but they don't want to give up the fast food!

I watched this on Amazon (for free) and then I watched it again.  I found the entire DVD enlightening as well as entertaining.  Watch it!  I've already sent for my juicer.
