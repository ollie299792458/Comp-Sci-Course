The reviews and award nominations speak for themselves. It was nominated for nine academy awards (including Best Picture), and it won three (including a well-deserved win for Emma Thompson). It won the British Academy and various critic/review groups for best picture. In addition, many say that Howards End is director James Ivory most accomplished film. I would agree, even though it is not as picturesque as "A Room with A View", or as thought provoking as "Remains of the Day", it carries so much symbolism and I found myself just captured by the main characters (especially Emma Thompson, who shares with Vanessa Redgrave as being the soul of the film). There is plenty of irony and tragedy, but it is not sentimental. The restraint the actors put in the film is something I admire more than a scene-chewing exaggerated performance (you know the kind that usually win awards). The production values are incredible and the screenplay makes the material even more accessible than it was (no wonder it won the Oscar as well). I really recommend it for lovers of thoughtful dramas, and well-detailed period pieces.
