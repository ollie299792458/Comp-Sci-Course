This movie is pure Closter phobia and maybe that's why when it came out it was badly criticize.  It's shocking that nobody liked this movie when it came out.  You can blame this on the 80's they simply didn't want to deal with this type of tension at the time.  As I was watching this movie I kept getting this morbid feeling of hopelessness at times I didn't want to watch it anymore.  This is probably the reason why people dismiss it.  You need to watch it at least three times in order to really understand why you wanted to stop watching it.  One of the reasons for me was that all the characters were beyond redemption, they were apathetic and maniacal.  None of them deserved to live and as I was watching the movie for the second time I wanted all of them to be eaten by the zombies because none of them deserve to be human.  Through out the whole movie you feel that there's no solution and no matter what the characters are doing things can only get worst.  Extremely different from all the other Zombie flicks that are out there.  It's great horror flick, Romero's masterpiece for sure.
