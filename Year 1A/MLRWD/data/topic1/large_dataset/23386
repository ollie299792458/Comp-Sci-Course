The culmination of the "Yes, Minister" / "Yes, Prime Minister" series from the BBC! I was very happy to find out that the "Yes, Prime Minister" box set INCLUDES -- and BEGINS WITH -- the "final" episode of "Yes, Minster" called "Party Games", which was rarely seen in the US.
"Party Games" was a ONE HOUR special Christmas episode; the show where Sir Humphrey becomes Cabinet Secretary and Hacker becomes PM.
Of course, all the episodes from "Yes, Prime Minister" are included.
DVD Special Features include some very interesting video clips. First, there's a bio on Paul Eddington, as well as an Eddignton interview broadcast at the start of the season. In addition, they included TV segments from BBC news shows which aired on the morning of the debut of "Yes Prime Minister" .  Coincidentally, I viewed that special feature first ... and I admit that I did feel the same "anticipation" that must have been felt in 1986!
A must-buy ... along with the box set of "Yes Minister"!!!
