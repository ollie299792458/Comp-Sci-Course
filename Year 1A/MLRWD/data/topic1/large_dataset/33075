Here is a movie in which one scene captures all. Life is made of moments and what lies beneath these moments. Having said that, I will now go on and on about the tango scene, which is five minutes of film worth more than my entire DVD collection.

The Colonel approaches the lovely Gabrielle Anwar, charms her to the ballroom floor, controls the pace with passion and elegance, and truly, completely enjoys himself; the only time in the film. The tango ends in an ovation from the crowd, but for the Colonel and also for Anwar and Charlie it is bitterseet.

The Colonel's smile slowly shifts to a painful, confused look. He must once again face his demons. Al Pacino is God.

Anwar seems dazzled similar to the crowd; however, she demonstrates a bewildered presence that may be pity, confusion, admiration, or maybe some tragedy related to her own life. Her brief role here was fantastic. Charlie is the happy-go-lucky chap and gives balance to this perfect but awkward meeting. He, as we know, has the "weight of the world" on his shoulders. You sense he is growing fond of the Colonel. So we have three strangers and a tango all tangled up. I love this scene and I love this movie.
