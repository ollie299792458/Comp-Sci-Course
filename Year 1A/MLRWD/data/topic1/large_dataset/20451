A stunning production that portrays the systematic and ruthless Katyn Forest (In Poland) murder by the Soviet NKVD of over 20,000 Polish army officers, many of whom were army reservists.  Called to do their patriotic duty, they represented the core of the Polish professional elite, from professors to doctors and lawyers and businessmen and were thus a core potential threat to the suzerainty of Soviet power in the newly conquered territory.  On Stalin's orders, they were bussed into the forest, each shot in the back of the head and dumped in a mass grave.  The movie is particularly effective in the way it carries representative families along as the tragedy unfolds, woven into the fabric of the portrayal of a small but sophisticated nation overwhelmed by the brute power of the Nazis on one hand and the Soviets on the other, each cynically aligned with the other for plunder and territorial rape. Soviet propaganda for years worked hard to blame the atrocity on the Nazis--sustained for a long time by "fellow travelers" world wide--but the truth came out.  Add another 22,000 victims to the colossal abyss of Soviet horrors!
