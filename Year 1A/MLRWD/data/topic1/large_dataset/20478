When Aladdin came out in theatres in 1992, I was quite skeptical to say the least about seeing it in the theatres.  After all, I was 19 years old and thought I was much too old to be seen in a theatre with a bunch of kids.  I had not even yet seen Beauty and the Beast.  After seeing Aladdin, I was totally re-won over.  The story, music, characters, everything about it was so wonderful.

The DVD is that and so much more.  The picture is so clear and brilliant, it is almost like seeing it for the first time.  The extras are spectacular.  The videos (most of them anyway) are great.  It was cool to see the original video from 1992 for A Whole New World.  Mr. Aiken (always a pleasure to watch) once again delivers a powerful redering of the deleted "Proud of Your Boy."  I guess the sweet newlyweds were fine for the new video of WNW...but totally unnecessary.  At least we did not get the obligatory teeny bopper stars of Disney Channel shows ruining a song...YUCK!!

Proud of Your Boy is a beautiful song that truely must have been gut-wrenching to cut from the film.  However, as the creators stated, it would have taken the plot in a completely different direction.  I only hope that an audio recording will be available soon with Clay singing it.

Overall, a must have for any fan of the remarkable Platinum Edition Disney masterpieces for the kid in all of us.
