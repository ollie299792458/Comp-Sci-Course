This film is one of my all time Clint Eastwood favorites.  He plays the kind of semi bad guy that you root for.  You almost hope he pulls off the big heist and gets away with it and lives happily ever after because he is Clint.  If you can accept the fact that this plot borders on total fantasy, could never happen and defies logic time and time again, you will enjoy the scenario.  Lennie Niehaus' film score is perfect in creating the eery and sinister mood throughout the film and Clint's own playing of the piano theme is beautiful and haunting.  Gene Hackman as the president is truly the screen's best on screen bad guy and Ed Harris is his usual natural and believable self as the "live alone" head detective.  With that being said you must ask yourself: Why and how were the president's trysts unaccounted for by his staff and the media?  When E.G. Marshall's wife was murdered there was apparently no investigation even though he was very prominent.  When Clint met his daughter at the outside cafe the whole area was surrounded by police but apparently Clint didn't see any of them.  When the secret service man was killed in the hospital apparently no questions were asked and no investigation took place and Clint was never a suspect.  When the president presumably committed suicide E.G. Marshall was never suspected even though he was the only witness and no questions were asked why the president fatally stabbed himself at that specific time.  Minor details, right?
