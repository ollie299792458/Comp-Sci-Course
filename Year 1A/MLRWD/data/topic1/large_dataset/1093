Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas and Dan Rickles working in a great comedic partnership that happens to showcase the proper usage of the tank in warfare!!  (And let's not forget Carrol O'connor as the gung ho general and Donald Sutherland channeling Hawkeye Pierce from MASH as a VERY funny but highly competent tank commander).  It is a fabulous combination, and a good war story, well acted and very well written and directed.  Clint Eastwood plays Kelly, who motivates Telly Savalas and his platoon to lead the advancethrough minefields and friendly fire to seek a bank full of gold.  The war scenes ring more true than in any movie or series until Saving Private Ryan -- especially the scenes involving tank combat (Sutherland foreshadows the "Ride of the Valkyries" scene in Apocalypse Now, which had to have been influenced by this movie) and the most convincing scene in the movie is when the German Tiger simply "takes command" of the village in a scene right out of the recent invasion and occupation of Iraq.  If I had only one war movie to take with me on a desert island (and Band of Brothers didn't qualify --)  Just writing the review makes me want to watch it again!
