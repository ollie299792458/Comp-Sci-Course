As a Christian parent, what I desire most is for my children to ultimately become Christ-followers.  But, I found myself stressed and overwhelmed with the task of parenting my young children, ages 5.5 and 3.  At this age, we are dealing with sibling rivalry, testing of limits such as back-talking and defiance, and lying.  While overall my children are "well-behaved" and are "good kids", I felt that maybe I was doing something wrong.  This book really helped me to realize that our children, like us, have a sin nature.  We are to parent with the grace that God gives us.  Its not about creating a safe Christian environment where we actively try to keep the world out to protect our kids, but to trust that God is bigger than the forces out in the world and as such, we raise our children with love, grace and discipline as we guide them to Jesus.
I would recommend this book to all parents, esp. those whose model of Christian parenting is more along the lines of "doing the right things", lots of restrictions and rules and harsh discipline.  Not to worry, this is not an "anything goes" style of parenting.  Dr. Kimmel is very clear that loving parents must discipline, but for the sake of teaching children what is right and how to recognize sin in their life.  And, he is very clear that the limits to what is acceptable is according the the Bible.  Pink mohawk is fine, indecent (immodest) dress, is not.  I think some other reviewers who think he is not "strict enough" may have missed this point in this book.  Reason enough for me to whole-heartedly agree with the concept of grace-base parenting is the numerous first-hand examples I've seen of children from "Very Christian Homes" totally leave the faith as soon as they could.  Some returned, others haven't.  Clearly, its time for a new model (though I don't think its "new"...its biblical!).
