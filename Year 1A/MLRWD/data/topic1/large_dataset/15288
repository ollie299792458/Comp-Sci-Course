This 2004 movie has a very unique premise:  Jigsaw, the film's "killer", doesn't actually kill his victims; he puts them in situations where they're forced to fight for their lives.  I thought that made this much more enjoyable than your standard "slash `em up" fare.

The actual killing scenes also brought this up a few notches from your traditional "modern" horror movie.  Each scenario was ingenuous and very suspenseful.  They were also quite gory, but not in a gratuitous sense.  If anything, it added realism and made each of the scenes raw and disturbing in a surprisingly entertaining way.

The only thing that brought this film down was the pace.  It seemed like the action dragged in a few places, especially when it came to the police's pursuit of Jigsaw.  It didn't hurt the film in the long run, though, especially when everything comes together for the surprise ending, which is bound to shock even the most seasoned horror fan.

This is how horror should be done.  Highly recommended.
