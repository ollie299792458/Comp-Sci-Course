The stars I've given this moody English film are mostly for atmosphere.  This story about a company of British footsoldiers in WW1 who stumble upon a haunted German trench could've been a lot better given the great production design and eerie setting.  What is lacking here is a script with some meat on it's bones.  A lot of time is killed watching the soldiers walk slowly around the trench calling each others names.  It just dosen't MOVE.  The acting is good from a young cast that includes ANDY SERKIS from LORD OF THE RINGS fame as the standout character, a psycho named QUINN who scalps Germans for kicks.  The trenches used are superbly spooky, and with a constant rainy grey look the film definitely sets the mood.  Alas, once mood is set nothing is done with it.  The pace is sluggish and the story never explaines any of the goings-on.  This flick takes you to a place you should be frightened of but never shows you (or tells you) what of or why you should be frightened.  The end result is something that drags to the climax which turns out to be anti-climactic to say the least.  A somewhat enjoyable effort that could've benefitted form snappier direction and a solid story.
