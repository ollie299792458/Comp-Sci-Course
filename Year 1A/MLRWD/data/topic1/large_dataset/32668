This movie is appealing in two ways.  First, it is a rip-roaring action-filled western.  Second, it is a movie about personal transformation.

Filled with great one-liners, Clint Eastwood lays some old Kansas style vengeance on the those who killed his family and destroyed his life.  There is a ton of pseudo-history implied with the Kansas Redlegs and the nature of the insurgency in Missouri during the American Civil War.  It is clear from some of the reviews that the author of the original book, perhaps, had some agenda to advance on this issue.  Regardless of how one feels about these things, it still is an exciting Western to watch.

But the best part of the movie is how Clint Eastwood goes from being a simple and happy farmer to being a cold blooded killer back to a decent human being again.  Actors are at their best when they portray those going through personal transformations.  Clint Eastwood begins to show the skills that he has since honed to perfection.

One ironic message in this movie - intended or unintended - is that Clint Eastwood's character actually achieves the complete vengeance by resuming a normal life after the pain of war.
