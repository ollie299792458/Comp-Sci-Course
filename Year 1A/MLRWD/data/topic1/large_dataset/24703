I Love You Phillip Morris is a wonderful movie. It is very obviously about two gay men who are in love, one of whom is an unrepentant conman. Oh, and it's the true story of the main character, Steve. That just makes the movie that much better, after reading up a little on the man, knowing that all of this happened. The only downside is the graphicness of the first few minutes. There is a scene of very uncomfortable, clothed, hetero sex that I could have done without, and a similar scene of gay sex that made me uncomfortable because of the nudity and language used in it. The romantic scenes between Steve and Phillip (Jim and Ewan) were the least graphic in the film, and most were actually very sweet. Basically, if you enjoy seeing romance (not just random sex scenes, but actual romance, with dancing and kissing scenes) between two gay men and don't mind the one graphic scene, watch this movie. It's touching and a little sad. However, if you have a homophobic fiber in your body, don't watch it. It'll just set you off, and the world can do without that rant. ;)
