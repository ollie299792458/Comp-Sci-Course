I was slacked jawed after sitting through this entire movie.  The basic premise was weak and more than a little far fetched - Jennifer Lopez's character decides she can't wait anymore for Mr. Right and wants a baby NOW!  Then after her first try attempt at a sperm bank... she meets Mr. Right and the sparks fly.  Turns out her first attempt was more than successful - she's pregnant with twins.  Mr. Right decides he doesn't care that she's pregnant and pursues her anyway.  (Insert requisite ups/downs/breakups/etc until the required happy ending.)  On paper is doesn't look too horrible.  So what's the problem?

The heroine has no redeeming qualities.  None.  She's whiny, neurotic, controlling and spends much of the time trying to push the hero away because of a childhood trauma.  I don't see how any guy would want to be around her for long once they got past her looks.

One the other hand the male lead is beyond saintly.  He's funny and charming.  He runs a successful business and going back to school to improve himself.  And willing to go into a new relationship with a woman who just got pregnant with twins (that aren't his).  On top of this, he puts up with and embraces all her neurosis and keeps coming back for more as she pushes him away throughout the movie.  I just could not suspend my disbelief that these two would want a relationship - any sort of relationship.
