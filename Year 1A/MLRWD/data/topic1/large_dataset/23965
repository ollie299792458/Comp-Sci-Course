...Building Better Worlds.

This 1986 release from director James Cameron served as many things to many people. On one level, it was an allegory to the relatively recent (at the time) U.S. involvement in the Viet Nam war. Specifically: A well trained military fights an enemy it cannot see and doesn't understand.

For others, it was an indictment of corporate greed for profit at the expense of human lives.

For me, it was a good old fashioned suspense film that integrated Science Fiction and the military quite nicely. The result was a tight story that moved well, despite the fact that the theatrical version was over two hours long. It also featured a new twist in the casting of a woman (Sigourney Weaver) as the reluctant hero Ellen Ripley. Paul Reiser is completely convincing as the consumate company man, and we even get a cameo from "Jonesy" the cat from the first movie.

Excellent movie that won't dissapoint you and leave you drained from the suspense...
