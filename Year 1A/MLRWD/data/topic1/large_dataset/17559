I heard that the release of this DVD was delayed almost a decade, so I was under the assumption that someone somewhere secretly was doing some kind of miraculous digital remastering of the picture. I was shocked and disappointed to find that was not the case. The DVD heralds itself as having marvelous color restoration, in one of the extras, but I see little improvement over the VHS edition. The color is still faded, and the picture is very blurry. I ran some scenes on slow motion, and it looks like it's missing frames - like every other frame is missing. That would mean I only got 50% of the DVD! All the exterior scenes look like they are taking place in fog. With modern computer technology, surely something could have been done with the use of frame estimation, much like as with color estimation, to artificially add frames to make the image crisper and clearer. At the higher DVD price, I can't recommend the purchase of this DVD. I feel like returning it for a refund myself. It has got to be the poorest quality title of the range.
