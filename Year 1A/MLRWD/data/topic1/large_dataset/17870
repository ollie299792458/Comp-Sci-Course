Commando team led by Richard Burton &amp; Clint Eastwood must penetrate a Nazi mountain castle  stronghold against impossible odds to rescue a captured Allied general.  Thoroughly rousing actionfest, with the typical  twisting Alistair MacLean plot.  My old video of this movie is almost worn  out from repeated viewings.  There are several criticisms sometimes leveled  at this film which are off-base.  First: The Helicopter - helicopters were  in development in several forms by Germany during WWII.  Operational  prototypes of the Flettner Fl-282 Kolibri bear suitable enough resemblance  to the helo in the film so as  not to strain credulity.  Second: Nobody  ever reloads - Not true.  If one watches the film closely, both Clint and  Mary Ure, as well as several of the Germans, are shown putting fresh clips  on their burp guns more than once.  Third:  The commandos accomplish things  which are impossible - Perhaps, but anyone who studies the actual exploits  of real commandos during WWII will discover that the action depicted in  Where Eagles Dare is not as unlikely as one might think.  There are, of  course, valid nits to pick with this, or any film.  Forget them, and enjoy  this exciting and action-packed movie.
