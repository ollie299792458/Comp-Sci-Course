Honestly, and I mean this, maybe the worst move I've ever seen in my life.

It's simply unbelieveable that a cast like this would produce such a dreadful bunch of stories to compose a sorry excuse for a movie.  It has appearances by Amy Adams, James Franco, Robert Downey Jr, James Cameron, and more!

The movie is made of several different stories; all are which seem to go nowhere.  The directing is amatueur, the script is terrible, and there is no depth at all to it.

The story starring Amy Adams has a good feel to it, but the whole thing leading up to the ending is boring.

The last one is the worst, just a bunch of confusing scenes to run absolutely nowhere (the guy from the Sopranos tries to hit on women on a sidewalk and keeps getting turned down.  That's it...seriously...that's it.  End credits)  And he's a great actor; what were all these people thinking.

To sum it up, I rented this for $1.00 and I'm still upset.  Absolutely terrible. Save yourself!
