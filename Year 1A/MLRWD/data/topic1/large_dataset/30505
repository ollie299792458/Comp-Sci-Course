A frustrating video to watch.  Much more could have been done to provide details on the precise DNA markers that relate to the various groups of people and to tie the archaeology to the genetic approaches.  The basic introduction to DNA that is provided is helpful, but there is no follow up that offers a more in depth look at the mutations that are key to unraveling the story.  Also, many other researchers have worked with these groups, and these other researchers are hardly mentioned.  It almost unfolds like Wells' own pilgrimage to discover people, with the assumption that nobody else has done it before.  For instance, the Navajo have been studied almost literally to death for more than a century (and they are also one of the later groups to migrate out of Asia to North America -- not the ancestral Native American colonists that they're portrayed as) yet the documentary makes it seems as if he is the first to figure things out.  His ego unfortunately overshadows the good points of the program.
