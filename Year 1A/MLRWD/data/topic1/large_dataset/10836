Disney's effort to make a G-rated drama that adults can enjoy doesn't totally  succeed, but the story of the high school teacher with dreams of playing in the major leagues is nevertheless enjoyable and inspirational.
The biggest drawback of the movie is that if you've seen the previews you can pretty much tell what's going to happen. Also, a number of the characters also are stereotyped, so this film isn't going to win any awards for originality.
In spite of those problems, as well as the fact that Quaid is a bit old for the role, the film does succeed in being uplifting. After all, much of the story is true, even some of the details. It's still fun to see someone defy the odds, and there are some good moral lessons taught in this film as well.  And the kids are cute!
The film is rated G, so there's little here to be offensive (other than some obnoxious product placements). But the rating doesn't automatically mean this film is suitable for kids. Much of the film would be too slow-moving for the little tykes, and children probably aren't going to identify with a high school science teacher. But if you're looking for a pleasant diversion that isn't nearly as hokey as it sounds, this Disney film is worth seeing.
