This movie wasn't that scary,but really it was really funny. Famous actors and actresses like Marlon and Shawn Wayans, Jon Abrahams,and Carmen Electra  star in the movie. They did a really good job in this movie. (I would have  to say that this was their best work ever. They were really funny  characters in the movie. Marlon and Shawn were the funniest in my opinion.)  This movie had scenes fimiliar to THE MATRIX, SCREAM, and I KNOW WHAT YOU  DID LAST SUMMER. It also had plot that were fimiliar to these movies.The  difference was that they were made into funny plots and scenes in the  movie. This movie took place in a small town.It is about a girl who gets  calls from someone, who she doesn't know.(Just in like SCREAM). He tells  her something about what she did last weekend. (Just like in I KNOW WHAT  YOU DID LAST SUMMER). She stars to get scared when her friends start to get  killed by someone. Throughout the movie she tries to figure out who is the  caller and the killer. Doffy who is like a kind of bumb cops istold to  protect her. At the end she does find out who the caller, but it is funny  how she found out. I was really surprised at who was the killer. This movie  was the most funniest yet a little scary I have seen. They won't probably  make a movies like this one in a couple of years. This movie was like some  people say "off the hook". If you have not seen this movie go to  nearest theater and go see it as soon as possible. This is a must see  funny/not that scary at all movie. HURRY AND GO SEE IT.
