This movie is about a world community in South America, The Guarangi Indians.  Many Jesuit priests have gone into the jungle areas and built missions for these people, for the purpose of converting them to Christianity.  "Forcing" a religion or  culture upon someone often will not end up with the desired results.  This movie portrayed the priests as kind and not forceful.  They were in the middle of the jungle to help these people in all ways, not just spiritually. The priests were portrayed as having the purest of intentions.  One such priest was a man who had murdered his brother over a woman and was seeking to pay penance with the Jesuits.  He stood up in defense of the Guarangi in a hearing to decide their status as men or animal.  His vehemence in their defense posed against the other men actually hurt the cause, though her apologized later.  The theme that shown through to me is that the best of intentions may not be enough to spare conflict when two cultures meet.  The Jesuit priests came to do good, but in the end what they did led to the brutal killing of many Guarangi.  I remember the statement of the Judge who was to determine the fate of the missions and of these people.  He was visiting the mission mostly depicted throughout the film. He said as he looked into the eyes of the people he wondered if they truly wished that they(the white men) had never come in contact with them.  The Jesuits gave them a home, but in the end the home they gave them led to their destruction.
