Like almost everyone else says, this is a beautiful example of Film Noir. It has rock-solid performances from the Coens' regulars (McDormand, Polito, Badalucco) as well as a fine cast of today's better actors (Thornton, Gandolfini, Shaloub). The look is spectacular and could have come out of most 40's and 50's hard-boiled detective stories. Some of the scenes are also lit in a Feliniesque super-contrast of light and dark.
Ed Crane suffers from a general ennui and total lack of care about everything. This spills over into his every action. It is this uncaring which prevents him from being emotionally or physically open with his wife. It prevents him from confronting his wife's lover, Dave. It prevents him from truly helping his wife when he finally decides to tell the truth. And it prevents him from taking any real action to save his own life.
However, Ed's detachment is not a result of his actions alone. His wife, friends, and family all work to keep him silent and on the fringe of their lives. This marginalization of Ed finally results in the total collapse of everything around him. In fact, Ed's one attempt to take an active interest in something results in an unwelcome sexual advance from a much younger woman and an horrific crash that nearly kills him.
Joel and Ethan Coen nearly perfectly capture the dissociation from life that is charactaristic of many in this modern age. This is a very good movie held back only by its too many references to 50's pop culture and the somewhat predictable end to Ed's blackmailing of his wife's lover (that is, Dave's attack on Ed and Ed's inadvertant killing of Dave.)
Truly one of the Coens' better works.
