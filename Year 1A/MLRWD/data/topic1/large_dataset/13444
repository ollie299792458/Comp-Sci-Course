First of all...I love "Home Movies". I wont delve into the premise of the show because I know you can find that all out by reading other reviews. But "Home Movies" is probably the best and most underrated show to come along since "Mystery Science Theater 3000". I've been waiting for these DVD's to come out for so long and am happy they finally did (Hope the rest of seasons get released because the show got better each season). Fans of "Dr. Katz" will appreciate "Home Movies", as many of the same people worked on both shows. H. Jon Benjamin is perfect as Coach McGuirk (the funniest character on the show). Jon Katz voices Erik Robbins, Melissa's dad.  Bottom line...it's a great show for adults. It's not a laugh out loud kind of show, rather the humor is derived from the interaction of the characters and the sarcasm that ensues. I especially love the Brendon-McGuirk relationship.  McGuirk isn't so much a father figure to him, but more of a big brother who seems to treat him more as a peer than an 8 year old kid. The first season is a little rough, but I reccommend you pick it up and give it a try...you'll like it. I gave it 4 stars because there wasn't enough extra features. The commentary seems like it's just Loren (one of the creators), Brendon, and H. Jon having a conversation at a bar dubbed over the episode...and the interviews weren't too informative, but it was fun to hear the guys talk about the process of the show. And by the way, McGuirk really sounds exactly like how H. Jon talks. He doesn't have to do anything with his voice for that one. Bottom Line...get this set, give it a chance, and enjoy one of the best animated shows to come out in a LONG time.
