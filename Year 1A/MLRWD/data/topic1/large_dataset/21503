This B & W Hitchcock film is definitely going to be near the top of my list for favorite films -- and what is amazing is that this movie was made almost 70 years ago.  It stands up very well.  The action never stops, the story is intriguing, and there are some very funny lines in it -- some that are slyly suggestive in a witty way.  The European setting (first in a mountain chalet in a fictitious country and then on a train) combine with some pre-World War II political commentary, particularly about pacifism and the brutality of the enemy they are facing.  There are jokes about the English (every English person on the train will all be in the dining car having tea at 4, notes one character)

The plot involves a woman who vanishes on a train while her young friend is taking a nap.  When she asks where the woman is, everyone denies having seen her with anyone.  She is made to feel that she's hallucinating the whole thing, perhaps as a result of a head injury.  She's certain enough to not give up trying to find out what happened to the woman, and is joined in her efforts by a rakish young man.

I think this is definitely my favorite Hitchcock.  I highly recommend this movie.
