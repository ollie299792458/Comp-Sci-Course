Clearly there is plenty of debate over which is better--Wyatt Earp or Tombstone.  Those of you who enjoy splashy hollywood fluff and don't care to think, stick to the latter.  The former, on the other hand, is one of the greatest modern westerns available--no doubt in a league including Open Range and Unforgiven--showing the heroic mythical figure along with the "warts and all" realistic character that was more likely.  
Although it is certainly longer than Tombstone, I don't think this takes away from Wyatt Earp.  Rather the subtle character touches, the incredible cinematography, and overwhelmingly stunning soundtrack by James Newton Howard make this film something of a wonder to watch and listen to.  Kevin Costner is magnetic as a heroic character who has the ultimate flaw of being a man of his times--a scoundrel and womanizer who puts himself and his family first.  Dennis Quaid is equally convincing and intense as Doc Holliday, Earp's skeletal side-kick.
The laserdisc transfer a few years ago (10 years already??) made Wyatt Earp incredible to experience--I cannot wait until the DVD release!!  This is the sort of film that DVD was made for!
