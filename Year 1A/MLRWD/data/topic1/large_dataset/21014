I enjoyed this movie. Goldie Hawn was exceptional this being one of her earlier films. Steven Spielberg directed this before he became well known for his other mega hit movies like Jaws.

It's a true story about a young mom who wants her baby back after the baby has been taken away from her by child welfare shortly after she was released from a womans prison. She travels to visit her husband who is in a short release prison farm (only 4 months left of his term)and forces him to escape and help her get their baby. Reluctantly he does and along the way they come to kidnap a young Texas Patrol officer and the chase is on towards Sugarland.

Though it's a true story, the movie depicts the action to take place over a two day period when in actual fact it was only several hours. But still the story is interesting and heart warming. You can't help fall in love with the innocence of the three main characters in this true life adventure. There is comedy, and action but most of all hope. I highly recommend watching this movie.
