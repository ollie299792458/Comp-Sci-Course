I really enjoyed this movie primarily due to seeing how hard the kids worked to achieve their goals.  Yes, the parents were highly involved, one in particular a bit too much, but the kids were highly self motivated and it showed in their work ethic and dedication.

There was a comment earlier about how a poor student could never win the Bee.  And I will admit, it was eye opening to see what some of the more affluent parents put into training their kids (language tutors, spelling tutors).  I still thought the fact that Ashley White and Angela from TX made this as far as they did showed poor kids could have a chance of winning.  I thought they did great.  I was really, really upset learning what happened to Ashley White as she moved to high school.  Another teen parent, it made me more incensed at her mother.  I really disliked her throughout the movie.  She had no clue the opportunity this Bee was for her daughter, a great networking opportunity to help match her daughter up with mentor to get her out of the typical SE DC mentality.  All she seemed to care about was the $10,000.  Just a sorry excuse for a mother.

As you can see the movie really draws you into the kids lives.  Definitely a great movie to own!!
