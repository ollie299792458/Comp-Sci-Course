This movie is really touching. I heard about it and thought it sounded cheesy, but the first time I wacthed it, it made me cry because it is so  believable and you can really relate to the characters! Jake Gyllenhaal  (who is very fine and my favorite actor) plays Homer so well you'd think it  was really him. And the Rocket Boys make a great team. I think Mrs. Hickam  could have had a bigger say in everything, it wasn't until the very end  that she came through and actually said her piece about what a jerk Mr.  Hickam was being. The ending is pretty predictable but it is still a movie  you need to watch all the way through. Laura Dern doesn't seem to fit as  the teacher, but I cried just the same when she got sick. Teachers are  definately an inspiration and helped Homer when he couldn't count on his  parents. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Parents don't have to be  afraid for their kids to watch, it is a family movie and totally clean.  There are a few swear words (hence the PG rating) but really nothing bad. A  movie everyone of any age should watch, it has a great lesson and any one  can relate to it.
