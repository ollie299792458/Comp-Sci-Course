Martin Scorsese has done it again.  He has managed to tell a New York story unlike any one else.  He has managed to mix both fact and fiction seemlessly.  The story is based on the gang wars of the Five Points neighborhood of New York City during the Civil War conscription riots.  The groups the gangs "represent" are the nativists, the people who were born in America and the various immigrant Irish gangs.  The movie portrays the story about who is going to control the five points area, one of the most notorious slums in the United States during the Civil War period.
The two lead characters are Cutter the Butcher played by Daniel-Day Lewis and Amsterdam played by Leonardo DiCaprio.  Cutter is the leader of the nativist gang and is vicious.  He beats on the immigrants and thinks nothing of mudering them in daylight.  Amsterdam is the leader of the Irish immigrants opposing Cutter.  A subtext to the story is that Cutter murdered Amsterdam's father in the opening scene of the movie and Amsterdam is seeking revenge.
The movie is both stunning and stark to watch.  Scorsese has done a magnificent job of rebuilding the Five Corners and bringing it to life.  Scorsese depicts brilliantly the squalor of the poor and the missionaries who live among them trying to help.  
Scorsese also uses the Civil War Conscription riots as a backdrop to the gang wars.  As the tension builds over the gangs, the tension over the Civil War also builds among New York.  If a person was drafted into the Army, they could buy their way out for a sum of $300 which was more than a years pay for the poor.  The buyout was for the rich to avoid sending their sons to battle.  The movie closes with the final battle between the two groups during a city wide riot over the conscription.
The Gangs of New York is just under 3 hours long and the time flies.  This movie is well worth watching and makes a nice addition for the personal library.
