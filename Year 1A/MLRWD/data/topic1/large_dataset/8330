The movie in a my opinion starts off reviewing relationships that could've happened to any normal guy. John Cusack (Rob) seems to reflect all of us. The book which is based in London, is followed faithfully by the movie.(except for the fact that the movie takes place in Chicago) We also find out that Laura,Robs faithful girlfriend has left, leaving Rob an empty shell of a man. Next we are introduced to Championship Vinyl a Semi-Failing record store that lies in a not too popular part of Chicago. Here we find the comic relief of the movie, Dick and Barry. Barry's part is played brilliantly by Jack Black. And Dick's part is played by Todd Louiso. Rob along with his two sidekicks spend the store parts of the movie, dumping on customers who have no musical knowledge and coming up with top five lists. Rob becomes obsessed with getting Laura back and eventually does. And in the end everybody's happy. But it's not corny or sugary at all. Overall the scenes in the record shop are the best and should be watched multiple times to get all the subtle references and jokes.
