Yvette Chauvire allowed them to use her name?  Incroyable!  The principals were better than the soloists and corps, but that wasn't a major achievement.  Only Myrtha came out with anything approaching glory at the end.  Roberto Bolle is a lovely cipher.  Svetlana Zakharova was someone of whom I had great hopes on the strength of her La Fille du Pharaon.  Was I in for a letdown.  Her Giselle is successful only in relation to her lamentable Odette/Odile.  Technically, she's exquisite when she isn't being sublime.  Her lack of emotional resonance renders all her accomplishments hollow.  I have seen live and on video Alicia Alonso, Carla Fracci, Dominique Khalfouni, and Natalia Makarova to name but a few, and in alphabetical order I hasten to note.  To none of the above can Svetlana hold a candle.  Alicia, largely blind and over 60 when I last saw her dance the role made more of it.  To be a dancer is one thing, to be an artist is quite another.  I found the narrative elements and the lighting design elements to be laughable in their inconsistency or flagrant disregard for the story.  At least we poor punters who pay our money for tickets or dvds deserve to have the sun come up at the end of Act II.  It's a simple enough lighting effect.  It's an important storytelling point.  Did we get one?  No.  Obviously it was too much trouble.  Again the camera was far too close to the action too much of the time, but it wasn't as choppy as in the Swan Lake.
