Pongo and Perdita are the proud parents of 15 dalmatian puppies. When an  old friend of the family, Cruella De Ville, shows up offering to buy all  the pups, the trouble begins. Soon it's a madcap, fun-filled race to find  99 missing puppies before they're turned into coats!
This is a classic  Disney animated film. It contains several wonderful, memorable moments...  such as Cruella's confrontation with Roger, and the courtship of Roger and  Anita.
The animation is bar none. As far as stylized, caricaturized  animation goes, this is one of the top five to watch for believable, fluid  movement. The characters, mostly, are unique and unforgettagle.
The score  is par for the course, though it has the same feel as the score for Jungle  Book. (Dalmatians actually came out first...) The three actual songs in the  film are quite hummable and entertaining, but this is definitely not what  one may categorize as a musical.
For sheer entertainment, 101 Dalmatians  is at its best during the suspense scenes, of which there are many. Quite  an interesting (and somewhat scary...) movie.
Anyone who is picky about  their animation will notice the re-use of many "cycles", which  was pretty much a necessity when you're talking about drawing 99 puppies  running through the snow.
In addition, there are a few points in the  movie where the action wanes and the plot slows down a little too much.  That's about the worst thing I can say about the story...
Overall  impression: 101 Dalmatians is a must-have for your movie library. Though  the video is currently out of production, it is still available on DVD.  Animators and hopeful in particular will find a great reference piece in  this film.
And Cruella DeVille is cool...
