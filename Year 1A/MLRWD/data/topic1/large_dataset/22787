I am a first time mom and for the first four weeks of my dear sons life he did nothing but cry and fuss.  We rarely had a night where he didn't wake crying and not just from hunger.  I was reading an article during a late night feeding and saw something on there in regards to the Happiest Baby on the Block method.  I thought "I have read everything there is to read on how to calm an infant..I doubt this would help."

The next morning I saw Dr. Karp on "The View" and watched the method at work and took that as a sign.  I called my husband that minute and had him order the DVD from Amazon.com.  The night it arrived we swaddled him, tipped him on his side and shushed him according to the way the DVD told us to and he slept 6 hours straight.

Although the long sleep time has not continued our child is so much happier then he ever has been and still responds to swaddling and shushing.  He takes three naps a day and only gets up once or twice to eat at night in a 12 hours period.

I was doing several of the things in the DVD before our baby arrived but the "way" I was doing them was not working.

We are SO grateful for this DVD (I bought the book too!) that we have told everyone we know and friends and family are amazed at how fast he calms down with the 5 S'in any situation.

I have had a white noise machine for 10 years and never had a use for it until now so combining that with the other steps really saved us!

Thanks Dr. Karp!!
