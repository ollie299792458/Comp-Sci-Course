It's just a short while after the third set of murders, and Jason Voorhees is supposedly dead, in the hospital.  However, he kills the workers on duty there and escapes back to Camp Blood once more to see if he can once and for all mark his territory.

He starts with the "lonely, undressed girl", follows with a spear to a man's no-touch area, and then moves to the teens' house to finish it all up.  However, there is the next door neighbor, Trish, and the smart 12-year old Tommy Jarvis, who plays a big role in the other Jason films.  Together, they do what they have to do, and that leads up to the end, where we see two interesting things: Jason unmasked AGAIN and then Tommy's hacking skill, where he splits Jason into quarter-inch pieces, or at least that's what I would have thought, judging from the 20 rapid-succession hits he did.

However, Jason is back in Friday the 13th: Part VI.  In the fifth movie, something else goes on, and I think it is a little too disappointing to care about seeing.

Happy hauntings!
