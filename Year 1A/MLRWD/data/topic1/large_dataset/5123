I watched this movie on my widescreen in my family room. Not only did it stink up the family room, but it stunk up the whole house. Costner stinks as an actor. I promised myself in the past that I would never watch a movie with Costner in it, but I broke my own promise. I'm very sorry I did because I wasted 2 hours of my life.

Let me give you just one small detail why this movie stinks (do not read on if you don't want to hear how this ends). In the end Costner and Kutcher are hanging on a 2,000 lb. steel cable dangling from a helicopter that is starting to unravel. With equipment they might weight 600 lbs. Because the story creators want to have a sad ending they decide that Costner will un-hook from the cable and drop to his death. The helicopter is apparently over 100 feet above the water so that any drop is certain death. Now anybody writing a story such as this would just let the helicopter descend to an appropriate height so that the swimmer could drop and not kill himself, but in this movie it would mess up the ending that they engineered.

Surprising Kutcher is actually a good actor and really out shines Costner. Kutcher may have a future in quality movies, but Costner never will.

How anybody could have rated this contrived boring movie above a 1 star is beyond me, I recommend that you don't waste your time on this flick.
