After Wes Craven's first film Last House on the Left he became known as gross, perverted, and depraved. This film explores the same gruesome topic that Last House did, the human instinct of vielence. Although this film takes a "reation vielence" turn rather than sexual vielence that Last House whent so deeply in. This film shows how 2 differnt families slowly switch sides. The movie begins with a simple kicked back family on a road trip who stumble into the wrong part of the country and are confronted with a canabalistic family who live in the rocky hills and try to get what they need out of the unexpected family, such as: food (the other families baby), supplies (stealing whatever they can), and pleasure (they're daughters body, the joy of killing for no reason). The helpless travelers become stranded and are now victoms to the savage family whatching from the hills. After one of the dogs and several family members are mutilated the ramaining survivors fight back in the same brutal fasion as the killers. The films final conclusion takes place when you realize that the people being killed have become as cold and nasty as the killers. This film whent where few other films have gone but made a powerful statement that is'nt to be passed by. Many ot the audiences responded to the film as worthless trash, but beneath the campy advertissments and cult fans this is a very well done film thats not trying to give a good friday night flick to show your girlfriend. Whatch this with caution and an openmind to respect the message it's trying to give you.
