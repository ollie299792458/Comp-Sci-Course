I'm not the first person to review this movie, and I'm certain I won't be the last. I WILL stand with many of the other reviewers who encourage a more "balanced" perspective of the film, and not the "berzerker-rage" perspective which some reviewers have offered.

ENERGY & ESSENCE:
My review of the movie can be summarized in the headline of this review. Hugh Jackman's fourth performance as Logan truly is "The Best There Is." Whether it is because the movie's purpose is to focus solely on Logan, or because Hugh has evolved as an actor, or because Hugh has grown closer to the character. Jackman captures the full emotional bandwidth of the character. The pathos, the irony. the overwhelming sense of loss that comes with over 100 years of life on the planet. Part of Logan's appeal as a character has been that he is always seeking to become more than what he is. "Gifted" with "powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men," he sees himself as an animal "less than human." A Samurai without a master, who sees himself as a "failed samurai," etc... The movie, and Jackman's naturally-enhanced physique and dramatic performance perfectly captures all of that ENERGY of the character.

Throughout the movie, Logan is surrounded by people who see either the "light" or the "dark" in him, and as such, the character is continually pulled in different directions, and tested, and as a result - grows. Whether it is the father who raised him - who sees the best in him, or later in life Kayla Silverfox, who acts as a guiding moral beacon to Logan, reminding him over and over that "he is not an animal." They are (unfortunately) outnumbered by those who see the "dark" in him, including his mother, Victor and Stryker - the latter two who continually seek to exploit Logan's dark side to fulfill their own purposes. And Logan himself finds out that focusing too much on his dark side usually results in him paying a price of some sort.

PULSING & PUMPING THEMES:
Someone once said that a great musical score can elevate a move to "the next level." Part of what DRIVES this "testosterone-filled" film is the music. It reaches its successful goal elegantly, and "dovetails" perfectly with the on-screen action, supporting it without overpowering it, or drawing disproportionate attention to itself. There is a solid foundation of pulsing rhythms that are tribal in nature. However, much like Logan himself, the music combines the base primal urges with aspirational tones. A mix of classical and contemporary instruments help give certain tracks a nice sharp "edge."

Some characters have their own unique "themes" yet even these often have a "hook" of familiar notes/chords which remind us that these characters all reflect different facets of Logan himself. This often subtle "echo" also helps the entire soundtrack hold together as one cohesive entity.

All-in-all - Harry Gregson-Williams' score reflects the pure masculine energy of the character - both his "light" and "dark" sides as he grows against challenges - internal and external.

CONTRIVANCES - "Marvelwood" & "Hollywood":
I have seen the film in the theatre more than once. The first time I viewed the film, I felt there were elements that were very contrived.
Immediately after that viewing, I went to my "LCS" (local comic shop) to fill in some of the "gaps" in my knowledge of Logan's published history in the past twenty years. In anticipation of the film, Marvel Comics published  a comic called "Wolverine: Weapon X Files" - which is an inexpensive "encyclopedia" listing the chronological history of Logan and his supporting cast.

The truth of the matter is that the published history of Logan has been "retconned" to be a LOT more contrived and convoluted than this film was (I mean, "Romulus" ? "The Lupine Sect" ? "Death" ? "Shogun" ? "Daken" ? "Elektra" ? and of course - "more," come on...) The filmmakers (including Jackman) did a VERY fine job of "stripping away" some of those cumbersome contrivances in order to more clearly communicate the pure ESSENCE of the character and his driving forces, as clearly defined years ago by Claremont, Byrne, Miller and Smith.

If the film had slavishly followed the published history of the character for the past 20 years, as some reviewers had wished for, here's what would have happened:
- A small "comic-fan-boy" percentage of movie goers would have been orgasmically excited
- The larger percentage of movie goers would have been left scratching their heads
- All movie goers would have been spending too much time "in their head" and not in their "emotional heart," leaving the same cerebral feeling that "Watchmen" did.
- A shorter run in theaters (it's on its eighth week as of this writing), and less revenue
- Shorter Run + Less Revenue = Less Demand for Additional Movies
- Most Importantly - the primal feeling, passion, conflict and ENERGY of Logan would have been lost.

- No, in reality, Victor is NOT Logan's brother, or even half-brother
(but, he's also not his father either. That was a red herring for years in the comics)
- No, Cyclops never met Logan before the X-Men
- No, Logan never met Gambit before the X-Men
- No, The Blob nor Deadpool were ever part of Team X
- No, Stryker was not associated with Weapon X (but then again, he was never a General either...)
- No, Logan's memory was not erased with a "really-well-placed-bullet" to the head

However - all of these "adjustments" are less contrived than some of the "retcons" in the comics these days, and may be acceptable "prices to pay" since they made the FILM work better as a representational, cohesive whole, easier to follow for the majority of viewers, and fulfill it's Ultimate Purpose as a vehicle for the character of Logan / Wolverine.

IN (*SNIKT !*) SUMMARY:
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" strongly succeeds in conveying the pure "testosterone-filled" masculine energy of the character, and the overall essence of the character - his conflicted journey as he strives to become more than what he has been, and some of the key emotional relationships in his past. The filmmakers have wisely chosen to streamline 20+ years of needless published exposition & contrivances - in order to focus on the strong CORE of the character, which is what has "hooked" readers and moviegoers for the past 34 years

Logan / Wolverine is not the "deepest" or "most profound" character ever to grace the printed page, or the cinema screen. The essence of the character is primal, direct, but never simple or two-dimensional. But, in the words of the fictional character himself, in his niche, he is "the best there is at what he does." And more importantly, so is the Driving Force behind this film: Hugh Jackman.

WARNING: If you are a continuity-obsessed-fanboy, this film may cause anxiety, elevated blood-pressure, and in some cases hemorrhaging.
