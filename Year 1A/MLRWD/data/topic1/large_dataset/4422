This will always remain one of my favorite films of all time.  After seeing it I can finally understand the reasons why James Dean has such a following.  He is what everyone either envisions himself as or wishes to  be.  In my mind, you can't quite label him an anti-hero in this movie.  You  have to show his character respect. In my mind, what makes this film great  is what you might find fault with in other films.  At times it seems overly  melodramatic and so emotional it seems painful to watch.  But this ain't no  "Titanic."  Somehow, all this intense emotion is what gives the  film its power.  When you are in high school everything seems as though it  is a life or death situation.  Who can honestly say that they weren't  utterly self-absorbed at that age and even in the present?  All the typical  themes are included such as unrequited love, fitting in, complex family  relations, and violence(today kids might have guns but name another scene  as riveting and dangerous as the switchblade fight). The additions to the  widescreen version are very worthwhile and offer some extra insight.  Is it  just me or does Natalie Wood seem on edge during her interview?  The Dean  "safe driving" interview is also rather interesting if not kind  of sick.
