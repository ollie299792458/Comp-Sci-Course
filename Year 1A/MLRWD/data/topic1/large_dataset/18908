This box set brings together all three "That's Entertainment!' movies along with many, many extras and special features. Anyone who has a passing interest in musicals or Hollywood's classical era would be advised to get hold of these DVDs!

Each of the movies come along with introductions (by TCM host Robert Osborne) and a trailer, and disc 4 has `behind the scenes' featurettes on the films, as well as contemporary TV spots on the films' releases and footage from the premiers.

The high points for me are `That's Entertainment! 3', including its selection of out-takes such as Garland's `Mr Monotony' and the wry and illuminating commentary from Esther Williams and Lena Horne. There is also a great documentary on the making of `That's Entertainment! 3' that focuses on the talents behind the screen such as the choreographers, composers and arrangers - people who are often overlooked in favour of the stars. There are some great comments, such as the one by Ann Miller who points out how callous Busby Berkeley was for making her carry on tapping when she had a bleeding blister.

Finally, there is a treasure trove of out-takes on disc 4 featuring Garland, Horne, Williams, Allyson, and so on; not all of them are great, but they're all very entertaining!
