I really enjoy this movie. I've seen it over and over. I think that what I liked most about it was the fact that the lead character, Jackie, decides to take a chance when push comes to shove. She recognizes that even though she's somewhat at the mercy of some very powerful men, including gun dealer Ordell and ATF agent Ray, she's smart enough to realize that they're both cocky and overly confident, and she can use this weakness to not only break away from both their control, but she can play them against each other and also get the money. She even plays Max Cherry a little, using his infatuation with her to her own advantage.
There is one scene where Jackie, knowing Ordell is coming to her home after she's bailed out of jail, has a gun hidden and ready. She could have ended up a victim like Beaumont, but she knows Ordell for what he really is and not only gets out of the jam she's in, but actually gets HIM to work for HER in her scheme.
There is also another very telling scene where Jackie comes home late one night and has a message on her answering machine from Max and he gives her something like 3 different phone numbers, and you can just sense the weariness in Jackie. In fact, I imagined her thinking "men are so predictable."
