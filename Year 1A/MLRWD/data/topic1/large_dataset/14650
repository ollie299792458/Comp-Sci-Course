Where to start? Where to start?! Perhaps, in my humble opinion, one of the funniest and snappiest comedies you will ever see. Think the Blazzing Saddles of the cold war... Think The Apartment of psychiatry! James Coburn glides shark-like through an ensemble piece of American Dream cold war paranoia. Shocked to find his star patient is actually a government agent and sometime state sactioned hitman, we find our happless hero propelled into a psychadelic rollercoaster ride as he realises he has been chosen to become the eponimous President's Analyst. Chaos ensues as the world's goverments try to kill or kidnap him. Even his own FBR want him dead. The fact that CIA and FBI were changed in postproduction (sometimes clunkily) to FBR and CEA stands tribute to how strangely subversive a movie we have here. The set pieces in the restaraunt and the attempted assassination at the hippie commune at amongst the best scenes in sixties pop culture ever to make it onto the big screen! I would take this movie into space with me if i could take no other form of entertainment!
