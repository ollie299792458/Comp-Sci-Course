I bought this DVD compilation of the original Ultraman TV series of the 60s to replace a defective copy I had bought at a dollar store some months ago.  To my relief, this copy is in very good condition and plays well.  There is a lot of action in these Ultraman shows, even though it's pretty cheesy production values.  You can tell the sets and props are miniatures.  You have the option of watching the shows in the original Japanese, with English subtitles, or watching the shows dubbed in English.  On the last video, there is an interview with the actors who voiced the old "Speed Racer" cartoon, who also did the dubbing for the English version of Ultraman.  It had been so long since I had seen this series, I really did not remember any of the episodes, other than just bits and pieces.  It brought back memories of my childhood watching the series and hearing the music.  Boy, the Japanese really love their monsters!  That's all Ultraman ever fought-monsters and mutated plants.  But the actors in the Science Patrol are all very good-looking!
