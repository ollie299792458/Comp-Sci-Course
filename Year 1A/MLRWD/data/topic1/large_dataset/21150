I thoroughly enjoyed this original and intelligently made film, but I think that in order to do so, you really have to leave your pre-conceptions at the video shop door. If you pick a film wanting it to be something, then you're gonna be annoyed when it's not. My advice on Wendigo is just to watch it. Don't expect it to be anything, no matter what anyone says. Not deliverance, not a monster movie, not the blair witch, not Halloween. Give yourself some credit - you can watch something new and unique can't you? The story follows a young couple and their son on a weekend away up in the snow covered countryside. They have a run in with some local hunters on their way to the house, and as the weekend unfolds the young boy becomes aware of the Wendigo - a powerful spirit of Indian legend. Gradually the young family, the hunters, and the legend all become entangled as the film reaches it's conclusion. The performances are great, and the script is full of realism, purpose and pace. The dream sequences and visuals are extremely creepy, and atmospheric. The fact that a lot of people seem to think that this is a monster movie about a Deer-man is absolutely hysterical!! The Wendigo is an ancient spirit, one that takes on many forms (which incidently it does in the film). Just think about why it takes on the forms that it does, and then maybe you will draw your conclusions as to the spirit's intentions. And this for me was the real driving force and mystery behind the film. The Wendigo's purpose depends entirely on you. Maybe it is the unseen force that guards and provides the purpose in life. Maybe it's the keeper of the balance amongst all living things. Maybe it's just a big old tree that scares little kids. What you bring to this movie will ultimately determine what you'll take from it. Just don't dismiss it, open your mind and enjoy it.
