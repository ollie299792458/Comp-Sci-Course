"It's Kinda of a Funny Story" is the archetypal film I've come to expect from Focus Features - good acting, serious drama and enough comedic moments to draw the viewer in and offset the heavier moments. Zach Galifianakis is great in his support role; he really ties the whole story together as the wise character Bobby who seems to know everything about the people and inner workings of their unit. This "all-knowing" quality is the only characteristic that at times seems a bit inauthentic in the character. However, his personal story as a father struggling to overcome suicidal ideation is a refreshing change from the roles we usually see from Galifianakis. Keir Gilchrist delivers a fantastic performance as Craig, a teen trying to deal with all sorts of pressures from family, friends, and himself. The number of cutaway fantasy gags give the viewer a glimpse into his psyche and are usually hilarious and something most people can relate to. Having worked in a mental health hospital, I can say that in spite of a few film industry liberties, it is a rather authentic portrayal of life in a program for people with various psychological issues. Definitely worth seeing.
