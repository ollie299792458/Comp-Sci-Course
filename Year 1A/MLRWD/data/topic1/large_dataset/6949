If you're the kind of person whose idea of a good movie is an action film, and you don't care for movies where almost all the action happens inside  the characters, this movie is not for you. But if what you look in the  cinema its a film with a perfect cast, directed by an artist filmmaker,  with a brillant screenplay, based on a novel of one of the best writers of  the century: The End of the Affair is a sure bet.  Based on a Graham  Green's novel, The End Of the Affair was originally made in the 50s with  Deborah Kerr as the unfaithfull wife and Van Johnson as the jealous lover.  I confess that I saw the 90s version completelly virgin because I haven't  read the book, or seen the earlier version, so with nothing to compare Neil  Jordan's version, I absolutelly loved this film. Why? Let me count the  ways: First the screenplay: beautiful dialogues, one liners and silences;  all the characters are extraordinary and the plot is full of surprises;  Second: The cast; They are perfect: Ralph Fiennes as the jealous lover is  better than in The English Patient, maybe  because Julianne Moore, as the  enigmatic Sarah, makes  believable all the passion felt for her by  the men  on the story(and the boy too); and I shouldn't forget the unpassionate  husband(why did she married him?), the clumsy and sentimental private  detective, and his marked boy, and God, who is the big antagonist of the  film. Neil Jordan, always a great director, never have been better than  with The End of the Affair, making a  strange jewel: A beautiful and  intelligent love story.
