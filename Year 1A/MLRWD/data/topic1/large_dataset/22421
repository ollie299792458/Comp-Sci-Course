As stated above, I consider this to be John Wayne's finest film
(just edging out The Searchers). There are many things to enjoy
about this movie . For one thing , the look of it. Shot in Ireland
in gorgeous, rich technicolor, director John Ford's insistance
to film there rather than the Hollywood backlots means this is
really an Irish film. When Barry Fitzgerald's character says
"ah, 'tis a nice, soft evening ", you can almost smell the soft
rain falling. There has never been a better Irishman in movies
than Barry Fitzgerald. To those of us who have seen this film
many times his lines & witty asides are a constant joy.
The casting throughout is superb from Ward Bond's catholic
priest to Victor Mclagen's alpha male. The chemistry between
John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara is natural & wonderful & must have
been a film they both remembered fondly . This is one of the
all-time great love stories & like "Casablanca" it's romance
is enhanced by everything else about it being perfect ----
direction, casting, location, dialogue & cinematography .
