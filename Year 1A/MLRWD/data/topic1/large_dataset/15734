I've never been a great admirer of Paul Thomas Anderson.
Don't get me wrong. I've loved his films. But they were never
particularly memorable for me.
Hard 8 was great. A good rental. I couldn't get into Boogie Nights
because of the 'hoopla' surrounding it. Tainted my viewing pleasure.
That and Marky Mark.
And then I saw Magnolia. Not only did Anderson get a perfect
performance out of Cruise. But he made a brilliant film. I figured
that was it. The same way I felt after finishing watching Cronenberg's
Spider.
"There's just no way someone can top that. No way."
I just finished watching Anderson's Punch Drunk Love.
He might not have topped Magnolia. But PDL is equally as impressive.
And it just FLIES by. Great story. Great cast. And Sandler is
inspired. Shame he doesn't get more parts like this. But from looking
what's out there. I guess there aren't many to be had.
Anderson has matured visually from Magnolia. PDL exists in its own
very private universe where sharp reds and blues contrast on
labyrinthine whites. Someone that went to film school could describe
it much better than I can. So I won't even try. Very beautiful film.
Has a tender fragility that is always on the verge of exploding into
violence and rage.
Right on the edge. Of everything known.
Highly recommended.
