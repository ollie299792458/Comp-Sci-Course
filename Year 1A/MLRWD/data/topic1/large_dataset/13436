I dare anyone to say anything negative about this movie.  I cannot think  of one element of this movie that disappointed me.  I love the romance  between Miss Lucy Honeychurch and Mr George Emerson.  I adore the  frustrating, "poor Charlotte Bartlett", Lucy's travel companion  and thorn-in-her-side in matters of the heart.  I love Cecil, wonderfully  pompous Cecil.  I want to be like Eleanor Lavish, the adventure-seeking,  scandal-relishing novelist Charlotte and Lucy meet in Florence.  Freddy and  Mr Beebe provide delightful comic relief, as do the lovely Miss Allens.  And who could not love George's doddering old Dad, Mr Emerson, especially  when he upsets a tour group with his travelogue asides?  If anyone is  worried that their favourite book will suffer at the hands of uncaring,  ignorant film makers, please, unfurrow your brow and see this movie.  E.M.  Forster's characters are brought to life by some of Britain's finest  actors.  The film is wonderfully scripted, beautifully filmed and  majestically located.  (There are only a handful of films that can claim to  have created travel pangs in my Aussie-bound Dad.)  It is a film I enjoy  coming back to over and over again.
