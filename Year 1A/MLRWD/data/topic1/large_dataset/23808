I got sick of pre-presidential politics on CNN, MSNBC and FOX. I'd watch Nick to clear my mind of the same old lies and exaggerations I'd hear, when I discovered "AVATAR the LAST AIR BENDER," on Nickolodean  That was it, I was hooked on the story line and the extremely complex characters. This without exaggeration is one of the best epic cartoons (I almost shudder to label it a cartoon) it's more of a "HOW TO" for parent who want to teach their children, morals, ethics, and dealing in real life decisions, with all the barriers they'll face as young adults.

I'm a nurse educator in my late 50's and even I enjoy this work almost as much as Shakespeare's works.  It's so well written with as many twists, turns and bi-phasic characters as King Lear or the War of the Roses have, (the REAL ONE, not the one in which Danny De Vito played.)

I'd hope Nick or some other very smart producer will pick up these characters and this story line, making it into a 3 or even 4 part epic movie series. I have a feeling its moral values will outweigh anything that the Harry Potter series had!

All I can say is, it's an amazingly executed story, excellently written as a role model for any kid or even young adult in today's very convoluted world of good vs bad and the extreme blurring between the two.
It's outstanding and I for one will recommend it to anyone: kid, teen or even an old geezer, who's tired of the real cartoons we see in Political Arena today..i.e., the ones with the Democrats and Republicians that are supposed to be reality. I loved to see Toph "earthbend" all the politicians and bury them in their lies, far, far under the earth's several layers so we can all sit and watch a real story of life, Avatar, the Last Air Bender."
