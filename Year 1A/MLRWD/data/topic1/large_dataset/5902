Obviously this boxset hasnt been released yet but wanted to share the following for any that may be thinking about it for the upcoming holidays.

Harry Potter hasnt been released in the US on HD DVD yet but one of the titles has been released for HD DVD in England last year. Since HD DVD is region free you can find online domestic retailers to purchases these imported discs.

I have to say this was the first imported title I ever purchased and was hesitant due to it being about $10 more then what I normally would pay but anxious to see Harry in High Def I purchased the movie from exploitedcinema.

This has definitely been one of my favorite movies in my collection for showing off HD DVD. Great picture quality and also including one of the first trueHD audio tracks for the format this is a great purchase.

The begining of the film shows the normal US Federal warning against pirating which has me wondering if the film has been encoded and ready for release for over a year now but as so many other titles held up by Warner waiting for Blu-ray to get there act together.
