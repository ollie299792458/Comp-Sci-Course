I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, and nothing scares me. For many year's I've looked for a truly scary, under your skin type movie that leaves you jittery and sick, after many years of looking, i finally found it, Dead Birds.This movie is disturbing, creepy, atmospheric, and is perhaps the scariest movie i have ever seen. When a group of soldiers make way into a house for the night with a bundel of gold they had just stolen from a bank, they take refuge in an old abandoned house. The house has its secrets that are locked within the spirits that haunt the house, and as time wears on each character becomes more and more aware to the horrors that took place. Filled with creepy and disturbing settings, gore (there arent many kills, but when they happen, they are strong, graphic, and very bloody) - many disturbing images, many scenes that make you jump, and an overall terrifying but yet joyful horror ride that will stay under your skin for more than one night - do not watch it at night - it will scare the daylights out of you, just as it did me.
