This was my first John Waters movie-so it's definately my favorite by him, one of my favorite Kathleen Turner movies-2nd being War o/the Roses.
Now, to the review.
Aside from two graphically violent scenes-this movie is a twisted riot!
The prank phone call scene, her twisted sense of morality and the murders leading up to the trial were hilarious!
I just found out it's getting the collector's edition treatment...I WANT IT!
I have the first edition on DVD, worth everything, this edition will not change my opinion of the film. I've loved it since I was 13(27 now) I wish I didn't have to wait till May, oh well.

I wish I could update my review, because I've got some new praise for the movie. I now have the coll. edition, watched it twice with the commentary-with John Waters and Kathleen Turner, and it sounds like from that, Kathleen had a lot of fun with this film, who wouldn't? The features are perfect, the picture is much clearer, subtitles are on every feature, I've heard Ms. Turner wasn't interested in doing the movie until she read the script-according to the commentary, that rumor was essentially false, although I think John Waters was insistent on having her play her.
The commentary with John is pretty funny too, I heard it numerous times in the other edition, and though it's somewhat outdated, it's still pretty informative not to mention entertainment, I can certainly relate to the idea that this film was clearly ahead of its time.
