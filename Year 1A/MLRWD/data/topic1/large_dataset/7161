To clear things up, and I wanna make this extremely clear, the two stars above are for Chow Yun Fat, my all time favorite actor, and Sean William Scott.
The best way to describe this film would be, mindless drivel. Paul Hunter makes up in stupidity what he lacks in direction, It offers a few quick one liners and a few battle scenes worth seeing, maybe. Hunter thinks that watching the greats and immitating them is a good way to direct a movie, it is so sad because many starving young directors would kill for a chance to do a hollywood movie and they actually have creative talent and good direction. Paul seems to have watched the Matrix a few times too much, many of the scenes stolen directly out of the movie, including Morpheus' "They're here" line. How lame. The worst thing about this movie, and this is a doozy because there are A LOT of bad things about this film, is the Nazi commander trying to take over the world for 60 years after WWII is over is it. Hi, Steven Spielberg called he wants royalties because you ripped his Raiders of the Lost Arc off. And the sad truth is that decades later, a sort of Nazi refrence like that will not work. One more thing before I sign off. Mista Funtastik, a cockney street thug dressed in the latest Gucci pants threatening to cut off Orchestras, which if you are wondering actual English slang. Why?
Paul, screenwriters, if you are reading this please take up day jobs at McDonalds and stop ruining the carrers of a venerated film stars and a new up and coming actors.
