Army of Darkness is the third movie in the Evil Dead trilogy, and in my opinion probably the best.There isn't much more i can add to what has already been said here but, this is one of the best parady movies ever made. You have it all here, goofy horror, Three Stooges slapstick action, violent fun with sawed off shotguns and chainsaws, poor stop-motion animation reminisent of 50's monster movies, some of the best one-liners in movie history and a huge cult following. Bruce Campbell was already a star in the b-movie acting world before this,AoD made him a legend. Bruce Cambell is one of the greatest actors of our generation, he is Jim Carey and Clint Eastwood thrown in a blender, combinding a bad @ss atitude with goofy comedic elements and that smirk face he has. For some people this might be way too cheesie, but i would recommend it for any movie collection. When Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrown back in 1399 with his 1972 Oldsmobile, you can tell this is gonna be b-horror D&D and the stooges all rolled into one.
