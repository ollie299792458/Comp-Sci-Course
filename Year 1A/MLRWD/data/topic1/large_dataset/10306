Bronson's magnum opus and proof positive that actions speaks louder than words. Bronson is at his taciturn best in the central role of an ageing 1930's depression street fighter, whose plans don't stretch beyond the 'next bend in the road'. In the acutely rendered hard times of the period: Bronson, James Coburn (gambling debt ridden fight manager) and Strother Martin (drunk ex medical student trainer) team up to outwit and outfight local big shot fight promoters, debt collectors and street fighters in a series of debt laden bare knuckle fights. Love interest is provided by various distaff girlfriends (including Bronson's real life wife Jill Ireland), whose relationships with the trio last about as long as the realistic fights - not long. The New Orleans locations and authentic period details of contrasting poverty and wealth add gritty realism to the hard fights that follow. In hard times actions also speak louder than music. The musical score is unobtrusive and except for a Cajun southern gumbo musical riff unremarkable. I will guarantee though that fans of the main characters and realistic street fight movies won't be disappointed. A man's man film. Five stars.
