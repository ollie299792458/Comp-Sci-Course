Im 17 years old, and have watched this movie as a little kid millions of times. My dad LOVES this movie. I got so sick of it that each time we watched it, i was always "daydreaming" of other things.

I wanted to give him a good gift and get him his favorite movie. I automatically thought of this movie and bought it instantly.

Well, I decided to watch it. (now that im older, able to understand what all the "kids" are going through.) It really hits home for a teenager to be graduating because all your friends truely are leaving and going seperate ways.

Now that i understand the lines and plot, it has become my favorite movie. The DVD makes the movie easier to follow, it doesnt have a near black scene unlike the VHS where it is amazingly grainy and dark. They even put in a new sky for the opening scene. Go check it out.

This movie is a best buy for any car racing person. The story/plot hits home to just about everyone. If you had friends in highschool, this movie is for you.
