Brandon Lee (The Crow, Rapid Fire) stars as  a special agent who with the help of a tough chick played by Debi A Monahan (Dark Justice, Liberace) travel to go rescue a professor played by Ernest Borgnine (Escapef From New York, BASEketball) who is a laster expert and who is being held by some Soviets because Borgnine has made a laser that can do some pretty powerful things. What we have here if a failure of a movie. It's hard to watch Lee go through this movie not giving anything. That's what I felt like when he did Showdown In Little Tokyo which is way worse then this. Borgnine has a bad awful accent. Graham Clarke (Running Free, Ali) was worse as the Colonel. I mean how many times did he like get in a fatal situation and wind up coming back? He got shot. He got burned and then they ran him over. Geez. This is no James Bond or...or James Bond Jr. for all that it's worth. The action scenes werent that great. This was the only Lee movie that I didnt see but I finally got to see it and wow I was disappointed of it. If you are a Lee fan and havent seen it be warned this isnt the best thing
