Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was my favorite film of the year. (It was either this or Corpse Bride- extremely hard decision- but, in the end, "Charlie" won out).
I was 7 years old when I first read CATCF and I fell in LOVE with it. I didn't watch WWATCF till I was 8 and when I did, I was disspointed, they had changed EVERYTHING! (This is before I knew that it was normal with adaptations)

Needless to say, I was SO happy when I heard that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were doing "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". Finally, the story as it should've been told. I still had some apprehensions mind you, but knowing Burton/Depp style, I was mostly excited.
I LOVED it, beginning to end, I was enraptured up by it. From the music, (Yeah for Danny Elfman) to costumes, sets, and acting, everything was a masterpiece. I completely understand why they had to alter the ending a bit, since they never intended to do "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator", they need a real ending instead of a link up to the next installment.
I know I'm getting this film ASAP and I advise you to do the same
