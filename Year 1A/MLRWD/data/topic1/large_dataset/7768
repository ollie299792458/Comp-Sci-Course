I watched this last night and had to let it digest before writing a review. This movie was far more painful and powerful than I expected it to be. The performances were excellent and multi-layered. I guess I thought it was going to be more about Brandon's (Michael Fassbender) sexual addiction, but it really was much more about making connections with people, emotional stress, the price of relationships. Yes, he turned to porn and prostitutes for release and relief from his otherwise tightly wound, buttoned up life that was carefully constructed to hide the pain surging beneath. But the real story was the tension between him and his sister, the beautiful and frail but manipulative Sissy (hope I'm spelling that right), whose instability leashed them together. They never talked explicitly about their past, but you knew something had to have happened to them to make them this way. They were like shell-shocked survivors of a war who never learned how to function in "normal" society. But then the movie also does a great job of peeling back the layer on what is "normal" as well, when it shows Brandon's married boss having a loving chat with his son one minute, then sleeping with Sissy the next, with no regard for a tortured Brandon in the next room. There is also a flirtatous yet married woman on the subway who is the narrative arc tying together the beginning and end of the tale. Of all of them, Brandon seems to be the one who truly craves a connection with another human being, while everyone around him is just throwing away what comes so easily to them. Very emotional, and really makes you think. Overall, I thought this was a truly masterful and heart-wrenching piece of filmmaking and acting.
