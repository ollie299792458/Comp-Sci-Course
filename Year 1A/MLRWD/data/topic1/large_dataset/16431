Very rarely is there a realistic perspective about  the family that comes to the big screen or even the little screen.  In years past, TV and cinematic families didn't dare to approach subjects that are broached in  "Parenthood," but Ron Howard shows no fear.  Sexual maturity,  masturbation, teenage pregnancy, alcoholism, gambling addiction, childhood  depression, and divorce are only a few issues discussed in this film, and  they are approached with a completely sensitive and realistic matter.  The  humor is never contrived and the realism is never overdramatic.  An  all-star cast that features Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards,  Rick Moranis, Tom Hulce, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves and Academy-Award  winner Diane Wiest tackles the issues of the extended family with an  empathy that exceeds remarkable.  Each character is developed to the hilt  from Steenburgen's harried housewife to Moranis' obsessive intellectual  coddling to Reeves' vacant surfer dude to Robards' crusty, yet emotional,  old-codger alcoholic and each character doesn't have to struggle to make  themslves believable.  You are carried into their lives and you are forced  to sympathize with every action.  You cheer at Gil's (Martin) son making  the winning catch, cry at Helen's (Wiest) son's pain because of his absent  father, and laugh at Karen's (Steenburgen) attempts to keep her children  normal and sane.  "Parenthood" is a powerful comedy-drama that  doesn't need to attempt to pull at the heart strings - it just does, with  no effort at all.
