More than an unfortunate pairing of brilliant musical performance with amature video production techniques, this DVD is an absolute travesty. Yes fans will have a difficult time enjoying this important live event until they turn off the picture. The Dolby 5.1 surround mix (thank you Billy Sherwood) allows the listener to enjoy this collection of Yes masterworks as they were intended - as a "total immersion" experience, but the video production itself is unforgivable.
Why Producer/Director/Editor Steve Mitchell thought that die-hard Yes fans would prefer to watch his high-school video production exploration rather than the concert itself is a mystery. Very little time is dedicated to documenting the actual musical performance. The live camera work is poor, additional footage is ill-conceived and amature in every way, and like any neophyte videographer, Mr. Mitchell over-uses every cheesey and tastless video effect available to him in his low-resolution video post-production suite. Finally, the compression of the DVD itself is atrocious - off-the-shelf home DVD-authoring software, I'd venture to guess. 
The result, if I haven't been clear by this point, is unwatchable. Seriously. And I love this band. Buy it for the music. Buy it to support Jon and the boys. But PLEASE don't watch the video... it'll take hours of Yessongs and House of Yes (perhaps even therapy) to reverse the damage.
