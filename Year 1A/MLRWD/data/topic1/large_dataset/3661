It's rare to find something that EVERYONE finds funny.  We are defnitely diverse in our tastes, quirks, and tolerance for "certain types" of humor . . . and because of this, I don't often expect to enjoy movies that others rave about.  This time, however, I was pleasantly surprised!

Noises Off has a cast of characters, funny in their own right; writing that is witty, full of puns, and rapid-fire reparte; visual gags that appeal to the slightly more juvenile side in all of us (the cactus bit was especially funny), and a sense of the absurd that had me laughing days after my first viewing.

The "play within a play" set up is especially fun for any of us who have ever worked in the theatre, be it professonal, community, college, or grammar school, because those of us "who have been there" realize just how many things can and do go wrong behind the scenes.

Not a movie for kids (too much sexual innuendo, double entendre and imagery), it is, nonetheless a FUNNY, must-see show.
