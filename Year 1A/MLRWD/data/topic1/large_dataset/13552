"Diehard" sci-fi fans will always inevitably make a comparison to the original dune book by Frank Herbert. The book spans some three hundred something pages, and to fit the intricacies of a novel of this length and detail into a mini-series is impossible; the comparison between the tv mini-series and the book, even, is a pointless one. With each transfer to a different medium, you lose details and you gain others, since each medium has its unique idiosyncrasies. Therefore, it seems to me a mistake to judge the mini-series or even the movie in comparison to the book, and makes even more sense to judge it independently within the context of each medium. If any comparison can be made is that this mini-series adequately preserves the human element and its metaphoric parallel relevance to our own time of environmental degradation, political intrigue and corruption, lifestyle dependence on finite natural resources, and spirituality as the original book intended. Some might even consider it "injustice" to the book, that some details of fremen rituals or political "feints within feints within feints within feints" were excluded. I might even suggest that for the medium, and the time allowed, these scenes, although relevant, are not necessarily needed. The directors of the mini-series have done a wonderful job adapting the book to the screen. If you judge this series for what it is, and not how exacting it fits into the book, you will derive much more enjoyment and meaning from herbert's intentions, than if you nitpick. :-)
