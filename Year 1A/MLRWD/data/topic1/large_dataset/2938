This is a story about a scientific experiment that went wrong. A group of scientists were working a project on defence science to turn soldiers into invisible fighting machines. Dr Sebastian Caine is the ingenius protagonist who succeeds in cultivating the serum that would turn an animal invisible when injected into its body.

Somehow, the team did not have to inform the guys at the top of the defense department and invite the military to witness the event when they decided to experiment on Sebastian himself. The experiment went wrong. Sebastian invisibility became irreversible.

Angry at first, Sebastian soon discovered that he could enter the bathroom without its occupants being aware of his presence. He was also able to snoop on his ex-girlfriend and her new lover. With the power of invisibility, Sebastian leaves the facility and moves on to other more ambitious things. He ended up raping and murdering people who couldn't see him.

Returning to the facility, he sent on to kill everyone who knew his secret. The ending, is of course predictable. The special effects are simply fantastic, but definitely not for those with weak stomachs. The story is also not as unbelievable as some reviewers say it is. Those of us who have been around long enough have seen how some people change after they strike it rich or get a promotion. Sebastian's transformation from good to evil is quite plausible.
