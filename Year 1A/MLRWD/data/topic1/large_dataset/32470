Henry, a Hawaiian local, has always dreamed of sailing his little sailboat up to Alaska to watch walruses in their native habitat. He's never met a girl he'd like to stick around for, until he meets Lucy.
But there's a problem. Lucy can't remember they met, or that they made a date for the next day.

A year before their meeting Lucy had an accident which deprived her of long term memories. This means that every day she has to start again. Her friends convince Henry to leave her alone, but he can't get her out of his mind.

Thus starts a series of interesting meetings where he tries to get to know her, and make her fall in love with him all over again every single day.

However, Henry must not only win her over, but her family and friends as well.

From the commercials I wasn't as interested in this movie, however after seeing it I think it's a wonderful romance, with a hilarious overtone. The way he overcomes her disability is fantastic and the ending is a little surprising, but marvelous.
