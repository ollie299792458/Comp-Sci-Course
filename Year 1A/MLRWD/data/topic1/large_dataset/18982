first of all, JFK is probably one of the greatest and most contriversial movies EVER made. JFK was so contriversial, that the government themselves were scared about the threat this movie posed. because of all the uproar from the american people, the government formed an assassination committee which released certain files into the assassination of John Kennedy.
the movie centers around Distric Attonrney Jim Garrisson's investigation into the murder of the century. you follow Garrisson's every move from his interrigation into the "most important witness in history" in David Ferrie to the conclussion of the trial. Great movie with many factual events and many interpretations of what could have happened. you can't fit all the information of the JFK assassination into a 3 hour movie, so you compress some of the information, like Oliver Stone did.
the DVD features are great. you meet Donald Sutherland's character, X, and you see a 30 minute film on the new documents of the assassination. you also get to see a whole bunch of extra or deleted scenes. you have to watch the extra and delected scenes in order to appreciate what job the film editor and Oliver Stone did to make this masterpiece complete. 
great film that moves you in one way or another.
