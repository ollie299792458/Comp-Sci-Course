I first saw this film many years ago when it was a movie of the week on network TV.  Like any kid, I was interested in the battle scenes, and by the time I'd graduated with a Communications degree, I dismissed this movie out of hand as a faithful, but unexceptional telling of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.
Mea Culpa!!  I finally saw this film in widescreen format, and this movie's artistic value magnified ten-fold.  The idea for this film was inspired: an American director would shoot the American scenes telling the USA side of the battle, and a Japanese director would tell the Japanese side of the story.  Originally the legendary Akira Kurasowa was hired to direct the Japanese side of the story, but after a falling out, Toshio Masuda ended up directing the Japanese side of the film.  Richard Fleischer directed the American sequences.
Fleischer does a fine job, but Masuda is absolutely brilliant.  The Japanese side of the story is the more compelling side of the story, but Masuda truly does a masterful job of setting forth scenes of eloquence and power in telling the story of highly motivated people whose actions will doom their country.
Despite truth being stranger than fiction, Hollywood all too often needlessly flushes historical truth down the toilet ("JFK" anyone?).  Fortunately, this powerful story is meticulous in its historical accuracy.  With a compelling muscial score and great special effects, especially considering the age of this film, this is a film which should appeal to movie lovers and history buffs both.
IMPORTANT!! This is a film which can ONLY be appreciated in widescreen/DVD format.  The dogfight sequences, the impressive sets and much of the drama is lost in the version formatted for TV, resulting in the butchering of a masterpiece.
