The actors themselves aren't to blame as they do the best they can with what they're given. The duo of Depp and Rispoli does well to keep the viewer interested and Robisi as Moberg brings a good humor to the film. Ekhart's Sanderson is terrible however which is made even worse by the fact that Sanderson was one of the most interesting characters in the book. He works at the paper and in the first few chapters is beating protesters with a sign, is fired by Lotterman for threatening to twist off his head, is the main protagonist in the brawl with the restaurant patrons that lands Kemp and Sala in jail in the film, and is one of the participant's in the beating of Lotterman at the end of the novel in which Lotterman is killed.

The film adaption is watered down with key elements that made the book so amazing completely missing. Characters are subbed out for other characters and plot lines get twisted for no reason other than to make the film seemingly incredibly dull. The ending is terrible compared to the brawl, killing of Lotterman and scramble to get out of Puerto Rico by the main characters at the end of the book leaving anyone who's read it scratching their head wondering why the film makers chose to fix something that wasn't broke. The ending credits claim Kemp went back to New York, married Chenault, and became a famous writer, hinting towards the fact that Kemp is Thompson, however Chenault is not mentioned at all after her exit in the book. Read the book, and if your bored watch the film. I gave it two stars because the Depp/Rispoli duo enabled me to sit through the whole film.
