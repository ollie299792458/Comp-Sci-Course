Most claymation features tend to be kid films, but this one is geared towards adult sensibilities. I hope adults won't think this is a cutesy claymation film meant for the kiddies; it's so much more than that.

This story of the pen pal relationship between an unprepossessing eight year old from Australia, friendless, isolated and neglected by her parents, and a 44 year old, obese, friendless, Jewish man with Asperger's Syndrome is one of the most affecting movies I've ever seen.

It touches on all kinds of dark emotions and situations; alcoholism, loneliness, depression, feelings of low-self esteem, awkwardness, abandonment, suicide, obesity, bullying, rejection, disability. And yet it also manages to be very funny. The main characters, Mary and Max, are both sympathetic and endearing, despite their eccentricities and lack of social skills. Both are what you might call physically unattractive and yet they are oddly appealing. They make the viewer want to be their friend.

Of course, the claymation animation is excellent. The vocal characterizations are spot on. Philip Seymour Hoffman stands out in particular; I would have never known he was the voice of Max. Usually when a celebrity does a voice in an animated film they are instantly recognizable, but Hoffman BECOMES Max.

This movie touched my heart (it's very rare that a movie can do that for me) and I think it did the same for a lot of other people. See it!
