The worst thing about this movie (and there are many bad things) is that with a good script rewrite, it could have been a classic comedy. It's not. The script is horrible. It's dreadful. It's a mistake--110+ pages of mistake. The initial concept of the film (a guy rents an RV and takes his family on a problem-filled vacation) is a great one--I love road films and who could do a better one than Robin Williams and Cheryl Hines? Both charming and funny actors with amazing appeal. But the backstory on this film, the lame idea that Robin Williams' character is hiding his secret motive to attend an important business conference is just so lame. Why was a complication like that even necessary? Isn't taking two teenagers across country in an RV ripe enough with funny possibilities? Chevy Chase's Vacation? Hello!!!

But instead of just making a funny road movie about an RV obsessed father taking his unwilling family on vacation, the writer(s) here decided that it needed an extra wrinkle: workaholic Williams plotting to get to some big meeting. Ugggggh. It's like a Disney script written by children instead of for them.

Also, the entire idea of being in an RV starts out with such great comic promise: the toilet is not working. And THAT sequence is actually funny. It's the last funny thing you'll see in this movie. From there on the movie is one long RV joke about long RVs and ridiculous scenes of driving over mountain roads and into lakes. Please. If you want to see a funny movie that takes this theme and provides killer comedy, just rent Lucy & Ricky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQU08">The Long, Long Trailer</a>" Perfection. Robin Williams hanging onto the hood of the RV as it plunges--driverless--down a mountain road is utter nonsense. Suspend disbelief? You'd have to suspend all human experience to find this remotely amusing.

That said, I will say this: Jeff Daniels is terrific. Why this guy isn't the highest paid actor in Hollywood, I'll never know. He is the saving grace (if there is one) of this film. And it seems to me like a better writer wrote his lines. In fact, I'm sure of it. And Robin Williams, while he didn't even phone in this role (he sent a body double), is somehow oddly comforting to watch on the screen. How is this possible? Here is the worst script I've seen in decades and Williams remains someone you want to watch.

Personally, I think that Robin Williams owes us all a refund--not for not being charming, he is--but for agreeing to do this movie after he read the script. He should have turned it down or forced them to rewrite it. That's what star power is for, isn't it--getting good scripts? Sorry Robin, but you stole the money on this one and we deserve a refund--not for your acting, but for your willingness to make any movie if the money is right. How much money do you need, anyway?

Anyway, if you want a comforting stupid movie to keep you company on a summer's night, spend a buck on a used copy at your local video store (don't pay Amazon $2.99 to ship it to you). But trust me, you will watch this film and at the end you'll say: "Wow, this could have been the best road film of all time. Instead, it's probably the worst."

Then the next weekend, go rent: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008O38F">Midnight Run</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076ONUK">Dutch</a>and see what real road-film genius is all about. Or watch a Williams masterpiece: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCTY">Moscow on the Hudson</a>.

Still, I have to say, that Williams guy is one helluva charmer. And I hope his health is doing well. Come to think of it, for all the great moments he's given us, I guess he can keep the refund.
