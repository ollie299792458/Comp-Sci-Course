I was hesitant to watch this because I was afraid it was going to be campy....like a very sad "Dukes Of Hazard" movie tribute to the eighties series...well let me tell you I couldn't have been more wrong..."The A-Team" movie was nothing short of a wild ride with JATO rockets strapped on for good measure.  Never a dull moment...and Jessica Biel well what can I say...shes the kind of woman that makes you stammer seeing a picture of her shes that hot...but I digress...If I were you, and I was, I would spend the 2 hours and 4 bucks, which I did, for a truly entertaining evening, and it was, with great acting off the charts completely ridiculous action sequences and a Plan that truly came together...

As a note...for a previous reviewer...don't be a schmuck and give a bad review to a movie because the service providing it failed...what are you 12...suck it up there Happy Feet....grab your sippy cup and get yourself a kool-aid refill you'll feel much better...and next time perhaps you could try customer support with the rest of the adults and not throw a tantrum cuz sissy took your rattle...

to everyone else sorry for the rant

I have never reviewed a movie before "The A-Team" but this movie was not only great it more then exceeded my expectations...motivating me to take the extra time to not only review the movie but also chastise a tool for misrepresenting it...

See the movie you won't be disappointed.
