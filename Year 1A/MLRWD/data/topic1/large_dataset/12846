Having been a fan of the Tremors series, there was a high expectation from the HD-DVD version of Tremors. Boy did this disc exceed my Expectations!!.

First of all, let me point out the best feature of the disc - the visuals.
Every scene is crystal clear in glorius 1080p. The sense of clarity and amount of detail found in this disc I have not seen in any other HD-DVD title to date, and I own over 20 titles. Lets say the amount of detail you can see now with this HD-DVD spoils the movie a little as things start to look fake, or you can see wires and cables along the ground. I guess thats one problem found with the re-release of older non-CGI movies to a high-def format.

As with most of these old movies, the sound was a bit lacking. It sounded like most of the movie was coming through stereo with little surround or bass action. Once again, the sound was crystal clear, just not much descrete surround seperation. The film was made in stereo, and thats where it stays for most of the movie.

If you wanted to purchase this film to show off your HD-DVD player, there are probably some better selections out there to choose from. If your a fan of the series, do NOT hesitate to pick yourself up a copy. This is the best way to see Tremors, in 1080p

So go pick up this Motherhumper, before the inhabitants of Perfection leave due to the Graboids!!
