I have viewed this movie many times and each time I come away from it a little richer. I recently watched an 'American Masters' biography of John Ford and the narrator gave the most exact description of the Ethan Edwards character that I think can be given: 'he was the kind of man that civilization must have but also the kind that can never live in civilization'.

Society has always been faced with the need to decide whether or not it will acknowledge the honor that men like Ethan Edwards have earned. Sadly, for the past 40 years, we have been drifting away from them, preferring to think that our own politically correct 'moral rectitude' contains a self-defending mechanism. People who support this view are frequently heard warning us 'not to become like our enemies'. First and foremost, this is shameful because it necessarily devalues the sacrifice of the warrior. But it is also foolish. At some point our decadent society will need an Ethan Edwards for its very survival. The question remains as to whether we will then find him from within our midst.
