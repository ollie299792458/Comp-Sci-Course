Once again, in comparing the original version of a film with a modern re-make - I must conclude that less is more.  In this particular case, the original source material is a short story by Elmore Leonard that bears little resemblance to either of the film versions.
In this 1957 version, filmed in B&W, the protagonist and the antagonist are played by Van Heflin and Glenn Ford respectively.
What makes this film great is that it doesn't rely on gimmicks and special effects to carry the movie, it simply relies on very solid acting performances.
The interplay between the two lead characters is quite wonderful - Heflin is the down on his luck hero being tempted by the lure of easy money, Ford is the charming but evil villain playing a psychological war with Heflin.
As far as 3:10 to Yuma is concerned, this 1957 film is the definitive version to watch.
To be fair,  the 2007 re-make does offer some solid performances as well, particularly Ben Foster in a supporting role, but it relies too heavily on special effects and gimmicks to carry it.
