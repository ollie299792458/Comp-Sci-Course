I had never seen this movie until yesterday, and its been out on DVD for along time.  I really did enjoy this movie alot.  The characters in Uptown Girls really tell you the truth about the title of the movie, they are two 'Uptown' rich little girls who were brought together to learn from each other and realize that Molly (Brittany Murphy) and Ray (Dakota Fanning) have gone through the same thing about the same time.  Only Molly didn't have anyone at that age and but Ray does now, with Molly.  It's a heart warming film that I truely enjoyed to the bone.  
A little note for those who enjoy watching it over and over for little things to complain about, if you notice throughout the entire movie, Brittany Murphy in every shot is wearing a dress or skirt.  Never pants or anything else, the only scene she is, is when she's with Duey watching the "Sheets of Egyptian Cotton" music video.  She's in shorts and stretch pants.  But then if you notice, she's wearing the same stretch pants underneith her dress in the next scene when she does to Rays house.  
As the producer Boaz said this movie was mean't to be unrealistic and for those who haven't seen the sneak preview to the interview with the cast about that, I hope you realize that this movie was about being enchanted and fantasized in New York and that if you want to go somewhere to find yourself or your dream, that New York is the place to go.  I think though that this movie is a mix of both realism and not, there are people who have problems dealing with death and some more than others try to do the opposite of what Molly does and thats heading downwards.  Whereas with her, she's always trying to stay as positive about everything and taking things in stride.  I pride myself in things about that and hope that most will see this amazing movie.
"Time" (Chantel Kreviazuk) music video is my all time fave... love and admire the song, couldn't stop listening to it.
