First I thought I'd share what happened when we were at the theater. The scene where Grinch is trying to figure out what to wear, he jerks the tablecloth off without disturbing the items on the table, walks off, then goes back and knocks everything over including the table. There was a general chuckle over this scene but in the quiet after that a young voice protested, "That's NOT funny!" For a moment Jim Carrey was upstaged by a young fan.
Now, I grew up on the classic animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas with Boris Karloff as the narrator. I admit that I was skeptical going into the theater. How much nonsense padding was going to be added to make this a feature length film? How would the Whos look "live"? Could Jim Carrey sing?! The additions made added an entirely new dimension to this classic story. The sets and makeup incredible. And Carrey's version of "You're a Mean One Mr Grinch" is delightful.
I think the most significate difference between the old and the knew comes towards the end when the Grinch is about to give up and allow the sled to fall from Mt Crumpet with the words "it's only presents." Then Cindy Lou appears atop the sled with the words that "no one should be alone on Christmas". It was only when someone, not something, was in danger that the Grinch reached inside of himself and saved Cindy Lou. That to me is a far better message than the original.
Add this one to your Christmas tradition. Share it with family and friends. After all that's what it's all about - people, not things.
