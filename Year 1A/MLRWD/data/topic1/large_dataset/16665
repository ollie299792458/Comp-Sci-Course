Well, if you have a little extra money and have not seen Lone Wolf and Cub, but are not sure whether or not you'll like it, BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!  Shogun Assassin is basically Lone Wolf and Cub 1 & 2 edited, dubbed, and handed to you in a nice ULTRA-FAST PACED bundle.  I have yet to see the full series, but having seen this I am very eager to.  Lone Wolf and Cub is longer and much more conclusive.  I suppose you could also make this purchase to tide you over while saving up for the full set, haha.  If you are very compelled to know how it ends, there is a second Shogun Assassin, but as I said, there is also a larger series that has all of this and more, just not in English, which may be a disappointment to some.  There isn't really much moral plot to this, other than perseverance, but it's still an entertaining hour and a half of blood flying absolutely everywhere, as it says, "It's impossible to keep a body count!"  I also highly recommend this as a gift for any loving parent to their 4-year-old (not really!), but it's enjoyable for the older crowd, as long as you don't have any reservations for mindless violence.  Once again, I will enforce, SPRING FOR """LONE WOLF AND CUB."""
