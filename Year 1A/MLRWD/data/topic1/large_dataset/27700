This 1980's version of SCARFACE is so compelling, that many viewers will be thinking of it for the rest of their lives. The story of a "Street-wise" Mariel Boat lift Cuban, X-prisoner, who is picked up by immigration in South Florida, and after some inner dealings in the holding facility, is released onto the streets of Miami. It documents the "rags-to-riches" story of Tony Montana, from flipping burgers, to obtaining international Drug-lord status; with virtually unlimited riches in his warchest, the key word being: war. Quite possibly, the best film ever made, it features a hypnotic performance by Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfiefer and of course, the 20th Centuries all-time best performance by Al Pacino as the Cuban, complete with heavy accent and haircut. The look of the film is "beautiful-eighties", complete with the Miami-pastel colored backdrop, and the music floating around at the right moments. Note: PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE 3 MINUTE PERFORMANCE OF TONY'S MOTHER - It is so remarkable, you can almost see Pacino's admiration for this actress in his facial expressions on film!
