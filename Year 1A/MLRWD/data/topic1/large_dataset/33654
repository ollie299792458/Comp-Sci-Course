This movie is another example of putting a good actor (Jason Statham) in a terrible sequel. From the beginning to the the very end this movie was unbearably bad.

Being a big fan of the original Transporter movie, I was totally disappointed in this sequel.  The plot was ridiculous, the dialogue mind numbing, and the action scenes totally ridiculous.

The female co-star, a Eurotrash brain dead girl was extremely annoying.  Her broken English dialogue consisted of talking about food (so annoying) and acting like a teenage brat.  Even the supposeably romantic love scene was totally pathetic, and lacked any real emotion.

The action was ok, but hardly made up for the rest of this cestpool of garbage.  Most of the stunts were totally unrealistic and phony. - even more so then the first two movies, imagine that!

During one fight scene, our hero gets thrown through a concrete wall and gets up without a scratch..... so ridiculous. In another scene, after the transporter drives his car into a lake to escape the bad guys, he is able to float his car back to the surface, by inflating two duffel bags with air from the tires.  Yeah, thats really going to work on a 3700 lb car.. give me a break.  And then after 2 minutes of tinkering with the engine of a car that was emerged under water for 20 minutes, he is able to start it right up and the car drives like new.... haha.

I paid $1 at redbox to rent this movie, and still feel like I've paid too much. What a piece of crap this movie turned out to be. Don't waste your time!
