Supposedly Howard Hawkes told Ernest Hemingway a movie could be made of the "least" of the author's novels. And Hemingway signed over the rights to this novel. Between the movie and novel there is barely anything to compare, other than the main character's name is Harry Morgan, he has a sidekick by the name of Eddie, and a romantic interest by name of Marie. Mercifully, Howard Hawkes changed everything about the novel and cast Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. By casting up and coming model Lauren Bacall opposite Humphrey Bogart, movie history - and legend - was born.

The plot and dialogue in this film are certainly not stellar, and there are many other films from the 1940s that far outshine this one. However, the chemistry and sparks that ignite between Bogie and Bacall cannot be denied. Bogie plays the role he is most known for: self-possessed, street-wise, hard-boiled, with just a touch of desperation. This is the man one wants around in a crisis.

But Lauren Bacall plays a new type of leading lady. Beautiful and sexy, yes, but smart. This gal is not given over to hysterics or drama. Her life hasn't been easy, but she isn't sinking into a bottle or embittered about it. She faces life like a challenge - and knows that somehow she's going to win it. She's tough without being rough, strong while still looking fabulous, and she can turn a man to jello with "the look." If for no other reason, it is worth seeing this movie just to watch the debut of this actress!

When the movie ends, I'll doubt one remembers the plot or what everyone was up to and it won't even matter. This movie revolves so strongly around Bogie and Bacall, and they certainly do hold it together so very, very well, one doesn't even miss the rest of the movie. A pure delight!
