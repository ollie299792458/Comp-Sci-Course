The son of Dr. Frankenstein is trying to find his fathers work and complete it.  He travels to Transalvania and meets up with his assistant, Igor.  Igor's father worked with Dr. Frankenstein's father a long time ago.  One night when Dr. Frankenstein couldn't sleep, he heard a violin noise behind his wall.  He found out that there was secret passageway down to a room.  He followed the sound of the violin and it led him to a laboratory and in the next room was the violin lying on the table.  He realized he was in his fathers secret library.  He wanted to finish the work his father never finished, which was to transfer a brain into a dead body and bring it back to life.  Dr. Frankenstein asked Igor to get the brain of a specific person.  As Igor was in the lab, he dropped the designated brain and just took an abnormal brain thinking it was a person named "Abby."
  Dr. Frankenstein added the brain into the head and didn't realize that it was an abnormal brain until the monster had woken up angry.  The monster ran out of the house into the village.  The only sound that calmed down the monster was the violin playing.  Dr. Frankenstein and Igor set up a trap and played the violin to lead him back to the castle.  In the meantime the towns people are getting suspicions that there is a monster inside the castle so they come over.
  Dr. Frankentstein and the monster were set up to transfer brains and 3/4 of the way in, the towns' people raid into the castle and stopped the transformation.  The monster had half of Dr. Frankenstein's knowledge and Dr. Frankenstein had half of the monster's knowledge.  They talk the towns people into leaving and they leave.  Later that day, Frankenstein gets married to Mrs. Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein gets married to his assistant.
