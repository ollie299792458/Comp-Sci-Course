This season basically summarizes why DBZ had to die. In the end, there were just a little too many similarities to the previous sagas involving Freiza and Cell.

Majin Buu is an unstoppable monster, but then we've all heard this one before. They try to introduce the Fusion technique and some new characters to keep things fresh, but in the end I felt like I was watching the same old stuff from before. It's not as grueling as the Frieza saga was, but it's still a chore to watch through at some stages of the story, where things just drag on and on for what seems like an eternity.

The best part of the saga isn't even Majin Boo, it's Majin Vegeta, and his duel with Goku that I enjoyed more than the actual fight with Majin Boo. That duel is pretty epic, and I wish it would've lasted longer than most of the rest of the story.

Despite this, it's still DBZ and if you love DBZ, you'll still enjoy this on some level, but I kind of wish at this point, brute force wouldn't be applied so heavily and that the villains would differ from each other more.
