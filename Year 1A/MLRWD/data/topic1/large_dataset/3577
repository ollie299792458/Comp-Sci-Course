Y Tu Mama Tambien, is not only a protrayal of the growing-of-age of the two teenagers, but of Mexico as a society as a whole.

It is scenes, the movie draws a clear separation between the shallow advances of the childish upper-middle class teenagers, to the stricken betrayed wife of a upper-middle class man (who presumedly was once like those teenagers).

In the backdrop of a decaying dying improvished countryside, beside the decaying wife, I am struck at the the blind ignorance and lack of compassion of the these teenagers to the plight of those around them.

The condemnation of class division, which is so rampant in Mexico today, shines clearly through the main characters. As they drive through the improvished countryside, the woman seeking her gleaming destination, the callous teenagers seeking nothing blinded by their lust and lives of comfort, so does Mexico.

Yet, this movie seems to state, a Mexico lead by the ignorance and crudeness of the upper-class, and the weakness of the betrayed, is a Mexico leading nowhere.

There is no happy ending in the midst of this lustful existential ignorance, merely the fateful expected ending.

For the teenagers, the trip through proverty is a mere pleasure trip. There is no coming of age - for there is no consequences or  responsibility or retribution for them. In the last scene where they meet, there is merely their own private shame and denial.

And for the woman, in her weakness, driven to tragedy, there is only one ending.
