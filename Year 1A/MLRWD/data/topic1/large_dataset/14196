This movie is pleasing to watch. One can easily see the details that went into the characters, the animation, and the background. Plus, the songs are catchy and entertaining. But, who cares? A good movie is only good if its story is good, and this movie's dark, whimsical plot makes it a classic.

Nightmare Before Christmas's unique story is about Jack Skellington and his role in Halloween Town, but he is bored with his town's repetitive rituals. He leaves the town to find something new, and he finds it in Christmas Land. Jack is intrigued by this land and plans to take over Christmas this year. Exciting, right? Yes...and no! The tension between Sally and Dr. Finkelstein distracts me from the overall story.

Their relationship is disturbing because it represents verbal and mental abusive. Dr. Finkelstein constantly remains Sally that he owns her, and he even locks her in a room, so she doesn't escape his control. Sally hates Dr. Finkelstein and performs extreme tactics to free herself from him. She dislocates her arm, poisons him, and jumps out of a window. There are moments in the movie where I am scared for Sally because I think Dr. Finkelstein is going to hit or kill her.

Another problem in the story is Oogie Boogie. He randomly arrives toward the end of the movie and tortures Santa. I don't understand why he does this? I don't even understand his place in Halloween town. How did he become evil? Why did Jack lock him up in that dungeon? It seems like Oogie Boogie is thrown in the story so the audience could have someone to hate. I will admit, I like Oogie's musical number, but he is a cheap character. He needs more development, or he shouldn't be in the story at all.

With these two negative aspects sprinkled in the story, this movie is still worth watching. Nightmare Before Christmas is the best-animated movie because it's story, and then its visuals, sets it apart from the pack.
