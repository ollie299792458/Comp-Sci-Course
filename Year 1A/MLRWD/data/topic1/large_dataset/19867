Amazing. That's the one word that comes to mind when thinking aboutd this DVD.

The performance is great, almost of it in broad daylight. As always, Springsteen and the E-Stree Band are giving their best.

Sound is great, and gool-old Bob Clearmountain is the mixing engineer. Also, I must thanks director Chris Wilson (or his editeur) for the great editing, that thanfully does not follow the actual trend of blinding-fast cuts where you can not even see what's happening! Other than Bruce, the the one who clearly gets more screen time is drummer Max Weinberg. The relacement of deceased Danny Federici of course handles the job well, but has very few screen time. Garry TAllent as always is almosta invisible and like a statue, but giving his best and absurdly precise.

Pat Scialfa is absent, but that's due to taking care of the children at home. Sosie Tyrrell is strong, as also are Van Zandt (apparently the most affected by age) and Lofgren.

The set list is a gem. Bruce's catalogue is so vast and high-quality, that he can choose effortlessly to change it from tour to tour or even from show to show. Tha inclusion of "No Surrender" and "Bobby Jean" were a plus for me.

Image quality is top. Sound is also top. I'm not sure enough if I can rate this as good as the unvincible "Live in NYC", but it's a winner anyway.
