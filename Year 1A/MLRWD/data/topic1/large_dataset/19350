I am a big fan of One on One with Jackie. I find all aspects of that video to be superbly cued and choreographed. I feel challenged by all aspects.
If you are a fan of that vieo you should know hat this one is different. First off, it lacks the weird sexual tension of the other video (a plus unless you appreciate its comedic value). Secondly, it lacks the variety of exercises and focuses on basic strength training without the cardio moves in between. The upper body routine only offers one exercise for biceps, triceps and shoulders which leaves one feeling as though they need to do more if they are accustomed to the One-on-One program.
Also, you'll need heavy weights as muscles don't fatigue as quickly with this workout.

I will use this video regularly because it still beats many of the other strength videos offered. I do hope she returns to her old style in her next video, even if she must flirt with the cast. And while we're at it, I'd like to request a decent cardio workout for those of us who like variety.
