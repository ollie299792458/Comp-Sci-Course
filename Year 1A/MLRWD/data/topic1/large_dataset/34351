I have given in to the fact that Hollywood director's are penny-pinching sell-outs. But to shove a Dr. Pepper can into the spotlight every fifteen minutes while filming a movie about the force which fights and dies to protect people they don't even know was, I thought, beyond even them.  But hey, by today's standards, the honour of fighting and fallen heroes is a small price to pay for a couple more big explosions and sunken bullet-holes.
Beyond that, I found it a bit less than subtle in these chaotic, hateful times to use a "frog", as Samuel L Jackson delicately puts it on more than one occasion, as the number one enemy of the United States police.  Using racial slurs against the number one democratic enemy of America's war?  In a major Hollywood movie?  
To take a Michael Moore-esque view on one final note, we see common thugs and low-lives with automatic weapons wounding and killing innocents, and never even question how such dangerous weapons got into their hands, but somehow this is justified  when a bunch of guys in black kill them off one by one.  We've come so far that using violence to counteract violence is the first, last and only solution to the problem.  Obviously, there isn't really any choice in situations like this, but at least question how things have come to the point where there IS no other choice, even in Hollywood films.
Ok this is a movie review, so let's finish with comments about the film itself; cliche action sequences, lukewarm acting, two-dimensional storyline.
