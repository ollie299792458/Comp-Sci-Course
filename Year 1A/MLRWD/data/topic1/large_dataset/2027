Scoop, directed by the inimitable Woody Allen, features very hot stars Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  This is the second of back to back Woody movies set it England; featuring Johansson.  This movie is best described as a light and airy comedy, with a bit of murder mystery mixed in.  I am compelled to compare it to Manhatten Murder Mystery.  Therin lies the rub.  From a critic, reviewer, and [the] public's standpoint, Woody Allen is in constant competition with himself.  His body of work is phenomenal.  There are great movies and average movies.  Were Scoop to have been directed by a first time director, I wonder what type of reviews it would have received?  I tend to believe that since Woody is so polarizing, this film is held to a higher standard than most others.  I think this film falls in the 3.5 star range.  To begin with, any film with Scarlett Johannson in it is time well spent.  She is a very good actress and is very easy on the eyes.  Hugh Jackman has proven to be a very versatile actor who does a nice job in this movie, which is a bit of a change of pace for him.  The movie is about a college student from America who majors in journalism.  She is in London when she unearths (scoops) a big story.  She meets with a ghost who provides some information about a London serial killer's identity.  With Woody as her magician friend, Johannson embarks on a romance with Jackman who may or may not be involved in the killings.  This movie is a nice little way to spend a couple of hours watching a light and airy comedy, with a dash of mystery mixed in.

I give this film 3.5 stars overall, but show it as 4 stars as a nod towards one of the best directors of his day.
