This is a true outstanding epic movie. I'm really surprised why it wasn't hailed as greatly as it should have been. I personally hail it as one of the greatest movies of all time, a true classic in every sense. I've seen  it totally ignorant of all the versions that preceded it and I've loved it  with the very first few lines "She came unaware of all the suspicion that  preceded her" " the first English woman I have seen". This story of two  unconventional people in conventional times with all its historical facts  and lush gorgeous background is capable of sweeping one's off his feet  making him feel all that cultural and emotional struggle that Anna and the  King seem to go through. Jodie Foster was lovely and extraordinary although  I used to think that she is too modern-looking for such movies...I guess I  was gravely mistaken. I think the movie's real surprise is Chow Yun-Fat who  was truly amazing. He seems to be so much at home with all this kingly  charm. He has such grace and overwhelming presence that would make him  probably one of the most remembered kings on the screen. I can't help  wondering if the original king was as charming as he was....and wouldn't be  nice if all kings were like that? We would surly love them. And what of the  palace? Do I dare and say more? I was totally amazed to know that they've  built a replica of the original one...wow!  I envy Jodie and Chow for being  in such lofty surroundings.  I think I would write a book if I were to  describe everything I loved in this movie...but I must take my hat off to  Andy Tennant for making such a masterpiece and for all the designers. Of  course, I must not forget the movie's music and photography and the  beautiful script that seems to linger in the mind forever for I would  always remember that "when a woman has so much to say and doesn't say it.  Her silence can be deafening.".
