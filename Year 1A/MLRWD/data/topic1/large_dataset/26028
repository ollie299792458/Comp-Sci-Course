Drexal
(Gary Oldman)and the newly weds end up with a bag of pure [narcotics],but along with the bag comes  lots of angry [persons] who want there [narcotics] back.So the couple now on the run decide to visit Clarences dad an ex-cop to find out if they are wanted by the law but everybody knows cops dont care about [Drexal].However there are STILL a [lot] of angry [persons] who won't forgive and forget.The love between Claernce and his Alabama is so stronge the it is fate that they should be together.My only advise is watch this film and you will realise what true romance is ,and if not for that Brad Pitt's in it girls what more reason to watch a film???
