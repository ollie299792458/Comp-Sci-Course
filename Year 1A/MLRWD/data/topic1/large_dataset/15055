When this movie came out I was 4 and my dad rented it. The Only part of this movie I remember then was Judge Doom scaring the boo boo Gebies out of me. Now that I'm 20 I've seen it 20,000 times. This is one of the most funniest and creative movies I've seen ever. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd give great Performances. And Roger Rabbit is one of the funnest characters on the movie (He sort of reminds me of an early Bugs Bunny) You get the occasional guest spots from some of the best cartoon characters. Donald Duck and Daffy Duck fighting each other just to show off who's better (Favorite Scene). Betty Boop, Dumbo, Yosemite Sam, Droopy, Mickey and Bugs share a scene (A first with these 2 legends.) Also this is one of the last perfomances of Mel Blanc (The voices of the Looney Tunes). The Movie is very high tech for it's time. This is one of the most funniest and greatest movies of all time. Some of the language is kinda bad for kids but not too bad so parents get this movie. I love this movie.
