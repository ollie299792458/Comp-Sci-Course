The main part of the story is about two NYC police officers who are trapped in ruble and are rescued.  It would not do justice for the 9-11 victims to tell every story of everybody that died or survived on that day.  That is probably 6000 individual stories (survivors and people who died).  All of their stories deserved to be told, and hopefully somebody somewhere is creating a website or a book to do just that.  Some of them would be interesting enough to be made in a movie, but most likely they would better served by being made into a book that can be read one story at a time without any time boundness and dramatization that are required of movies.

As for this movie, it did the job is was designed to do.  Is it a movie I would watch over and over again?  No.  Is it a movie I would recommend to others to see? Yes.

As for me, I went into the movie without having been exposed to the news coverage of the events day in and day out.  I did not know how I would react seeing the dramatization of the "evils" of that day.  I was glad that the movie did not focus on the dramatization of the airplanes crashing into the WTC.  It was just shown on a TV in the background.  I am also glad that it had zero coverage of the Muslims preparing for the day or whatever.  They do not deserve the film time.

The movie told the story that it was designed to tell, and it did it very well.  I feel sorry for the reviewers who are so exposed to hollywood dramatization that they cannot handle or accept true reality.  The movie is the truth, not TV hollywood.

Oh, the marine person was not just thrown in.  He was the man who found them, and the film did a very good job of showing his personality and his dedication to his task.  Everyone portrayed in that film is a real life hero, not a hollywood actor.  They deserved to be treated as such.
