Even if you have the series on VHS or previous DVD releases, the picture and sound quality is SUPERB. The transfers are perfect. The extras make it worth the purchase. It even contains a disc with one classic TZ comic book from the 1960s and 1970s in PDF format so you can read a classic issue on your computer.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes "everything" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com. Do yourself the favor and get both. You'll thank me for it.
