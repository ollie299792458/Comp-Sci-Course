I have been amazed (as us all) to see the absolute incredible evolution in the career of Tom Hanks.  No one would have guessed that this "Bosom Buddies" actor would ever turn out to be the greatest actor of our times.  Sure, Tom drifted once-and-a-while to scripts that should be better left unmentioned.  But Tom has evolved.
His movies are successful because we are comfortable with Tom in front of our eyes.  He is one of those actors that does not become type-cast or predictable.  He IS the part he plays...and we believe him and want him to be that character.  When he played Jim Lovell in Apollo 13, he was Jim Lovell.  Get my point?  We welcome Tom into our homes and into our lives because he has gives us an enormous gift every time he does another movie.
And in Cast Away, he surpasses our already high expectations with an outstanding and demanding performance.  I have watched this movie numerous times, and each time gives me a warm and pleasant feeling.  Bravo, Tom, for making our lives richer through your superb acting and superb selection of the films you make.
