This movie came out when I was 7 years old and when your that age things tend to scare you more easily.  Well I can't tell you how scared this movie made me then.  Especially the closet stuff, the tree, swimming pools, and under the bed stuff.  What a difference age makes when you rewatch something that scared you so much when you were a kid.  Poltergeist is still one of my all time favorites.  I bet the practice of relocating cemetaries was common back in the day but now I think people are more aware of respect for the dead.  In this movie the construction companies' greed led to this families house to be haunted by many ghosts.  I love the story here and the movie is still fun to watch.

The Movie: It seems that Carolanne's life force is confusing the spirits who are lost in between here and heaven.  They think that the allumination her spirit sends out is the real light and that is why they seem to be haunting her.  Well another presence (The Beast)does not want those spirits to make it to the real light so that presence uses Carolanne to restrain them from traveling to that light.  This family goes through the pain of losing thier daughter somewhere in the house.  Paranormal researchers are called in to investigate the unbelievable event.

ENTER TANGINA:  This character has got to be one of the most interesting and beloved characters I have ever seen in a movie.  THIS HOUSE IS CLEAN.

It becomes a battle between this world and an unknown force that is so powerful it can swallow an entire house.  Just see the movie if you haven't already and have fun showing it to some young kids and let them be traumatized like some of us were.  HEHEHEHEHE
