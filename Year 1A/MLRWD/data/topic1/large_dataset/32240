This movie is utterly unremarkable. I reccomend it to no one. I enjoyed films such as Independance Day and even parts of Godzilla. But this movie has virtually no redeeming qualities. We have seen special effects by now. Recent films (War of the Worlds, Lord of the Rings, The Island) have shown us that special effects can be used to augment good storytelling to make compelling films.

In this case however, the effects stand alone, and there aren't nearly enough of them. There are probably a grand total of 10 minutes of "shock and awe" time in this movie, worth catching on HD HBO, but certainly not worth the price of a DVD or movie ticket.

The actors are not to blame here, Quaid, Holm,and Gyllenhall clearly did what they were asked. However the story and dialogue are so flat I never particularly cared what happened to any of the characters.

I was expecting a fun sci-fi effects romp, which I got for about 10-15 minutes of this film. The rest was just ghastly, ghastly filler.
