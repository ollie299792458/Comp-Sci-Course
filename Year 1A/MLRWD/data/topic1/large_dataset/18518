While the history in "The Lady and the Duke" is spot on and presented from a very accessible personal angle (and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one), the presentation of the lives in this movie is so boring that it makes you pray they'll be sent to the guillotine soon!
But don't get me wrong.  There are redeemable qualities to this film.  All the actors are very believable in their roles.  The Duke presents the story of a man who has made his bed and now has to lie in it, though he comes to hate the Revolution as much as he once hated the corruption that preceeded it.  Grace is eminently believable when she is hiding the refugee in her bed and the guards come in.  And I particularly loved when Grace was stopped by the wall guards and her French became very English, as if she barely understood the language.  No, the actors are not to be blamed for this debacle.  They did their jobs.
It's the staging of this movie:  the painted backdrops and blue-screening is so poor that it makes one feel as if they are watching a play on a stage and not a movie.  The backgrounds of Paris are so obviously painted that I felt like I was watching a Disney cartoon instead of a live-action movie.  With today's technology, surely this was not necessary.  If the budget was really that much of a concern, a better alternative would have been to shoot the entire film indoors.  The outdoor scenes just made the film feel fake to me.
Add to the awful set design and utter lack of cinematography a script that ends as if they ran out of time to shoot and we have The Lady and the Duke.  Honestly, I've seen better productions on PBS and BBC.  I can hardly believe this one was a cinematic release.
If you absolutely must see it for yourself, please try renting it first.  I think buying it would be a waste of money.
