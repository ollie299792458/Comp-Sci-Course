I rarely even give tear-jerkers the time of day, I'm more of a Harrison Ford/Clint Eastwood/band-em-up type of fan, but when I tuned into "Angel Eyes" while running on the treadmill, I liked it so much that I stayed on the machine for the full length. What I got was a great workout both physically and emotionally. I don't need to summarize the plot; the Amazon main review reflects exactly what I thought, and many reviewers have done a great job. I just wanted to add my two cents that, as a 31-year-old grit/action fan, I still enjoyed this film a lot. It's not the saccharine silly love of every other chick-flick, this movie deals with the difficulties of love in this world, on two fronts: family and partner. This is definitely the best Jennifer Lopez movie I've ever seen (gosh, "Anaconda" might be a close second!) and Caviezel has the perfect blend of romantic/haunted/creepy that makes "Catch" a deep character. He's a great guy with a CATCH of his own: if you love him, you have to understand his past.

I really felt good at the end, as it didn't finish on a silly little everything's-peachy note. I think the director and screenwriter did a great job of tying it up in the finale. See what you think. And guys: don't be afraid of this one. Hey, maybe if you suggest this one for a movie date with your girl, you'll enjoy it and score some points at the same time! :D
