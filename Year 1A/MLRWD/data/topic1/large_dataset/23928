Ok, so the dialogue isnt the greatest, the acting is a little stiff, and sometimes you can see the strings holding up Vincent and his Texan counterpart, but this is one of those movies that shouldnt be taken  seriously anyway!  Speaking of Vincent, quit picking on him!  I thought he  was cool, a lot less annoying of a kid's immick than Jar-Jar! (if maybe a  tinge too philosophical...)  Even into the new millenium I think most of  the FX and set designs hold up very nicely to today's movies (the black  hole itself and the meteor are still stunning).  This is really more of a  kid's sci-fi movie, and truthfully it made me feel like one again watching  it!  Mix together Lost In Space (for storyline and characters) , 2001 (for  visuals) , and Star Wars (set/costume design) and you get the Black Hole.  Also worth watching to see Norman Bates and Ernest Borgnyne as astronauts!  Dont take this movie too seriously and you'll love it...trust me!  DVD  version picture was nice and crisp, sound was as good it probably was in  its day,  but a la cheap-o Disney, don't expect any worthwhile extras (like  all their other dvd's).  I think this movie was more enjoyable and better  than the Phantom Menace...honestly!
