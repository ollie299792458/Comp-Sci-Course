Sometimes you get lucky, and are a fan of a great filmaker, and on the hunch that anything they make will be gold, you go out and get a film and are treated to a gem like this.
No this film is not for everyone.  Yet perhaps it is?  I know all about where the movie came from and what inspired it.  I belong to the SCA.  This film captured, at least for me, exactly what I joined the SCA for.  A kind of escape from reality, without being totaly delusional and dysfunctional.  
It's a joyride into many peoples ideals of getting away from it all, and doing your own thing.  At the same time the ideals of Arthurian legends are lived, not just imagined.  
As movies go it is quite possibly the best example I have ever seen of what a truly gifted writer/director can do with the least amount of money and hype.  Nothing else I could say would do justice to this film.  It's now one of my favorites of all time, and I don't need to justify why.  Simply pick up this movie, give it a good sturdy chance at winning your heart, and you will find something about this movie that will really pull you in.  Nuff said, what are you waiting for go get this movie :)
