I am not going to go into what the movie was about , describe the story plot , or give credit to the great performance done by the actors and actresses as the previous reviewers have already done that. I love fantasies so enjoyed the movie very much. Our imagination can be a lot of fun. I will however give my view of the theme of the movie which is knowledge can be a dangerous thing. This theme is used a lot in today's world for various reasons. Examples can be found almost anywhere. Many governments use the excuse national security to keep citizens in the dark when they are at war to keep the enemy from finding out their spies or their battle strategy. In this instance however, a scientist is studying nature (representing lets say Darwin). Cute little fairies disguised as flowers represent a popular religion (lets say christiananity). And, the Ogre represents non-believers (lets say atheists). The message becomes clear at this point. If you stray from your religion (represented by the circle), the devil will get you and knowledge about nature (heresy)is used by the devil to destroy you.
