Bullitt is Steve McQueen at his finest! It's an excellent movie with an excellent cast, a great plot, top notch acting, and the "Greatest" chase scene ever filmed. Two of the most powerful street cars of the 1960's (1968 GT 390 Mustang Fastback, and a 1968 Dodge Charger) battled it out on the streets of San Francisco! If you have a big screen TV you'll enjoy feeling yourself move in your seat with the cars as they race down the hills of frisco. Cameras are mounted in the windshields for the best special effect ever. I remember when I was a kid watching Bullitt in the theater, everyone was rocking in their seats as the cars went down the hills. This movie was made when all of the actors were stars and headliners, not like today with one or two leading actors and a bus load of newbies. Also, Bullitt was real stuff - not special effects! Bullitt was made before green screens, gimicks, and computer techology had come along. The racing was real, the crashing was real, the explosions were real, and yes - Steve really drove the Gt 390 Mustang.
