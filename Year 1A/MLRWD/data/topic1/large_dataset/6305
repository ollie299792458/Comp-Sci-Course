First off, I CANNOT BELIEVE the four & five star reviews for this muddled, confusing film adaptation of a brilliant book, set in a small town in upstate N. Y., by one of America's best modern day writers, who incidently, also wrote this horrible screenplay. Are we talking about the same Empire Falls here, or are all these reviews- PHONIES, written by HBO publicity hacks????!!!!
Mr Russo has demonstrated  to this writer / viewer he needs to stick with the book writing and leave screenplays to accomplished screenwriters, or at least cowrite it with one! Thankfully, I have read the book, and truly  needed the information from it, to make it through a movie filled with so many unanswered questions, unexplained characters & side stories left unexplained.......!!!!??/#*!%
At the finish of the film I spent a good deal of time explaining the plot and characters to my wife and five others who were viewing with us- as so much of this movie left people in the dark!
What a waste of a brilliant cast here also!
For a great film adaptation of a Richard Russo book, definitely try "Nobody's Fool", which also stars Paul Newman & the late great Jessica Tandy, heading a stunning  all star cast.
Additionally, I highly recommend reading any of Mr Russo's great books, some of which include : "The Straight Man", "Nobody's Fool" and "Empire Falls" ...
Thank goodness I did not actually buy this DVD, but was merely renting.
