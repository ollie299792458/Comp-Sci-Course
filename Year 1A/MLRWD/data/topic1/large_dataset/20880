"Back in 2005-2006, there had been unconfirmed reports of a "best-of" DVD release for Family Matters, a single-disc "favorites" title which was supposedly meant to test the waters and see if there were enough fans out there to warrant season set releases. Such a release never did materialize, and fans have always wondered why the show was missing on DVD. In a September 2008 live online chat with Warner studio execs, hosted by our friends at the Home Theater Forum, the program was brought up in a question. The reply from the studio was: "Family Matters is a title that has always been on our list, but related costs have prevented it thus far and we're working to get around those issues, if possible. MORE TO COME." At last, we're pleased to tell you that "more" is here!

This morning Warner Home Video has formally announced that Family Matters - The Complete 1st Season is coming to DVD at last, on June 8th. The show's rookie year in 1989-90 included 22 episodes starring Reginald VelJohnson, Kellie Shanygne Williams, Darius McCrary, JoMarie Payton, Rosetta LeNoire, Jaimee Foxworth, Telma Hopkins and (starting with the show's 12th episode) Jaleel White as "Steve Urkel". Guest stars include Ron Glass (Barney Miller, Firefly) and Tim Russ (Star Trek: Voyager, Samantha Who?). The DVD release will come on 3 discs, for $29.98 SRP.

Further details - including A/V specs, bonus material (if any...it looks doubtful) and package art - have not been revealed as of this writing. But stay tuned and we'll update you just as soon as we can!"
