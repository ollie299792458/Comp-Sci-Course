One thing you learn about Kung-Fu movies, if you buy a bunch of them, is that they are all the best at something. That is how they sell the DVDs.  This one inspired Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.... supposedly.

Fight scenes: poor.  Lots of stand-off time, with very little actual combat.
Story: simple with obvious twists
Editing/special effects: laughable.

In all, though this film may have fired the _imagination_ of the next generation of martial arts film makers, do not buy this DVD expecting a film that is anywhere near the quality of the current crop of films like, e.g. Ip Man or Fearless.

The screenplay in English is different from the subtitles, both of which are adequate to tell the story.

The one bright spot of this product is that the video quality itself is much better than I expected.  Some of the DVDs I've bought in this genre have been little more than VHS tapes copied onto DVDs.  This was better than that... actual DVD quality, probably.

TL;DR: I wish I had saved my money.
