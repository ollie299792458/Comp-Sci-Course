A positive review. What got me is this is totally realistic. The nerdy kid, buys a costume on amazon :) then gets stabbed in the gut and hit by a car by a jerk who doesn't even stop to see if he's alive. I was tempted to stop watching right there, but the characters were too good. I was worried there would be a bunch of teenagers out there who would don a wet suit and fight crime,  I don't think so.  The rest of the movie where Mindy starts actually doing all the ass kicking is brilliantly enthralling and heart aching to watch. I even loved Red Mist,  who they kept alive at the end of the movie for kickass number2...
Who wouldn't want a one girl/boy hit team to knock off the mafia once and for all? Big Daddy realizes that the "good guys" aren't going to do it as they are themselves entangled with the mob. The story has been told before if you listen to the news. I know we will never have a real life Mindy to slay the scumbags for us, but we can enjoy it while it lasts.
As for seeing a little girl do all this killing, it seemed exactly like a game to her which made it ok.  Nicolas Cage's character had already made all the sacrifices and was not about to have his little girl be helpless, which is what caused the mother's death. Empowering ouselves to be able, like Kick Ass to stand up to bullies and not be victims. Speak softly and carry a big bazooka.
As someone who hates violent movies, this one actually got to me in a good way. Once I got past all the red paint, I enjoyed  watching Mindy chop em up. I might even take up taekwando.
