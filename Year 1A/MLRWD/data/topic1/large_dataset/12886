This review is of the VCI DVD - called CITY OF THE DEAD
also known as HORROR HOTEL.
COTD is a great creepy witch story with lots of atmosphere, a great New England setting and lots of fog. 
The film starts with wonderful title sequence with faceless, hooded figures and medieval chanting. Then a recreation of a 1600s witch burning in Massachusetes. The exploration of witches in a fog drenched town.  Finaly great tension and action in a graveyard setting. 
 If you like fun/scary, old style, black and white films that rely on atmosphere rather then special effects this is for you. 
Almost on par with the original Dracula, the original Haunting, The Uninvited (Ray Miland), The Innocents (Deborah Kerr) and all the Val Lewton films.
 The VCI version has great extras and VCI acquired a beautiful wide-screen print of the film.  The VCI DVD is the best version yet. My only complaint is that the sound is a bit thin even for an older film but the original soundtrack for the most part excelent.
