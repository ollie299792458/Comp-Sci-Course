This marvelous film is based on "Cranford" AND two novellas by Gaskell - "My Lady Ludlow" and "Mr Harrison's Confession". Depending upon which edition of Cranford you purchase, these stories may or may not be included. So much for comparing below the plot of the film to the books.

This adaptation is one of the best ever done and ever shown on the BBC or on PBS here in the States.  The acting is beyond first-rate; these actors are so believable, their acting so subtle and yet strong, that one forgets completely that each of the older ladies is an actor of quite a bit of renown.  The Victorian essentials of thwarted romance, disappointed hopes, bonnets and shawls, legacies and runaway brothers, country towns and grand estates, are enriched with priceless moments of poignancy and laugh-out-loud humor.  If I were to say which actresses run away with the show, they are Judi Dench (quite different here from the feisty woman she often plays) and Imelda Staunton, who apparently can take absolutely any role and make it her own.  Lavish  scenes shot on location, plenty of outdoors to breathe in, wonderful costumes and details.  This is well-worth the buying--I was moved to tears, and can't wait to watch it again.
