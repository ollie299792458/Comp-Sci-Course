Some will call Death in Venice an intellectual masterpiece, showing an artist's gradual awareness of his sexual orientation.
Others will call it the most boring, slow, slow, slow two hours of watching an old man sit in a hotel lobby and on the beach, obsessing over an androgenous young boy.

The scenery and costumes will transport you back to Europe of the late nineteenth century. You also get a look at a troubled artist and his difficulty in fitting in with the world. On these aspects, as a beautifully staged, wonderfully costumed and acted film, it's quite enjoyable. The incredibly beautiful music of Gustav Mahler also gives it a warmth and 1890s glow.

Whether this becomes one of your favorites will be a personal decision. I just wanted to advise you that you may not enjoy this if you're not up to an intense two hour voyage of one man's struggle to come to terms with his gayness.

I had hoped it might be the story of composer Gustav Mahler. Perhaps it is novelist Thomas Mann's vision of Mahler, but it has almost no basis in fact.
But many will find the photography and intense retrospection quite pleasing.
