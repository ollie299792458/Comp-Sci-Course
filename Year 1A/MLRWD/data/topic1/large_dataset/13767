Valley Gay Press Book Reviewer: Liz Bradbury
I don't usually review videos in this column, but the Rosemary and Thyme series, seen as an original serial on PBS, feels like the kind of escapist read you get from an English village style mystery.

The main characters, who are just good friends (but occasionally mistaken for more so) are two middle aged women who work together on creating and restoring the most beautifully filmed English and European gardens you could hope to see.  Former policewoman, Laura Thyme (played by Pam Ferris) whose husband has just dumped her, and recently laid-off college professor Rosemary Boxer (played by Felicity Kendal) find and solve mysteries at every gardening job they take. The `not-too-complex' plots are enhanced by the strong friendship that develops between the two women. That the women do real work, get dirty and look the way real women do, also adds to the story quality.

Three series of six episodes each are available. That ought to get you through the cold winter nights.
