Like so many others, I was fascinated by the banding together of so many tragic, anti-heroic characters of Victorian literature. Unfortunately, there are just too many problems with the movie for it to be worth buying:
- there was no thought behind many of the special effects. When water rushes out of doors and along corridors, none of the running crewmen are bowled over. The chandeliers in the Nautilus don't swing during turns.  How could that huge Nautilus fit into a Ventian canal, let alone turn a corner?
- there was no thought taken for the motivations of any of the characters, good or bad.  Why were Mina & Nemo there at all? What did the villain have to gain from his (fairly expensive) villainy?  And why was he personally there for all the big bombings and shootouts?  Playing it a little risky for an evil mastermind, eh?
- Tell me again: how is firing a Polaris missile from the Nautilus into a specific Venitian building, guided by GPS location of a 1930's-style roadster supposed to save Venice from destruction? And how is it that the guys in the car can find this place through the winding streets of Venice but the crewman up in the crow's nest can't?  And why would you, as the evil genius behind the bombing of Venice not only station scores of your armored men along various (soon to be toast) streets and alleys on the off-chance that a gentlemen-filled car will drive by but also be present yourself? How did he expect to get away? And how did the Nautilus start to sink in Venice, then end up in the open sea when it popped back up?
- The characters, so richly written 125 years ago, were never properly developed in the film. It was hard to care much about any of them.
A little attention to detail could've turned this from a fun summer action-romp into a true X-Men meets Indiana Jones classic. Ah well, rent the DVD once it's off the "New Releases" shelf, drink enough scotch & soda to be able to suspend your disbelief WAY up high, have fun with the movie and thank me that you didn't pay full price.
