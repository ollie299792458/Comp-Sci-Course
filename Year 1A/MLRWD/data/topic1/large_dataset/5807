This series is so different and much more compelling than any other horror-themed television show that I've ever seen. If you like Walking Dead (which I LOVE), it's like the haunted house version of that show because every single episode is so suspenseful and has so much going on that you can't wait to see the next. Every episode is like watching a mini-movie in the sense that each one is completely intriguing, suspenseful, full of story line and such quality visual effects that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Of course it takes a few episodes to get going and start piecing things together but even from the very first episode it is very creepy, gives you chills, piques your interest and leaves you hungry to see what happens next!

We don't actually have cable so we would have to wait for each episode to come up online after it aired that night. It got to the point where it was almost like an event at our house where every week we would get together with friends to watch it.

****One thing though, you really have to start from the beginning  to understand everything that is going on. It would be hard to watch an episode here and there and still be able to know why things are happening the way that they are.

When Supernatural came out I was really excited b/c the effects/creepiness seemed like it was pretty cool but when I watched a few episodes it seemed like it was like watching a glorified Buffy The Vampire type/Teen TV show that I didn't like at all.

I am normally cheap about buying DVD's and like to get the not-too-much-worn-used versions on Amazon and things like that, but this is one of those series that I'm willing to pre-order and pay more than full price to have right away!

If you love horror movies, you just can't pass this one up!
