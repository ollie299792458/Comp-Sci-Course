Having served in the Navy as a musician during the mid-sixties, I had the honor of being assigned to then an Admiral - John Bulkeley's band. While the movie named the character John Brinkley, the story was about John Bulkeley who won the Congressional Medal of Honor after he and his PT boat crew rescued MacArthur and his family from the Island of Corregidor. After I reported aboard the U.S.S. Columbus for duty, that evening I had a private viewing of the film which was the Admiral's policy for any and all who was assigned to his staff (his band was part of the staff). To this day, I frequently watch the film and I still find it to be a great movie. What makes the movie even more special is that director John Ford was an Admiral in the Navy Reserve where he served his annual two week active duty tour with his buddy Admiral Bulkeley. Talk about a bunch of swashbucklers! Since the band played for the Admiral's numerous receptions, we witnessed them in real time as well as hoasting a few side by side with them. While we exercised a certain amount of decorum, they treated us like we were part of the guys. This movie is a 'must' for any swabbie's video library.
