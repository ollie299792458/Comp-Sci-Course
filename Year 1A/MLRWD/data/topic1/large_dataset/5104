Its easy to get burnt out on Anime with the same old story told again and again and again. Young pre-teen boy/girl develops mysterious super powers they didn't know they had to fight an evil that happens to show up at the same time their powers. The young hero transforms into their "true form" at the final scene to vanquish the evil foe... boring and very juvenile.

However, every once in a while a true gem will be made that reminds you why you love this genre. Tekkon Kinkreet is such a movie. Its got it all: Incredibly unique storyline, excellent visuals (backgrounds and city, the characters were drawn simply on purpose), characters you truly care about (I got choked up twice during this movie), and voice acting that isn't horrible. Sure it doesn't have giant mecha robots that crash into and blow up a seemingly infinite supply of buildings, but hey, anyone over 15 years old usually considers that a plus.

If you love anime then do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie. I purchased it as a good movie to show people who are new to the genre.
