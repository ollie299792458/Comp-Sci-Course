This is a good movie.  I mean, not badly cast.  Lovingly done.  The acting is great.  Yeah, you should enjoy it.  Assuming you know absolutely nothing about Victor Hugo's original story.  The truth is, if I didn't know better, I'd say whoever wrote the script never read Hugo's masterpiece and based it completely on the 1935 version.  Come to think of it, I don't know better.  That's probably exactly what happened.
I never thought I'd say this, but I am so glad Hugo didn't have to live to see this movie.
If you've read the book, you will hate this film.  TRUST me.  The plot, especially toward the end, is mercilessly butchered and rewritten.  At some points it becomes utterly unrecognizable.  Many of the revisions completely miss or even destroy the essence of characters, and some do not even make sense, the movie ending with Jean Valjean jubilant over the death of Javet, whose life he has made an enormous sacrifice to save.
Likewise, Javert would never attack Cosette; he was obsessively professional, not cruel.  Nor would end his life (with minimal explanation, no less) in front of Valjean.  Marius would NEVER act like Enjolras (oh, I forgot, there IS no Enjolras).  Neither Marius NOR Enjolras would smile at remarks about making love to Cosette, so I find it hard to believe that some mutant hybrid Marjolras would.  Cosette would never consider leaving Marius, her soulmate, to stay with Valjean, her adoptive father.  And above all, Jean Valjean would NEVER, EVER fall in love with Fantine.  The mere suggestion of this limits the portrayal of his charity to people he takes a special interest in.
Small variations are to be expected in any film adaptation of a book, but these all completely distort characters.  The people who made this movie may have gotten the message (love, charity, etc.), but they missed the point.
If you've never read the book, see this movie.  It is touching and carries a good message.
But it is not Les Mis&eacute;rables.
