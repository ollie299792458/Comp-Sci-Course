I've just now finished watching every second of this four-DVD set...and I found it funny, fascinating and informative. Yes, the episodes are painfully hilarious, with brilliant acting from Shandling, Torn and Tambor. The only thing seemingly dated is the live musical performances, but hey, the '90s were the '90s. The real kick is what you might call "Garry's Journey." Garry Shandling is a very smart, talented and basically neurotic guy who goes back to many guests of the show years later and asks them questions about the show and about him. You can see how he used humor as a shield and is painfully sincere in his questioning of how people thought of him and the show..only occasionally lapsing into shtick, which he can do instantly. Hours of this "new sincerity" do begin to wear, until Jon Stewart offers him two words of advice: "Lighten up!" And he does. The funniest bonus interviews are with Tom Petty, just because they are both such humorous people, and with Jerry Seinfeld. Worth the price of the entire DVD set is the scene on a Central Park bench when Garry and Jerry compare verbal tics that irritate them ("Can I say something?" "Here's what I think." "Here's a thought," etc.) If you were a fan of the show and want to see the behind the scenes of a show that was built around "behind the scenes," this is the DVD set for you.
