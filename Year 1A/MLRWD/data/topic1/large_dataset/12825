For anyone to attempt to tackle World War II in its entirety seems foolish.  The sheer scope of the war seems like an insurmountable mountain.  I mean, how can any one organization document events from the Beer Hall Putsch to the Japanese surrender aboard the U.S.S Missouri?  It seems impossible to do with 100 DVDs.

The World At War series does the impossible.  The amount of obscure footage in this series is worth the price of admission.  One vivid example -- there is footage of the Japanese and Russian battles in the Far East!  There is footage of the Japanese invasion of China.  Footage of German soldiers swimming in a river on the Eastern Front...during WINTER.  The siege of Leningrad?  Yep, footage from INSIDE the city during the siege.

There is some amazing U-boat footage from the battles in the North Atlantic.  Watching merchant ships being torpedoed is quite awful.  Seeing the tight and confined spaces inside the U-boats made my skin crawl.

In the Far East, there is footage of Japanese cities prior to the start of hostilities!  It is fascinating footage.  There is even a clip from inside a Japanese theater that shows some of a propaganda movie from the era.

Sir Laurence Olivier's narration and timing is nothing short of brilliant.  He provides vivid descriptions and details when appropriate.  Sir Laurence also knows when to let the pictures speak for themselves.  As the cameras panned over the utterly destroyed Stalingrad, Sir Laurence lets the pictures speak volumes for the ruined city.

A&E, despite their awful broadcast habits, managed to stay out of the way of this series.  No annoying on-screen distractions.  No popups.  Just straight footage and narration.

I'm only about a third of the way through the series but am utterly addicted.

As other reviewers note, this series was originally created in the mid-1970s.  Still, for any person interested in studying World War II, this series is a must-have.
