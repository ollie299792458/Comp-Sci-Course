This movie is much of the same story line of the first one, except is is 10x as good. It starts off with the family running around packing for there vacation to a tropical place. At the family's Christmas concert Buzz (Kevin's brother) pisses Kevin off during his solo. They both create a scene and end up explaining the family many apologies. Kevin talks back and is sent ot his brothers room (the one who pisses the bed) to sleep.
The next morning the family gets up late and are rushing to the airport. Keving trails behind and gets on another plane. Kevin arrives in New York and reliazes that he had took the wrong plane. he is thrilled, however his family is not. 
The first thing that Kevin does is all the stuff that his parents won't let him do. He checks into a hotel, using his dads Visa. He then goes shopping at a toy store, with his dad's money. Kevin soon finds out that the wet bandants are in new York and that they are after him. This sends him on a chase.
This movie is a great movie and a fun movie which you can watch time and time again. It displays a perfect image of the Christmas craze we go through each year. I'd 100% recommend this movie.
