Was it just me, or did the movie end before the real story was over? I know that I shouldn't be hinting at the ending, but as this is a light, romantic comedy starring down-to-earth Tom Hanks and girl-next-door Meg Ryan, anyone who doesn't know--in the most general sense, of course--what happens in the end has probably not seen a movie in over a decade.
The love-on-line angle is not the real story, but the framework. The real story is about how Mr. Chain Store meets Miss Sole Proprietor and how they have to reconcile love and business. Yes, we romantics want them to end up together, live happily ever after, yadda, yadda, yadda . . . but we also want the princess to have her own store--or at least her own life--after marriage. 
As for the framework, it had some loose ends, a lot of subplots that the screenwriter and director didn't follow through to the end. For instance, what was the deal with Tom Hanks' "wicked stepmother" and "American family"? Why did they get so much attention when they didn't influence the plot beyond Hanks and Ryan's first meeting in her bookstore? They took up a lot of film that could have been used for a satisfying denoument.
After doing such a great job of showing how beautiful New York is in the fall, the winter and the spring (thereby, I've heard, not really showing New York at all), both the director and the set designers neglected New York in the summer. (Though I barely noticed because my eyes kept wandering to the costumes, which were even more fabulous than the sets.) Unlike "Sleepless in Seattle", which even has a better soundtrack, "You've Got Mail" doesn't come full circle. It will make living in New York, going on line, or being in love look 100% perfect--but as anyone who is experiencing any will tell you, that isn't the whole story at all.
