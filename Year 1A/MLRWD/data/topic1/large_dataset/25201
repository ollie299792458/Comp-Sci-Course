This movie was one of my favorites as a child and even now, 25+ years later, it still tickles my funny bone!  When I saw it in the 70's, it was the first time for me to see Barbra and Ryan in a movie. They are  hilarious and look great.  They make a great "on-screen" couple!  The late Madeline Kahn is a real gem here also - she is wonderful in each  and every scene.
There are almost too many funny scenes to mention here.  Scenes to look for are the drug store, the Laraby dinner party, the bubble  bath, the fiasco in Howard's room (just listening to Madeline Kahn rant and  rave to Howard during this scene cracks me up!) and who could forget Barbra  singing to Ryan on top of the piano!
I also love the scene in the court  room.  The judge is one of my favorites!  He is hilarious!
Not to be  missed - a real funny movie that has never lost it's charm!  This was a  movie my parents and I would watch in the 70's every time it was on TV.  Now I can enjoy it over and over on video.  The only thing that is missing  now is a DVD version!  Hopefully this will be soon, and when they do, it  will include all the outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage!  
A  wonderful movie that will make you laugh and smile, and a "G"  rating to boot, something the whole familiy can enjoy - which these days,  is hard to come by!  ENJOY!
