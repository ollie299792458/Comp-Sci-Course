I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I have loved it ever since! Seeing as how I was only about 7 at the time, that's saying a lot. I have been into karate and martial arts for quite some time (I have four brothers!) and that has evolved into being more and more of a Bruce Lee fan as well. I have been searching town for a copy of this movie on DVD since my family only owned the video of it, and finally resorted to this online purchase! The day I got it, I watched the movie and all the extras and the commentary. VERY exciting and interesting to watch! Bruce Lee is an icon and always will be included as one of my heroes. He did so much to inspire people, those who like martial arts or not. This movie is a good reference if you want to know more about Bruce Lee as a person, his personality, his family life, what he is basically all about. Linda Lee (Caldwell) helped with making this movie and Shannon Lee, their daughter plays a small part in it, which is fun to see. I would recommend watching this movie to anyone and can watch it over and over and over again!
