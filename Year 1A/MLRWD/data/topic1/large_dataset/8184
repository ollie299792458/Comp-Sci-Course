Ya know, you just can't trust some of the reviews on Amazon. I read several before purchasing the Hounddog" DVD and then waited a month till buying it.
Once I had the movie, I left it sit there unopened for even longer. The reviews combined with the title, made me feel almost perverted, with my being 41 years old.

This movie had nothing to do with its implications. This little girl was not a sex fiend/addict in any way.
She was sweet and caring.

Those reviews must have been written by a woman hating creep. Ya know the type, She got what she deserved type of mentality.

In-fact, it was a very good movie and totally worth watching again.

I was somewhat difficult to watch this pretty skinny little girl performing her Elvis routine. I actually preferred to look away for those parts.

Another problem I had was seeing the older teenager, completely covered with acne. It was very disgusting and left me wondering as to why no adult back then didn't teach the kid how to fix such a thing.

So, there is no "sex" scenes" in this movie. Just a hidden Rape scene.

This movie is just as good as any other thoughtful movie.

I can totally recommend this being bought.
