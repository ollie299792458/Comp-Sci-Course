If I hadn't read the wonderful book by Lloyd C. Douglas I would probably have given this a higher rating. But this purports to be an adaptation of the book and so I judge it as such. The book was the first adult length novel I read when I was about 10. I loved it. The first time the film was televised I was in high anticipation that Easter. But the longer I watched it the deeper and deeper my disappointment and disillusionment became. The screenwriter didn't do just the usual tinkering, he changed personalities and basic relationship, eliminated the best episodes, not just one or two, but five. Yes, that may have made it too long for theatrical release as one film, but basic integrity should have dictated that either the producers ought to have committed to one long feature or to two of more conventional length and spared us the dreary sequel about Demetrius. They probably could have counted on a good box-office either way since this was a wildly successful best-seller. Also, while Burton and Mature were fine actors, neither we're suitable to portray the book version of the characters, already much distorted. In other words, I think that as an adaptation it must be among the worst ever made. The film has little in common with the book except the title, the names of characters and the core premise. If this film had not been an adaptation, I would think it a very fine movie. But, unfortunately, it is an adaptation so I think it's awful. I think that the use of the book's reputation made it at the very least false advertising and IMO actually a kind of fraud.
