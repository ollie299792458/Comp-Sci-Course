Robin Williams is an amazing actor, im sure he could pull off a movie with purely pantomimes and nothing more, so he is perfect for this role as Si, a Photodeveloper at a local supermart. It is a supremely delicate role in that he has to portray being obsessed with what he wants and appear almost as a stalker and yet still make the audience feel bad for him, if it weren't for the extreme position he is found in at the climax of this movie im sure everyone could truly say, 'that could be me.' I would  reccomend this movie to anyone with a strong understanding of symbolism within movies or other arts and also to anyone searching for a movie that has more to offer in which the director has ingrained subplots or hidden meanings, etc.etc., but you must understand that Robin Williams' character is not simply a homely stalker latched onto an unlucky family, he is a midlife lonely man who only wants someone to love and love him in return, he has nothing else so he attatches to this family he sees as perfect; a large house, a beautiful son, wife, and husband, a pet dog, a new car, everything top of the line. He ends up uncovering the 'beneath-the-surface' america that is really in every home at different levels and it infuriates him, i reccommend going to sparknotes and looking up this movie for further symbolism and theme descriptions, its not one to miss.
