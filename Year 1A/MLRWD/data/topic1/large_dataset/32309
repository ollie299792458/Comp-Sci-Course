Most sequels don't surpass their predacessors, but this one does.  The first Bond movie was Dr.No, starting the popular franchise, but it was Goldfinger in 1964 that is still the finest of the films.  Sean Connery, the finest James Bond, is determined to stop Auric Goldfinger a man who is determined to get what he wants.  His plot is called "Operation Grand Slam" which is a plot to raid Fort Knox.
  But of course, James has his gadgets, but most of them are within the best Bond car to date, his Aston Martin, with machine guns, an ejector seat, [there's a very nice car scene involving this one and one guy stupid enough to let Bond drive] and a smoke screen.  I'm not going to ruin the movie for you, but I will tell you about the Bond girl in this film, Pussy Galore [Honor Blackman], who happens to be one of the finest.
  With a henchman who has a hat to die for [literlly], and some catchphrases that you already know even without having seen it [thanks to it's impact on pop culture], this Bond film will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.
