Most everyone I know who's seen this film joyously remembers one of its scenes: a wonderful sequence in which the half-inspired, half-delirious Farley Mowat (called "Tyler" for purposes of this film) dashes back and forth with a caribou herd as they veer across the greening tundra in a remote Alaskan valley. There are few moments in film more nicely done, more mad and extraordinary and beautiful than that brief run and the simple-but-powerful percussion score playing behind it.

I'll leave to others reviewers to explain for you exactly WHY Mowat does his "Naturalists Gone Wild" take -- and it does make wonderful sense in the context of the unfolding story!

I'll share only this: be ready for one of those small, most-special, slightly startling moments that define fine cinema. As a young, single man in 1983, I chose to take the most beautiful and intelligent woman I knew to see this newly-released movie, chose this above all others, precisely because I knew that the "Caribou run" scene would move her deeply (it did, to my later joy that night). But the important part was that I was moved even more; I remembered the beauty and joy of that dash-with-the-Caribout for two decades, 'til one night I was lucky enough to see it replayed on cable and rediscovered it, just as brilliantly photographed, as magical, and as exhilarating as I'd remembered from first viewing.

SEE this movie, or, rather, indulge yourself in this film nougat -- and it will repay you with sights and emotions well beyond what this much-neglected movie's "ratings" might have led you to expect. Have fun! And, Disney, you have a brilliant-cut gem, here -- get it a new mounting, prepare new DVD's from a new print! -- hell, re-release it! What a fine film you made, and what a silly decision to look right past it for these 25 years since.
