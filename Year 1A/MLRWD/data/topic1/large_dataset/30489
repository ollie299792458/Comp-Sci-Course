Sure this movie was unbelievable at times, but it is a movie. Keanu Reeves plays a busy architect and Sandra Bullock is a doctor.  Sandra's character loses her first patient in a horrible car vs. bus vs. pedestrian accident.  She takes some well-meaning advice and goes to the place she feels safest in the world, the lake house she had previously rented.  While there she leaves a message for the new tenant, Keanu Reeves.  Through thier correspondence they fall in love, but the story must follow them through life's struggles.  But will they ultimately end up together?  Well I am not going to ruin the end of the movie.  :)

This move is a cross between "Somewhere in Time" and "Sleepless in Seattle" (a more obscure comparison would be Hallmark's Hall of Fame movie "The Love Letter").  It is a little slow in a couple of spots and even my husband knew how it would end before we got there.  But over all it was a good Friday night, stuck at home sitting by the fire, watching movies movie.  I recommend it.
