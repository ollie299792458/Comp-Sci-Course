...but I've always wondered since a child whether the world of fairies, leprechauns, ogres, goblins, and sprites was just there beyond the envelope of what we call reality.  When I happened to catch a commercial advertising this movie while at a friend's house. I was intrigued by the special effects and imagery.

Intrigued enough that the commercial remained at the back of my thoughts enough that I broke down and purchased the movie not long after it's release.  The following Saturday afternoon, I curled up on the couch, popcorn on hand, slipped the dvd in the player and settled back.  Alternatively, I laughed, shivered a bit, and jumped during moments of the movie.  All in all it was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon.

I rated it as follows:

Imagery - 4 stars
Special effects were wonderful, the monsters cutely terrifying with alot of scene ambience.
Acting - 3 stars
Sometimes it felt forced, and at times the emotion was divergent from the storyline.
Story - 4 stars
This is something I would read my children, and grandchildren.
Entertainment Value - 4 stars
As I stated a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.

Over all I felt the movie rated 4 stars based on the imagery, story line, and entertainment value.
