Hey guys.  The best anime film I've seen, EVER.  To start, this has the coolest villian you couldn't ever imagine.  He was not the main villian in the movie but, a character like Tessai is what every good anime creator should base their main villian on.  He is the ideal badass.  Though he is my favorite character in the movie, I feel that there was one other person that did not get the credit that he deserved.  I think the best fighter in the feature is the Blind Swordsman in white who issues a challenge to Jubei.  It has been a while since I've seen the film so I can't remember the guy's name.  I feel that had it not been for the girl ninja, Kigaro, he would still be alive today.  Anyone who has seen the film can't deny these facts.  In every perspective that I've viewed it, the film is artistically excellent and beautifully written.  11 out of 10 stars, esily.  If you havn't seen this movie, it should not be ignored and should be an item on every collectors list.  If anyone else feels me on this, holla back!
