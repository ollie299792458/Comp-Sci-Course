The Train Robbers is one of those straightforward old-fashioned good guy vs bad guy westerns.  A movie with a basic plot that doesn't take itself too seriously.  What is noticeable right off is that there are very few actors in this movie, eight, and everything revolves around their relationships. There is the straight shooting Lane (John Wayne) who gathers his old friends Grady (Rod Taylor) and Jesse (Ben Johnson) to restore Mrs. Lowe's (Ann-Margret) honor. She doesn't want her son growing up under the dark cloud of his dead father being a train robber.  Rounding out the team is Ben (Bobby Vinton), Sam (Jerry Gatlin), and Calhoun (Christopher George).  Their job is ride into Mexico, recover $500,000 in stolen gold locked in the boiler of an old locomotive, return it to Wells Fargo, collect the reward money, and set things right for Mrs. Lowe.  Trailing along behind them all is a mysterious rider (Ricardo Montalban).  The remaining movie's cast are just back ground minglers in the set.  They  mainly consist of the train engineer, the bartender, the Mexicans trying to rescue their jailed friends, and the cannon fodder bad guys. They are seen but have no speaking roles.

This is a very simple movie in many ways.  However, it does a very good job in developing the friendship and camaraderie between good old friends.  This combined with beautiful scenic shots and set pieces make for a  light-hearted fare with no dark undertones or jarring side trips.  Rounded out  with comedy and action, this movie certainly demonstrates that less is more.

While not the best western that John Wayne has starred in, this movie does succeeds in many ways.  Formated in wide-screen with few extras on the DVD, this western is well worth adding to the John Wayne collection
