Indeed, this movie is one of my guilty pleasures only because the story is so fantastic, so unbelievable that I can picture myself as a teenager daydreaming this story up about myself.

Hilary Duff plays the clumsy, yet charming young Lizzie McGuire who journeys to Rome for a school trip. Disney could not have picked a better location for Rome is one of my favorite cities. The movie does well to highlight certain sites, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Villa d'Este (which isn't even in Rome but just northeast of it) and a montage scene when Lizzie arrives in Rome is a nice addition. After Lizzie finds herself mistaken for an Italian pop star (strange coincidence isn't it?) she goes on a whirlwind adventure trying to sneak past Ms. Ungermeyer, her teacher, who is an enjoyable character herself, while enjoying the delights of Rome.

It is a little difficult seeing Lizzie McGuire as an unpopular girl in her grade. She is way too cute to not be part of the in-crowd and has a fantastic wardrobe (although I could not imagine walking around the cobblestone streets of Rome in the hot Mediterranean sun in heels) while Lizzie's quasi-nemesis Kate wears suits daily and is mean to everyone.

Bottom line is that this is a fun, believe-in-yourself-and-your-dreams-will-come-true Disney story. A true guilty pleasure. Just enjoy it!
