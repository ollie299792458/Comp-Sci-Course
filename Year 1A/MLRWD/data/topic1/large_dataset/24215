There is a simple reason this version of the wife-and-boyfriend-kill-husband thriller works better than all the others (Postman Always Rings Twice going back to Terese Raquin): William Hurt makes you like the boyfriend character Ned Racine. Hurt is greatly helped by brilliant acting turns from J.A. Preston as a cop, Ted Danson as an assistant D.A., and Mickey O'Rourke as an ex-con, who play characters that are also fond of Ned. In fact, the warmth and humor generated by the scenes these male actors play together are some of my favorites in the film. It also helps that the the script can subtly mock itself, while still forcing you to take its story seriously.

This is not to minimize the film's other virtues--especially the equally brilliant performances of Richard Crenna as the scary husband and Kathleen Turner as the scheming wife--but only to explain its uniqueness.

Amazing that "Body Heat" momentarily makes you forget the absurdity of people constantly sweating in the Florida heat, both indoors and out, as though air-conditioning hasn't been invented yet! (The story is not set in the past; the cars are all contemporary, as are the clothes.)
