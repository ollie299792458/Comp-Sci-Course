This movie certainly is not for everyone.  It starts out very promising with some very funny "fake" trailers.  Then the squirming begins.  This movie funny, but it isn't a laugh out loud, tears streaming down your face funny.  It's more of a "Oh my gosh, I can't believe they just did that" snicker.  You almost feel bad for watching it because you will find things humorous that you somehow feel you shouldn't, but you will smile anyways.  I personally found it to be entertaining and I bought the Blu-Ray even after seeing it in theaters so it wasn't a blind buy.  It's one of those movies that I will enjoy watching with others just to see how they react.  For most people, I would say this is a rental unless you catch a good deal, but you should make the effort to see it.  The performances are great and this has become only the second movie that I have enjoyed Robert Downey Jr in, with Iron Man being the first.  Jack Black was the only character that I really didn't like for most of the movie.  I just wanted to watch him in "The Fatties" which is his characters money maker.  Anyways, again, it's a solid rental, but if your thing is comedy, action and a lot of uncomfortableness, then go ahead and buy it.  It looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray and you might end up liking it like me.
