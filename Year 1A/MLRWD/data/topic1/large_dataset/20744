This was the first time for me to buy from Amazon and I was a little apprehensive. I am of the older generation and not so tech savvy as the new generation. I ordered a movie that in passing my wife mentioned was one of her all time favorites. It arrived in just a few days I was pleasantly surprised. We put it in the dvd player and nothing I tried everything. I put a few dvd's that we knew worked to find out for sure the one we just got from Amazon did not work. Well you can imagine my concern returning dvd's opened never happens for obvious reasons. I figured we would just have to eat it, so to speak. I went online to see what I could do to return it, and it was a little scary, I wasn't sure what would happen. To my surprise there were no road blocks there was a new one on the way before I had even sent the bad one back. I cannot say enough of how this was handled, I would buy anything from Amazon.com again without any fear at all. Thank you Amazon.com for making me a very happy customer.

Best regards
