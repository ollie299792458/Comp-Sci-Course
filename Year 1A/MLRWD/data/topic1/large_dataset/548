First off, let me say that I've not seen the Korean version, so I'm not going to make any comparison. I was living in Vietnam when the original movie came out (some time in 2002), and it was a mega-mega hit there. So, it's understandable if some people are not satisfied with the remake.

That out of the way, I have to say that this is an excellent movie. I don't see this one so much like a "drama marketing as a comedy". It is sort of a funny romantic movie. I think the director did a good job of keeping the spirit of the original movie. I'm not Korean, but a Vietnamese. I understand the Asian mindset. I don't know how different the two are, but the story in general is very very Asian, at least in my opinion. I'd not go too much on the romantic side and focus on the funny side.

The "romantic" comedy was great! I'll explain it. I don't like movies are too predictable. This one is definitely not. The movie kept me on edge during the  "1 year after" sequence at the tree. When I saw they bury letters under the tree and decide to meet 1 year later, I thought of it as a classic tragedy in romantic movie. You know, like one character will be there, reads the letter and finds one his loved one had some terrible illness (most often some kind of cancer). All that character can do is to sit there with nostalgia because his lover is already dead.

Well, they got me there. I don't want to spoil the movie, so go ahead and watch it. I came from crying (they were such a great couple) to laughing out really loud.

Anyway, enjoy the movie! I also recommend you to watch it the second time to pick up the nuances you probably overlook the first time you see it. The ending connects all those clues.

Oh, one more thing. Elisha Cuthbert is gorgeous! To be honest, I decided to watch this movie because of her name. I can't keep my eyes off her. I'm not surprise Charlie felt in love with her at first sight. She is simply gorgeous!
