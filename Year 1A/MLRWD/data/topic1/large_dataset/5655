How this DVD qualifies as a "special edition," I have no idea.  The "special features" include one audio commentary, the theatrical trailer and a non-interactive list of the cast and crew.  That's it.
Sure, it's the first widescreen edition of this movie on DVD, but it's matted widescreen, which means that although we are seeing what the director intended us to see, it's also less picture than the fullscreen version.  It was shot in 1:85-1 ratio anyway, so it's not a big deal.
The audio commentary is absolutely awful - the worst one I've ever heard.  For one, it's got way too many people on it... six, to be exact.  None of whom are Chevy Chase.  Watching the commentary is like watching the movie with a bunch of old ladies, as the actors constantly interrupt each other, repeat each other, try to remember the names of bit-part actors, start thoughts and don't complete them, and obsess about how they look onscreen.  I truly felt sorry for Johnny Galecki (Rusty Griswold), who's mostly silent except when the women prod him with stupid questions, like did he get to kiss Juliette Lewis (the answer is no).
Even the DVD case is generic - the old-style paper case with the black plastic tab to close it.  Everything about this DVD screams "ripoff."
Still, I suppose I'm glad to have it, since it replaces a fuzzy VHS tape that I found in the hallway of the apartment I stayed in during college.  I still laughed out loud at the movie about a dozen times, even though I've seen it at least 50 times.
