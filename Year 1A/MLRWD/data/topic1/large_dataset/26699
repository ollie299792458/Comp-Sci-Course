I am presently viewing The Barchester Chronicles for the 3rd time and enjoying it immensely. The characters are dead-on portrayals of villagers, clergymen and their wives and daughters with all their human foibles. Money, power and ego are fought for here behind all the facades of righteousness. Never depressing though; it's very funny and humor rules the day.
The role of the mild-mannered warden of the hospital is played very well by Donald Pleasance. Nigel Hawthorne is the Arch Deacon who can barely keep his temper under any circumstances, but finds it especially difficult when dealing with Bishop Proudy's shrew of a wife, played brilliantly by Geraldine McEwan (she's absolutely scary). Alan Rickman, as Mr. Slope, takes away top honors in his outstanding portrayal of the Bishop's chaplain. His slimy, smarmy persona counterbalances the witchy ways of Mrs. Proudy and together they manage to give the Bishop many of his "sick headaches."
Take the ride to Barchester, it's well worth the trip!
