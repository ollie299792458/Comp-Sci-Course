You can spend your evening watching yet another cop show or you can delve into fabulous fun by watching this, the frothiest answer to the Great Depression.

The film begins with a huge close of up Ginger Rogers singing the ditty "We're in the Money" in pig-Latin (added to the film when she was overheard doing this off the set).  The chorus girls go through their Busby Berkeley routine clad only in oversized coinage and so we know we are off on quite the romp.

The next scenes provide the grit of the Depression in the form of closed theaters, out of work actresses and pilfered milk bottles, but not to worry!  There is always a song coming on, and Dick Powell, that charming neighbor across the airshaft has already captured Ruby Keeler's heart with his tunes and his smile.  Her gal pals are not buying his applesauce, but when he provides the funds to underwrite their next big show that is sure to make them all happy if not famous, well, things start looking up big time.

We are gifted with some of the best of the Berkeley numbers in this film.  The "Shadow Waltz" is breathtakingly gorgeous with all of those lovely chorus girls in the best Art Deco dresses ever dreamed, on their Dr. Seuss-ish set, as they play their neon violins...  Like drifting on one very snazzy cloud.  And the "Pettin' in the Park" number brings a whole new meaning to the question, "How long do you stay fresh in that can?"

The singing by both Joan Blondell and the incomparable Etta Moten (for whom Gershiwin wrote the role of Bess)in the "Remember My Forgotten Man" finale (by Al Dubin and Harry Warren) is as good as you will find anywhere.

Sprinkled all through this is a problem that is skillfully handled by a smattering of wise cracks, high-jinks and good clean fun that will make you glad that you took a trip back in time.
