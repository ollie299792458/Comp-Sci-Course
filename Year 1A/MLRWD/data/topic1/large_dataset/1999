This is a wonderful movie, and being used to the standard offering where macho italian mobsters beat up on their dumb molls, it is a real breath of fresh air.
Jennifer Tilley oozes sexuality from the opening scene in this movie, and never stops right to the end.  She plays Violet, her character, brilliantly.  A mob club Vamp who is there as furniture for the boys, and they drool and fight over her, little realising her true nature.
Enter Gina Gershon, the butch ex-con called Corky, flaming obvious lesbian, replete with tattoos and leathers.  Boom!  Violet moves from Vamp to seductress in some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed - gay or straight!
Having formed a sexually charged but shallow bond, the ladies embark on a plan to relieve the mob of a couple of million in blood money.  Violets significant other, Caesar (played brilliantly by Joe Pantoliano) is busy in the apartment laundering the money for the mob.  In a tongue in cheek parody, he actually has to launder the money, washing off the blood, haning it to dry, and ironing it.
In classic Hitchcock tradition, Violet and Corkey tell us exactly how the heist is going to go down.  And of course, it all goes horrible wrong.  Caesar is not as dumb as they thought, and the plot escalates into angst, madness, violence and murder with a neat Tarantino-esqe twist.
This is a great movie - Hitchcock meets Tarantino.  Lots of atmosphere and suspense, but also lots of laughs, not to mention mayhem and murder.  Not a movie for those who are squeamish around blood, murder, violence, lesbianism or drain clearence.  But highly recommended for those who love bondage, leather, tattoos, butch lady decorators and shiny stainless steel sink traps.
