Ok, First of all it should have been a game, NOT a movie as it was created using game creation software.  The plot is horrible and is all over the place, the voice acting is not great and the coloring/lighting/camera angles are all ridiculous.  At parts the camera keeps moving so fast you can hardly tell what's going on. And unless they meant to film the whole thing in SEPHIA and BLUE then it would deserve the 2 stars I am giving it, otherwise it would get a 1 star as if I wanted to see a 1950's style film, I would have watched one.  The Water Creatures may work in a Game, but they definitely don't translate over in DVD form.  I really don't know what to say about how BAD this movie really is, except for that it never should have been made.  If you want to see a really good independent film see Dragon Hunters and compare the difference. If you want to see a really good CGI movie based on a game then see Resident Evil: Regeneration.  This movie is NOT FOR KIDS they will be bored to tears.  Avoid this movie if you possibly can it's like the GIGLI of CGI.
