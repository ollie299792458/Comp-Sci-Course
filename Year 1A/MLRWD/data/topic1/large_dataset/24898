A beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting. Russell Crowe shouldn't try the Hugh Grant shtick! The movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into Hollywood's story template mire. Hollywood won't take any chances, it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over. Hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises, are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before. You know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes. The only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and Albert Finney's performance. He commands your attention, fills the screen with his acting. A superb performance. Many have said it is the new "French Kiss". Though the story lines are similar, the direction and character development in "French Kiss" was much better. Kevin Kline's acting and character development were excellent. If you want to see this genre done really well, watch the film "Mostly Martha" directed and written by Sandra Nettelbeck. No, it's not about Martha Stewart. "A Good Year" would have been a much better film in her hands.
