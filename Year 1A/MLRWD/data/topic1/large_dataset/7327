Any movie with Jean Harlow and Marie Dressler is going to be delicious, as this certainly is. One of the greatest of all time. MGM had just completed its star-laden Grand Hotel, and while everyone was idle during early 1933, this stellar cast was assembled to make a movie from the original Broadway play. Marie Dressler, 64 at the time, plays the part of Carlotta Vance(based on Mrs. Patrick Campbell)as she barges into every scene and rubber-faces it when necessary. Most do not realize she was ill with cancer at the time, dying the next year. Louise Closser Hale is delightful as cousin Hattie. Hale died in a car accident later in 1933. The great dislike between Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery in real life shines through in the climax argument they have when his manhandling her looks very real.The wonderful Billie Burke is perfect as the scatterbrained social climber. John Barrymore basically plays himself. Originally, Clark Gable was to play the doctor, and Joan Crawford to play Paula Jordan, but they had prior obligations, so declined. This is a must-see, and is as fresh today as it was in 1933.The quickly-moving plot centres around a zany, social-climbing tycoon's wife and her preparation to have dinner at 8:00 that evening, and trying to assemble dinner guests. The sub-plots are many and are interwoven very well. Comedy and drama both surface and are handled expertly. Not to be missed, this one.
