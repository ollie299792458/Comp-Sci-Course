A friend of mine and I enjoy watching horror, and we have seen some really bad flicks. That said, I want to explain why the Breed isnt worth the dvd its printed on.

The acting is completely lackluster, and the lines they say are even more boring and uneventful. The movie never makes you care about the well-being of these characters, because they are boring beyond belief.

The storyline is overused and dull: dogs are bred on this certain island in the movie to 'make plans'. oooooh scary huh? Well it gets worse. Their is very little death and blood (thought this was a HORROR movie..) and the dogs predominately appear to be cuddly and nice instead of Evil or Mutated.

I cannot really stress enough in words how sad it is that people would give this anything more than one star (its the minimum) I'm sick and tired of these horror flicks that arent scary, and I'm really done with directors that dont know how to make an interesting movie. Hollywood spills out all these horror movies, and they dont take the time to really make a decent one that will please horror and or gore fans.

Let me just say in closing, you could take a nap and be better served than sitting thru this boring and horribly acted and written (as well as directed) FARCE!
