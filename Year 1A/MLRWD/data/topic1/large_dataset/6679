This is a truly great film. The Poseidon Adventure remains to be one of the ulimate classics in disaters films. The storyline is very simple, when an ocean cruiseship gets turned over by a giantic tital wave. Those who want to escape, must do so by getting to the bottom of the ship. Before, it gets pulled under. Gene Hackman did a great job as the preacher who leads the group through the dangerous traps of Poseidon. Ernest Borgnine wasn't too bad as the cop who butted heads with the Preacher. Shelly Winters was wonderful as the kind hearted, Mrs. Rosen. Who tries to help the group to escape. Even Red Buttons was good as Mr. Martin, the friendly and helpful man. Who keeps the peace in the group. Poseidon is a true disater film. Cause, when you watch it. You will understand why the tagline for the film is " Hell Upside down". Cause it is, but at the same time when you watch it. You will also see how six ordinary people can triumph over one of the mother nature's worst and most horrific disaters ever!!!
