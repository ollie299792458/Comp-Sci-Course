What else can be said about this classic tale of the macabre. Bela lugosi set the standard for all vampires to this very day. The movie is a masterpiece of cinema. This latest release has about the sharpest, cleanest print ever seen. There is now detail in the film that probably has not been seen since it's original theatrical run, over 75 years ago! There are some places with grain and some film wear, but considering it is 75 years old, it holds up well. The sound, however stated as "re-mastered" is distorted and has hiss that i'm sure could have been eliminated with today's modern electronics. The only print to have proper sound is the Original DVD release. Even the Legacy collection has the distorted sound, which i own also, and hoped it would have been fixed in this release. The supplimental material is great and enjoyable. The Philip Glass score has always annoyed the heck out of me and should have been erased long ago! It is the errie silence that makes this film scary. All in all, a great addition to any monster fan's libray. Dracula is the original monster, in all his glory and Bela lugosi, who was a very underrated actor, is marvelous and an icon the world over. A historical note: Bela only played Count Dracula twice, once in this film of course, and 17 years later in "Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein"! It's amazing how a single performance in a film would secure him such a place in history. Just watch his facial expressions and body movements, truly spectacular, something no CGI could ever duplicate today! So, Curl up on a stormy halloween night and go back to a time when blood and gore was left to the imagination.. That's what made it so scary...and timeless. Universal set the stage for all monsters then and now. Oh, and don't forget to pick up Frankenstein too!
