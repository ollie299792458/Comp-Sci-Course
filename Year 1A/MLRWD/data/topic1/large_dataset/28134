No, I'm not. And I'll tell you why:

When this was released, a lot of drama appeared in the tabloids regarding Brad and Angelina's then illicit affair. Many cynics (including myself) knew this was a cheap move on both actors' parts to promote a movie they felt insecure about letting stand on its own virtues.

Srangely enough, they didn't have anything to worry about, although I suspect nobody (actors, producers, marketing people, director) knew any better, except for perhaps the script-writers.

Many critics were distracted by the press storm Brangelina generated, and let that taint their opinion of this movie. And of course it drew the gossip-mongers and celebrity-worshippers among us to this movie in generous numbers.

What they found (and what you'll find, once you ignore the hype) is a well-thought out movie about couples therapy!

The clever writers of this movie managed to work into the plot an entire cycle of rebuilding the trust in a relationship back from nothing. Every requisite action sequence, sex scene, and conversation fits nicely within the context of an estranged married couple taking steps toward reconciliation.

For all the hype and unfortunatly unimaginative branding of this movie (suffering from luddite marketing, like "Mean Girls" only worse) this is a highly entertaining movie about the not-so-happy subject of repairing a relationship.

For this reason, I strongly recommend this one as a good choice for both male and female audiences, particularly married ones. At the very least, It's certainly a lighter take on mending a marriage than most other movies that stray into the subject.
