Long time addicts of Hong Kong action flicks have, for too long now, felt like addicts.  "Where's the good stuff that got me hooked?"  Many have wandered off into the good old chanbara slashers for a fix and if it wasn't for a handful of beautifully made movies out of Korea we'd have nowhere to go except our increasingly perverse seeming and overflowing dvd shelves with hardly a movie not seen 3, 4, 5 times.  So maybe someday they'll be erecting a little golden altar to Yip Wai Shun who is saving the genre with a power like that that first infused our then young bloodstreams.  If you are so old don't be surprised if ya get teary eyed seeing old Sammo and Donnie (who, it seems, don't get old) mixin' it up like you haven't seen out of China since, well, who's countin', too long.  Key here is Shun's respect for the talents and abilities of everyone in the cast.  Simon Yam, whose made every kind of movie there is, plays his role, as he often does, like he was born for it.  Jackie Wu, whose young talents have shone elsewhere, is here given a role where he can and must cut loose and he leaves no doubt but he's up to it.  (Proving again, talent and skill beats wires by several magnitudes.)  Seeing "Killzone" one can only hope Hung and Yen's careers have been reborn.  It's not that they don't disappoint, it's how they go well beyond anything you're likely to have expected.  These two artists are great and this movie provides in your face proof of it.  If you see this movie and don't like it you aren't and never will be an action fan so you can safely write off the whole genre.  I don't know, go see Charlie's Angels or somethin' cause action fans are going to like this movie lots and lots and over and over again.
