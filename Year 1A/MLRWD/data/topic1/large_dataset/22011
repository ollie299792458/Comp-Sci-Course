If you love things British, then you will like this move. The only thing not to LOVE about this movie, is the non-brit in it is the obvious, but we can shy away from that. Gywenth does a great job of trying to be English.  John Hannah is excellent in the romantic comedy genre. Jeanne Tripplehorn plays the "american" lover brilliantly.  She is catty, jealous, and truthful.  She does what most of us imagine doing to our lovers... John Lynch plays the desperation hilariously.  If you are looking for fun, and laughter along with love and heartache you've come to the right place.  The concept is brillant, there is a few parts that are a little shaky, but overall it was great.  The idea that a split second difference could have changed a person's whole life is so exquiste.  It makes you go hmm.. What would our lives be like if we only caught that train.  (Chris Cagle fans... notice that reference).  The only downside of the movie, i feel is that it trys to be american when it should be all BRITISH! but that's ok.  I would say, if you are up for a romantic comedy this is the movie for you. And trust me you won't be dissapointed.
