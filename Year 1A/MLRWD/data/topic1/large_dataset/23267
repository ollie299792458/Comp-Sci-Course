Crispin played the role of George McFly perfectly in Back to the Future, and he respectfully found the opportunity to finally do it now in Willard. As george McFly, he had one of the most ingenious roles ever, and I have always wished he was wrtten into the second and third films of Back  to the Future more legitimately. Did you see him on Conan OBrian? What a geunine innocent, the coolest guy ever. It's as though any interaction he has with the public is an exposure on his lifestyle, so simlar to the movie. So yes, I think he fits this role as Willard, perfectly. There needs to be a jump-start to a new era of respect for his acting, and as other highly respected actors in Holywood, scripts need to be written specifically for Crispin Glover, simply because of his incredible unique presence on film and in front of the media.
Willard is definitely going to attract cult classic viewers and hopefully the larger public eye. Of course saw the movie on Sunday having only the person I came with and 1 other couple in the theater, but I hope it still stands well in the box office. 
In any case, the characters are "overly" exaggerated in style and it fits. His boss is "overly" and uncontrollably bullish, his mom is "overly" gross and old, the girl is "overly" innocent, caring  and naive, the rats are just "overly" abundant, and Willard for sure is "overly" confined and whacked out of his gourd. The coolest movie out right now for sure.
