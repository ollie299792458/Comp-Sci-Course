I rode in a clinic with Buck 9 years ago in Montana...and never forgot that something special he possesses with horses and people. You intrinsicly trust him, which is why he has the success he does with his equine friends. I tried to explain to people what he brought to the table and the value behind his beliefs and techniques, but that doesn't always translate for people who ride in different disciplines..."Cowboys" have a rep that isn't always good.
When I saw this film, I thought "at least someone had the good sense to share the experience in a much more scalable way", but most importantly it was put together in a way that would even engage and intrigue the non-horse person.
It's beautifully shot and the moral to the story, a true one at that, is that we can all change our path going forward, from whatever past we have evolved from and make every life that much better when we cross paths with the right intentions.
Watch this, even if you don't think you are interested.
