So maybe this isn't exactly award-winning material. So what? "Rocky Horror" isn't meant to be some uptight, emotional, stuffy piece; in fact, it  goes out of its way to be just the opposite. It's a satirical  piece that makes plays on corny sci-fi late night flicks, drippy musicals,  and corny Frankenstein-type horror [ex. Doctor Frank N. Furter, for  example?] 
 The movie is packed with get-up-and-dance rock tunes,  overdone acting that seems just right, and a wildly ridiculous plot. Tim  Curry is simply brilliant; from his authoriative-yet-plaintive cries of  "Oh Rocky!" to his flashy and utterly corny performance of  "Sweet Transvestite." The best scene for me is right after he  transduces Janet, Brad, Doctor Scott, Rocky, and Columbia, sighing heavily,  "It's not easy having fun...even smiling makes my teeth ache.."  before biting his finger in melodramatic anguish. Other good performances  include that of Susan Sarandon, who scores high as the naive and  inexperienced yet curious Janet. 
 "Rocky Horror" isn't for  everybody. Some may write it off as "sick" while others may view  it as pointless. True, it took me a while to realize the whole point of the  movie and piece together bits of the plot for myself, but this movie is all  in good humor. So, to all you people out there who
a) refuse to see  "Rocky" after hearing 5 or 6 people complaining about its  disgusting content
b) have seen it once and, after deciding that it was  "pointless," and turned the movie off immediately... 
This I  say to you...
 "Maybe Rocky Horror isn't really to blame. So, I'll  remove the cause..... But NOT the symptom!"
