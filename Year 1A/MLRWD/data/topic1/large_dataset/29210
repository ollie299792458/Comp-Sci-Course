An energetic young woman named Faith devouts time to writing to encourage the troops overseas.  Cody Cullen receives one of her cards, which keeps him going despite the tragedy he experiences serving in the military.  When he is given the opportunity, he goes in search of the woman, Faith, whose words kept his spirit strong during the war.  He meets Faith and her family and through a series of events, stays in their home to work at the family business for a few weeks.  He quickly falls in love with the vivacious Faith, who becomes engaged to her long time boyfriend, Paul.

While the storyline was engaging and sweet, there were several suggestive and impure scenes, that may give offense.  Cody stays in the home of Faith's family, and she shows him to his bedroom.  There is a quick scene of Paul and Faith passionately kissing alone in the family home & they dance in a sensual manner in another scene.  Playing football, Faith tackles Cody and ends up on top of him with other family members piled on top of her.  Faith lies on top of Cody after falling in the woods and kisses him--highly suggestive.  Faith father makes a suggestive comment to her mother.  The jeans worn by various characters thorought the movie were very tight.

Except for the scene in the woods, Cody acts like a gentleman; while Paul is a selfish, lusty man.

Not recommended as a family friendly movie.
