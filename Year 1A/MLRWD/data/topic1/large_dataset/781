To those of us who had parents who fought in the Second World War, the Battle of Britian pilots were heroes. I remember as an eight year old boy playing with a toy Spitfire. Reading about tin legs Bader,Deere, Sailor Malan. We wanted to be Spitfire pilots.We built plastic Spitfires and hung them from our ceilings, like kids put up pictures of their pop idols today. Many of these pilots were 21 and younger, not all of course. This T v film has captured the reality of air battle and its cost on the men who fought. In the TV series,it begins just before the out break of war and portrays the phony war in France. Then the actual battle of France in the air starts.Here we see the distinctive characters, Rex, Moggy, Flash,the prof, and  the old wise,First World War pilot,intellgence officer, who is a father figure. The gathering together of the survivors to fight the Battle of Britain.The Pole who states "Is balls up"The Australian C.O, fed up with the Lectures to young pilots, by the American Chris Hart, who fought in the Spanish Civil war. Flash flying upside down when fighting,not quite sane and quoting great chunks of Churchill. He lost his wife in France when she was shot up by a Jerry 109. The ruthless Moggy killed over his airfield to the disbelieving on lookers. It captures the terrible tension that these young men were under like no other film on aerial combat. I have only given you a glimpse of a brillantly made series. To write more would give it all away. The characters are well written and acted. Some went on to bigger films.
