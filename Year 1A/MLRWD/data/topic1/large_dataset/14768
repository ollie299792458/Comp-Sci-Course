For those who've criticized the video quality...what do you expect? It's 30 years old! For those of us old enough to have seen this edition of the band, the video quality is probably better than our memories of having seen them. As far as the performance goes...it's classic Blackmore, being the center of attention, and if you watch the Bob Daisley and Colin Hart interviews, apparently Blackmore just got out of jail in Vienna immediately prior to the show (evidently he kicked the Vienna promoter in the head, although it sounded like the guy deserved it). Ronnie James Dio shows why he is one of the best rock and roll singers out there, with his outstanding vocal range and diversity...and Powell pounds the skins like the true professional he was (RIP). Add Daisley's use of a pick instead of his fingers on bass, and the competant David Stone on keyboards, and this is as classic a Rainbow lineup as you're likely to find. One small annoyance is that there are times when the camera doesn't seem to be where you might want it to be: at times when Blackmore is shredding his guitar, the camera is on Dio or Powell or, worse, showing an angle from behind the band. This DVD has pretty much the same song selections as their albums On Stage and Live in Germany '76...but then again, these three concert selections were made within about a year of each other, so that's to be expected. It would have been nice to see Stargazer, or Tarot Woman...at least the "bonus disk" included selections from the Long Live Rock and Roll album, including Gates of Babylon.

All things considered, this is a MUST HAVE for classic rock fans, and those of Blackmore in particular. He is at his self-centered best, and his supporting cast is great. Sit back and prepare to enjoy one of the best rock bands of the '70s...
