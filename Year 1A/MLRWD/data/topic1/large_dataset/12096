Ok... first of all, the muh-roon that rated this dvd series with only "1 star" must be high on crack... I recently bought the "Range Murata Complete Set" and I gotta say, this is a BEAUTIFUL anime series. The artwork on each dvd case are equally beautiful.

Although I wouldn't go as far as call it a "perfect" anime, it's definitely a beautifully done show. It maintained its quality and consistency throughout the series. I'm a character animator, so I'm especially sensitive to spotting inconsistencies in an animated show. There are times when you can detect the cg elements, but overall everything feels right.

There are some especially neat touches that make it a great anime... One being that their written language uses Greek alphabets and Roman numerals. The others are small details that really sell the characters such as having to boil their drinking water, cranking the engines to start their vehicles, keeping an eye on fuel levels while operating their vehicles, having limited resources during missions, etc.

Obviously, anime isn't for everyone just like many movies/shows; Some people like "Heroes" while others prefer soap operas... If you hate a thing, IT JUST AIN'T FOR YOU.

I personally recommend this to animation fans. If you never watched anime before or aren't particularly into them, don't bother.
