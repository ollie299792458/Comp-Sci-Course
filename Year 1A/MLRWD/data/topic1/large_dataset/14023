First of all I would like to say BRAVO to TBS for showing 24hrs of a Christmas Story!!!  I love this movie it's a great holiday classic that I look forward to watching every Christmas and if I simply can't wait that long (which is every year) I just pop in the movie and watch it any time I want.

My children each have a copy on VHS and this year we bought it on DVD. They love it as much as I do. And why not? Its a great movie, I know it's not It's a Wonderful Life, or Miracle on 34th ST, but it's a great Christmas movie just the same.

I remember watching it as a kid and laughing so hard I nearly fell off my chair. It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together.

I love the funny little scenes like the "Triple Dog Dare" and when the icecicle knocks Ralphie's glasses off and he thinks he really did shoot his eye out like everone told him he would do. And how about that awful lamp of his dads??

The whole movie every one tells Ralphie "You'll shoot your eye out kid!" yet he still has his heart set on getting one that he does everything he can to get one. Like some kids, he just had to learn the hard way and gave us a good laugh in the process.

I would recomend this movie to anyone that likes a good humerous, yet sweet Christmas movie.
