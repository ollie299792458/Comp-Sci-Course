First of all, to Mr. Less than Mediocre Beasley, I agree.  You should go out, grab yourself an agent and make your own movie.  It's easy, and I'd like to see what you come up with.

I applaud the Director for taking a chance on a genre that, in this day and age, is tough to please its audience.  A lot of directors settle on remakes of the classics or subpar sequels.  However, Mr. Osunsanmi takes the audience into a new world, one that none of us knows much about... the underground caving world.

I enjoyed following the cavers as they struggled to survive miles beneath the earth's surface.  The dim lighting helps us share the cavers perspective.  How scary would a film be if we could see what is around the next corner?

I especially enjoyed the character Ambrose.  He brings comic relief and yet, shows a wide range of emotion.  The performances by the other actors are also good.

The film editing and use of the "hypershake" can be a bit jarring at times, but overall the film moved at a good pace and did its job:  It successfully scared the [...] out of me.  I'd recommend checking it out.
