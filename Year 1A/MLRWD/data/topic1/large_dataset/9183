I think this is a great, great movie. It has an amazing soundtrack, a great cast, and it really just makes me want to grab my records, set sail, and broadcast GOOD music.

Radio today sucks for the most part. Thank goodness I live in a college town and I'm able to pull in the campus station. Clear Channel and the like have completely killed the spirit that drove these DJs to live on a ship and broadcast rock and roll to those who deserve it.

When was the last time you sat with a group of your friends and just listened to the radio? I remember doing it. It doesn't happen anymore. Many will blame iPods, CDs, etc.  I blame crappy radio. Who wants to gather around a radio in the break room or your bedroom to listen to a Nickleback song you can hear every hour and it sucks anyway?

A great movie. The Bluray is a real nice transfer. The music comes through loud and clear, the dialog is easily heard. The picture is clean. I'm glad they didn't add the deleted scenes into the film as a "director's cut". They're fun to watch, but I like the pacing the way it is. Easily worth $10 for Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance alone.
