The revelation, in this movie for me, aside for the fact that it did not receive wider recognition, is Colin Farrell. His inhabiting of the gangster is so natural and frightening, while at the same time he shows you brief glimpses of the man's hidden humanity, his desire and need for closeness to other people. The others are all fine as well but he particularly stands out.

I like this movie precisely because it is utterly unsentimental. These people are out to survive and death does not stop their drive. Death is heartbreaking because these characters have already survived so much that the injustice of their falling short so close to their goals hits hard. It also points out a truth; that life is not fair and guarantees nothing. Two moments hit hard; when Ed Harris' character releases the young girl so that she can die and when the group spends the cartoonists last night reviewing his sketches, letting him know how much they appreciate his art. Simple, not overdone and beautiful.

Movies that can communicate powerful emotion without overdoing it are rare (think Tender Mercies with Robert Duvall). This movie is very fine and worthy of repeated viewing. In my top twenty and in my opinion a must see.
