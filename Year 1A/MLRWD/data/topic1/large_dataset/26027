frightfully original with a somber message, you will either love this movie or completely miss the point...  this is a meaningful thought-provoking piece, finally a vampire movie with a focus not on the decadence of vampires, but the deterioration of its entire parasitic culture as a whole; the story hides under the cloak of a genre film to expose the problems our modern society is currently facing in disturbing and portentous ways; we as human consumers are draining our planet and its resources dry, just like the vampires in this story; and what happens to them will surely happen to us as we continue on our current path of destruction (in fact, it has already started).  the characters all seem so real it's chilling to watch as the fate of their (or is it our?) world unfold.  goes to prove that not all horror movies need to rely on gore and guts to influence the audience, and that even a genre film can be made relevant and realistic in refreshingly creative ways. this may just be the best vampire movie i have ever seen, better than all the "cult" and art-house vampire flicks combined, not especially because of its characters, actions, or special effects, but for its central conservationist message, a resounding wake-up call that is loud and clear, for anyone who cares to tune in.  how unfortunate it is that the masses can never choose a gem like this over all the rubbish, it's just a shame that Daybreakers came out just when True Blood and Twilight did, the timing could not have been worse... so if you're reading this, spread the word and get the name of this movie out there, because it deserves more recognition.
