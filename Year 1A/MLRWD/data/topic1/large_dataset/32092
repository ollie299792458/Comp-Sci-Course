Rene Russo as Catherine Banning is great, her facial and body expressions are quite versatile as she proceeds to find and entrap the art thief, taking risks with her own heart and soul.  Communication between Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown and Russo is near-telepathic.

Unfortunately the bad guy gets a pass, leaving me wanting.  Enjoy the scenes at an island villa and in the NYC mansion.  If you are older, the characters look and act your age, which is often rare for a romance.

Catherine's superego is played by Denis Leary as police detective Michael--the most real person in the film--but he too gives the art thief a pass.  If you love great art, you may cry when a "maybe-forged" Renoir is destroyed.  Faye Dunaway plays 35 y.o. Crown's shrink -- Catherine from the original film -- somehow looking younger than Russo.  Anna, played by a Spanish supermodel, is such great eye-candy that the SO stated he could not see why Crown would pass her up for Catherine.  Guys can be such bores.
