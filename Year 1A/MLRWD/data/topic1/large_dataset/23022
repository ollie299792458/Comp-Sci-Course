As a Christian Slater fan, I watched this. I am glad it was on TV and I did not have to pay. By the end, I was sad for Slater and the turn his career has taken that he has to accept roles like this. The premise was interesting, but the actresses are not very solid. I agree too, that the jerky camera work was to hide the fact that they were not really doing the moves in the fight scenes--like the audience would not notice. Wes is annoying, but I thought he was supposed to be sort of a nerd. The opening scene with his bizarre marriage proposal was laughable. It starts off decent, but gets worse as it progresses. I am not going to tell people whether or not they should watch this as I can't speak for what they may or may not like. But at the end of the day, it is not a very good film. Sometimes I wonder if the actors realize how bad a film is or how they feel when they see a bad film in which they appear. Slater and Gooding, Jr. are not stupid and I am sure they realized how bad this was once they saw it. Better luck with their upcoming projects, including Sacrifice, in which they appear together again.
