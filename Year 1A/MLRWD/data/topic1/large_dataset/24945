Well let's see a woman marries a man and then realizes that he's a wife beater.  Hmm... sounds familiar? Kinda sounds like a "REMIX" of "Sleeping with the Enemy."  
J.Lo's very famous for remixing her songs now she's also popularly known for remixing her movies.  This is a movie that screams "Been there done that!"  A simple movie that questions the intelligence of the viewer by having huge captions to let you in on the story line.
I didn't know whether or not to laugh at the bad acting or the exagerrated scenes.  Jennifer's acting abilities make this already bland and unimaginative movie fall short from praise.
It's a movie that many reviewers will say that it "Empowers Women," but really imagine yourself as a woman if you will taking Krav Maga and beating up your husband eventually killing him without any legalities involved?  
It's clearly a movie for those people that lack imagination and originality.  Or it's a movie for those that just want to see if they can get a glance at the "Million Dollar [Bod]."  
One viewing was "ENOUGH" and I don't plan on watching it again.  I only have one word to say "RENTAL!" Save your money and rent it, then judge from there. Another recommendation is to watch "Sleeping with the Enemy" now there's a classic movie that I will watch over and over again.
