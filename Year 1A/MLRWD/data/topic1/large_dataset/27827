If you are a fan of Diana Krall you would get this DVD to see her perform.  If you don't know Diana Krall this would be an excellent introduction to her music-making.  But let me elaborate on the production.
The video seems to have been shot in DV.  It is soft, with an overall dark hue and very good colors.  The video compression must be rather high (it is a single layer disc), but there is no motion scenes, so this is no problem.
The real high of the DVD is the excellent DTS sound.  You feel as if you are somewhere in rows 5-10 in Olympia, which by the way is were the central camera pointing at the stage is.  Krall's voice is dead center, the piano extends perfectly from her to the right speaker, and the imaging of the rest of the band is spot on.  The strings are on the far left.  The audience is spread nicely around you.  Occasionally a high note spills over to the rear channels, but otherwise it is just the reverbation and the audience that apperas on the rear -exactly as it should be.  All instruments are recorded with life-like accuracy.  This is an excellent demonstration DVD for high quality systems.
The Dolby Digital version is not as good, but it comes pretty close.  The apparent difference is that the subwoofer channel is too strong, causing a smearing of the midrange and thickening the voice.  
The Stereo version is very poor in comparison, as if phase problems were introduced in the downmix.  Switching to Dolby Prologic, all the instruments are gathered around the center speaker with minimal soundstage and reduced bass. ...
