What can I say about Waking The Dead? 1000 words doesn't quite cover the depth and scope of the emotions this film has stirred in me.  I got it this week and having watched it, I can honestly say it will stay with me for the rest of my life. I have been walking around in a kind of melacholy ever since the end credits rolled. I feel we would be lucky men and women, to experience the kind of true, all consumming love, that Jennifer Connelly nd Billy Crudup portray in Waking The Dead.  Both these young stars give Oscar worthy performances (of both love and personal commitment and conflict) within a tightly crafted and beautifully executed piece of cinema from writer director Keith Gordon. The design, music and cinematography in this story are haunting, adding to the depth of feeling it must surely bring out of the viewer. Indeed, I defy anyone with a soul, who's ever been in love, NOT to cry at this movie.  I have been in love with Jennifer Connelly since I was 13 years old (and I first saw her in Labyrinth and Some Girls), but this is by far and away her finest performance. Billy Crudup portrays heartbroken despair, and a near spiral into nervous breakdown, the likes of which I have never seen on celluloid.  My heartfelt recommendation is that any Amazon customer reading this, with a taste for fine human drama, buys a copy of this DVD now!  My only regret is that I can't give it anymore than 5 stars for quality and depth.  Sheer excellence from start to finish. I will treasure this title. You will too. Enjoy!!
