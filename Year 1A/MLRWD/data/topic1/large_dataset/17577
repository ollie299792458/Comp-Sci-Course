This review may contain some spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the movie.

This movie had some great action, don't get me wrong. Some, if not all, of the fighting was very well choreographed. But there were a few scenes that could have been better (the 'practice' sword fight... what was the anime-style 10 foot leap about?), or better yet cut altogether (the bomb scene, anyone?).

Next, lets discuss the musical score. It starts from the beginning (listen/look for the Director's ego, which is about the size of... say... the Pacific Ocean.) Even really boring scenes get REALLY dramatic music, which is, I assume, supposed to make them seem less boring but really just points out the nothing that is happening.

Finally, there is the dialogue, which caused me deep shame when listening to it. Do people actually talk like that? Why would two Russians, when they are alone, speak in stilted English lifted from the pages of Stereotype Weekly (okay, so I made that one up).

To the other reviews that say "Better than the first" I have this to say: While this movie has some better ladder-fu, most of the fights are just poor copies of the fights in the first (Let's all attack him with axes again, shall we? Nah, I'll grab this Fireman's Katana...). And the other important fact is that the first movie was set in the REAL world, where people can't jump straight up into the air 10 feet, and you can't dodge bullets from less than 3 yards, and you can't shoot at a helicoptor TWICE and expect it to explode.

All in all, there is a good action-y bacground behind all the bad acting, and for fans of the first it's a must see, at least for closure. But would I see it again? Definitately not.

Oh yeah, was anyone else sad when Frank DIDN'T tell the Jamacian guy to "take out the trash?"
