The First time i saw this movie was right after i saw Goldeneye a few years back. I thought it wasn't all that great. But then when i started getting into the older movies more than the new, i loved this. First of all, the acting could be a little better, but the settings and story made up for it. It has infact, a really good story, about Bond traveling to Las Vegas only to find out about a diamond scheme involving his old S.P.E.C.T.R.E friend, Blofeld, who he thought he killed in the beginning. I liked the other Blofeld in You Only Live Twice better, but this one was better than the one from On Her majestys secret service. There isnt much killing, but their is some good action, most are fist fights, or car chases. Like the chase scene through Las Vegas, which i actually thought, was pretty good, considering there wasnt any gun shots at all during the chase, but the end of it (the car enters with it tipped left, but leaves tipped right). The oil rig/helicopter battle, the fight with Peter Franks, fight with Blowfeld, chase through the desert. But it has lots of spying, bond goes undercover many times including as a link in the diamond smuggling pipeline, in the compounds of a space program, and going into his penthouse, and stuff. Overall its more of a spy movie than an action movie, but it has good action. If U like from russia with love, or goldfinger, you'll like this.
