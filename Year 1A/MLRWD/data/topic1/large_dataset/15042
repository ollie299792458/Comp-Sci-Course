Seeing as I had at first judged this film to be a chick-flick, I would have never watched it had not one of my chick friends rented it one night.  The film is a brilliantly executed "what-if" scenario, played out  by the chief agent, Helen (Gwenyth Paltrow) and centers around one  particular instant that spurs off two distinct paths her life could take.  The rest of the film jumps between the two separate life-paths.  The plots  are intertwined not only by sharp coincidences in events, but also through  brilliant cinematography.  The film cleverly entices the audience to feel  pity for Helen's feebleness in one plot; then instantly transforms it to  envy and admiration for her strength in the other.  There are small twists  throughout, and there isn't a single loose end in the entire film.  In the  end, it is both neatly tied up and yet opened to brand new possibities, in  an ending that will leave you with a flow of emotions ranging from hope to  happiness, and even a hint of sadness.  The picture's duality is never  overbearing, and is completed both on it's film, and in the audience.  It's  definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.
