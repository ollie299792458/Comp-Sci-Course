Scary Movie 2 at First Glance, Seems To Have Little (If Any) Plot. The Same Jokes Are Told & It's Twice As Raunchy. The Second Viewing (Which Was On DVD) Changed My Opinion Completely. When I Went To The Theaters And Seen It I Didnt Enjoy It As Much. Reason Being? I Hate Going To The Movies, Unless There's Something Out Im Dying To See. (E.G American Pie 2/Rush Hour 2/The Mummy Returns). The First Viewing Dont Really Make Much Sense, But The Second Viewing You Really Get It All. I'm, For One, Am Not That Interested In The Haunting (Catherine Zeta-Jones), House on Haunted Hill (Taye Diggs), or Dude, Where's My Car? (Sean W. Scott). But The Spoofs Were Hilarious. Especially The Hollow Man (Kevin Bacon) Spoofs. I Really Enjoyed Watching The Scenes With The Hell House Caretaker Hanson (Chris Elliott) as Well as The Scenes With The Handicapped Dwight. The Opening Sequence Was Absolutely Hilarious. But If You Only Watched It Once, Take Another Look On DVD, You Won't Be Disappointed.
