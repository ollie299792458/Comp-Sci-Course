"This movie is strange!"  That's what my wife, unused to science fiction, said several times as we watched this movie.  Sort of a 'journey to the center of the earth' story, actually taking place somewhere in the polar ice north of Russia/Siberia.  You will recognize some sets, such as the giant gate, from the original "King Kong".  The pace never slackens once Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce set off to find the flame of eternal life, somewhere in the hidden land below the ice.  Randolph Scott does an acceptable job as the leading man, playing much the same character as in his earlier westerns.  Nigel Bruce must be playing himself as his character is so similar to his portrayal of Doctor Watson in the Sherlock Holmes flicks.  Helen Gahagan is good as the cold-hearted ruler of the hidden land, and guardian of the flame of eternal life.  Helen Mack is real eye candy once she dons the gowns she is given upon reaching the hidden land.  I watched the colorized version and must say it is a splendid job of colorizing.  Much better than some of the earlier colorized movies from the 1990s.  The thrilling climax is a real delight.  Bizarre and colorful.  I won't tell how it turns out.  Let that be something to look forward to.  I have not yet watched the black and white version, or the extras.  Definitely worth the sale price of this DVD.  Although, the disc was rattling around loose inside its case when it arrived.  The disc had many minor scratches that did not seem to affect the colorized version that I watched.  Recommended.
