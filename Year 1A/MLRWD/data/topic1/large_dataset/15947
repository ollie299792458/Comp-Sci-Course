I had read some reviews before  purchasing the set. What we viewed was a wonderfully and tastefully presented story of a young and vibrant woman married to a wealthy, but due to war injury, impotent man whom she loved and attentively cared for. With some encouragement from her husband who senses her loneliness, she becomes involved with the husband's forest warden.
The relationship with the forest warden changes from pure physical needs and  gradually evolves into a more emotional and caring one, however, all along, she never neglects her husband. Some of the encounters and love scenes with the warden are explicit, but presented in a natural way, as opposed to the way physical sex is being portrayed in todays movies and TV programs. The photography is such that it is believable, but not xxx-rated. All through the movie, it is the characters and their relations that are important - not the few sex scenes.
The set includes a very helpful and important narrative by the director and commentaries about the sexual aspects of the movie, the issues faced by the actors and their acceptance on basis of the tasteful way in which these scenes were filmed.
Anyone looking for a lot of ups and downs, raw or unusual sex will be disappointed. Its an excellent movie, but not that kind of a movie.
