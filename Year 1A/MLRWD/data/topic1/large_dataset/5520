The first time I saw The Agony and the Ecstasy was more than 20 years ago.  Apparently it really made an impression on me because I remember Michelangelo's method of transferring images to the ceiling so clearly, that I used the same method myself for painting a large mural in a school cafeteria.  I have seen it another time since then.  Unfortunately for Michelangelo, played by Charlton Heston, there seems to be far more agony than ecstasy.  Pope Julius II, played by Rex Harrison, doesn't hesitate to exert pressure on the passionate yet complex artist who really wants to sculpt instead of paint.  But the Pope knows what he wants and how to get it and Michelangelo gives in.  Despite their contentious relationship, I felt satisfaction in knowing that it was the Pope's nagging that provided the necessary impetus for Michelangelo to create one of his greatest masterpieces.  I found the technical details of how the Michelangelo's vision was executed to be fascinating and I learned a lot about Michelangelo's life, his work and history all at once. The fact that The Agony and the Ecstasy was released 40 years ago doesn't matter a bit - there is no over-dramatizing or inappropriately stilted language, just all the grandeur that make it a classic.  If I see a movie more than once, it has to be good.
