I honestly don't know what would possess anyone to claim that this isn't a great movie! The plotline is somewhat cliched (good vs. evil, fight-against-time sort of thing) but still different (throw in a scheming son-mother/couple and the selling of brake pads). The connection between Richard (Spade) and Tommy (Farley) is top notch. Every joke, routine, monologue, etc. is simply hilarious! I dare you to stay straight-faced!! When I first heard of this movie through previews, I figured it to be a stupid, toilet-humor "comedy" with bad acting. YOU CANT BE MORE WRONG! What else is there to say about this movie? The acting is seamless, the plot and adventures are hilariously done, and the humor is unbeatable. Farley even exposes a bit of emotion (albeit tied with a little humor), such as when he's on the sailboat and he's "talking" with his father. Not to mention the supporting cast (Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe, Bo Derek, Julie Warner)!

Here are my favorite parts:

1. When Tommy is trying to sell "Ted" his brake pads instead of another companies...his mannerisms are so unorthodox!! "Next thing you know, there's money missing off the dresser and your daughter's knocked up, I seen it a hundred times."

2. The part where Richard's god-awful toupee gets blown back by a fan. every time it kills me!

3. When Tommy has on Richard's jacket and is singing "Fat guy in a little coat!"

4. Richard: "Mommy, mommy, the rhino's getting too close to the car!"

5. The entire scene of when the "dead" deer completely dismantles Richard's car.

6. Tommy: "You know where the weight room is? I'll check it out"

7. When Tommy and Richard are listening to the Karen Carpenter song and getting emotional.

go rent this movie and you won't be disappointed!
