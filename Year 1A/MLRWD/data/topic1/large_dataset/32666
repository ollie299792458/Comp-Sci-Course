I will not talk about the film, everybody knows it.
The review is about the "what's in the box"....

Days ago I got an email from Amazon saying they were sorry but could not deliver the DVD on the promised date, bla bla. 2 days later, I got another email saying they shipped it.

Yeah, I've got it and it has the same image quality as the previous release (1 disc). It is missing the foil with the chapter guide (you can use the one from the other edition).
Although the movie is 10 years old and was filmed on normal equipment, it does show some age on the image quality. Paramount should have cleaned it before the new release.

The menu is new, animated with the Enterprise B on the first disk. It has some extras on the second disk, like deleted scenes, alternative ending (Kirk's death) which I found interesting to watch. It has some features also on the special effects, like the crash sequence and filming the Enterprise - most of it was not CGI.

Besides the missing trailers - it is mentioned on the cover, but not available on either disks, one good suprise was to find that this version has also Dolby DTS track.

Overall, it is worthwhile, for the extras and DTS. And it costed much less than the first version.

Nevertheless, Paramount deserves a negative feedback for taking advantage of us for using such strategy: release barebones first and special editions later: this is pissing a lot of customers, specially the ones that bought the Original Series for much higher cost in many volumes. Paramount must learn with the other studios on how to master and pack DVDs - Warner, FOX and MGM are normally much better.
