For an early eightys movie, I thought "Quest for Fire" was a great movie which depicted the ways of early mankind and explained just how important stuff that we take for granted today was once so heavily relied upon. I thought the asian circus elephants covered in musk ox hair was an excellent depiction of the wooly mammoths of pleistocene europe. The two lions wearing saber teeth was also a great example of how historical movies like that can be made succesful without top dollar computerized animal characters much like "Jumanji" or the newest movie "Ice Age."  
Many people complain of how historically inaccurate the story is. However, that simply isnt true, and anybody who reads the book first would see why. The story starts of in 78,000 B.c. in ice age Europe. Many people complain that cro magnan didnt show up until about 10,000 B.C. Several other reviewers said that the characters were much too primative in their language and overall behavior. However, the story book tells that the 3 main characters were Neanderthals...so the movie isnt all that inaccurate and lousy to a historian point of view.
I thought Quest for Fire was an excellent movie in both plot and cast and it deffinently has my 2 thumbs up.
