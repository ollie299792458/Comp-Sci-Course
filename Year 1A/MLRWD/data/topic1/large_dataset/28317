Sweet, gentle, sad, with amazing performances by Sean Penn and Samantha
Morton.

Interestingly, this got mixed reviews on release for being 'small' in
scope, but to me that's its great strength. As screwed up as the Sean
Penn character is, we still get pulled into him, and it makes for a
lovely portrait of a sad, lost, brilliant jazz guitarist whose ego may
be even bigger than his great talent. Penn and Allen conspire to
create one of the most simultaneously infuriating and oddly
ingratiating characters of recent memory

No big conclusions or statements, just a subtle, brilliantly acted
comic and tragic study of humanity. That's enough make this the
strongest Woody Allen film for a number of years.

Two comments on the DVD.  For some psychotic reason, after a brief run
where the DVD was made with both a 1:85 wide screen version and
a 4:3 full screen on the same disc, the DVD was re-released with
the doctored 4:3 version only.  However, you can usually find a
copy of the widescreen available used on Amazon or elsewhere.
It's worth it. This is a beautifully composed film visually, and seeing
it with a large part of the image gone is a real loss.  (Alternately,
if you have a region free DVD player, the region 2 version is widescreen
as well).

Also, this marks yet another Woody Allen film currently out-of-print,
meaning that much of his great work (including even 'Annie Hall') is
no longer being made. I keep waiting for the re-release/upgrade, but
have heard or seen nothing for months.  So in case these films are being pulled
for some obscure legal or other reason, you might want to grab copies
while you can.
