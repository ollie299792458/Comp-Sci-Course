This review is specifically about the technical aspects of the DVD, not the movie itself.

This DVD (ASIN 6305428220, UPC 7-17951-0022-8-0) is the 1999 Dimension release of The Faculty, and it differs quite a bit from the 2011 Echo Bridge Home Entertainment release of the movie (ASIN B004P7CN7W, UPC 0-96009-75089-3).

Video:
Dimension = Letterboxed widescreen in 4:3 format, so your widescreen TV will show a small picture with big black bars on all four sides.
Echo Bridge = Anamorphic 16:9 widescreen, so it will take up the entire screen of your widescreen TV.
Both releases are Region 1 NTSC (even though the Echo Bridge release does not specify this on the back sleeve).

Audio:
Dimension = The movie is Dolby Digital 5.1 (384Kbps).  The menu does not have sound.
Echo Bridge = The movie is Dolby Digital 2.0 (192Kbps).  The menu has music in Dolby Digital 5.1 (448Kbps).
Both releases have one audio track only (English).

Subtitles and closed captioning:
Dimension = English subtitles available and closed captioning available.
Echo Bridge = No subtitles.  No closed captioning.

Bonus features:
Dimension = "Bonus features" are the theatrical trailer and film recommendations.
Echo Bridge = No bonus features.

Other thoughts:
The chapter stops are in different places.

No, I did not make a mistake listing the audio details for the Echo Bridge release; it really does have Dolby Digital 5.1 in the menu, but only Dolby Digital 2.0 in the movie.

The only bad part about this Dimension release (and the only reason to consider the Echo Bridge release) is that the video is letterboxed, so a widescreen TV will show the picture with black bars on all four sides.

If you care about the audio and/or you want subtitles, then get this Dimension release.  If you want to use the full screen of your widescreen TV, and you don't care about the audio or lack of subtitles, then you'll probably be happier with the Echo Bridge release.
