If I were not transsexual, I would probably have loved this movie. It's a wonderful story, well-told and well-acted. Unfortunately, the makers don't understand the subject.

Their conception of transsexuality is rooted in the false idea of "a man who wants to be a woman." What is hard to communicate is that a transsexual woman has never been a man. We are born with female brains. All of our lives, our consciousness and emotions are those of a woman. We don't know what it is to be men, because we have never experienced the world as men.

We do know what it is like to pretend to be men, to try to fit in as men, to be treated as though we were men. But we never were.

Everything about the character of Bree screams out "man in a dress." Her clothing is a false stereotype of how we dress. Lots of pink, lots of over-the-top touches like the pink hat. I don't know a single transsexual woman who dresses like that. We dress like any other woman. We like blue jeans and comfortable clothes like any other woman.

Her mannerisms are the same. When she camps out with her son, she plays it like a stereotyped woman in a bad 1950's comedy. Again, I don't know a single TS woman who acts like that. I certainly don't act like that.

So if you want a film that shows what it's really like to be transsexual, this isn't the one. But if you want pure escapist entertainment, a fascinating tale of a growing relationship between parent and child, this film is an excellent choice.
