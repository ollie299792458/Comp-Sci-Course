I don't understand first of all why people try to compare this movie to The Shawshank Redemption.  Just because they have the same writers, etc.  and somewhat the same theme does not in my opinion make for obivous  comparison.  They are totally different films with different totally  different objectives.  Furthermore, who defines what is long for a movie?  Sure, we are used to our approx. 90 minute films or even 120 minute films,  but this film never once, was boring or uneventful.  I don't think it could  have been any shorter than it was.  I bought it last week and have watched  it twice, something I rarely do with a 3 hour movie. The performances were  incredible.  Tom Hanks shines in everything I've ever seen him in and this  film was no exception.  I too was tired of seeing stereotyped prison guards  and prison inmates and this movie really crept into the very soul of the  viewer.  I thought the supporting cast was wonderful.  I thought the story  was wonderful and a big magical which carried the audience every single  minute.  I don't think it was all that predictable and until I read  someone's review below didn't think it "obviously" borrowed any  story line from the bible; although I guess when you sit and pick it apart,  you see the comparisons.  I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I felt scared  and comforted all within the 3 hours that I sat glued to the screen.  Not  many movies provoke so many emotions in one setting.  I think this is  perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and I feel Tom Hanks gets  better and better with age.  Again, the supporting cast was wonderful and  well-casted.  I find it hard to believe that there were viewers who were  not entertained by this film.  It is well worth the purchase price and a  movie that I intend to watch over and over. In my opinion it rates right up  there with The Shawshank Redemption which is another of my favorite movies  but I don't intend to get the two confused with each other.
