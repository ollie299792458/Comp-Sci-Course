I first saw this on TV when I was 15 in 1979. I liked it then and I like it now on DVD. I will agree with some other reviewers who complained about the lack of special features, but that's really not a big deal. WARNING: This IS an R-rated film with gun violence & gross profanity.

Robert Shaw is Bernard Ryder, A/K/A Mr. Blue, a former soldier of fortune who is the leader of a gang of four heavily armed men (one of whom is an ex-motorman) that hijack a subway train, sever the head car, and hold 17 passengers and the conducter hostage. Their demands: $1 million must be in their hands in one hour or they will kill one hostage for each minute the money is overdue. Walter Mathau is Transit Authority Police Lt. Zach Garber who happens to be in the TA's Command Center when Mr. Blue calls the demands in over the subway's radio system. Garber must continuously think fast to keep the hijackers from following through with their threats while relaying their complex demands to the police and City Hall. While doing all that, he must also figure out how--being underground and with Command Center tracking the car's movement on a status board--they intend to escape undetected.
