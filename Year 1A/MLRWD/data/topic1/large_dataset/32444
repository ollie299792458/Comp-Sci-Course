Will Smith was FABULOUS and was robbed for the oscar and so was Mr. Ali once again. I own over 1,000 movies, have rented thousands more and grew up in the era of Mr. Ali. I have watched countless docu-dramas of many people and this was by far the best! I have watched all his fights over and over. I will never cease to be amazed by him. This film and Will Smith came as close to reality as possible in the time frame allotted. There were so many realistic gestures by Will along with the VOICE, it was spooky!I am not familiar enough with the Muslim faith and the facts of Mr. Ali's private life to criticize the over all portrayal of him in the movie, but I will always admire the stand he took against the draft and his reasons for it. I am a disabled, caucasian Viet Nam vet. I also admire what he means to African-Americans, Africans and many millions like me world wide. Yes, people will nit pick about minor flaws in the movie, but how do you ever do justice to a man who is still a living legend?????
