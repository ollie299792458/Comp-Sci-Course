I like Stephen Chow's work.  Especially Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  (I have Kung Fu Hustle on DVD, Blu-Ray and UMD.)

I pre-ordered this DVD without seeing it first.  I wish I had seen the movie in the theater first.  It is not what I expected.  Yes, it is probably intended to be a "family film."  That's perfectly fine.  However, I cannot imagine sitting down and watching this with any young kids.  Unless of course it's pouring raining outside and they just watched "Bambi" and "Old Yeller" back to back.  That will prepare them for what is to come in this movie.

There is some cute stuff in the movie.  But there is also some content that might be difficult or emotional for some kids.

The brief homages to Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and Mission: Impossible II were nice.

I never would have bought this DVD if I had seen the movie first.  I will definitely have to watch Stephen Chow's next movie before buying the DVD.

You can buy this DVD, but keep tissues nearby while watching.
