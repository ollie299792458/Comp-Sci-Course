My husband has introduced me to many great movies I would not have seen but for his Favorites list, and this is one of them.  The story and the actors, etc., have been adequately covered in other reviews, but only a couple have mentioned that this movie is not available as a Region One DVD, so you need to watch for it on cable and capture it for more than one viewing.  It's worth it.  I look forward to being able to purchase my own copy, preferably with lots of special features, for this is one of those westerns made between the old, classic and the modern, realistic eras -- and it's one of the best, despite the not-so-bad-as-you-might-think mechanical buffalo -- and they need better documentation.
Also, if you like this movie, you might like Dead Man, another western, dark and dreamy, exploring the place between wholeness and whatever comes next.
A final note:  this is the way I want to see real Native Americans portrayed -- with authenticity and dignity.  A fine performance.
