A dismall profession, that of critics. Anyone who has been exposed to massive doses of awfull musical-movie production of the 50s and 60s (usually through 70's afternoons TV features) is absolutely honest in labeling them crap from Hollywood's sadest period.
Then, as decades pass, you keep remembering scores like 'Where Did My Childhood Go', by Peter O'Toole, in this Goodbye Mr. Chips, while the whole score of Singing In The Rain goes down the drain (as you always wished it to go, despite all the hype around the crap). 
I vaguely remember 'Mr. Chips, but I am pretty sure it is very cheesy. But the songs are becoming better with the years, and ABSOLUTELY non-existent in CDs. So I am buying the movie on DVD, just to hear the score.
Wouldn't it be astonishing if the movie also became better with time? 
The score has definitely to be reapraised by the critics. It is very honorable of Amazon.com to criticize so heavily an item it intends to sell (I have used this candid advice many many times). But I really recomend the critics to hear to O'Tooles performance with 2000's ears (rather than with 70's TV watcher's).
