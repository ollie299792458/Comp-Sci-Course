One has to wonder how a film so bad can be made with so many fine things about it.  I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend.  She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably.  He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie.  He has sex with the Charleezz character often.  That he knows how to do.  And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting.  The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused.  No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early.  Is this the  fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan?  The cinamentography is lovely.  The costumes are fine.  The story is ok as well.  Its just shown in  a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction. Come to think of it, I havent seen much by her lately.
