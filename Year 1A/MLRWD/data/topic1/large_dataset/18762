Ninotchka is a funny, well-written film with a good dash of romance showcasing Greta Garbo's beautiful, expressive eyes.
Her unlikely relationship with Melvyn Douglas is a hit; one that you hope will succeed.  
The only flaw in the film is its characterization of Soviet Russians as buffoons (contrast the simpleton emissaries with the multi-faceted duchess) and its constant smug references to the superiority of the U.S. political system. Initially these references are just another facet of the good comedy: "I've been fascinated by your five year plan for the past 15 years" but after awhile they wear thin: [the man walking through another's apartment to get to his own or the line about the bird leaving a crumb of black bread]. 
Nevertheless, the action and the script, taken as a whole, is very smart and very funny. It includes some great romantic lines such as when a wooing Douglas (referring Garbo to a clock) says, "Look, one hand has met the other hand...they've kissed."  
Garbo is the star. I didn't have any pre-conceived expectations of what she wouldn't do but the laugh scene in the cafe is certainly one of the highlights and key moments of the film--one that will likely have you laughing too.
