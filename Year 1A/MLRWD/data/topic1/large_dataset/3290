The original Theatrical Aspect Ratio for First Blood was anamorphic widescreen - 2.35:1 (cinemascope). On its 35mm cinema film neg & stock, it is compressed horizontally in a 2:1 ratio. This interprets that on the film, it will roughly be 1.17:1 and on screen, it will magnify and stretch to its intended 2.35:1 format. 
What deterred me from buying this particular DVD is that on its "Technical Information" page, it has listed this DVD's aspect ratio for Widescreen as - 1.85:1 (which is generally non-anamorphic and flat) suggesting that it has been incorrectly set to - "Letterbox" (used to cover production mechanics such as lens' barn doors, sound booms, etc.). If this is the case, certain part of its image that was originally viewed in the cinemas would now be blocked out. That's almost as bad as the 1.33:1 pan & scan. Maybe it's an info error? 
I like to watch movies in the format it was intended to be seen by the filmmakers. Also, I can never understand why anyone would want to own an inferior full-screen/pan & scan format. It's like watching half a movie. 
On this DVD release, it seems the studios have provided both widescreen & full-screen. I assume this equates to having both sides of the disc being used. It would have been better served to have an attractive picture on one side to reduce accidental handling faults such as dirt or finger prints on the read-areas of the disc. Of course, the flip side should be the majority's choice - Widescreen (when available). 
An option for English subtitles would have been great too. When actors tend to mumble, it is handy to be able to rewind to a particular scene and turn on the subtitles to find out what the character in the script was supposed to have said.
