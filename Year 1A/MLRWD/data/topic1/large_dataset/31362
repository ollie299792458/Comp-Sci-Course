What can I say really about the movie itself? Its probably one of the most classic post apocalyptic sci-fi's ever created! Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken character is memorable, infact most of the characters in the movie are probably the greatest played, including Lee Van Cleef as Bob Haulk; the US Police Force captain of Manhattan Island prison, Isaac Hayes (R.I.P.) as the Duke of New York; the ruthless gang leader running Manhattan Island on the inside, Harry Dean Stanton as Brain, Ernest Borgnine as Cabbie, and of course Donald Pleasance as the Prez. I just love the blend mix of the old school war movie/western vets like Van Cleef and Borgnine mix with the new school action bad-asses like Kurt Russell (though today hes considered old school, he can still kick ass though!), and the interaction between the characters in an environment of a world gone to hell, according through the eyes of Snake Plissken. I don't have to explain the story really, just buy the movie and find out! Not too many people can appreciate a good John Carpenter film, well, to me, not to many people are interested in an idea of creativity and making movies for the movie-goer, instead of just trying to cash-in on a franchise, or cover the story with plot-holes and filler by CGI and Gore Effects. This movie is thoroughly smooth and great from beginning to end, and I think others would agree that it destroys any top grossing movie today. I got the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD (along with the entertaining Comic Book with it, the Snake Plissken Chronicles), its a great buy alone, I enjoyed the Behind the Scenes look, and the alternate 'Bank Robbery' opening scene. If your a big fan of Carpenter's movie, or an action and/or sci-fi movie junkie, get this movie! Or rent it for a final decision at least.
