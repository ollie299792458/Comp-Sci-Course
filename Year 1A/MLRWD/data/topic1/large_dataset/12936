Having bought the NTSC version of this dvd, I have to say, although I love the selection of clips, the mastering of the video and audio leaves a lot to be desired. The video has that soft feel, akin to recording through composite leads (which have half the resolution of component or digital transfer), and the audio is a rather low bitrate ac3 if I can recall. Granted a lot of the videos are 20 years old, but that isn't an excuse if care is taken in the digital mastering, which it looks like Warner's hasn't done. If you want to see what true outstanding quality is, take a look at the releases by the Virgin Group of Culture Club or Human League. Those videos are as old as Elvis Costello's, but the videos are so sharp and the audio so stunningly recreated, you'd think they were shot yesterday. Elvis Costello's fans really deserved better. I hate it when the record studios take shortcuts with mastering of the video and audio for their dvd's, they do a major disservice not only to their own reputations in the eyes of the public, but to all the fans of the artists who buy these dvd's and cd's.
