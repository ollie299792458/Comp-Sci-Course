Even after 70 years, this is an amazingly DIFFERENT mystery/thriller, because the thrills are psychological rather than the result of horror cliches, and the mystery doesn't really solve itself.

Made long before people started talking of dysfunctional families, this story is about a marriage between a neurotically dependent girl ( significantly we never learn the character's name) and a haughty manipulative millionnaire named Maxim de Winter.  Not only is it a bad match, but there is also a servant woman named Mrs. Danvers, presumably a lesbian, dedicating to breaking it up.  The girl is so besotted with her husband that even when evidence comes up that he murdered his previous wife Rebecca, she swallows his claim of innocence and helps him get away with it.  What follows is a mystery story in reverse, dedicated not to the capture of the criminal, but to his attempts to get away.

A lot of puzzles remain at the end.  Did Maxim kill Rebecca?  Is his denigration of her character accurate, or just an excuse, or a bigoted point of view?  Is the servant simply a villainess, or a social outcast trying to bring a powerful man to justice?  And what will happen if Maxim tires of wife number 2?

At the time of the filming Hitchcock could not be explicit about Danvers' lesbianism or about a murderer getting away with it.  He solved the problem by dropping hints and letting them contribute to the mystery of the story.

My one complaint is Olivier's sometimes wooden portrayal of Maxim.  He later said he was bewildered by the part, which keeps Maxim's inner motiviations a secret, and it shows.  Fontaine is marvelous playing a girl who seems sweet but turns out flawed; Judith Anderson does a great job at hinting at impulses that could not be made explicit when the story was filmed.
