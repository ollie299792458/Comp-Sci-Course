ROCKETSHIP X-M (stands for expedition moon)..........1950
One of the 1st space films that introduced us into the 1950's sci-fi craze.
a Lippert films production. Introduced  a very young Lloyd Bridges.
The films premise is mankinds 1st expedition to the moon , a group of specialists of 4 men and 1 woman.
The ship some how goes out of control putting spaceship X-M on a course for Mars (strangely the ship had a lot of fuel to make a long trip to Mars ? ? ).
Again we learn what happens in a world with war and atomic weapons. Mars is a war-ravaged world that has been transformed from a superior intellect to a prehistoric savage world.
X-M is filmed in black and white until they arrive at Mars , then the film is in a pinkish hue.
No special effects are really used, far off scenes of the gigantic ship are really just painted backgrounds. The close-up scenes of inside the space ship are pretty standard props with all kinds of impressive gauges and dials and so on. Remember this was one of the 1st movies of its kind ,so the audience was supposed to be at awe over these instuments ,  space exploration at that time was still in its infancy.
Some of the amusing moments of the movie:
......At the very beginning the group was giving a press conference when the countdown had already begun at minus 9 minutes, heck they had not even begun boarding the ship until it was minus 4 minutes,just casually walking ,  Oh and they strapped in at minus 30 seconds.
......They wore just normal issue army type clothing . Got off on Mars with not even a space suit, wore their normal clothing.
......Used a old WW II short wave radio for communications back to earth.
......Was originally a trip to the moon, some how they had enough fuel to make the trip to Mars and almost back to Earth ??
......Fired pistols and rifles on the surface of Mars ?? Could that work ??

Great 1950's fun , break out the popcorn and soda.
This is the 50th anniversary edition DVD , excellent clarity.
