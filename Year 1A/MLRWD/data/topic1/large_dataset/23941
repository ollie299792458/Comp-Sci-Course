i love the comments about how there's no plot, or the film is boring or not gory enough, blah blah blah....
i have a feeling most reviews in that perspective are coming from people who probably think the retarded remake was better. faster paced editing, some nasty gore scenes. basicaly untrue to the nature of the original, just udated and remarketed for young blood. tcm is low on gore, yes. gore is disgusting, not scary though. this movie is scary. the beginning sets up the mood well. we enjoy a bus ride with a happy go luck hippie type gang through texas. but suddenly things go all to hell. that is the plot. this is a horror film, not the 400 blows. the atmospere we witness and the overall grim descent toward hell that the characters go through is almost unbearable. this film is realy perfection. a larger budget wouldnt have made it better. nothing could really make it better. the use of ambient sound and jarring noises make the most effective sound track instead of a bunch of rock songs or whatever we tend to hear now days. i only wish i was around back when this was in theaters! damn.
so here is another release of tcm. i notice alot of low reviews because the release doesnt offer new features when actually it does. hold up the pioneer version along side with the dark sky version and use your eyeballs to see features listed on dark sky exclusively. they are similar but not identical. dark sky is an excellent label. great catalog and highly reputable.
speaking of, this packaging is pretty sweet. the reflective tin case is much better than the dark pioneer case that tends to show every finger print that touches it. the clear inside of the dark sky dvd is a perfect location for signing, as mine is by gunnar hansen aka leatherface himself. guess one good thing comes form living in maine. gunnar is about 40 min away. sleep tight. haha
