At our house this is one of our favorite comedies.  What happens when a mad scientist (Henry Gibson) and his brother and nephew mysteriously move into a peaceful suburban neighborhood?  It means laughs from the start of the film to its finish.

Next door neighbors on the right are played by Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher whose on screen chemistry works perfectly here.  Hanks' character is on vacation looking forward to what he thinks will be a rest-filled week off.  The crusty neighbor on the left is played by the Gale Gordon who many will remember my for his long years on TV working with Lucille Ball.

Hanks' neighborhood pal (Rick Ducommun) (in a role that could have been written for John Candy) has other plans for Hanks, specifically, spy on their new neighbors.  They enlist the retired military man next door Bruce Dern, who has all the necessary army hardware needed in case of invasion.  This has to be the funniest role Dern has ever played and his fits it him a tee.  Corey Feldman plays the wacky neighborhood teen who also gets into the act.

This movie is a lot of fun....hope to see a special anniversary edition with cast & crew interviews at some point.  Highly recommended if anyone is in need of some belly laughs.
