I do several yoga/pilates beginner and intermediate workout videos, so I guess I am intermediate. The two big reviewers who think this doesn't work the bum/bikini area are bikini ready already, obviously. This workout probably wasn't intended for you!

The arm movements are comfortable and flowing, and the challenge varies with how much weight you use. I have some 2 and 3 pound weights.

I don't do regular squats or aerobics videos because of knee problems, so it was a pleasant surprise that this workout full of plie moves didn't hurt too much. She also gives an alternative low-impact move for the hopping motion, which my knees appreciated. The only thing that hurt much was the single-leg squats because my bad knee couldn't take the extra load all at once, so I just did regular squats.

The next day I knew my "squat areas" definitely felt the workout. I appreciate the flowing nature of the movements and the fact that we do things several times before moving on, so a new and clumsy user like me can keep up.

I found this video On Demand from my cable company, completely by accident! I selected an 8 minute Buff Abs routine, and I guess the link is messed up because about 5 minutes in I realized we weren't stopping anytime soon. They don't have a title screen on the video, so I didn't know until the end what the name was and I searched immediately to buy it on Amazon.
