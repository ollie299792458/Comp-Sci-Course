If you're new to the internet, there's a scene in one of the episodes that depicts a few heads up on spikes.  Good old fashioned medieval fun.  However while the studio was looking around for prop heads to put on said spikes they kinda grabbed whatever was handy.  One of those heads was modeled after G.W. Bush for some other movie and they figured if they put enough dirt on it no one would notice.  I certainly didn't.  The internet did though and then it became a mild, completely meaningless controversy that no one with a brain cared about but since TV producers typically don't have brains they decided they'd recall (or at least make a statement saying they would) all the copies of the DVD and Blu-Ray that had this scene and would replace them with an edited version.

Right about now you're probably wondering who the hell cares, right?  Well this Blu-ray was $36 when it was up for pre-order.  It was $45 when I bought it the day after HBO released that silly statement.  Now it's about $55.  See, while this may not be a collector's item, people are certainly going to speculate that it may be one and it's price is going to go up accordingly for a while.  If you don't care about having a digitally edited version down the line then wait about 8 months and I'm sure like all other over-priced HBO box sets this will go on sale for about $20 on some lightning deal.  If you do care to not have some clumsy digital affects animation edit out G.W.'s head on a spike, then by all means buy this before the speculators get out of control and the price goes up another $10-40.

While I'm at it it's worth mentioning this is one of the best series HBO has produced and it's an amazingly rich fiction that grips you and keeps you wanting more.  ;)
