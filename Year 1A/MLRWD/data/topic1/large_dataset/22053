I've liked the other Spike Lee movies that I have watched although I will admit that I have not watched many of them.  However, this being a World War II movie got my attention especially since it is about an aspect of World War II that doesn't get alot of attention (even during the war), the Italian Campaign.

I knew there were black Army units but I thought they mostly stuck to supply (the Red Ball Express).  I didn't realize there were black combat units until a few years ago.  Shame really because it sounds like many of them showed valor along the lines of the Japanese-American units.

The scene that really bothers me is the scene where they try to get Ice Cream in Alabama and are refused service, unless they go to the back.  Sitting in the restaurant were German POWs who were getting better treatment than the American soldiers.  It was a sad reflection on the times but an indication of just how far we've come.

I will have to admit that it started in a weird direction with the killing.  I wasn't sure where that was going to take us, although I figured it had something to do with the war.

Overall, it was a very good movie.  Good acting.  Great cinematography.  Awesome battle scenes.
