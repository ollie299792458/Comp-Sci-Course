I have a bachelor's in Film.  I love movies, from The Third Man to The Graduate to Barton Fink to Amelie.  I also enjoy the popcorn flicks like Jaws, The Mummy (yes, The Mummy), Iron-Man and Harry Potter.  I can even watch stuff on SyFy (though usually when I'm doing something else).  I've grown up on sitcoms and cartoons, so this is up my alley.

Hudson Hawk is not for everyone.  Even Bruce Willis himself made fun of it on Letterman one time.  This is not Die Hard, but people expected it to be Die Hard, which is why they didn't get it.  This is slapstick humor, tongue-in-cheek.  Comedy is so subjective and if someone doesn't think something is funny ... for some reason they get angry at the movie, TV show or comic.  I feel this way about "Two and a Half Men."  I hate, hate that show, but for some reason ... it does well.

This is a different type of movie.  It has musical numbers and explosions, so it has to be different.  Think of it as a live-action Bugs Bunny cartoon without Bugs and the gang and you might enjoy it more.  It could take more than one viewing to appreciate it.  Some people thought of The Fifth Element in the same way.  They didn't get it at first.  If you don't understand why Hudson Hawk is great, then that's fine ... you don't have to.

It's not perfect (obviously) ... I wish the final robbery was like the others (without giving too much away).
The DVD quality ... it's fine for what it is, who cares, it's 2010 and I want the Blu-Ray out already, but it could be awhile.
