As a future marine biologist, the original JAWS was what first planted the seed of my shark fascination. I love all sea predators, and sharks are definitely one of the best. And as such, whenever I found a JAWS film that my eyes had yet to view, I had to get it. Love the original classic, the next one JAWS 2, liked it, mainly cause of the music, however I learned about how Roy Scheider didnt want any part of this one. Then I saw JAWS 3-D or simply JAWS 3 as it is no longer in 3-D. This one gets bashed quite a bit, but honestly this third film scared me the most, mainly cause alot of the scenes involving the giant shark were very dark, making it eerie. Then finally I stumbled upon this one: Jaws The Revenge. Now at that time, I knew nothing about film or what makes a good film. As I got older, I had seen countless reviews on how this was one of the absolute worst films ever, so bad that saying anything postitive about it would've been a Cardinal sin.

HOWEVER...Im going to be honest here: I don't find it all that bad. Yes! You heard me! Im not all that disappointed with it. Maybe its cause Im not really someone who tries to be a critic, but as I said, I really don't think this film is as horrible as so many others say it is...and Im going to point out that some of the main complaints this film gets, to me, are exaggerated and overrated. So, what I will do is list the main complaints about this film, explain why these parts arent so bad once one stops and thinks for a moment, and even point out a contradiction that many dont seem to notice, so here we go:

Now I know alot of you critics are thinking DUDE! How can you defend such garbage?!? Just hear me out and read on:

-Complaint #1: Ellen Brody's flashbacks to scenes of the first JAWS film.

I read alot of reviews where people seem to get all waah! waah! waah! about Ellen Brody's flashbacks of different moments from the original film. But just think about this for a second. The first flashback she has was a scene in JAWS that she actually witnessed, which is Martin playing gestures with the younger son Sean, who is the first shark victim in Revenge btw. It would make perfect sense to have that flashback cause she was there! Secondly there is the flashback she is having from the first film which features the epic ending where Martin is trying to shoot the air tank in the sharks mouth. Now I understand that it would make zero sense for her to flashback that scene, but did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the reason she was picturing that particular scene was..I dont know...maybe because Martin may have actually told her about it between the first and second films? As far as Im concerned, he told her what had happened in the time frame b/w Jaws and Jaws 2. It may not have been part of the films, but I dont care.

-Complaint #2: The Shark Following the Family to the Bahamas

Sure, it is unrealistic for an animal such as a shark to kill out of vengeance, completely unnatural. However it isnt so unnatural for a great white to make a long distance migration. Great whites are known for swimming great distances from the US Pacific coast to Hawaii. No one really knows yet why they take these long journeys, but it does happen. Plus it is mentioned in this film that great whites dont like warm water, however, great whites are actually warm blooded and can adapt their body temperatures to cold and warm water, which is why great whites can be found in coastal waters worldwide with the exception of arctic and antarctic waters. Now that still doesnt explain the whole "revenge" thing. Well, all I can say is, the whole revenge plot was something the director put in just to make it scarier. Feel free to whine about that all u want, but as far as the shark swimming from New England to the Bahamas, it is actual great white behavior, it just takes place in the Pacific, not the Atlantic.

-Complaint #3: Michael Cain & Mario Van Peebles

Now Ive heard mixed opinions when it comes to Cain. I honestly thought Cain was annoying and unnecessary, basically because the makers of this movie tried to put in a sub-plot where he has a thing for Mrs Brody. Im not a big fan of subplots. But he did offer some quick comedy relief when the shark tries to eat him and he utters what many consider the best line of the whole film, but youll have to watch it to see, or just see if u can pulll it up on YouTube.

Now as for Peebles, yes, his Caribbean-Jamaican accent can get old, but honestly he made me laugh. Im serious, the first time I saw this, he had me rollin, especially the scene where he tries to put some electric device into the shark's mouth only to fall into its jaws. The look on his face and the music playing at that moment match perfectly and I was hysterical. Its still the only scene in a scary movie that makes my ribs hurt from laughing.

-Complaint #4: The "Explosive" Ending

Alot of people whine and mope about the ending which bears strong resemblance to the first film, yet also makes no sense. The ending Im talking about is of course where Ellen stabs the shark in the gills with the broken end of the boat...and the shark just blows up and we see the footage from the first film of the shark sinking to the sea bottom. There are actually two different endings to Jaws The Revenge. The one everyone is used to, sadly, is on the dvd. However, the original theatrical release shows an ending very different: the shark still gets stabbed, but instead of blowing up, blood gushes out of its mouth, the weight of the shark causes the boat to snap in half, and we see the bow of the boat sinking to the bottom with the shark impaled on it. Now that ending is a much better ending and shouldve been put on the dvd as far as I go. Why they chose to make an explosive ending, i dont know. But the original ending I would take any day.

-Complaint #5: The Roaring Shark

And now we come to what everyone claims is the biggest outrage of the film: a roaring shark. Yes, a shark cannot roar, even I will admit that...but did it ever occur to anyone that the sharks from the other 3 films ALSO MADE UNNATURAL SOUNDS?...

(Remember what I said about a certain contradiction?)

Thats Right! The shark in Revenge isnt the only one guilty of this. How do I know? Simple:

-JAWS: When the shark bursts through the glass as the Orca is sinking, trying to finish off Brody, you can clearly hear a gurgle-growling sound erupting from its throat. Sharks cant roar, but they cant growl either.

-JAWS 2: There is a scene where two sailboaters are trying to pull one of their fallen bretheren out of the water and the shark is closing in. They barely get the guy into the boat as the shark's jaws pass by, barely missing the victim's legs. It is during this moment that you can hear a roaring type sound coming from this shark that sounds quite similar to one of the T-rex sounds from Jurassic Park. Dont believe me, watch and listen...

-JAWS 3-D: This shark makes far more unnatural growls in one scene alone than all the other sharks from the other films combined! Pretty much every time you see this shark, it opens its mouth and wouldnt ya know? A growl erupts!

Now, as Ive said, Jaws The Revenge may be one of the worst films in history according to all the big critics out there, but the next time someone complains about a roaring shark or Ellen Brody's flashbacks...just think about what I said...

Peace!
