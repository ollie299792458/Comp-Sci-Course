If you haven't seen this movie before, by all means buy this DVD.  It is an excellent story by an excellent director with an excellent lead actor.  However, if you have seen the movie before, or have seen other Criterion productions, then steer clear of this print.  The contrast of the picture is good.  But the actual movie often has lines and scratches throughout.  I find it hard to believe that this is the only print that Criterion could utilize in making the DVD.  Likewise, the opening credits are in English, instead of in Japanese like the Seven Samurai or Hidden Fortress DVDs.  These English credits spill off the screen, and this is sort of a prelude to the quality of the rest of the DVD.  Indeed, the film quality of the older Kurosawa movies issued by Criterion is far better than that of Yojimbo.  
So, buy this movie for the adventure and the exciting story.  But if its quality photography you are after, just beware.  Criterion usually does a good job but this ain't one of them.
