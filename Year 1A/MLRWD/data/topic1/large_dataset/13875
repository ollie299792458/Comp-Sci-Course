I recently picked up this 2-disc set after watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre on IFC a couple of months ago.  That was my first time seeing this classic.  I must say that I was blown away by the sheer rawness of this film.  I had heard of this movie as a child in the 80s, but never tried to watch it, for a fear of it being too gory.  This is not a gorefest movie, which makes it scarier in my opinion.  Literally, my jaw was on the floor when it was over...I was very impressed, shocked, and literally terrified of how real and raw this movie is.  I've now seen it 4 times, and cannot wait to experience it again.  For those who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.  I recommend the 2-disc ultimate edition, as you get the classic movie packaged in a nice metal tin.  Disc 2 includes 2 wonderful documentaries, "TCM: The Shocking Truth" and "Flesh Wounds".  There are also outtakes and blooper reels which are pretty cool.  Anyways, I just had to add my 2 cents here to praise this classic horror gem.  Long live the saw!
