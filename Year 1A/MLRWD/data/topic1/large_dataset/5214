If this film came out by any other writer/director, people would have really liked if not loved it.  I'm not a huge Ben Affleck fan and I've never seen Jennifer Lopez in anything longer than a movie trailer.  I am a big Kevin Smith fan though.

The dialog was snappy and genuine, the acting was surprisingly understated and moving and while it was a little predictable as to where Ollie's (Affleck) journey was taking him, it was  done in a way that was surprisingly funny, disarming and touching.  Liv Tyler is more expressive than she's ever been on film, Ben Affleck is more conflicted and more vulnerable than I've ever seen him and George Carlin gives a surprisingly nuanced performance as Ollie's imperfect, loving, alcoholic father.  Jennifer Lopez' small contribution to the film is fine.  Affleck and Lopez do a fine job convincing the audience that they were in love, so when her character leaves the film, Ollie's heartbreak feels genuine.  Why cast Jennifer Lopez?  Well, in part, she gives Ollie's time in New York a fantasy-like quality and when her pop star-like beauty is gone, Ollie's world genuinely does seem a little less bright.

Jersey Girl is a modern film about modern themes in the old Frank Kapra style.

Why was this film panned?  Is it because Kevin Smith's fans are all under 20 or because we can't stand to see people make something sincere and different after we've made up our mind's about them?

Kevin Smith, like most of us, has grown up.  He's still the foul mouthed comic genius he always was, but he's something else too.  This film suffers, not from lack of quality or poor execution, but from a shallow public perception.  Who knew that Kevin Smith, creator of Jay and Silent Bob could make something unflinchingly heart warming?  The saddest thing about this film is that he's taken such a beating over making it that he'll never make another one like it.

Open your mind and forget the hype.  This is a good little film.
