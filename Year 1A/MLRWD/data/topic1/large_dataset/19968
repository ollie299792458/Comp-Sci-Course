Finally, this lost 1973 musical film is released on DVD and about time. The film has been remastered to pristine quality and with added bonus materials and good to see the deleted scenes. I did watched the film when it was released in 1973 and was quite enchanted about it, as I was only 7 years old at the cinema, and I was simply adored the songs that we had on the soundtrack record.

The theme of the film is to live in moderation and how true especially in the present economic climate. Being greedy holds no boundary as it only produces grief and despair.

When it was first released, it was a flop financially and critics reallt panned the film and never did get it's credibility, however it did gained a cult status among fans of the film and it remain a favourite of mine. Best musical numbers are 'The World Is A Circle', 'Question Me An Answer' and 'Living Together, Growing Together'.

Whatever it is, do give a try to this rather interesting musical and get lost in this special presented horizon.
