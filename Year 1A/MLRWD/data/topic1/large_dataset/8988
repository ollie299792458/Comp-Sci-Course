Simply put, I regard this picture as the greatest movie of all time. I have many favorites old and new, but this movie still is as hypnotic now in 2010 as it was in August 1979 when I saw it in the theaters.

The original theatrical version remains the best way to see this picture for me. But I am grateful for the redux version that allows us fans a different perspective also. And including HEARTS OF DARKNESS in the 3-disc BD (finally!) completes the package.

The picture/sound on this BD title is perfect: a 5 out of 5 for those needing a rating. I detected absolutely no problems or errors while watching ALL 3 discs (am I just lucky?).

Buy this 3-disc set, disappear into your man-cave for a weekend and watch what a true genus can do with film.

PS. I understand the confusion of the ending. I too, have seen the ending with the village being bombed while the end credits rolled also, but I can't seem to remember when exactly. Was it in the theater? on cable in the early 80s?

I never gave it much thought until I bought the Laserdisc in 1992. When the ending came, there was nothing. The credits required me to flip the disc over and that is when I asked: "Where's the village destruction?". You could hear the explosions but the background was black, yet the credits bounced around on the screen where apparently they were placed around the explosions onscreen.

Thankfully, these questions have been answered through DVD and now BD. The apocalyptic ending did exist, but was removed by Coppola. I respect his decision and feel the ending is better because of it.
