Tough guy, Ryder (played by John Travolta), has taken a New York City subway train and its passenger's hostage, and will only release them once the mayor has paid $10 million dollars. Meanwhile, transit worker Walter Garber (who is under suspicion of taking a bribe) is the unfortunate dispatcher who Ryder makes contact with, and soon finds himself embarking on a series of tasks to rescue the hostages. There were two really great actors (Travolta & Washington), some snippers, some chase scenes, some really bad guys, an entertaining Mayor, and tons of stuff that should have made this a must see, but I was disappointed. There was so much potential, so many possibilities, but nothing really seemed to connect. There was no follow-thru, and nothing to really justify the mediocre ending of Garber (Washington) walking home with a half-gallon of milk following his showdown with Ryder (Travolta). Not even Travolta's attempt at being a bad guy and using "MF" constantly (although the tattoo on his neck was cute) seem genuine, just forced. What worked for him in Pulp Fiction (tough guy yet likeable) didn't really work here, and while I would love to give this a great review, I can't. But I will give this tale a "2" because I thought the outtakes and extras on the DVD were great.
