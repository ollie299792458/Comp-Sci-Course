I seriously was shocked when i saw the ratings for the film. This is one of the best Comdies I've seen since Me,Myself and Irene.Adam Sandler to my opinion is no longer funny ever since Little Nicky which was still in the ok zone. But his latest films like Punch, Drunk, Love or Mr. Deeds, and even, not to forget, 8 crazy nights which was just HORRIBLE, Sandler to my opinion just has worn out with his recapitulated humour and i still fell the same way about this film except that i couldn't stop laughing, but not due to Adam Sandlers part but due to Nicholsons. Jack Nicholson carried Sandler throughout this movie but i have to say i loved it. It's about a guy that has to undergo Anger Management do to his anger explosion on the air plane which never really happened. His anger management counselor, played by Jack Nicholson, moves in with him and start to take his life apart, especially the life he has with his girlfriend. I have to add this again Why doesn't anyone like this movie, it was fantastic and straight up hilarious, but i should add that this movie should have been rated R for all the vulgarity, and some sexual humour, so don't take your kids cause this is a adult film!!!!
