So much has been said and written about this movie, what do you believe? I say it's a classic, just because the film tried so hard to be big, bold and beautiful. It falls flat on all counts, but not for want of trying. The film features great acting, great costumes and great sets. As well, you get to see how Bob Guccione perceived Rome back in the day. If you want to own this movie, this is the version to have, stay away from everything else. You have to see the film to fully understand and grasp it. It is actually a miracle the film ever saw the light of day, and we should enjoy it for what it is. Besides the big names, the film also features Signe Berger, Valerie Rae Clark, Anneka Di Lorenzo, Jane Hargrave, Henrietta Post, Juliet Morris, Carolyn Patsis, Suzanne Saxon (1956-2006), Melanie Sutherland, Lori Wagner and Bonnie Dee Wilson. The film boasts a great musical score by Paul Clemente. I would also recommend the film 'Messalina! Messalina!' which stars both Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner and also features the sets used in Caligula. The film isn't that good, but it's nice to see Anneka and Lori on screen, and the sets are fantastic!
