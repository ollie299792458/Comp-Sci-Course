After so much success with Talking Letters by Leapfrog, we went ahead and bought this one and were just as pleased.  Talking Letters taught recognition of each letter and the sound it makes;  this DVD teaches how to put those sounds together to make simple 3 letter words.

My son was roughly 2.5 when we bought this, and he quickly learned to read 3 letter words.  When my daughter's friends came over, my daughter liked to spell words with letter tiles and have him read them to the genuine amazement of her playmates.

Of course, if you want your child to fluently read a variety of books, it will take more than this Leapfrog series of DVDS (to date there are 4 reading ones and 1 math one).  However, this dvd UNQUESTIONABLY gives kids a head start.  It makes the material fun to learn and easy to remember, and who can quibble with that??

I have also recommended this series to several friends whose kindergarteners were having trouble with letter/sound recognition and the idea of blending letters to make words.  The dvds helped all of their children make significant progress towards mastery of these concepts.

I will warn adults that, while certainly not on a par with Teletubbies or Boo-bah, the DVD can be annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs. But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.

This series, and this dvd in particular, is a great guilt-free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table.
