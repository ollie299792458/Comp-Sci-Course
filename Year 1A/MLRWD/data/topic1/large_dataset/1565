It's difficult to add anything more to the great reviews made here of the Dick Van Dyke Show. It's an absolute joy to watch these classic episodes of one of the top 5 all-time TV comedies. Smart, impeccably cast and written, and relentlessly funny, season after season.

HOWEVER...why, oh why, is there no list of the bonus features? There's no list included, nothing on or in the individual sleeves...nothing. The 12-page booklet has some fun trivia, but why couldn't they add another few pages to catalog the bonus material? Do I really have to browse the menus of each individual disk?

I tried looking up each season here on Amazon as someone suggested, but that doesn't work. Example...the standalone second season set has rehearsals listed as a bonus, but after looking at every second season disk in this complete set, I find nothing of the sort.

That's the only glaring fault I have with this set. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. It's beautifully laid out, the prints are pristine and it's packaged nicely, worthy of the show contained herein.
