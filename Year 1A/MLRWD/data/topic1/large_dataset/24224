What is utterly, utterly fascinating about this film is that it literally follows them from the very beginning.  You get Stewart-shot Super 8 footage of them driving around America from tiny gig to tiny gig, hauling their own gear and staying at fleabag motels.  With a crew of... two.

Then things start to change.  The gigs start getting bigger, the crowds larger, the hotels nicer.  You are there the first time they return to England after one of their singles breaks and you see their awe as fans mob them at the airport.  Soon the touring van is replaced by touring bus which is then replaced by touring... plane.

It really, really is a voyeuristic, mindblowing look from their perspective, literally.  More from their perspective looking at the audience.  This is NOT a behind-the-scenes look at them in the studio, save for a few killer scenes from Zenyatta and Ghost.  No fights or arguments or groupies.

Truly eerie to see them from the very, very beginning.  Watch it with Stewart and Andy's commentary for the second time.  In fact, you could watch this the first time--it's a better narrative for what's going on.

BIGGEST BONUS: I don't know where they came from, but the whole film is littered with alternate takes and EARLY, early versions of classic Police songs that I have never heard before.  There's wild early takes on "I Burn for You," "Tea in the Sahara," songs from Ghost with piano on them that wasn't on the album.  Some of the songs are virtually unrecognizable from their eventual versions--only the lyrics give them away.

For any Police die-hard, you must see this.  It's basically home movies, but oh what movies they are.  Casual fans will probably not think much of this, and that's fine.

Casual fans wanting to get an early look at the Police should rent/buy the video "Police Around the World."

It runs up until about their appearance in the US Festival in 1982 or 83.
