Okay first off I went to theater to see this movie and to tell you the truth I really didn't like rock music all that much(Daft Funk, Nas, Wu-tang, G-Unit, and snippets of the Beethoven(hee-hee)y'know the essentials). I went to the movie thinking "I don't go to often and I've admired Jack Black's candor on TV and the movie roles he played before hand. Movies like:

So I fig, hey why not, while my mom (who by the way is Doreathea Henderson. As her son i monitor stuff) goess to see some girly movie or what ever i'll watch this. And let me tell you It Rocked!? (What am I saying??) The movie is filled with quasi stars and, up till now I didn't know, the writer of the movie as supporting roles. Someone out there trusted Jack with a script written for him (like he's John Wayne or sumthin') and he took it and ran to..to...well I don't know he just did alright!!! For a person how doesen't like rock muzac i found to love as the movie transpired. In the end,the movie made me want to have the same fire in m'belly as Sir Black.
