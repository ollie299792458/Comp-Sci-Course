It's a simple premise really: "A happy family > separate happy family > (makes everyone unhappy) > try and reunite family to be happy again."

It worked.  I very much wanted to see the family back together again.

I watched this film hoping for a good, suspenseful, well thought-out drama/thriller and was not disappointed.  I think Crowe picks projects that are top notch with good story-telling elements.

I wasn't bored (I read a review who said they were.. and I thought perhaps they might have been asleep, but not bored..) and in my opinion Crowe makes his character really come to life.  I'm not sure what it was, but his performance reminded me at moments of how he was in 'A Beautiful Mind'.  Maybe it was the mania that eventually overcame the protagonist in dire moments of decision and his ability to keep the level of intrigue heightened, I don't know.  But it was worked for me.

'The Next Three Days' wasn't totally predictable which was a relief.  He played a masculine yet sensitive even sentimental community college professor ultimately willing to do whatever it took to keep family intact.  He loves his wife and child. That always works, it worked on me.  I found his emotive range to be unexpected and rich and that made me root for him, even in questionable situations.  I don't recall the actress in the film (so sorry!) but I've seen her before and thought she also did a very good job and was well suited with Crowe.  It was a satisfying film, but then again, I am old-fashioned, I like a good story, well-told, and if there are some explosions or guns fired with other action involved, that's OK with me...

My thumbs are up on this one.  I watch plenty of films and this one has stayed more toward the top of the heap as of late.  And I'm not a professional film reviewer, just somebody who loves a good movie with story and character driven sensibilities.
