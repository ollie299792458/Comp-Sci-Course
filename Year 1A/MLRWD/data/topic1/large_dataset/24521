I pre-ordered this DVD and Amazon delivered it on the same day it was officially released. Anyone who could find any flaws in the music, playlist, energy or production must not understand REAL MUSIC! They apparently only listen to hippity hop, rap or grung. I have over 100 DVD concerts and this one is securely in the top five. When the Grammys begin this DVD/CD will walk with every award in their class as well as "Best of all for 2005."

I can only pity those people who gave out 1s, 2s & 3s. The pity is for their neighbors who have to listen to the sounds that comes from their homes/apartments.

By far the best DVD to be released since, "Music For Montserrat" which featured all of the best musicians and singers in 1997 (was released on DVD July 27, 2004). There have been many that are great between those years, but in my eyes Cream 2005 Reunion is second to none.

They were great in 1966 and all have improved dramatically. The surround mix is fantastic as is the editing. My advice is if you are under 40 you may want to skip this one unless you were fortunate to have family expose you to the best trio to ever light up a stage.
