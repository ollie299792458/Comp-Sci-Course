I have a soft spot (probably between my ears) for this movie.
ZZ Top reject prof uncovers the living dead in grounds of his villa. Unfortunately for him they are not the Grateful Dead and despite the prof's pleas the zombies eat this "beardie-boffin." Hair today gone tomorrow I guess.
Before long assorted Italian extras (and one unfogettable minor) visit this Villa Of The Damned.
An odd looking bunch - especially "young" Peter Bark - a sort of Mini-Me version of Dario Argento (sorry) who is utterly terrifing.
After a while the zombies arrive at the villa, but these living dead aren't Braindead. They use tools, weapons and even a battering ram to gain access to eat Italian. This predates tool using zombies in Dan O'Bannon's Return Of The Living Dead by several years. "Brains, brains, need more brains....." - out of luck here guys on both sides of the camera!
After assorted unconvincing gory mayhem (although the zombies look nicely rotten from the neck upwards in classic Italian make up tradition)we reach the film's highlight.
Peter Bark (now a "Mini-Me" living dead Dario and still scarier than his zombie cohorts) learns [chest] is best and takes a bite out of his mother's bogus bossom. Goes to prove the old saying "His Bark is worse than his bite!"
Hailing from Britain, now living in Australia, I first saw this movie on video and it lasted a scant 60mins - thanks to over eager editing by its distributor (Apex Video) and our helpful state censors - so it's nice to see it all its gory glory.
A much better release thank the UK Vipco DVD version entitled "The Zombie Dead" this film remains and unforgettable film experience....no matter how hard you try.
