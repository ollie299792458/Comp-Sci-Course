Avoid this one at all costs.  I don't know where people get off giving this four or five stars for, this movie reminds one of the work of a film school student who came up with half of a good idea and successfully pitched it but when it came to finishing the story ran out of poop.  The movie starts off promisingly; a man is fired from a career job and to hide this from his family concocts a story about being hired to an important position at the UN, and a scheme to swindle his family, acquaintances and business associates so that he can afford to live the lie presumably until he lands on his feet.  Alas the promise of the story is strangled by the numerous sections of the film filled tedious, over-wrought and downright tawdry sections of nothing but morose music and rather pointless shots of the protagonist driving, or walking or thinking or sitting.  Meanwhile the audience is yawning or fidgeting or groaning or snoozing.  Fast forwarding through these bits of self-indulgent rubbish takes five to ten seconds so you can imagine how long it takes to view them.  Furthermore, the director attempts to create a family dynamic that is both adrift and riven by tension but utterly fails simply because there is no real point to it; it is misery for misery's sake.  Which, by the way is just like the movie on the whole.  The reason being that while the story does start out with some promise, it never develops into anything.  The 'star' creates a ponzi scheme to bilk his friends AND gets caught at it by a mystery man with ties to the underworld and even gets involved with the fellow, THEN has his ponzi scheme called by his friends, THEN gets found out by his family and yet NOTHING HAPPENS.  Not a thing happens and this is the problem with this really, truly, genuinely poor movie. To put it nicely it's like getting kissed but not conjugated.
