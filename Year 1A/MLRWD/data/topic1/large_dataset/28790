Let me get this out of the way first: this is NOT a traditional zombie flick (a la George Romero). If you require your zombies to be mindless, slow-moving, flesh-eating machines of the dead, then keep looking. Otherwise, if you don't mind checking out a movie that takes chances with genre rules, keep reading...

A team of mercenaries is hired to protect a businessman on a journey to find a hidden bunker in eastern Europe. What they find inside the bunker is quite more than any of them expected.

So there's a brief synopsis. The movie isn't perfect, but it's well-cast and well-acted (IMO). Stevenson owns the show here and does quite well doing so. Again, the "zombies" are quite different than your typical Romero-spawned fare (think: more aggressive and with a purpose), but for me, they work with the story. Also, since the bunker is in the middle of nowhere, the feeling of isolation works very well too. As a viewer, I was constantly waiting for something to pop out from behind the corner or from the forest. The director did a great job building (and keeping) tension.

Four stars might be a little unfair since I'm trying to balance my overall reaction with slightly-lowered expectations, but it's an honest four. Granted, I didn't expect it to be "great," but I did expect to be somewhat entertained for 90 minutes. I'd say I got that and a little more. The story is just deep enough to be intriguing and the characters are none we haven't seen before, but they're engaging enough. And the script moves along logically and smooth. Overall, a very fun way to spend an hour and a half with a few genuinely tense/scary moments thrown in.
