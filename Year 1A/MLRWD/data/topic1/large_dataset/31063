By the end of the third season of the series we could see that major changes were coming for the characters and I was eagerly awaiting for the upcoming fourth season to find out about Susan and Steve's baby, Sally and Patrick's relationship and the suggested idea of Jane and Jeff being together. Well, you'll see most of it here but definitely not Jeff.

The reason why Richard Coyle is no longer in the show is unknown to me, and never mentioned in the bonus materials (which by the way include a complete interview with the new guy, Richard Mylan), but the writers obviously tried to justify his absence not succeeding at all. I will be honest and say that Jeff Murdoch was definitely my favorite character of them all, and I don't have anything against the new Oliver character, but listen to his dialogues and you'll see that the writers tried to fit already made Jeff dialogues into his persona, which doesn't help the new character at all.

But regardless of the new Oliver character, this season comes as witty and intelligent as it has always been. The first episode for instance shows you the same timeframe (9 1/2 minutes) from three different points of view that fit together in the end, total genius!

`Nightlines' and the never ending phone call will give you a good laugh, the game of coupling in the third episode is just amazing and the highlight is definitely episode 6 (9 Â½ months) with a retuned Jeff that totally lets you down, put aside that and the rest of the episode will make you cry (Steve definitely draws all attention here)

I usually give 5 stars to the show but being the current Oliver-Jeff situation this won't be the time. I think this problem could be fixed if the writers could give Oliver a personality of his own instead of trying to adapt him with Jeff's.
