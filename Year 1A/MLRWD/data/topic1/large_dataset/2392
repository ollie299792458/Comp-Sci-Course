First of all, I must admit that I am somewhat prejudiced in this review.  I attended one of the concerts on this tour, in Montreal, Canada.  It is a sweet memory, going to Montreal, and seeing Cat in person.  I recall how he entered, quite unexpectedly, from a Magician's box.  A surprise for sure!

This is a great concert, and I am so glad Yusuf Islam allowed it to be released.  There is music from the full repertoire of his albums.  And he performs them flawlessly.  (Well a small flaw on "Lady D'Arbanville," but whose counting?)  Stevens had everything going for him.  A marvelous talent for melody.  He seemed to have an inexaustible supply.  A sense of the appropriate lyric.  A voice that could not have been better.  I can't think of a Stevens song without that voice (perhaps cost him in covers, but did him good in the short run).  And last, and I say this as an observer, he was simply the most handsome of pop artists of his generation.

In any case, this is a concert to remember.  I do!
