My favorite Diana Krall song is whichever one I'm listening to at the moment. The Internet radio stations I listen to originate in France; they play Diana two or three times every hour. Also Louis Armstrong; and Miles; Coltrane; Ella; Billie; Nina Simone. All the best. Now and again (every day) they play Otis Redding and Sinatra. It's not an eclectic mix, it's simply the best music the world knows as Jazz.

I won't compare the great Live In Rio DVD with the great Live In Paris DVD and the great Live At The Montreal Jazz Festival DVD. One is better than another? I wish I had a hundred Diana Krall DVDs, each one worse than the next: the worst would be great.

But since Diana always pays deep respect and homage to Nat King Cole (who was my mother's favorite), I'll compare Diana to Nat. They both were blessed with apparently ageless and beautiful skin. Also, Nat had perfect pitch, which Diana doesn't have. What Diana has - and she may be unique for having it - is perfect affect. Paraphrasing Samuel Johnson's praise for poet John Milton's epic genius, I'll say Diana Krall isn't the greatest of story-tellers simply because she isn't the first.

Krall's perfect affect doesn't show only in her singing and playing. There's an absence of ego, or rather, her ego seems to disappear inside the music, deep into its histories. And seldom has a performer of such celebrity and popularity bothered to mention regularly the composers and arrangers of the songs she performs. Her respect and gratitude are bottomless.

I can't believe each of these DVDs of hers can be had for under $100! And you can play them as often as you like!
