I am a sucker for an epic movie and I swore when Titanic came out twelve years ago that it would be a long time before another movie could come along and top it. With The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, that has finally happened. This film is so endearing and wonderful that I am not even sure which words to use to express its merits. In many ways, this film reminds me of both Titanic and Forrest Gump, two movies that are rife with humor and sadness--two films that do storytelling on a grand scale.
Furthermore, the cinematography is at times breathtaking and the musical score is absolutely perfect. In my opinion, this film is the highlight of Brad Pitt's career. Cate Blanchett, as usual, is stunning.
This is one film about which I can say "I laughed and I cried," and mean it. I saw it last night as a Netflix selection and am glad my husband was already in bed. This means he'll want to watch it tonight, and I will be "forced" to watch it again. I can't wait.
I cannot recommend this film enough. Positively stunning and unique.
