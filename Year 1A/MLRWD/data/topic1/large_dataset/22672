Writer John M. Cain's story of lust, greed, and murder is brought to life in the film Double Indemnity. Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) along with writer Raymond Chandler (The Long Goodbye) brings Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson into a great film noir. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a successful insurance salesman. He falls in love with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwych). Mrs. Dietrichson is trapped in a loveless marriage and wants her husband, Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) killed off so she can claim the insurance money.  This wonderful plot in Double Indemnity has many twists and turns in it.  There are so many obstacles for Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson to overcome.  They have to time everything just right and this keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There are so many moments in the film where you think the whole scheme is about to collapse.  Neff and Dietrichson are such witty characters that they seem to have the right thing to say or do at the right time.  Until the end of the story there never seems to be a crack in the plan.  Neff is even surprised how good the plan is working out.  After they have committed the murder, Lola Dietrichson, (Jean Heather) Mr. Dietrichson's daughter, becomes attached to Neff.  At the very end of the movie Neff finds out what Phyllis Dietrichson's real plan is and tried to put a stop to it.  You will have to watch the movie to find out how they both end up.  I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages.  The film really kept me on the edge of my seat the entire second half.  I cannot think of any other film noir made in the nineteen forties with such a good story line.  This is one film noir you can't miss.
