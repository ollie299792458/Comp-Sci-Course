For those of us who played little league baseball, we can most certainly relate.  One reviewer said, "little league a little too serious", but that is not true.  For there are moments that relate perfectly with my childhood experiences.  In my youth, I remember countless accounts of belligerent parents, drunken parents, parents who were would-be coaches, abusive parents, terrible coaches, and best yet, terrible sportsmanship on the part of the kids.  Some may say, this is a terrible example of youth league, but the true is, this is how it is.  In fact, when compared to reality, the reality was--is--much worse.

Please, do not be alarmed.  For through my memories of sadness, hardship, and pain, I do not regret any of it.  In the midst of all the madness, we still managed to have fun.  It was a great time and a great part of my youth.  Likewise, this move is a great family movie.  For it does not dare put a silver lining over our television sets, but rather, it shows the true reality of youth sports.  In the end, we have a great family film and one that we can relate to.

Yours Truly,

Mike
