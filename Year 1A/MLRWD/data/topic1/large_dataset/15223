This isn't a "gay film" as much as it is a compelling and touching story of two men who find each other in a difficult period of transition. I guess that technically makes it a gay film, but it's so much more. This movie could be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. It's an instant classic and is one of the best, most romantic films I've seen.

I happen to really enjoy this movie and have watched it several times since it came out. The cinematography is excellent and shows the beauty that can be found in the "wrong side of the tracks", as well as how naturally gorgeous Southern California actually is.

I really enjoyed the acting and wasn't, the combination of the writing, acting, direction and camera work gives this film a very honest feel. You can tell that everyone involved really cared about the script. All of the actors are great, but both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe shine in this production - they are both very talented and charming actors and I honestly hope that we see more from the both of them in the future.

While there are things about the ending of the movie that feel a bit contrived, the sweetness of how it unfolds really outshines any criticism I have.

It's definitely worth checking out.
