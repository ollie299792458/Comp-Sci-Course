The Living Daylights is my favorite Bond film. In this adventure, James Bond becomes the pawn in a Russian defector's plot and finds himself in the middle of an international arms and drug smuggling ring.
In the opening  sequence, we see Bond parachuting, dive tackling a fleeing jeep (then  fighting with a KGB assassin in the jeep), and finishing him off in a  mid-air explosion over the water.  
Bond is on assignment to aid and  protect a Russian defector (a KGB agent, who ultimately double crosses  Bond).  Bond meets up with the KGB agent's girlfriend traveling from  Czechoslovakia, through Austria, to Morocco, and Afghanistan.  And in the  end, of course, the good guy wins.  Add to this some romance (with just one  girl, for a change), probably the best music score, great action, beautiful  cinematography, and you've got a great James Bond story.
TLD has all the  right ingredients and chemistry between actors.  But what makes this story  line believable is a credit to a superb performance on the part of Timothy  Dalton.  This guy is believable and looks like a professional killer.
TLD  was filmed in Morocco, Gibraltar, Austria, England, USA, EuroDisney, and  Pinewood Studios.
The Living Daylights is a sleeper, probably because T.  Dalton is not as well known as S. Connery, R. Moore, or P. Brosnan.  TLD  is definitely a crowd pleaser - I highly recommend it!
