This is my favorite movie of all time.  We owned a vhs copy recorded from televison and just recently my husband was shopping around and found a DVD copy for me and I was surprised how much the television cut out of it, the dvd also has an alternant ending.  I have watched it so many times my husband now loves it.  A wonderful movie that never leaves the neighborhood.  Staring Tom Hanks as Ray Peterson, Carrie Fisher as Carol, Bruce Dern as Mark Rumsfield (my favorite), Wendy Schall as Bonnie, Rick Ducommun as Art Winegardner, and Cory Feldman as Ricky Buttler.  I was reading all the quote lines and would like to add some not previously listed:
*carol says: "he cant come out until he resembles that man that I married", Art:"carol, we don't have that kind of time!"
*"I'm going over the fence and i'm not coming back til I find a dead body"
*"thats one thing about these cul de sacs, only one way in and the people are kinda strange"
*"Art's got a Gun!"
*"What is that infered night vision..."
*"smells like they're cookin a godd*mn cat over there"
*"they keep a horse in the basement"
*"A femor just happens to be a human thigh bone, you think this came off some kind of chicken"
*"I've never seen that before, they drive their trash out to the street and bang the h*ll out of it with a stick"
*"Hey Pinoccio where do you think your going"
*"I think we flushed em out,Rumsfield and I, we wrote a note and slipped it under the door we rang the bell then we ran"
Well I could keep going and going, love this movie.  Definately reccomend at least watching it once, but to catch all the lines I suggest multiple viewings.
