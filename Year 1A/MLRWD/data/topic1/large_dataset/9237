I have seen the original many times and was intriuged with the choices of who was chosen for the roles. And I wasn't dissapointed!
Depp sings with a passion and has a gravel that gives him an edge and feeling that is hard to put a finger on. Carter had a sad and more desperate sound to her singing that Angela did.
In fact the whole musical movie was filmed with a more serious note than the original was acted.
I prefer Toby, Anthony, and Johanna in the movie a hundred times over the acted version. Anthony in the play had this stupid grin on his face almost the whole play. He is entirely stupid in the play. Toby also seems dumbed down in the play, and I actually like Burton cutting off the last minutes from the play, with Toby going mad. And Johanna in the movie seems more trapped than the Johanna in the play. In the play she feels clingy and shrill.
The only thing that I do prefer in the play to the movie is Hearn's singing. I said that Depp's performance it good- it is. But Hearn's deep voice is hypnotic and powerful. That is the one thing that Depp lacks.
All in all, this movie is a wonderful adaptation to the play, and I will watch it more than the original.
