VIDEO QUALITY:
The release contains 2 films on one disc - on Side A 1994's "Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla", and on Side B 1995's "Godzilla vs. Destroyer" (using the title "Godzilla vs. Destoryah" since "Destroyer" can't be copyrighted). Both sides were pretty even when it came to video quality. I'll start with the positive which is, unlike Sony's previous attempt with "Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah/Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth", that the disc presents the films in their original 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, and features anamorphic enhancement. Sadly however, both films, especially "Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla", contain a heavy amount of grain and print damage, and a fair bit of artifacting too. There was also a lot of discolouration and brightness issues too. You've gained one thing, but lost another.
AUDIO QUALITY:
One very basic setup, Toho's international English dubbing in Dolby 2.0. Like Sony's previous release, it generally sounds pretty good, with no distortion or other issues. It would have been nice to see a new 5.1 remix or the original Japanese soundtrack, but alas.
EXTRA FEATURES:
Absolutely nothing, unfortunately.
OVERALL:
For everything Sony did right with "Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah/Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth" they did wrong with this, and vice versa. This release has the bonus of being in anamorphic widescreen, but looses extra features and the vivid image quality the previous release had. It's a simple  barebones disc for those that want the film on DVD, but perfectionists will really need to look elsewhere.
