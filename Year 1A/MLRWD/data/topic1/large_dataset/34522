I watched it in cinema and felt like this has one of the greatest screenplays for years, and the performance of the characters are brilliant. The only thing though is that I felt the movie is not completed and there is something missing, not at the ending, but rather something in the process. But that was the feeling before I watched the Bluray version with the deleted scenes, especially the last two sequences. They actually push the movie to something fantastic, and make the story whole and quite arty. The whole story took place in the troubled time, and everything around was casted in a grey sad colour. But at the end it was" family" support, warm, comfort and encourage everybody to get through. But what did Ryan get from all these experience or anything changed to his philosophy and his life?  How Nat dealt with the suicide case, would she be in law pursuit trouble? The answer seems to be there, but the movie just did say enough leaving the characters less fullness. The two deleted scenes gave me complete satisfaction on everything. Their running times are every long and in HD quality, well edited. It seems it's just because  they need to fit the movie to the cinema rules, so they have to cut the two deleted scenes down, and I'm sure in later DVD and Bluray, there will be the director's extended cut to show the movie as it should be. If you like this movie, make sure you get to watch those deleted scenes, you will be surprised!
