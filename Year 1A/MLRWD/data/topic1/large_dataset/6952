This is one of the most popular films of the 1960's and one of the most beloved movie musicals of all time.  Originating on Broadway with a score and soundtrack by the famed songwriting partnership of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, the composer and lyricist created hit Broadway songs such as "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria," "The Sound of Music," "Sixteen Going On Seventeen," "So Long, Farewell," "Do-Re-Mi," "Edelweiss," and "My Favorite Things."

The accompanying story was one of the great musical plots, and therefore this well-balanced musical marks somewhat of a shift from musicals which focused less on plot and more on music to those which have a strong plot in addition to strong music.

The musical received film treatment in 1965, with Julie Andrews tapped to play the part of Maria.  Mr. Georg Van Trapp is played by Christopher Plummer, who performs a delicate rendition of "Edelweiss," a beautiful ballad about his Austrian homeland, which is in the process of being seized by the Nazis.  The onscreen chemistry between the Maria and Georg develops throughout the film, as political pressure builds around them, similar to the plot of the 1942 film "Casablanca".

"The Sound Of Music" takes place in WWII Austria while the country was on the verge of Nazi occupation.  The Van Trapp family, especially the strict father Georg Van Trapp, must wrestle with the upcoming political realities of living in a country at odds with the family's freedom-loving ideals.  The Nazi army wants Georg to join the Nazi occupation as a military officer, but Georg holds his ground and openly shows his contempt for the Nazis.

As dramatic as it is playful, "The Sound of Music" is one of the essential musicals in Broadway and movie-musical history.
