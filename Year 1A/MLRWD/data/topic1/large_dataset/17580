The Black Sox Scandal. Ponzi Schemes. Prohibition and the Volstead Act. Gangsters getting rich selling alcohol while the government flounders and politicians lie, cheat and steal to ensure that the alcohol keeps flowing.

Is this series a version of the Sopranos for the 1920s? In some ways, maybe it is, but in other ways it holds its own. Steve Buscemi plays Enoch "Nucky" Thompson who is the County Treasurer for Atlantic City, but he also controls the alcohol flow in and out of the city and controls politicians from the lowest alderman to the highest judges and senators in the land.

The show is just outstanding in every way. From the plot(s), the characters, the acting, the dialogue and the setting. It is very obvious that some serious research went into each episode with true life characters and events tangled into the midst of various plots each week. The roaring 1920s and the speculative economy (much like ours today as we live on the edge of credit and financial ruin) are played out beautifully in this series. The Internal Revenue Agents who desperately try to tie Nucky Thompson to the illegal distribution of alcohol to the average worker on the Boardwalk trying to survive are all tangled in a great series and I cannot wait until I watch Season 2 of this fantastic show.
