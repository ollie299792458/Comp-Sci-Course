I find that the true measure of depth for a movie is evident in its' projected empathy. If you're looking for a touchy-feel good movie this definitely is not it. Bitter Moon emphasizes the worst in humanity and provokes a guttural disgust for the characters played by Peter Coyote and Emmanuel Seigner. Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas represent the pawnish almost innocent characters within Oscar and Mimi's sadistic game of emotional chess.

I would never identify this movie as a "Black Comedy" but more of an erotic drama dealing with the dark side of the human libido. You're drawn into the relationship of Oscar and Mimi as outsiders listening to the story of their life. Along with Hugh Grant's character, you listen to their story ...from the inception of their lusty affair to their tortured life where the only reason that they exist as a married couple is in a vain attempt to limit their damage to the rest of humanity. Two people bonded together in a never ending battle to inflict torture upon the other...where everyone else is pawns and collateral damage. The content is definitely not for kids and not for the timid.

If you enjoyed Glen Close and John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaison's or the War of the Roses, then this is a film for you! With one of the best endings I've seen in a film dating back to the early 90's...I doubt you'll be disappointed.
