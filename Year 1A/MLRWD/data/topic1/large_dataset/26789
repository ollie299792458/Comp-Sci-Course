It was during the second season where things came into play that would effect the series.  The mention and eventual appearence of the Dominion, the Maquis, Winn becomes Kai, continuing conflicts with the Cardassians.  
Highlights:
Rules of Acquisition:  This was a really funny episode with the first look at a female Ferengi, and the first mention of the Dominion.
Rivals:  THis was entertaining even if it was not overly popular.
The Maquis Part I and II:  A two parter about a Terrorist organization working against the Cardassians.  Sisko fights a dear friend and is at loggerheads with Dukat.
The Wire:  A really good Garak Show.  Talks about Garak's back story including his days in the Obsidian order, his relationship to Enabran Tain, and his exile
Crossover:  DS9 revisits the classic parallel universe.  Humans are subservient and Kira is evil.  This was a dark and yet a very entertaining episode.
THe Jem Hadar:  The seeds of conflict are sewn here. Sisko is taken prisoner by the Dominion and the crew has to get him back.  While this is not when the war starts, this is where it is declared.  The fact that the Dominion destroys a Galaxy class ship shows how powerful they are.
