Let me begin by saying that I have immense respect for the talent of Robert Downey Jr. and normally his presence can rescue any film. That being said, it is unfortunate that Due Date weighs him down to the point that "rescue" is not possible. This film is a recycled Trains, Planes and Automobiles which sadly lacks the charm so associated with the famed John Candy, Steve Martin classic. Due Date has a disease - poor writing combined with absence of heart. Its not all that funny and the lead characters in general are so unappealing that I found it hard to root for either of them.

There are other unfavorable reviews here reflecting that the reviewers do not subscribe to this type of comedy (The Hangover, Harold and Kumar, Bridesmaids) but I am not one of those. I usually enjoy a good "gonzo" picture as long as the laughs/writing is there to back up the crude antics of the players. Due Date just didn't succeed in this arena or in any other.

Final Analysis... In the end Due Date fails to do its job as a comedy: deliver laughs.
