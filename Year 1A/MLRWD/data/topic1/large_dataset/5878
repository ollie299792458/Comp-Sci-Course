Before I watched this movie I didnt really no if Indians were either the good or the bad.  But as teh filmed reached its peak  I finally learned the answer.  The movie by far again its the greatest ive ever seen even compared to the movies of my generation.  It has a beautiful script that no one should miss.  I thought it was going to be a very boring movie but it is not.  I was very surprised at the end of the movie and how it ended.  Its also very sad and a great way to teach anybody about native americans and how much they suffered since the movie shows that.  I dont want to kill how the movie is but it all starts with the protagonist John dealing with the flaws of soceity and how some white americans were destructive againts this great human beings the native Americans.  It then shows the bad and good sides of how some people were with the native americans.  John who matures as his odyssey goes through learns alot from the Indian people and is accepted by the Sioux people who care for him sicne they name him Dances with Wolves.  You the reader would have to know why.  I dont want to kill the movie anymore.  So watch it and try to understand the history part of it cause its very important.  Hope this helped.  Thanks for reading it.
