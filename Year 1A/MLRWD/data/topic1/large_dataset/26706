In 230 BCE, King Yinzheng of Qin (Ch'in) launched a series of wars of conquest against the six other major states of China, which over the course of the next 9 years would unify China with Yinzheng as the first Qin emperor - Shi(h) Huang (Ti). By 206/07 BCE, the empire would collapse under a peasant revolt aganist the Emperor - who had standardized a number of aspects of China and rebuilt and strengthend the Great Wall, but was seen as a tyrant who overtaxed and overworked the people. It is against this backdrop that Hero takes place.

The movie begins with Jet Li's character "the Nameless One" welcomed into the palace of the king having recently dispatched three of the greatest assassins from the Zhao(Chao)province to make attempts on Yinzheng's life. His audience with the king provides the frame story for which most of the movie is told in flashback. Kept 100 paces from the king for security, the Nameless One recounts his defeats of each assassin in turn, and with each recounting is allowed to come closer to the throne of the king.

Within the flashbacks we see lots of wonderous Jet Li wire-fu, full of sword, spear, kick and leaping action. Each flashback makes use of a different vibrant color theme: black for the frame story, then orange, red, blue, white and green. Loose fabric from the wide sleaves and long robes of the combatants flutter and drape with beauty during the fight scenes. The Chinese landscape too plays a dominant role shifting from lush mountain valleys to desert, to autumn woods. With a possible nod from the Matrix, cg animation of leaves and arrows add to the fairy tale aspect of the film, which feels more like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" than "Iron Monkey"
