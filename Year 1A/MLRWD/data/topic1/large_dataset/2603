I remember seeing the previous trailer for this movie and it peaked absolutely no interest. Then one day I happen to be very bored channel surfing and happened to leave it on Cinemax by chance. This movie had just started and i glimpsed through the first 15 minutes doing chores around the house. After those fifteen minutes I was sitting watching every second. This is one of those Gems that failed to get traction with the broad American audience.

The stylized future setting, action scenes were top notch and the social commentary going to an extreme level of relevant issues facing this country in regards to health care. Though an extreme level, a level that can certainly be achieved given the current political winds. It struck me that Arizona has already lost several dozen people as they were cut off from funding for their transplants. Also stunning is how HMO's can become even more powerful corporations with plans to turn healthcare exclusively to the private sector which could very well go to this extreme.

If you don't find interest in the social ramifications and relevance of todays isues, at the very least you will enjoy the action sequences and truly awesome soundtrack. Highly recommend this GEM. Can't believe I let this one slip away from me.
