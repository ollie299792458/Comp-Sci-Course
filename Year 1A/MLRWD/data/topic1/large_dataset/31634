Shows the twin towers of the World Trade Center from many different viewpoints at various times between 8:46am, when the first plane hit WTC1, the North tower, and 10:28am, when that tower collapsed.  (Actually, it shows a few minutes after that, too, as pedestrians flee the giant clouds of pulverized concrete.)

Some viewpoints are labelled with distance and direction from the towers, but many more are without labels, which can be confusing when scenes shift abruptly.

Some images are accompanied by audio which exactly meshes with the video, often with voices of witnesses actually at the scene, along with what can be heard from a radio or television broadcast in the background.  Other segments may have been recorded as video only, to which audio from other sources has been added.

Between the Introduction (1) and the Credits (28) are entry points labelled (2) thru (27) with times presented in hh:mm:ss:?? am format, where hh, mm, and ss can be recognized as hour, minute, and second, and I am guessing that the final ?? field could be frame number, since its tens digits show up only as 0, 1, or 2, and its units digits go by too fast for me to match up properly with the tens digits.

The beginning of the collapse of the South tower can be viewed near the end of segment 17 (9:55:50:12 am), and the collapse of the North tower at the beginning of segment 25 (10:28:12:03 am).
