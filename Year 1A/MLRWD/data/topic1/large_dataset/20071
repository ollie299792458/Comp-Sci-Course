Although I am very happy that In This Our Life is finally out on DVD, I felt the other selections were rather banal choices. Why did they have to put Watch On The Rhine in this set? A very tedious talky sactimonius piece of WWII propaganda, which is not even a Davis vehicle.  All This and Heaven Too although a box office success in it's day, is rather long and overdrawn. Why not have included Dangerous and Beyond The Forest in this set? Some out there may turn their noses up at the thought of these two films being included in a Bette Davis boxed set--indeed, even Davis admitted to hating these films--but her performances still hold up today, and would have made a good juxtiposition between the young Davis spitfire persona and her latter day turn at a no-holds barred middle-aged vixen. I wonder who puts these packages together??? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OX7DA">The Bette Davis Collection, Vol. 3 (The Old Maid / All This, And Heaven Too / The Great Lie / In This Our Life / Watch on the Rhine / Deception)</a>
