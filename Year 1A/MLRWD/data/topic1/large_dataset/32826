This third James Bond set contains some very entertaining Bond films that each have an essence of their own. From Russia With Love ranks as one of the best movies of the series. Both Diamonds are Forever and You Only Live Twice are each fun films, though each does have a tendancy to drag in some parts. These two were the beginning of some of the comic book aspects of the series that were to come in the seventies. Nontheless, these last two Connery Bonds were so substantial that even today the Austin Powers films have borrowed liberally from each.
Octopussy is one of the best films of the Roger Moore era. It is superb in all respects. A View to a Kill is at best a spotty film, but it does provide a healthy dose of dry wit and memorable performances (specifically from Patrick Macnee, who shares a great chemistry with Moore in his too few moments on screen). 
The Living Daylights also showes a harder-edged Bond that harkens back to the Fleming novels and the first film the the set, From Russia With Love. All in all, a very successful and distinct performance from Timothy Dalton.
These movies are all very distinct, and show varying interpretations of the character and reflect the time period in which each film was made. This set is highly recommended.
