Kevin Costner plays a drunk and negligent father (daughter played by the talented Madeline Carroll) who finds that his vote that was not registered controls the outcome of a presidential election. Well, it was actually his daughter who tried to vote for him, but a mishap caused it to not be recorded.

I won't explain the details of the movie, other than to confirm some of the complaints below that yes, Kevin Costner portrays a drunk and irresponsible father for basically the entire movie. But this portrayal of Bud is essential to the theme of the story. This film exposes the arbitrariness of democracy. It shows how one moron who can't even take care of himself and is totally bereft of the issues, who has no political knowledge or understanding of our republican form of government, and who knows nothing of the checks and balances supposedly built in to our system of self-governance (nor do the presidential candidates played by Kelsey Grammer-R and Dennis Hopper-D), controls the political destiny of the world's richest and most powerful nation. Now, extrapolate this story line so that instead of just one person controlling the political leadership of our country, it includes the median voter. This movie explains why we end up with the government we do. In the end, the median voter is not much different than Bud Johnson. See Bryan Caplan's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691138737">The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (New Edition)</a>.

It's not a great movie, and the acting is only so-so (other than the performance by Madeline Carroll), but it accomplishes pretty well what it sets out to do, which is to make the point that electing political leaders through majority rule is arbitrary and may be no more worthy of our respect than drawing names randomly out of a hat.
