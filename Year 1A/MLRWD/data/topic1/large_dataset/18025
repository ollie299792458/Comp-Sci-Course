  This film really surprised me.  I was expecting a good movie with good cinematography, good music and a good story.  Well, 'Water' was all of those things.  But it turned out to be so much more in a way that you really need to see for yourself.
  Well, the cinamatography and music are not just good - they are fabulous.  The cast, made up of actors I had never even heard of (besides John Abraham, a popular Bollywood actor)act wonderfully and are all perfect for this film.  Aside from perhaps 'Rang de Basanti' I have never seen such a talented ensemble cast in an Indian film.  I was especially moved by the beautiful Lisa Ray's performance as Kalyani.
  The only criticism I have for this movie (and this is nitpicking here) is what I felt was lack of screentime for Seema Biswas, who plays Shakuntala.  Other reviewers on here praise her performance as the good-hearted and conflicted widow.  I agree that she is excellent in her role, especially in the final scene, but I feel more time could have been put into developing her character.
  Finally, if you are someone who is easily affected by a movie (as I am), expect to need a few days of emotional recovery after watching 'Water'.  It is an exquisitely crafted film, but heartbreaking.
