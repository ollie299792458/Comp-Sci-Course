The desire to see the end of the story started in the first installment (which was decent) is pretty natural. So, there is practically no way to avoid yet another idiotic sequel. This time nothing makes sense at all, but you will know the ending.

After watching all three movies in the series the most amazing part is that Sweden is presented as a police state with openly corrupt legal system. According to these movies Sweden is populated by morons, whose ineptitude is the only thing saving them from sliding into full totalitarianism.

Just an example: there is lot of intrigue going around the desire to avoid public exposure during a trial, however, it did not occur to the corrupt prosecutor that the easiest way out is to drop the charges.

It is indicative to the overall content of the movies that jails look like the best place to be in Sweden: comfortable and quiet with friendly staff gently pushing for healthy life style.

The court proceedings are real shock: mentally incapacitated person could be tried for murder, accused has to testify against self, prosecution witness can lie with impunity and the prosecutor does not seem even a little bit concerned that he could be disbarred if he made opposing attorney angry enough.

I suppose Mr.Assange can easily avoid extradition to Sweden by showing trial scenes as evidence in British court.
