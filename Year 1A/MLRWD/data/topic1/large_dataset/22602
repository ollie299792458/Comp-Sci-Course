I saw this movie when I was just 16 in 1974.  It made a big impression on me then - that such a big, exciting movie could even be made.  Now - in 2009 - we get the first hi-def home video version of this film on Blu-ray disc.  Let me just say - Fox did a great job!  The detail is all there - along with the brilliant 70s colors (check out Fred Astaire's taxi near the beginning for super solid yellow), and, of course, the great John Williams score.  All of the extras from the DVD special edition have been ported over as well.  Fans of this movie should be ecstatic with this new edition.

Sure, the movie is dated, somewhat overlong, and the acting a bit wooden - but as shear spectacle (and 70s kitsch) - it kept this viewer interested.  Another thing that is very refreshing - real models for the special effects work.  Some of these models were built 70 feet high in order to ensure realism.  If this movie were remade today - I'm afraid it would suffer from overuse of CGI effects (such as in the recent _Poseidon_.)

One other note - the opening menu on the Blu-ray disc is not to be missed.  Someone worked really hard on creating a menu that honors the film.  Let the disc spin up naturally without clicking ahead.  A very nice touch.
