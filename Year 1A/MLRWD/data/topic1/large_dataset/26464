I love this movie! My favorite thing about B&B is that no matter how dumb they get,the writing is always very intelligent...a point that is overlooked far too often.Of course fun is the main factor when watching B&B,and no,it shouldn't be taken seriously,but I hate when these snobbish yuppie types get on their high-horses and dismiss it as unintelligent,because it is everything but that! Major gripes aside,let's get down to business.I'm not gonna reveal any details about the movie,for those of you who havn't seen it yet.All I'm gonna say is that it's absolutely HILARIOUS,and very well-written...crude and low-brow of course,but that's the whole point! The show was literaly the official show of my childhood (it started when I was 8,and ended  only months before I turned 13),and the movie is everything the show was,and then some.So,if you like crude but intelligent humor,and you're prepared to laugh your gluteus maximus off,then by all means check out "Beavis and Butt-head Do America".Oh,by the way,my review title is taken from one of Beavis's lines (and I didn't misspell "dam"...you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). -Peace-
