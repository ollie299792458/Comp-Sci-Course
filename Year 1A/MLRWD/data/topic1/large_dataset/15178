I bought this blu-ray of Predator half because it came with a free ticket to see Predators in theatres in summer of 2010.  At the time, my home setup was just on a large 720p display and a PS3 player.  Long story short, I watched the movie, and was blown away by how awesome the movie looked!  Crystal clear picture as far as I was concerned.  I expected something less than perfect from a movie filmed before there even was "HD".  Granted, I don't have a world class setup....just a "real world" setup...the kind of setup an average Joe would have on a budget.  For a movie decades old, I was stunned by the picture quality and the awesome surround sound.  Until this time, the only times I had seen this movie was on VHS and on a standard definition 4:3 TV.

As far as I am concerned, for the average movie watcher, this is the definitive version of Predator to get.  For the rest of you, keep in mind at one point, you all swore that LASERDISC was the end all and be all of home theatre...and we know how that worked out.
