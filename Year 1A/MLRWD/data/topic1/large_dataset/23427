It seems that I'm kind of like the rest of the reviewers, that I caught the movie by-chance while flipping through the channels. I was scanning the channel guide on T.V. a week ago and seen nothing else worth watching and I decided to turn on TBN. Although the channel guide said that the show "Praise the Lord" was on, I knew from previous times that they sometimes play a movie during that time-slot. Now, usually I find a movie that sparks my interest but I become easily tired or bored with it and turn it off within an hour. Not with "A Perfect Stranger."

I caught the movie just when He introduced himself as Jesus to Nikki. I was rivetted to my seat from that point forward. The long extensive dialog that took place really captured my interest. I can see how people like Nikki would ask those exact questions. I found the answers compelling, realistic, and things that Jesus might say.

This movie seems to have no specific dogma attached to it, so I imagine it will offend some denominations or certain Christians, but I do pray that this film can be used to bring people to Christ and to strengthen faith of believers. I know it did mine. I'm not a Bible scholar, but I am a born-again, spiritually thirsty Christian who likes to take in possibilities.

I can't put my finger on it but there is something missing in this movie so I only give it four stars. Maybe it's just not exciting enough for my tastes, but I will recommend this movie for Christians and non-Christians alike... especially non-Christians. The theme to this movie is Jn 3:16. I just purchased this DVD myself. I'm so looking forward to it.
