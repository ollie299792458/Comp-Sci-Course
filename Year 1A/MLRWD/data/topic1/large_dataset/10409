I just recently bought this dvd set, and it's about time these movies were released on dvd--For years the only option to get these were either laserdisc,vhs tape, or bootlegs dvds on ebay.
 "Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman"-What can you say--who needs a budget?
What worst than a women scorned ?-How about a 50 foot woman scorned!!--  I remember watching this on Chiller Theatre(here in NY on WPIX 11) on Saturday nights when I was a kid, and it still hold up.- The special effects are hilariously bad, but that's part of the charm.
 "Queen Of Outer Space",Starring Zsa Zsa Gabor(Dahling), and written by Charles Beaumont as a spoof--but the director, and some of the actors don't seem to be aware of that-they play it straight.
 "The Giant Behemoth"-- kind of a slow moving picture about dumping radioactive materials at sea disturbing a giant prehistoric sea creature.
 The set offers good prints and features commentary by Yvette Vickers & Tom Weaver-film historian-(on Attack),Laurie Mitchell & Tom Weaver(on Queen) and Dennis Muren and Phil Tippett(special effects gurus) on Giant.
 The only minor drawback is that they could have put these dvds into slimcases and taken up 1/2 of the space.
