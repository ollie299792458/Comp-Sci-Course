Reshoots and delayed release dates are usually indicative of cinematic disaster. That is not the case for "Factory Girl."

This an amazing cinematic experience. Both a compelling look at the beginnings of celebrity culture and the highly personal story of a sad, lonely young woman at the center of a maelstrom beyond her control, "Factory Girl" is excellent.

Leads Sienna Miller (whose off-screen infamy sadly tends to outshadow her on-screen work) and Guy Pearce are very well-cast as Edie Sedgwick and Andy Warhol. The ostensible muse and poseur artist are a match made in hell, each feeding off the other until one is eaten alive by fame.

This is a rich, detailed film worthy of repeated viewings. With the exceptions of Hayden Christensen (especially disappointing considering his award-worthy work in "Shattered Glass") and Jimmy Fallon (is it possible to be less than one-dimensional? If so, Fallon has the secret), the casting could not have been better. Artful use of different film stocks helps to set the scene. The attention to detail pays enormous dividends as a powerful emotional story unfolds.

DVD extras are magnificent: an insightful biography of the real-life Edie includes commentary from dozens of survivors, Guy Pearce's video diary is an enlightening look behind the scenes, and Sienna Miller's audition tape is remarkable for the mere hint it offers of her superb work in the finished film.

For younger audiences, it's a fascinating look into the beginnings of the days when fame first became its own reward. For those who remember the 1960's, it's a pitch-perfect flashback.
