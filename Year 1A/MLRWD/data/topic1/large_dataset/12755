High Noon, the greatest Western of all times?  Please?  The plot is ludicrous.  An entire town quivering behind closed doors in the Old West.  Hardly.  Every family in that era had a rifle, shotgun, and pistols and  were more than willing to use them. Remember Coffeyville, Kansas, and the  Dalton Brothers--now those Dalton boys were a true criminal crew.  Unlike  these pansy-thugs who arrive in town to murder Cooper and who fail  miserably in their attempt.  In the Old West these props-for-criminals  would have been shot down (bushwacked) in quick order by the good citizens.  America then, and the Old West, had plenty of guns and were willing to use  them. In this film, the town should have turned their armaments on Cooper  (who acted as if he were already dead), Tex Ritter who sounded as if he  were dying during his hideous singing, and the  casting director who  selected Cooper, worn out and depleted, as the geezer who would plunder the  breathtaking Grace Kelly (no wonder she left the country), and any of the  other cast who participated in this ordeal.
