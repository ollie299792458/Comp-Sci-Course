Anyone who has been lost in Japan can appreciate this movie - bewilderment about the the world around you, not understanding what people are saying, frustration with the strict Japanese way... It captures that aspect of being a foreigner in a strange land really well. It was a bit contrived, and if you thought about what was happening too deeply you would probably not enjoy it, but it was cute. I thought it really helped to understand Japanese (especially the Osaka-dialect), as you can only get so much meaning from subtitles. But even without any understanding of Japanese, you can still get through the movie and appreciate it.

I wasn't familiar with Brittany Murphy before watching the movie, but she did well playing the ignorant foreigner who insists on breaking through the Japanese barriers. The chef, Toshiyuki Nishida, played the domineering Japanese male to a T. (Yes, it's a stereotype, but there are a lot of grains of truth to the rigidity of older Japanese males and how they expect things to be.) Her blind drive to succeed at something, combined with his inflexible views on how things should be done, drive the movie. Again, if you watch it in the most innocent frame of mind as possible, it's cute. If you are prone to picking apart a movie's faults, you'll probably move on quickly. Appreciate it for what it is - a cute movie about a girl trying to succeed against highly unlikely odds, and learning about herself along the way.

As a sidenote, I found it funny that Thane Camus got credit for his appearance, when his entire role was speaking in Japanese next to Brittany for a few seconds at her office. Funny guy, best known for his English role on Karakuri TV, but unless you paid attention really, really closely you would have missed him.
