I'm not big on reviewing movie quality as it is so subjective and with 350 other reviews there isn't much to add.  However This film quickly founds its place at the top of my collection.

The pacing and storytelling is very similar to Shyamalan films.  I was very tempted to be bored in the beginning of the film but quickly found the pacing and scenes of alleged insignificance were actually doing quite well at building a very dramatic plotline.

It doesn't hurt that the cast is stellar and they all work together very well.

The Blu-Ray quality is superb.  I have watched on a 24, 47, and 40 inch LCD and every pixel is simply a masterpiece.

This movie won't be for everyone.  Its a slow moving story that is finally fulfilled only in the very end, but once you arrive there it is well worth the journey.

The violence and some content is a little rough for younger viewers as the story is about a corrupt and devastated society that is literally fighting in a survival of the fittest scenario.  Throw in a few people that will do anything to make a play for power and you get some disturbing images that may turn a few stomachs.

The blu-ray features are decent and the price was extremely favorable when I bought this movie.  If you like a good story, even this post apocalyptic setting can provide a plot that most people will be pleasantly surprised by.
