Dirk Schafer may have once been Playgirl's Man of the Year, but he certainly won't win any prizes for his directing style!  This movie is bad from start to finish.  The story line, if that's what you want to call it is banal and predictable.  The dialogue is weak at best, and the acting, or lack there of, is deplorable.  
What do you get when you take a small town cop and plunk him in the middle of the circuit scene in Southern Cal pumped up on steroids and tweaked out on 'K'?  Let's watch as his life spiral downward, while his supposedly good friends take a back seat and watch without intervention.  Mix this with a touch of HIV+, a homeless woman he dated when he thought he liked girls...whoops...a ditzy DJ, a long-time relationship gone bad, Circuit parties, gorgeous studs galore, narcissism and a ghetto fabulous trailer in the hills.  This should give you something tasty.  Unfortunately this movie leaves you with a [$$$] recipe for disaster!
There are so many 'queer' movies worth owning.  Don't waste your money on this one.  I gave it 2 stars solely for one of the coolest soundtracks around, and the eye candy.  But let's face it, if it's eye candy you're looking for, just head to your local A&F.  It's free, and the [$$$] you saved from not buying this movie will get you a fabulous sweater!
