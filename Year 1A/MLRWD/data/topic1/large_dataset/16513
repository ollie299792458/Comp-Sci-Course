Robin Williams in perhaps the single most vicious, despicable, and possibly the very funniest role of his entire career. Edward Norton as a soy-dog devouring "bottle of pancake syrup with legs". Danny Devito as a low-down greaseball. Okay, two surprises and one standard role. All three shine in this Devito-directed self-proclaimed 'black comedy', which has sparked protests from parents nationwide. Why? Don't ask me. Despite the R rating in the US and the equivalent rating of AA (Adult Accompaniment) in Canada, there actually seem to be some twits out there who will take their kids to see this simply because kiddie shows happen to be the subject material. Therefore, I will warn you now: THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE. That said, it's a hilarious satire of the world of children's television and a very satisfying parody of Barney the Dinosaur. (At last!) It's also just a thoroughly enjoyable story that only gets better the second time. It has a bumper crop of corrupt, nasty villains, including the gravel-voiced Harvey Fierstein. It has enough platitudes and slipped-in health tips from Norton's free-spirited character to make anybody sick. It even has a costumed Elvis Stojko doing what he does best-- figure skating. In other words, this is one movie I may not let my kids see, but I'll be staying up late to watch it myself again and again.
