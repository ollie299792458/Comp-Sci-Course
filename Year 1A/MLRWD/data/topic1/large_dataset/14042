I would much rather have seen a release of the original Batman cartoons from the late 1960s. I really enjoyed the original cartoons from the 60s & was looking forward to the new series with Adam West & Burt Ward when it was announced in 1977. However, just as Scooby Doo jumped the shark with the arrival of Scrappy, the Dynamic Duo had to be saddled with the equally annoying Batmite, a multidimensional imp from the same "universe" as Superman's Mr.Mxtlplyk (however it was spelled). In addition, the action was toned down for the kid-friendly 70s. While nowhere near the level of violence in today's animated fare, West & Ward's live action show & the 60s Batman cartoons were brutal compared to the watered-down superhero cartoons of the 70s. So a note to whoever's in charge of putting these cartoons out--please make the original 60s Batman cartoons available for those of us that enjoyed them & would like to share them with their kids--as well as ALL of the 60s Superman cartoons & the Superboy cartoons that were part of THAT show. I was a disappointed to learn the SUPERMAN set being released at the same time as this set will NOT contain all the Superman cartoons produced for the 60s series, NOR will it contain the Superboy/Krypto cartoons also featured in the show.
