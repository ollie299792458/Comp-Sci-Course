[Wolf Creek is loosely based off the Outback Killer, who is said to have killed a bunch of hitchhikers and backpackers in Australia.]  Three friends are driving through Australia on a road trip and stop to see the worlds largest meteor crater at Wolfe Creek.  When they return to their car it is dead and their watches have also stopped.  Along comes Mick Taylor, a seemingly nice guy who offers to help them out(This seems so cliche but it's really not.)  So without giving too much of the story away, they take this guys help and wind up fighting for their lives.

Wolf Creek was probably the best horror film to come out in a while.  I'm a horror buff; I can watch any of them and be entertained.  Every so often though, I watch a movie that is flat out scary and done perfectly.  That is Wolf Creek.

The begining is all about character build up which you NEVER see in horror movies nowadays.  Everyone wants immediate action: more gory and less story. That's why some people I've conversed with about this movie said they didn't like it because the opening dragged.  I really think it was important though, you really got to like the characters.

Secondly, I love that there is little to no music and when there is music it is subtle.  It doesn't really guide or warn you; you don't know whether Mick Taylor is about to jump out or not.  Instead, you just feel nervous and scared the whole time.  Which is awesome.

Third, I loved the visual shots.  It added this prodigious characteristic to Australia.  It made it seem large and endless yet empty and capable of engulfing everyone inside.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that Australia was almost a character itself in the movie; a villian.

Lastly, the acting was great.

I really recommend this movie for anyone that loves horror films and has been long awaiting a really good one.
