This is the first negative review I have ever put up on amazon but when you consider the tremendous acting talent, source material and the excellent first installment of this series it is truly an achievement to come up with such a boring, unfunny movie as Be Cool.

When watching this film I get the feeling that any other director would have done so much better.

Gray seems to have no concept at all of pacing or flow.  Scenes drag on way too long (i.e. the Linda Moon/Aerosmith song..did we REALLY have to see the entire song..how about just a snippet),  unfunny recurring jokes (russian guy getting punched in the eye) are employed and great actors like Harvey Keitel are completely underutilized.]

The Vince Vaughn and Rock characters are unfunny and cringe inducing and Linda Moon's singing is so generic sounding that it is hard to believe that she would ever get a second look much less play on stage with Aerosmith.

If this film reflects Gray's vision then he is  truly a shallow and uninteresting person.

Lousy movie
