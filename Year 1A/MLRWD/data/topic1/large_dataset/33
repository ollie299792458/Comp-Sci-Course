I recommend that those who love historic based novels purchase not just this set - but the entire set (sets 1 through 5). You may piece-meal it in as we have done or purchase the whole set here on Amazon. The entire story takes you from the dark days in 39 through VE day in Britain. Each set contains four stories revolving around a mystery with WWII on the British home front as often the cause as not the cause of the mystery. Foyle is a man of principal, who does not think any injustice is insignificant. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he must accept to outcome, and sometimes it is a delayed victory.

Michael Kitchen has the starring role as Christopher Foyle, a detective chief superintendent in the English town of Hastings. Michael Kitchen always portrays Christopher Foyle with a reserved wit. The story's setting is true to the era. In spite of Foyle's strong desire to join the war as a combatant, he is chosen to squelch conflict, prejudice, malice, and greed the war brings to this small English community.

Regulars include Anthony Howell, Honeysuckle Weeks, and Julian Ovenden as Foyle's son Andrew (who joins the war as a British fighter pilot) - they exceed in doing an excellent job of support - and help to make the story cohesive.
