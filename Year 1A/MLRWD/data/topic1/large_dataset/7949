Having heard all the hoopla surrounding this film, I was fairly eager to see it, so when my father-in-law gave it to me for Christmas, I didn't waste much time.
I was pretty disappointed, though.  The title character, who I guess we are all supposed to see as a sharp, tough woman, seemed to me little more than someone with such a chip on her shoulder she was bowing under the weight.  Her law partner (who was excellently played by Albert Finney) was nothing but kind to her, and she was constantly accusing him of trying to cheat her or of going behind her back.  He gave her a car, for Heaven's sake, and she was still treating him like the enemy.  Her refusal to dress professionally wasn't funny, either..it was an indication to me that she was a person who was determined to be rude to others.
Since seeing the film, I have read more about Ms. Brockovitch and discovered that the story in the film is only half of the truth anyway.  Many people in the town she "saved" found that their settlements were much smaller than the settlements of people who were particular "buddies" of Erin's..not to mention the fact that the chemical everyone in the film was so upset about is certainly present in Erin's cigarettes in far greater concentration than it was in the water, and that that particular chemical has STILL never been proven to do damage to people.
An interesting film, I guess, but certainly not one I have a desire to see again.
