When this movie came out when I was in my early teens, as pathetic as it may seem, it really helped me through some tough times. I would listen to the soundtrack over and over and think of living out my dreams just like the silly Muppets. When I was older and the VHS came out I was so happy. And now I could get all the jokes! That is when I really began to see the genius of Jim Henson. He never talked down to the kids and his writing could appeal to adults as well. Many of the reviewers talk about the subtlety of the lines like "gone with the Schwinn", but I've always loved Kermit encountering James Coburn outside the bar. And then meeting Madeline Kahn (always the best) who tries to pick him up, with Telly Savalas threatening him. When Kermit says that people getting warts from frogs is "a myth, a myth", here come Carol Kane; "Yes?". There isn't a kid who would pick up on that, but watch it at twenty-two and your spitting your drink out. Whenever I'm down I know I can pop in my Muppet Movie, sing along with all the songs and feel after it is all over, I can accomplish anything again. Now that is what I think Jim Henson wanted all along. Oh yes, Steve Martin is the best waiter in the world.
