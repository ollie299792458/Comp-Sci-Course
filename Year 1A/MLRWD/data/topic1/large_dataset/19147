A Series of Unfortunate Events is about three children, Violet, Claus, and baby Sunny and their journey after they lose their parents and home in a fire.  Guardians must be appointed to care for the children; the underlying plot of the movie is the three children bouncing from unusual relative to unusual relative.  The first guardian they wind up with is the sinister Count Olaf; he's after the enormous fortune the children possess and will stop at nothing to get it.

This movie was beautifully done.  The sets especially are incredible.  While watching the movie, the sets reminded me of some of the darker video game worlds..."Myst" came to mind.

The story itself was enjoyably done.  The characters are unforgettable...Violet's inventions, Claus' knowledge of the arcane and mundane, and Sunny's...well...umm...bite.  Also, Jim Carrey's Count Olaf is, if nothing else, amusing.  How true he, or anyone else, hold to the characters in the books, I do not know, I have yet to read them, but am greatly anticipating opening their pages quite soon.

The biggest gripe I have with this movie is that an underlying plotline is not brought to fruition.  I found that kind of annoying.  When I entered the movie, I did not know that their were so many Lemony Snicket books out there (I checked after the movie...11, so far) and that we would have to wait for a sequel?? -- or read the books -- to get the answers to some of the questions presented in Unfortunate Events.

Overall, I rather enjoyed this movie, look forward to any sequels that may be made, and certainly look forward to reading the books.  Despite two or three creepy/scary scenes, I would recommend this movie to kids of all ages.
