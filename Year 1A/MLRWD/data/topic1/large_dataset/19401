The Saint is an amazing adventure with a true heart and soul. My wife and I watch it several times a year and it always captivates us. Unlike the Hollywood schlock of late the Saint truly delivers thrills and adventures with a soul and emotion, something missing in the films of today. I traveled through out eastern Europe quite alot in the time period portrayed in this film and can say that it is bristling with true accuracy and atmosphere.

This is by far one of my favorite films. This film brings me back to some personal grand adventures a decade ago. The music is great, the cinematography is phenomenal, and of course there are two endings !!

Yes the Saint has an alternate ending in which Simon Templar fights Tretiak's son to the death in the Tretiak mansion as the Russian military launches a full on attack onto the manor with tanks. A spectacular ending I saw in a European version. Hope to God that Philip Noyce will grace us diehard fans of this wonderful film with a deluxe DVD. I would pay $100.00 for that.

THE SAINT IS A TRUE CLASS ACT !!!  Val Kilmer is a genius and Elisabeth Shue is a world class charming cutie
