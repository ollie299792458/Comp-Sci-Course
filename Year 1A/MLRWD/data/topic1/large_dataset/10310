Perhaps I've been ruined by experiencing Paris, Je T'aime (the original film this was based off of) but this film did not seem to pop. Individually, the pieces of the entire film should add up to create a good film seeing as the acting was well done and the individual story lines were all quite unique. Even still, with all the little pieces separately, the movie was just ok. The one thing that has brought me back again and again to Paris, Je T'aime is the feeling of utter adoration for Paris every single time after watching that film. Every moment was filled out with an underlying and common love for their eternal city. At times in New York, I Love You, I almost forgot the city they were in or the ultimate purpose for making the film. It didn't leave me wanting to go to New York or thinking something spectacular of the city I know so well. It did not elevate New York as a home as Paris, Je T'aime did. So, perhaps if I hadn't seen Paris Je T'aime first, my opinion wouldn't be so strong but I have been tainted by brilliance that provoked the making of this film and unfortunately this film did not live up to its originator.
