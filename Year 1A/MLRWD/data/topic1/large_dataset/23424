Truth be told, I saw End of Eva before I saw the series.
And as I am writing this, I've still only seen 8 episodes of the series, including the highly contreversial "ending". 
End of Eva still doesn't make as much sense to me as it probably does to many, but it still awes me every time I watch it (which is often... still waiting for my Evangelion boxed set to arrive in the mail ^_^). It's simply brilliant! I love an anime series that makes you think, and after the disappointing ending to the series, is a welcomed addition to the Eva series (pun intended). I was actually a fan of the ending of the series, I thought that Shinji's contemplation was clever and while not providing the closure that End of Eva provided in a sense, was still good.
I would definitly not recommend End of Eva to the kiddies, o'course, when I watched it I let out my share of "ews" and "oh my gods". But one thing that shocks me is that some people in their reviews stated that End of Evangelion was poor because it of its cryptic nature and all the questions it surfaces, not to mention its less-than-clear ending. I have but one thing to say to this- if you were looking for something that ties up all loose ends and gives you a positive ending, then why did you watch Evangelion in the first place?
For a series like Evangelion, the possibilities are infinite! After all, isn't one of the many on-going themes of Evangelion that life is what you percieve it to be? End of Eva provides no less, and no more. ^_^ 
A must-see, that is for sure. Now excuse me while I go watch it once more...
