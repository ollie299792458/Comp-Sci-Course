I consider WInds of War and it's sequel, War and Remembrance, as one giant series, which is why I put the "?" in my review title.  My family bought this for me for my birthday.  Great story, although the pacing needed to be worked on a bit as some episodes are all romantic soap opera and the next episode will be full of action and war drama.

I gave the Remembrance a four star rating mostly for content.  The video quality is questionable and the audio is a mixed bag.  On a big screen TV like I have the video is fuzzy and the colors very muted.  Looks like it was taken from a VHS master and not redone for DVD.  The audio is the most interesting thing to me.  The first set is in stereo and I can run it through my surround processor and the voices are in the middle track and the music and audio effects are in the two front channels.  On the second set of discs, called the Final Chapter, if I run it through the surround processor, everything comes out of the center speaker.  Just seems like they didn't process the audio the same on the different sets.

Overall, still enjoy it and am happy to have the set.
