"Father of Invention" has a plot you have seen a hundred times.  I get the idea that the film was also trying to be a comedy, but I did not laugh at all.  However, the dramatic elements worked and I was able to enjoy the film simply for the characters.  The cast is full of very talented actors who give good performances, and this is the main reason why I would recommend watching the film.

This is just the second feature film from writer/director Trent Cooper, and I was impressed by how he handled the material and the cast - even if he didn't bring anything new to the table.  This movie was certainly an improvement over Cooper's first film... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FSME3S">Larry the Cable Guy - Health Inspector</a>

For some reason, this movie did not have a wide theatrical release.  But it is on par or better than a lot of the films I've seen in theaters recently.  Hopefully it will find an audience on DVD, because I think it is worth watching - particularly if you are a fan of Kevin Spacey.
