Geraldine McEwen is a wonderful actor and is certainly very good in this role, but this series plainly does not have

the charm nor the atmosphere of the Joan Hickson versions.

The Marple character here does not seem as well integrated into the stories as was the case in the

Hickson versions.  McEwen plays Marple with more of a modern day "edge" and

absence of warmth,  which I suppose is designed to

appeal to MTV generation viewers of today's more explicit procedural crime dramas.  This

lends a subtle "false- modern" quality to the period Marple stories, which are much better served

by a more neutral style of  acting and presentation, such as was done in the --yes, you guessed it!-- the JOAN HICKSON versions.

The McEwen series is not bad, it has just lost so much of the charm and whimsey which added so much to

the previous Hickson programs, and made them such an absolute joy to watch.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that the newer series is the one to get simply because it is newer!!

If you are a fan of Geraldine McEwen, you will want to see her work here, which is certainly good (as always).

There's no question she is a brilliant actor.  ---BUT if  you are a Christie fan, or a Marple fan, or just

like a good mystery story, you would be MUCH better served to buy the three available JOAN HICKSON sets

while they are still available.

JOAN HICKSON'S achievement as the overall "best" Miss Marple remains UNTOUCHED.
