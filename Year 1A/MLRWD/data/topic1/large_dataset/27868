Who is this guy? I could not sleep one night in early April 011 flipping through the channels to Palladia. I could not turn the volume up much,my wife was sleeping.Seeing two drummers and this guy in sun glasses,dressed nice, playing a guitar and singing like I have not seen for a long time.I wrote his name down and in the next day or two went to Amazon and could not belive all of the 4-5 star ratings on all of the CD's and DVD's.I think then I ordered a couple of his older CD's first. Buy the time they came,I found his web site and of course some videos.Listened to CD's and buy that time I had ordered this DVD.I grew up in the 60's and was exposed to [of course] the Beatles at age 12.My oldest brother collected records from mid 50's and 60's. From the Beatles, the British Invasion,Black Sabbath,Led Zeppelin, Santana,Ozzy Osbourne and other super groups in the early 70's and beyond,and of course SRV, I have a wide musicial appetite for true talent.I will also throw in Hank Williams and Jr, Buddy Holly and several others of the late 50's.The first night my wife and I were going to watch the DVD,she says "I do not like that kind of music" {the blues}. Well, after she wanted to watch it the next night,she said "I have never seen anyone play a guitar like that".Now,after understanding more of the lyrics this is all she wants to listen to or watch on DVD. Joe Bonamassa is a true talent and I get excited listening to and telling other people about his music and DVD's.I guess I too have also been under a rock the past few years. Please note this DVD will spoil you because Joe's vocals and band are at the top,giving 125%.A lot of reveiws about the Joe's live performances being better that the stuido recordings? I may agree. Maybe, Joe is still being that 'LITTLE HAM' he refers to at his first performance with B.B.King.
