While some of the acting in this story is at times a little awkward, the  story and heart of this modern classic shine through at all times. This  flick has stood the test of time and is one of Rob Reiner's best films and  one of the best Stephen King adaptations.
River Phonenix, Wil Wheaton,  Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell bring the characters to vivid life and  are all touching in their own way as they all learn a little of life and  themselves on their odyssey to claim the dead body of a dead kid their own  age who's been hit by a train.
Poignant observations on things that shape  our character while growing up, such as alienation, stereotypes, and  friendship give this affecting but funny story a sentimental and familiar  flavor that can take anyone back to their youth.
While perhaps a little  sappy at times, the syrup somehow works. 
The DVD also has an excellent  documentary interview with Reiner, King, Wheaton, Feldman, and O'Connell  reflecting on the making of the movie. 
A fine collection to anyone's  library.
