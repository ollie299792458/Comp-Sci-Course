After all the dross produced in the name of the post-Lock Stock British gangster film industry at last a good movie has been made: Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast. (The only other exceptions would be Gangster No.1 and Guy Ritchie's own highly Lock Stock-esque Snatch). 
From the brilliant opening scene to the last Sexy Beast is littered with masterful surrealistic touches. Although Ray Winstone gives a career best performance as Gary - the retired gangster who just wants to be left alone in his utopian Mediterranean idyll, it is true Ben Kingsley somewhat steals the show. As Don he is as hilarious as he is terrifying. In a unique performance which owes nothing De Niro or Pesci or indeed anything I've seen him play before (certainly a far cry from Gandhi!) Kingsley illuminates every scene he is in as a monster of cockney menace. British TV star Ian McShane is also convincingly malevolent as the ambidextrous Teddy Bass and James Fox also shines in a fleeting appearance.
Unlike so many British directors Glazer is genuinely cinematic - using the screen to the full, particularly in the opening sequence. He is certainly a talent to watch even if Sexy Beast made less of a splash commercially than hoped.
One quibble - like Grosse Point Blank and Boston Kickout, Sexy Beast is lumbered with an inappropriate and poorly chosen name. But don't be put off - if you want a Brit gangster flick in the spirit of Get Carter or The Long Good Friday then this is for you.
