The only bad thing I can say is that on the dvd release there is a line missing that was on the vhs, and that line just happen's to be one of my favorite's.

Hawkeye: My father warned me about you...
Cora Munro: [interupting] Your Father?
Hawkeye: Chingachgook, he warned me about people like you.
Cora Munro: Oh, did he?
Hawkeye: He said "Do not try to understand them".
Cora Munro: What?
Hawkeye: Yes, and, "do not try to make them understand you. That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense".

There may be a few other thing's that were cut, but when I got the dvd that is what I noticed. It says a lot about the movie that the lowest review it recieved was mainly because this line was cut out of the dvd.

You can feel the wildness, the savageness of the country they travel through. You can almost feel the fire on your face, the straps of rawhide cutting into your wrist's, and the damp air of the cave survivor's hide in waiting to be found or passed by. The only certainty that you have is that no one is exempt from death as you wait to see who survive's. The love story is there, definitely, but it's not the focus of the story. A revenge seeking native, attacking french force (that have bigger gun's and more of them), and rebeling colonials lead the watcher to a satisfying end. It takes you through the entire range of emotion's, leaving an ache in your heart, but a smile on your face. Loved it.
