When I first saw this movie at 11 years, words could not describe the emotions I felt.  The Neverending Story has been my favorite ever since, even at 25.  It is magical. I still get goosebumps every time I see the  movie.  The soundtrack is wonderful, such beautifull music. You can almost  imagine yourself there with Bastian and Atreju.  I am an adult and proud to  say that this movie inspires me and it always will!  I love to read,  especially fantasy novels.  If you like to leave it all behind and go some  place wonderful just follow Bastian as he reads his story.  Bastian is a  young boy having a hard time dealing with the death of his mother and also  a father who insists he grow up much to fast.  He reads The Neverending  Story, which is about a boy warrior, Atreju.  Atreju is on a quest to find  a way to stop the Nothing, a horrible thing which is eating up Fantasia.  The warrior must travel thousands of miles and meet many enchanting friends  along the way.  As Atreju goes on this quest Bastian discovers that he is  living vicariously through Atreju and that this story, this quest is all  meant to reach him.  Bastian realizes he is a very important part and that  he alone can save Fantasia. He learns that his dreams and imagination are  all part of life and are a necessity. Without our imagination we are all in  a sad existence and easily controlled because we have no drive, no  inspiration.  Watch it, keep and open mind and heart and you will see that  you are also a part of The Neverending Story.
