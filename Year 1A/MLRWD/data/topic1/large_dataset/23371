You did not see this movie on any critic's top ten year end lists but it deserves to be on them. This movie will surely attain cult like status and be enjoyed long after the overrated films from 2001 have evaporated. I should mention 2001 was a very good year for movies to boot so Not Another Teen Comedy is in good company.
For sure it parodies and pokes and probes countless high school comedies from the recent and somewhat distant past. Spotting the influences would take too much time. But this cross pollination works for several reasons. Yeh the humor is broad but it is telling comedy. This flick and its over the top antics nails the high school culture experience right on the nose. The anxieties, futlities and clique horrors are all explored with wit and panache.
The cast is uniformally excellent as everyone embraces their "stereotype" with gusto. Mia Kirshner and Jamie Pressley are incredible in this film. Cudos to the director Gallen for keeping everything in perspective and percolating.
This movie just feels right from the start. Always in sync, Not Another Teen Movie, perhaps because of the R rating, raises the bar a notch in the teen comedy genre. This allows the director to push the envelope-particularly with Kirsner's character-but also allows breathing room and tension release for audiences who fully understand the awkward, dark, restless and flat out wierd experience that is high school. The lusts and thwarted desires are all in evidence here in spades.
And the Grease like musical moment before the prom is pure joy.
What a debut for Gallen.
This is simply the best high school comedy I've seen in ages and ranks amoung the best.
Enjoy.
