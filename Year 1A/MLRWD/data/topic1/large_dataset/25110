This is where the series began to veer off course. After Batman Returns
failed to make the ridiculous amount Warner Bros. hoped it would (it actually did very well), the studio blamed Burton for making it too
dark and violent for the little kiddies. They wanted a lighter Batman that was more family friendy (doesn't that sound stupid?) Well, this is what you get: Cheesy dialogue, sets that are too bright anf flashy for OZ, and a Director who values eye candy (if you can even call it that) over plot. So why did I give this film 4 stars? Two reasons: Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. The movie is worth seeing for their performances. Also, Chris O Donell is a decent Robin, but I think that story (like most of the Batman saga) will be handled better once they get to it in the current Dark Kmight saga. Warner Bros. got lucky here. There's something worth watching in this film. Unfortunately, the next installment didn't have any redeeming qualities that could save it, and thus Batman died....until 2005, when a much more talented Director showed the world what a Batman movie should be.
