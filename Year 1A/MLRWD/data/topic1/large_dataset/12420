DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is a very well-made, atmospheric, creepy, disturbing, & effective horror film. What makes this movie very unlike what Lucio Fulci makes is that it relies more on suspense, characterization, & disturbing realism other than blood & gore that which he is noted for.
In a small Italian village, young boys are being murdered. Who is responsible for these horrific crimes?
Probably one of the first of its kind of films that deal with the grim reality of serial murder (along with Fritz Lang's M & Ulli Lommell's THE TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES). And when the revelation of the murderer is is truly astonishing & shocking for its time when it was released.
The Anchor Bay video transfer is crisp & bright. They did a marvellous job of bringing this well-made giallo on video the quality is just marvellous. 
Barbara Bouchet is mesmerizing as the town tease. Nuff said!
If you're a horror film fan, you won't be disappointed with this classic, yet almost forgotten outing from one of the masters of Italian horror, Lucio Fulci.
