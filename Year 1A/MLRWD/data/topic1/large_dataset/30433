First up, the people who have given away the ending out of spite ought to be ashamed.Who the hell do you think you are?I have reported these posts and I am glad I didn't read them before seeing the movie.

I enjoyed the suspense of this movie about a deeply disturbed child.

"Boy, this kid's got some SERIOUS problems."I kept thinking but then I would think to myself, "..or does she?"

Who is Charlie?Is he really an imaginary friend?Has little Emily truly gone completely around the bend, as it seems?Or is she simply traumatised over her mother's death and nothing more, not crazy at all but covering for someone who is.

(I sure felt sorry for her anyway)

I do wonder ,though, when Dakota is going to start starring in ...I don't know, some nice Disney movies..:)...Light, fluffy stuff more suited to a 10 year old!!!!!!lol.

She's very talented though and I see her as a new Drew Barrymore..(I mean in terms of talent and future success, not drugs!!)

Obviously, this isn't the greatest, most superb thriller out there.I know this because it is so widely hated.But ,again, a good mystery to watch for a couple hours.
