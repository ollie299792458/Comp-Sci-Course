When I first saw this movie I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I thought 'Oh great, here we go, another boring American western.' But it wasn't boring at all. I loved the whole dynamic of Garrett's character selling out yet still trying to hold on to that last piece of his past with Billy. It really feels he's having a constant battle inside his head about what to do. James Coburn had it down with this role, as he usually does. His portrayal of Garrett is amazing to watch. He takes no crap and likes his drink and his women. Billy's character, played by the great Kris Kristofferson, is at war with himself also, whether he should run to Mexico to escape Garrett's impending capture or stay and confront him. The whole movie is really centered around their relationship yet still has that feel of lost freedom, coming from the new government people trying to take over all the land. The movie has a good pace and a legendary score from Bob Dillon, who is in the movie as well. If you get the 2-Disc Special Edition then you get the 2 versions of the film which is a real treat, and some cool extras. I'm not sure how accurate the story follows what actually happened in real life but either way this is a great movie. If your on the fence about getting this, get it and enjoy if you like classic Westerns or are just interested in the story of Billy the Kid. Sam Peckinpah made a real gem with this one, as most of his stuff is.
