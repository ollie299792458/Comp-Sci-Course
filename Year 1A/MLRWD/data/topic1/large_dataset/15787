I knew about this film since 2001. I was looking forward to it just reading a synopsis of it on the Back to the Future website. I was awaiting a trailer sometime in 2002, but it never came. Over time I had forgotten about it. Until the fall of 2003 when I discovered that "Interstate 60" was going straight to DVD. Now I am not gonna lie, I use to think that movies that went straight to video were not good enough for the big screen. However, after watching the movie I could now see the "black hearts and red spades" that I was conditioned not to see. Interstate 60 was not meant for a wide release. It was put here for people to find, not for "Interstate 60" to find them. Sure I could write a detailed review of the movie. But all the words and all the details could not draw this one of a kind classic film. There's a reason why this film gets mostly fantastic reviews. And the reason is that each of those people found something, or connected with the film. Just like the characters in the movie did. I can honestly say that "Interstate 60" is a movie that could motivate, and even inspire someone to achieve whatever's in their heart.
