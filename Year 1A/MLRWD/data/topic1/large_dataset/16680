Ok, so the advent of remakes is on it's way and where it
ends, who can say? If you grew up with William Castle,
lived through the Slasher movies and find yourself stagger-
ing through the over-indulgent CGI-effects movies and wonder
where the good old creepy feeling went...well, 13 Ghost gets
ya closer than most.
The CGI effect are masterfully blending with existing sets
and you'll find it hard to tell where it ends or begins.
The whole aspect of the house was unique and it is a 'must
see' just for the house itself. My only gripe is the
line-up of the Ghost, I really dug the Jackel and thought
that he was a lot more threatening than the Heavy Metal
Spike-Head, and the Lurch/serial killer-Juggernaut...but
my favorite was the Beauty with the knife...She needs to
be seen, and is pretty creepy. The Gore is a little too
high, but at least the CGI was'nt there to replace the
attitude!
