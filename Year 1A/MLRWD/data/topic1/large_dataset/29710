Bad dubbing is how I can sum it up for the main thing that made this movie not so good. There are three things that go into zombie movies: makeup/fx, screenplay & T&A. If you can pull off only two of those you will have a decent zombie flick. I think bad dubbing killed the screenplay & it did have some T&A  but, it is not long & does not fit well with the events of the movie. At the tribal village the lady goes in nude & in minutes she is back in her normal clothes (I find that totally unrealistic). I believe that she should have stayed that way either the rest of the movie or at least until they left the village.(Return of the Living Dead pulled that off well) Also, her grass "skirt" looked more like a pair of underwear made out of leaves. Either full nude or a real grass skirt would have been better. Other than that the makeup & fx was fair at best (I do realize that it is an old movie with a limited budget). The gore was really good but, makeup & the scene at the end where the girl gets killed is horrible.

The movie itself was not that bad & I actually enjoyed it but, it would not be on any top ten list I would ever have.
