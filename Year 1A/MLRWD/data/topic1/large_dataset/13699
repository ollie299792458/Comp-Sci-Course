First thing that I want to warn you about, this IS an Adam Sandler film. There is no mistaking the jokes and the supporting actors in this film and the film is truly Sandler. If you don't like Sandler films, run, because this film is not for you no matter how much you might like Jack Nicholson. That being said, it is one of the best Sandler films I have seen. Nicholson is hilarious and fits in to a Sandler comedy simply because he is a great actor. He does elevate Sandler and everyone in this film.
There are some great cameos in this film, several are very short and I can not hint at them without giving away the joke. I will say that Heather Graham was hilarious. There were great unexpected scenes that made me almost pee in my pants.
I only gave this film 4 out of 5 due to the corny and slightly predictable ending. Sandler was funny. Jack was roll-on-the-floor-choking-on-your-popcorn funny.
Warning! It is a Sandler type film don't expect sophisticated plot lines, expect potty humor.
