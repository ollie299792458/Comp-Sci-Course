This was an exceptionally beautiful and thought provoking movie, which I shall always carry with me.  You are exposed to a difficult way of life with many hardships, which force you to have to make choices to survive which change the characters forever.  I decided this was a very worthwhile movie, after reading Roger Ebert's review.  The movie is true and based upon a book.  The acting was exceptional by the main characters.  You could feel Lei's pain and confusion in Viet Nam, and America.  Her expectations with her new husband, Tommy Lee' Jones, who I feel is always flawless, in his acting ability, was more shocking and disappointing,(to her) I think than usual, because she understandably expected so much.  She was also torn between Buddism and Christianity which was a huge factor in the movie.  The concepts of both religions are so opposite and she tried so hard to meet his expectations, which was impossible.  He sank into such a deep depression, he was beyond help and the consequences were tragic and heart moving.  The entire movie, gave you so much to think about and understand an entire different culture, if you are American.  I definitely have to watch this movie one or two more times as I only viewed it once and there is so much to absorb.  I never realized Viet Nam was such a beautiful country before all the wars.  I was totally ignorant of the history, which was overwhelming.  I think pain and helplessness was a part of the theme along with heartache and finally some sort of acceptance and peace.  She was a very strong, and determined woman.  She fought to find salvation.  This movie is a must see, and as I stated, I must watch it a couple more times.  Maybe, I should have reviewed later on.  I feel my  thought,  even after one viewing, will change one's understanding of war, loss,  culture ,terror, fear, love and acceptance.
