My Big Fat Greek Wedding is an awesome movie. There are plenty of laughs throughout it and it is great for the whole family to watch. Every character has their own unique personality and ways. The father, Gus, is always teaching other people things about the Greeks and he is always talking about things that they did. The grandmother still thinks the war is going on and sometimes gets a  little out of control. But the main character,Toula, is  a young women who is always being pressured by her father to get married before she gets too old.  When she does find the right guy, her father is ready to disapprove because he is not Greek. I am not going to spoil the ending of the movie, but I want you to know that you will enjoy it.
 It is great especially for people who have very large families. You can watch the movie over and over again, and it is always brings a smile to your face. I love to learn about people of other cultures and different traditions that they have. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did and I hope my review was helpful.
