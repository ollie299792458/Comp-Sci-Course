It's never a good thing when you're laughing midway through a horror movie...There was alot of predictability in the story - which seemed liked it had been a preteen horror book or an extension on one of those urban legend short stories for preteens. The idea has been done in other movies and even on t.v shows. A group of children die in a mining accident in the early 1900's and wander the now deserted forest up in the hills at night as little zombies with axes. A mother and her two daughters move in after inheriting their dead father's family house. I could have done without the beginning back story on the miner kids and how it all began - that's what finding newspaper articles is for... Of the two daughters, one is about 7, and very devoid of personality. Scout Taylor-Compton is the teenage sister, the best thing in this long movie. The family never stops to wonder why they are the only people on the hill besides a crazy woodsman, why everyone else lives in the town below them. In a Hide & Seek ripoff idea, the young daughter goes out to play with invisible friends and disappears. People start to die, farm animals disappear...
This movie has to have the lamest killers EVER seen. They attack robotically with their little pick-axes and the first image in my head is of the 7 dwarves gone mad. This is the part that inspires laughter. Now be very glad you only rented this and you never have to see it again.
