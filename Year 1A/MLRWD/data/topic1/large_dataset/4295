I don't know what is up with the bad reviews I have read here but do yourself a favor and IGNORE THEM!  This film was so funny that I actually had to turn it off about half way through because I was going to get sick from laughing so hard!

Perhaps people don't understand this movie because it is a brilliant mix of Mel Brook's comedy combined with (dare I say it) great musicals of the 1940's.  This movie is indeed a full scale musical and I can't help but think that many people just don't accept this form of entertainment on the big screen anymore.

The story is great, the singing and dancing is fantastic, and the visual aspect of the picture is astounding.  You can't help but think that you are sitting in your living room watching a Broadway Musical!  The "Springtime For Hitler" number alone is worth the entire cost of the DVD.

The original "Producers" is one of my favorite films and unlike many, I don't feel like they compromised it in any way.  This is simply a much different adaptation and should not be compared to the original.

I would also like to say that the cast could not have been better.  Every performance was excellent.  Buy this film, and

you may find yourself watching it over and over...and LAUGHING

UNTIL IT HURTS!
