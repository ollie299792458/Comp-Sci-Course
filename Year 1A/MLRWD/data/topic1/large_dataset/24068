I bought this movie for my girlfriend last christmas as we had went to see the orphanage earlier in the year and both really enjoyed it.

Then there was this film...

As the film started I was quite sucked in and interested, expecting a relatively eerie movie with a strong original plot.

How wrong I was!

As i mentioned, this film starts off quite interesting with a young boy being sent to an orphanage for boys. The kids share stories about a kid who used to live there and say he dissapeared and that he's apparently a ghost etc etc...Story goes on to reveal one of the carers is a bad guy etc blah blah blah

It's just not interesting enough to go on really. Some silly pointless story elements and overall, a long winded movie.

When you SEE the ghost-boy, it's just not as horrifying or intense as it is in the orphanage. It reveals too much too soon!

My girlfriend hated it, I pretty much hated it, and we will be trading it into blockbuster very soon I'm sure (and that's once we fish it out of the back of her wardrobe where it now resides!)

If your looking for a way to bore yourself to tears then this would be a pretty good place to start with it.

I gave it two stars because the sets are quite nice...that's its only real redeeming feature.
