Strange Brew - What a superb title for this movie.
Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas created a classic when they did this movie. They play the part of two brothers whose sole purpose in life is to drink beers and get loaded eh. The first scene is them on the planet after a nuclear war and trying to capture fuzzy headed mutants. The movie reel breaks and the real movie starts. The real movie starts off with them trying to get free beers by putting a mouse in a bottle and are told to take it to the brewery. To get past the receptionist the have to bribe her with their last Jelly. They are offered jobs at the brewery and while wandering around they slowly start to uncover a evil scheme by Brewmeister Smith (played by Max Von Sydow) to take over the world by adding a chemical their beloved Elsinore Beer. The chemical when coupled with certain musical tones will make people who drink the beer fall under some sort of spell and do what is asked of them.

Bob and Doug eventually save the day and get a lifetime supply of beer with the help of their flying dog Hosehead.

The movie is so thick with cheese that its funny. They don't make movies like this anymore and that's a shame.

As a side note: I used to watch this movie with my roommates quite often in college after a night out on the town. Of course, we always had drinking rules to the movie. Every time they say "You hoser!" or "eh" we had to drink. This is not for the faint of heart as you can drink a 6 pack pretty quickly in the first 15 minutes of the movie.

Simply put - Take off the Great White North you hosers and enjoy a classic film about beer.
