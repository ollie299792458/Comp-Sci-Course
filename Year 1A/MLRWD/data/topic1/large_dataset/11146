I was anxiously waiting to see the video of Bewitched since I hadn't been able to see the movie when it was in the Theater.  I was however a little taken back by the bad reviews it had received and couldn't understand how such star power of Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell along with Michael Caine and the rest of this cast could make something that would be so panned.  But after seeing this movie I now understand.  What a mess.  It wasn't the actors that made this a mess but the director and whoever put this together.  Nothing made sense.  They introduce the fact that Iris (Shirley Mclean) is a witch and then never follow through or even confirm it except for one line from Uncle Arthur.  They never explain how a supposed character from the original show (Uncle Arthur) shows up in real life.  They introduce Aunt Clara, but when Isabelle reverses time she never shows back up??  Was Aunt Clara like Uncle Arthur and a character from the original show that comes to life???  I doen't even really think this movie deserved 1 star...but this system doesn't give the option of no stars.  Do yourself a favor....Save your money and don't buy this movie....buy the second season of the original show and enjoy a classic.
