I had high hopes for this one, but was prepared to be let down considering the absolutely awful sequels that I have seen from great movies (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, American Pie 2 and Dumb and Dumberer) which was a prequel, I know, but you get the idea. They have a tendency to try and capture the magic of the first one, but end up making a parody of it instead by recycling the jokes and hoping for the best. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! It captured the same, utter ridiculousness from the first movie, but made a completely fresh and funny two hours. The beginning was a bit slow, but once it got going, I laughed until the end. If you liked the first one, I think you'll love this one too. NOTE TO THE WRITERS: If you cant resist the urge or the money to make "Harold and Kumar Get Married" that's great, I would love to see one more Harold and Kumar movie, but please, take your time and do it right and don't pull an X-Men 3 or Spiderman 3 on me and waste everyone's time.
