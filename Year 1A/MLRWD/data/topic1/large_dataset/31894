Overall, I was very impressed with this movie.

Pros:

-Excellent Plot

-Good editting (nothing seems to be missing and there isn't significant "filler")

-Good dialogue

-Excellent action (but not overdone)

-Great car chase scene

-Not much gore (there is violence, but not what I would describe as graphic

-The price is right (check out used, too)

-The movie balanced the plot, action, and the characters very well

Cons (none about the movie itself):

-This movie hasn't had influence on people the way it should -- nuclear weapons are not secured as carefully as they should be in Russia and a modification of this movie is actually possible. Also check out &lt;www.lastbestchance.org> for another movie on nuclear terrorism (it is free from the Nuclear Threat Initiative).

I would highly recommending either buying or renting this movie. At the price, it seems worth it just to buy it in case you want to watch it one more time (and then your two rental fees would be equal to the cost of the movie itself).
