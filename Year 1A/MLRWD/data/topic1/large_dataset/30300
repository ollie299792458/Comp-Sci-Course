This is one of the best made animated movies of all time. First off, the animation is amazing. It alone is reason to see this film. More importantly, it is an inspiring story regardless of your religious background (those worried about seeing a 90 minute propaganda film need not fear,) and is very respectful of the history and cultures it deals with.
I was most impressed by how accurately Egypt was portrayed (the middle eastern people in it actually have dark skin!) The film's creators really did their homework in making 19th dynasty Egypt and its surrounding tribes come to life. The use of traditional Jewish tunes in the music is a nice example of this.
Finally, this story makes the characters in Exodus very likeable and human. There is great character development and moral dilemmas. There are also no "cutesy" sidekicks or silly songs in this movie; the story is treated seriously which I appreciated greatly as well.
Besides the absence of cutesyness, the film is quite graphic in its depictions of slavery and death, so very small children might not like it, but I encourage all older children and adults to watch it, it is a wonderful film.
