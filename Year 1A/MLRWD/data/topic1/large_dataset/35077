I did not care much for many of the other reviews on this film.  I watched "Mulberry Street" and "Borderland" and, personally, I thought this film blew them both away.
  Michael Madsen's part had been described as too small.  I agree that his part should have been larger; however, his acting ability made that part live as, perhaps, only he can do, with the character having an evil, yet carefree air to it.
  I love "End of the World" movies and the reason for this one was very interesting (I won't give it away as some did).
  Sure there were some screwy parts as well as some parts of the movie that flopped a bit.  But, as a suspense thriller horror film, I found it kept my attention for most of the film (therefore, the 4 rating instead of 5".  The film explained itself well and it was not an impossible setting; not one of those films that you had to "forget" some parts in order for it to be realistic.  This one could happen.
  I think I loved it best because, in the tradition of "Aliens", it has a woman as the heroine as well as a little girl.  To make it even better, there was a woman as the head of the baddies.  The battle scenes were well-done and the film did not have to have the women running around in skimpy little outfits (not that that is a bad thing) to keep the viewer's attention.  There were few really stupid lines and enough good dialogue to keep the film intelligent.  If you like well-done, low-budget films, then this one is a must-see.
