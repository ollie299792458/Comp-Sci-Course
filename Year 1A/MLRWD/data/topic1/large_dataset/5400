Here is a recent review of Barton's work which I think applies to all of which he publishes to achieve his "mission".

"Well the worst is this fellow from Texas named David Barton, who has written a book about original intent in which he has gone through and falsely combed the founding fathers to get their most Christian sayings and compiled them in this book, out of context to the exclusion of their broader way of seeing the world, and saying, see - they were all Christians and ... Jefferson was a Christian, and Madison was a Christian, and Franklin was a Christian, and do you know what?  He is just plain wrong and a fraud."

This from a recent podcast of Clay Jenkinson, one of the first winners of the nation's highest award in the humanities, the Charles Frankel Prize.  See wikipedia or other sources for information about Jenkinson.  There one can also find ample review of Barton's work from numerous, other exceptional historians, including Richard V. Pierard, Stephen Phillips Professor of History at Gordon College - who describes Barton's work as follows:
"Moreover, American history is rewritten to become "Christian history," the story of a people chosen by God and who honored him in the past. David Barton and a host of other evangelicals have produced books and videos setting forth a "holy history" of America--an idyllic past to which we must return if the nation is to be saved from destruction at the hands of secularists."
