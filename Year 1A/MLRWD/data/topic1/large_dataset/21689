Overall, this is a good prenatal vinyasa yoga DVD. I got the DVD and tried it when I was 6 months pregnant and couldn't finish it mainly due to me just not being in shape. I felt the moves themselves were not diffifult to follow. I appreciated them having demonstrations of each pose for 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester.

My only issues were:

I feel the DVD is a little long and not easy to fit into my schedule. I'd say it's about an hour long with not much of a warm up and does not include any cool down. The cool down portion is in a seperate chapter where you are just laying there for 15 mins or so while she's talking.

The couple's section was a disappointment. I was expecting this to be a routine such as in the main chapter or instructional yoga but it simply gave you very brief step by step instructions back to back for 5 or so couple poses and didn't walk you through any type of routine.

Being in my 3rd trimester now, it's definitely more difficult to go through the routine and I can't usually finish to its entirety, so I wouldn't buy this in your 3rd trimester.

As someone else had mentioned in their review, some of the poses (such as downward dog) are not good to do if you have reflux issues as I do but I've found a workaround to that by substituting downward dog for the child's pose as the video instructs you to do if you are overwhelmed at anytime. It helps a lot!

Overall, I do like the video and I feel good after I do it. Some of the poses they mention are good during labor and getting the baby into a good position which I've used several times already when I was having aches and pains.
