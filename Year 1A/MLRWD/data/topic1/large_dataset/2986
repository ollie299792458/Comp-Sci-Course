As much as a NORMALLY LOVE Penelope Cruz (that's sarcasm, folks!) her performance in "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" isn't so much acting as it is a series of gawky smiles or frowns accompanied by girlish squeeks and squaks. This terrible acting is accented by Nicolas Cage, whose performance makes it seem like he researched his Italian accent by playing "Super Mario Bros." games. 
Thus are the weaknesses of "Captain Corelli's Mandolin," a valiant effort of a film that, nevertheless, fails to sizzle. And while the film does have its strengths, they ultimately can't save this picture. 
Those strengths include John Hurt and Christian Bale. John Hurt plays the highly cliche part of "Wise Old Papa," and the part is, indeed, highly predictable and run-of-the-mill. But John Hurt is such a subtle and charming actor that he manages to rise above the part and make it a highly enjoyable performance, nevertheless. And Christian Bale does a convincing performance that makes him almost unrecognizable as Penolope Cruz's fiance before "Mamma Mia Nicolas Cage" comes into the story (It's hard to believe that this is the same Christian Bale who only a year before was playing an American WASP in "American Psycho"). These strong performances are coupled with beautiful locations and very smooth-looking cinematography.
Still, these strengths cannot save a dulled-down story and terrible leads, and all in all, "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is a disappointment. If by chance it happens to be on TV, I'd reccommend a quick watch of it, but if not, than you should probably save your money with this one.
