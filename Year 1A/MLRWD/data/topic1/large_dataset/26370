This is a fantastic, classic WW2 action film / 'Boys Own'-adventure, and  it's a criminal shame that it isn't out on DVD (perhaps with extra  sequences in which we see Clint Eastwood reload, or narration from a real  WW2 Commando which, presumably, would degenerate into laughter as out  heroes fight out entire divisions of German soldiers with nary a scratch).  After a slow build-up, during which a carefully-planned, daring commando  raid seems to unravel, the film kicks into gear and becomes non-stop action  and intrigue. Even after blowing up most of a castle, our heroes get to  cause mayhem with period kubelwagens and tripwires. Rather like  'Armageddon', almost everything in the film that can be blown up or shot,  is.
It's like a cross between 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' but with  Nazis, and 'The Guns of Naverone' but with Clint Eastwood. Everything about  the film is perfect, from the opening credits sequence (blood-red Germanic  script, a Junkers transport plane, a driving, foreboding score) to the cast  - Clint Eastwood is utterly Clint, Richard Burton is clipped enough to pass  for Patrick McGoohan, and the Nazis are a fascinating, aristocratic bunch  with groovy, well-pressed grey uniforms and matching MP40s. Furthermore  it's *the* cable-car movie.
It's also utterly irresponsible and very  silly - only 'Kelly's Heroes' and 'Star Wars' have matched the comic-book,  off-hand brutality of the violence, and there's a nasty bit with an boot, a  cable-car, and somebody's face that makes me wince every time I see it.  It's probably Richard Burton's most memorable screen performance, too,  which is something Burton himself would probably not have anticipated. It's  a shame that most of the distinctive cast are either dead, or very old  nowadays.
It gets shown on television every time there's a bank holiday,  but it's hard to tire of watching it. Somebody release it on DVD - now.
