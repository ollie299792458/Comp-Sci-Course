At first viewing, "Predator 2" seemed lame.  After viewing AVP I decided to give it another chance.  Actually this one could have been a cross-over sequel if Mel Gibson was in it and they used their "Lethal Weapon" characters.  Danny Glover was an interesting choice for an action lead.  Not as suspensful as numeral uno, but loaded with tons of action.  It's virtually nonstop!

What is missing is the governator for one, or at least an action star.  The special effects are fine, but the story is loaded with colorful stereotypes of ethnic groups which some might be offended.  Also, therre is loads of blood and freakin' profanity.

Question is, could they have gotten Stallone, Van Damme, Pauly Shore?  Why not.  This movie has a great deal of humor, some unitentional.  Casting the late Morton Downey as an obnoxious TV reporter is dead on.

Pack to the DVD.  This one is special because it is loaded with several behind the scenes documentaries, audio commentaries, trailers.  Also, the new transfer is great and the soundtrack has been greatly improved.
