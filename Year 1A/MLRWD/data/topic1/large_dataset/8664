I was into this one when i saw the previews for it awhile ago.  Jodie Foster plays her character Erica Bain (radio personality) with a passion and vulnerability.  That most don't even see especially considering the circumstances surrounding her transformation.  She and her boyfriend (Naveen Andrews) are out for a walk with their dog in the park late at night.  Not something i would do (but i digress) they confront some guys that have their dog that ran off and expect a reward for it. They only found it a few minutes ago so i dont understand that.  But he refuses and madness ensues after that with him being beaten to death and Jodie Foster being beaten unconscious herself.

She awakes weeks later a former shell of herself and unable to make it out of her apartment for several days.  Once she finally makes it out of there and decides on what to do next.  Well she goes and buys a gun for protection, venegance and who knows what else.  There is the detective played rather well by Terrence Howard.  Whom she meets and they start to develop a connection that he believes is innocent.  But Erica knows otherwise as their are vigilante murders being carried out all over the city by her.

I love how they show her characters as one that doesnt fit the norm of male killers.  She's doing what she does to help her cope and exist in a city that she once loved but now feels very differently to her.  She also feels like a totally different person as she copes with her boyfriend's death by dealing out her own brand of justice.  Will she get caught or killed herself or will she continue down this dark path of crime and murder undeterred.

You really need to check out the Brave One for yourself.  It has very well established actors/actresses who all give exceptional performances, a well fleshed out story and an excellent backdrop of New York City and brings the citizens to life as they go about their daily lives.
