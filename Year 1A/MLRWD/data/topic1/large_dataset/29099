yeah well that might be true, but it is still quite bad.

Soul Plane is that movie that you watch and cringe. You feel embarassed for the characters on the set. Not for the actors, as they dug their own graves by signing onto this plane crash of a film, but for the characters. You ask yourself: why the hell are you doing something so stupid? Why on earth did you just say that ridiculous piece of dialogue? Why are you on a purple plane and so on.

That being said, doesn't that plane look a lot like Barney?

What I was most dissapointed with is just the low level of satire in this film. Well, I actually did find it to be more intellectually stimulating than the standard Carlos Mencia skit, but I still found it to be on a very low level. I mean, there were so many sterotypes that they missed completely. I think that the white people can't dance stereotype went almost completely untouched and they had all the components right in front of them.  And what about the inexcusable way in which watermelon was completely omitted from the film? Where the hell were the barbecques? Why wasn't anybody robbed at knifepoint? Why were there no jokes about Mexicans seeing the virgin mary in airplane food? Why did the Arab lack bombs strapped to his body? Why were there no dead goldfish in the player's boots?

Now that I have pointed out all of these inexcusable omissions, I have to ask: why was the movie so short? Racial stereotyping provides more material than a thousand talented writers.

That being said, the movie provides a few laughs, but they are not enough to make this movie passable or more appealling than a Colt 45 and some Popeyes. Smoke a blunt and watch this, I know I did, but it will still not be enough to make humour of a man sticking his fingers into mashed potatos and thinking that it is a female sexual organ.
