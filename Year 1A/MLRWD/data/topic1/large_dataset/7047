In the original Evil Dead there was some intention to make a serious horror movie, with Evil Dead 2 a bit of that was retained, but much of it was replaced with slapstick and farce.  In Army Of Darkness there is not a single serious moment to be had in this entire film.  Take a bit of the Evil Dead movies, add a heathy dose of Howard,Fine and Howard, some Errol Flynn, a little Ray Harryhaussen, and every bad line from every second-rate action film ever made.  The end result is nearly only fit for viewing through the lense of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but Bruce Campbell, Sam Raime and company actually pull it off.  If you have any notion that this is a serious horror movie of any sort, you are either going to be very disappointed or extremely confused.  If you loved Evil Dead 2 this will bring you more of the same only far more so, it takes farce to a whole new level and proves that you can make an intentionally "bad" B-movie, that's better then a great deal of the A-list stuff that's being churned out of Hollywood by the gallon.
