I LOVED this movie!  I cannot believe the overall rating is only 3 stars.  Unbelievable! The minute I left the theatre, I was calling my friends to see if they wanted to go the next night and see it. I wanted to see it again for at least a week afterwards.

This movie is simple and elegant, which unfortunately is unusual for the 21st century, but I found it to be VERY refreshing.  There is mystery, sex appeal, comedy, romance, drama and action throughout the entire film.  And the storyline is actually BELIEVABLE, something else that the 21st century has abandoned.  I'm a 30yr old woman and I have to say, even I couldnt keep my eyes off Angelina. And what woman could take their eyes off of Johnny?  They were a brilliant combination!

I will say that when I went to see the film, I had other expectations of the movie, based on what I saw on the trailers but I was pleasantly surprise to find out my expectations were misplaced.  That alone made the experience of the movie much more pleasurable.  I didn't know everything that was going to happen because the trailers had all the good parts of the movie in it, like just about every other movie I have seen.  I rarely go to the movies because I dont feel like paying $30 to eat popcorn and sit with strangers who may or may not talk through the movie and cant pause it if I have to go to the bathroom, when I can easily wait a few months and spend $5 to rent it.  I go for movies that I think would be better in a theatre.  This is not a movie that I would have needed to see in a theatre, HOWEVER, I am very glad that I did.

For me, its a MUST SEE.
