Have seen both versions of The Parent Trap and both are excellent. For a first time viewer would recommend the newer 1998 Double Trouble version for first viewing with the original also recommended for second viewing. First because as an adult watching both movies I found the tension between the parents more interesting and believable in the Double Trouble version and second because the print quality of the newer Double Trouble version is/was superior to the vault version of the original. The contrast of print quality is striking because Disney restored the vault version of Pollyanna also starring Hayley Mills and it looks brand new with sharp images, excellent color and a print that is not faded at all whereas the vault version of the original Parent Trap does not have as sharp images, has darkened slightly and the color while good is clearly not of the same quality as the restored Pollyanna vault version. The acting in both Parent Trap versions is excellent including both Hayley Mills and Lindsay Lohan. So would recommend Double Trouble version for first viewing and if you get hooked as I did going for the original version second. The Vault version is loaded with extras, so for me I am glad to have both versions.
