When I first saw this movie as a recommendation for me, I read the reviews. Most of the ones I read were not complimentary. In fact, one of them gave it only 2 stars! I give this movie  stars because of the acting, the story and the soundtrack. I used to be a fan of The Carpenters many years ago but as I got older, I changed my mind. Two of their songs are featured in this movie are strategically placed and made me fall in love with the music again. Each "category" of gay life is portrayed here in an honest light with no apologies offered or given. An interesting question happens at the beginning of the film, "What does Jack see in the Purple guy?" This question eventually gets answered and it is so obvious. So what did I particilarly like about this movie? See it and the question will get answered.
This movie is a non-threatening movie which can be seen with straight friends, family and co-workers and you or they will not be offended. There aren't any token sex scenes or obligatory nude scenes. Everything is tastefully done. Please see this movie, you will be able to identify with at least one of the characters. A great ensemble cast.
