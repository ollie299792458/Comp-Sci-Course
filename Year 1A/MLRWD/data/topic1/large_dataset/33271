This movie is one of the best movies of 2003. The beatiful cinematography, natural scenes, capture of emotions and accompaniying music leads to a modern, potential masterpiece. It tells of Cathy (Conelly) who gets evicted for being wrongly accused of not paying taxes. She goes to get her house back (which her father left for her and her brother when he died). Biran is the man who buys the house when the county puts it up for auction and he wont sell back the house unless they (the county) pays back 4 times as much. Shortly, Cathy becomes homeless and meets a police officer who after breaking up with his wife becomes homeless too. It also shows how the cop is trying to get back wit the family and all the emtional twists in his family. It shows Birans family and the stunning actor (Shorah Aghadashloo) shines in this movie and also Esmail's actor is excellent. I can not put the greatness of this movie in this review as it is so big. The only let down in the movie is when the family speaks Farsi as they are Irani, there are no subtitles. I give this move 5 stars, but I would have given more if I was able to. You'll be kicking yourself if you dont watch it. Truly stunning!

PS. Watch for how the camera is shot, excellent! and for the part when she is in the phone booth with running mascara and the grey sky- fantastic!!!
