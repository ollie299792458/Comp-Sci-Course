Interesting.  I have to say I enjoyed this movie.  Justin Timberlake is always fun (Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Social Network).  I'm happy I saw this movie, and I recommend it.  The concept is weird, the "social class war" theme is current and smart, the acting, score, and cinematography are right up there with any Hollywood film, and the plot twist and turns are film 101.  I've never quite seen a movie like this before.  They had to create their own new world, which is always a challenge, like "Inception", "Watchmen", "Edward Scissorhands" (not saying this film is anything like those, but it tackles a surreal idea and bases it in our reality).  The film is a love adventure, racing against time, freedom, and death with a "Natural Born Killer"/"True Romance" type of "love conquers all" relationship.  None the less, I feel with a script like this you're always trying to find the holes and I do have to say, the holes are slim and far in between.  Don't put this on the top of your list, but find time to slip this little gem into your movie night soon.
