I missed Ray Bradbury theater when it was originally broadcast, so I jumped at the chance to purchase this collection. I have not been disappointed! The only reason I give it 4 stars, not 5, is the video quality itself, which is rather poor (but certainly watchable), I assume due to very high compression used to get so many episodes on each dvd. Balancing that is the very low price, so overall it is a wash.

If you are a Bradbury fan you will be familiar with many of his famous short stories filmed here. I have noticed some, mostly minor, changes from the original stories, but nothing that wrecks them. And I must assume that the series was filmed in Canada or possibly even Europe, based on the accents of many of the supporting actors, and the locations, many of which do not look particularly American -- certainly not Bradbury's "middle America." But that doesn't really hurt the shows, either, in my opinion.

What you are getting with this set are plenty of well-filmed, fairly faithful adaptations of stories by a great sf/fantasy author, and this sort of thing is just about impossible to find any more. It's several notches above your standard tv sf/fantasy pap. Get this collection and I think you will be pleased.
