Almost everyone would know the plot of this film.  The story of villagers being attacked by bandits and then hiring Samurai has been remade by Hollywood quite a few times (Magnificent Seven, Bugs Life). This however is the story at its best.  The performances in the film are great and Mifune can be quite humorous at times.  The film itself with a running time just under 4 hours goes by incredibly quickly.  I cannot praise this film enough.  If you haven't seen it then I recommend you do (In Japanese of course).
The picture on this DVD is quite adequate.  For a film that is over 50 years old I was quite impressed how clear the picture actually was.  It is presented in full-frame and is quite acceptable.  Well done to those that spent their time restoring this masterpiece.  The sound is Dolby Digital Mono and Japanese.  It is very clear, though don't expect any surround activity.  The subtitle stream is in white and doesn't conflict at all against the black and white picture.  The extras are limited with an interesting commentary track, though are better than nothing.
This DVD can be recommended on the film itself.  It is simply brilliant.  The characters and the story just doesn't get any better than this.  Well done again to the folks at Criterion for another fine presentation of a Kurosawa masterpiece.
