At twenty minutes into this flick I wondered what it was about Magnum Force that bothered me. The introduction of David Soul and Robert Urich irked but it may have just been indigestion. Then at about fourty five minutes into things, just about the point where the Asian woman playing the cheap whore asks:

"What does a girl have to do to go to bed with you?"

Clint's answer:

"Try knocking on the door!"

I realized what it was about this movie that bothered me. It's not very good. Overblown, self-important authority figures and a truckload of poorly conceived clich&eacute; catch phrases none of which is worth quoting. Essentially another McHollywood's fast food movie of the Big Mac variety. Lettuce, cheese, pickle onions, stake outs, chase scenes and lots of guns... stacked high on a sesame seed bun. I'm not sure if it was more boredom or munchies but I never did see the end of Magnum Force and wound up talking into a clown's mouth instead.

Consider taking the kids out for a burger before watching anything that might kill your appetite. A good man always knows his limitations.
