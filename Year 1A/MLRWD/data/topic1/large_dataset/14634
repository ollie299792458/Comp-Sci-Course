This is easily one of the Coen brothers finest films and it's long awaited debut on DVD will hopefully punctuate it's greatness. Although it never received it's due in it's day, many covet the film for it's absorbing script, mesmerizing acting and jaw dropping technical beauty. The story revolves around a hard nosed mobster who is sharp, cunning and loyal despite his flaws. It also showcases rich characters you simply never see from the tepid world of major studios. Even if you don't catch all that is happening behind the motivations for the plot and it's characters on the first viewing. The acting by Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harding, John Turturro, John Polito, J.E. Freeman and great Albert Finny will keep your attention glued. Also the technical presence of it's cinematography and sound will startle you now that DVD can properly showcase it. Add on top another gorgeous soundtrack by the underrated Carter Burwell, and it will just astound you that this film never swept the Academy Awards. IT IS THAT GREAT! The DVD won't be stacked with extras but, trust me, this movie is so good you won't need them. This film and a few others by Kubrick and Foreman are the only dramas, I watch over and over. I can't thank Fox enough for releasing this film on DVD!
