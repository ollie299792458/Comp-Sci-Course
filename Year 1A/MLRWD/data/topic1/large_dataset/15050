I can't add anything to the praise for this film.  If you love Disney films, this is considered one of the classics.  I just wish to briefly comment on the criticism of the lack of a widescreen version.  The first  widescreen film, The King and I, was released in 1956.  Previous to this  all films were full screen.  Peter Pan, released in 1953, and a good many  of the Disney classics are only available in full screen aspect.  This is  not the Pan and Scan alteration of an original Widescreen format.  The way  this film is presented on the DVD is the original aspect ratio; Nothing has  been altered.  I have seen this so called criticism leveled against many  Hollywood classics such as Casablanca, Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of  Oz.  Please, get off your high horse and stop whinning about how Disney or  whatever movie company is ripping you off.  None of these films ever had a  widescreen version to begin with.  Do a little research and you could be  content to enjoy these classics in the aspect ratio they were orginally  presented in.  Thats all I wish to say.
