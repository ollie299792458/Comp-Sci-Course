This is enjoyable cheese :). I would not call it amongst the best martial arts movies ever made out there (like some people do).

The audio options are pretty nice. The ability to see this with subtitles without bad dubbing and rewritten lines is a plus.

The video might not be as sharp as some people out there like, but let's focus on reality. It's an old movie which was made before the high def era of modern films. The fact that it looks sharp on my high def TV to me means I can't complain. I can only compliment the guys who made it look so sharp for my home viewing enjoyment.

Now because a few of my idiot friends asked (so this next section is here for the off chance that an idiot will be online)...

As to its accuracy in training techniques. Watching this and trying to practice some of the shown techniques will result in injuries or even death, so I don't advise doing that. I haven't been a hard core martial artist in over a decade, but I'm getting back to it (I do daily practice sessions). There are actually specialized training techniques taught in Shaolin (I practice a bit of Chan Quan Shaolin myself) but mastering one technique alone can take an average practitioner between two to three years of dedicated (up to 8 hours a day for 3 years) training. The fact that the main character, San Ta, had mastered 35 techniques in 5 years meant he averaged mastering 7 techniques a year.

As to the accuracy of the shown techniques: I'm not an expert but there are at least seventy two specialized techniques of Shaolin including soft and hard style techniques. http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Shaolin-Heritage-Training-Methods/dp/1440474176/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1328531919&sr=1-1
