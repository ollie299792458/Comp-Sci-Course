There's a long list of films ruined by people who said "Chop this, edit that, blah blah blah".  Three in particular come to mind instantly:

Dune (david lynch) - With an original running time approaching six hours, Frank Herbert gave the workprint his blessing.  The 90 some-odd minute theatrical release, however.....

Legend - A barely laughable film until the extended version with the non-modified soundtrack came out.  Now it's truly worthy of it's title.

Waterworld - Who out there ISN'T asking for the original intended release as shown on the Sci Fi channel, but with the language, gore, and nudity reinserted?  The film is very enjoyable in it's full length.

Well, regretfully "Event Horizon" was subjected to the same celluloid-emasculation.  The "Hell" sequences started as mere flashes, but by the end of the film we would see them in all their entirety and horror.  Evidently, shooting those scenes was incredibly traumatic for the actors/actresses.  The film would have had a running time well over 2 hours and, in the pre-"Hostel" era, would have been by far the most disturbing, terrifying, and graphic film of it's time.  Quite likely the most terrifying space-horror film since the original "Alien".

The film itself, while flawed due to it's forced-editing, is beautifully filmed and very unnerving.  The characters act exactly as you would expect.  The film follows a very steady pace with lots of mystery and theory.

And then there's Sam Neil.  I can think of a better actor to descend into that kind of madness.  He and Lawrence Fishburne are simply outstanding in this film.

This is an overlooked gem worthy of another glance, especially on DVD now.  Go see it for yourself.

And put in a request for a blu-ray version while you're at it.

And maybe a petition to reshoot the lost footage :).  If I had a few million dollars to burn, I'd pay for it myself just to see it.

How's that for excitement?  Do you see it for yourself?

do you see?

DO YOU SEEE?????
