Oliver Stone's "Nixon" is probably the greatest political film of recent years alongside his masterpiece, "JFK." Some people have attacked Stone for supposedly "re-writing" history, these are people who either don't care about knowing the dark truths history has to offer or don't understand how dramatic composition works. This is a brilliant, powerful and important work. Stone does not justify what Richard Nixon did, he instead, presents a portrait of a flawed man haunted by memories and events. There is a Shakespearean feel to the screenplay. The film is a look at how politics really works, how it's a jungle in that field where issues are forgotten and the object is to win. "Nixon" is a study of power, and how power really works in our system of government. Stone is one of the most brilliant filmmakers of our time, his film here is filled with powerful moments, intense, rich cinematography by Robert Richardson and an editing style that adds texture, realism and energy to the movie. As for re-writing history, the pundits who attack this movie are living in Disneyland and even John Dean claimed that there wasn't anything "unfair" in the dramatic license found in the script. Besides, who the hell goes to the movies to get the facts? For that watch a documentary (and those use a large degree of dramatic license too) or read a book! "Nixon," in it's depiction of how politics and the world works is completely accurate. If you don't believe it, do your own research and especially read Anthony Summers' "Official And Confidential: The Secret Life Of J.Edgar Hoover." Oliver Stone is one of the true film directors who dares to show the truth, who takes a mirror and forces us to look at ourselves. He understands how society and how we who live in society really do operate. Those who attack his work are the ones afraid to realize the realities of this world, they got no balls. He's a dramatic historian, a genius who's work is vital to the history of American cinema.
