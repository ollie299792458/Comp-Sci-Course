I like to read reviews by first re-ordering them starting from the one-star ratings on. These reviewers got me interested. A movie that would shock and disturb so much, so many people? People who loved the movie until the ending twist that made them give only one star and an overall negative review? I had to see this one!

Well, for starters, I was disappointed. This was quite an ordinary serial killer movie, where a highly religious but possibly crazy man goes on a killing spree - with the forced help of his young sons. He justifies it all (for himself and for his sons) with the claim that it is God's will.

Well he dies eventually, never getting caught. But his two sons don't grow up to be really healthy men, you know... The younger one especially grows up pretty crooked and thinks he is continuing his father's work for God.

The older brother never quite believes the stuff, but with enough "persuation", and dehydration, even he starts to "hear" the voice of God.

Pretty standard stuff if you ever read about real life serial killers, right?

Where this movie exells, is the ending. In a thriller movie, it's all about the ending. And this one is good.

SPOILER ALERT: SPOILER ALERT: Don't read further if you don't want to know too much of the plot.

Right when you thought the father and son were insane, you get hit by a surprise. They really felt they saw what sins their victims had committed. Now here's the kicker: the FBI-agent had never told anyone that he himself murdered his mother. Yet, Adam (the younger son) "sees" this and kills him. Guestion is: is he just smart (as is hinted in the in-car conversations) and he just guessed it? Or does he really hear someone talking to him - and if so, is it God or The Devil that is speaking to him?

Now you see why all the bible-lovers shun this movie, the ending is really great.
