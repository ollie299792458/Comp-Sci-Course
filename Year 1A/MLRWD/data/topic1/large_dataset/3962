This was a great movie, and really showed how we used to have American drive and enthusiasm.  No research, No focus groups, no perceptual studies.  A man and a GOOD idea.  That is what this country was founded on, and it is also what we have lost today.

If McDonalds did "research" and asked people if they would like a chain that sells the same hamburger anywhere in the country, people would say "NO" since at the time( and we are losing this every day) each place was unique.  Tucker followed his dreams.

Speaking of dreams, the sequence where Tucker is called outside the plant by his partner who resigns has a GREAT speech that nobody here has written about as of yet.

Catching someones dreams is possible with that drive and enthusiasm.  Good teams also helped us get where we are, by invigorating people.  Granted, you never know how much this was juiced up for film, but from the look of it Tucker was someone who inspired those around him.  America take note.  Like Cold Stone Creamery.  Making money all over, expanding like crazy, new concept new way of doing business.  Research would say the ice cream market is oversatured.  It is.  But tis is unique.  America... be unique and go for it... Let's not lose wha tmakes this country special!!
