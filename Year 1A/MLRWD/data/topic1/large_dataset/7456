This series is awesome. I had low expectations- but this show does almost everything right. I wish I had started watching it earlier than now (2007). I expected low budget & fair effects from a (then) fledgling "network." The pilot blew me away. And it went on from there to do what it does best- it makes every character from this comic phenomenon HUMAN. Including, ironically, Clark Kent himself. The actor is great- plays him as so naive and trusting- you can't help but like this dude. And Lex- Man- this actor portrays Luthor better than ANY movie incarnation. You want to like this guy- and yet you're still a bit afraid of what he might do. Maybe it's because they have time to develop this character. The movies only portray a stereotype of what we expect form L.L.- an evil smart guy- no depth. The show makes you care for almost everyone. Great acting from everyone- but I think ultimately the producers & directors are responsible for this being the best 1st season of a show ever. Only one negative- the EXTRA features on disc 6 SUCK!!! Probably because of the age of the release.
