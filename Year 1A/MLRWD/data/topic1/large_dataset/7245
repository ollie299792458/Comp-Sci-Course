Yes this is one of the only movies my Mom and I both like.  When I was young, she had me watch Cosmos with Carl Sagan on PBS.  This movie reminds me of that because it is dedicated to Carl Sagan. I knew she had seen it previously and liked it, so I got her the bluray for her new bluray player.
Jodi Foster is excellent as usual as a frustrated scientist listening to signals coming to Earth from Space in hopes of possibly finding proof of intelligent life in outerspace. Matthew McConaughey plays a very liberal preacher who isn't such a believer in her work but seems to like her very much. She's all science, he's all religion, so there's friction for a sort of attraction as a subplot.
When a signal comes to her crew from outer space, she of course wants to follow the instructions in the message to build a device/portal to take her to the originators of the message. Add in government interference, a rich old eccentric man who supports her, and a crazy religious zealot who opposes science at any cost and you've got a good movie.  It may seem sentimental and slow to some viewers, but they can't all be action movies can they?
