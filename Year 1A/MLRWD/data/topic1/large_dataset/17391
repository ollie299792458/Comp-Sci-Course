So much praises have been said about this film, about de Vito's powerful direction and Nicholson's towering performance, that adding more nuggets to the already high pile of gold would be equivalent to standing behind a choir and singing; instead, then, I will mention my two minor complaints - the first one about the film itself, and the second - about the DVD. (Before that, however, I will add one nugget, since I intend to praise something that I rarely saw appreciated in the reviews - David Newman's touching score).

Off to the minor flaws, then...

Firstly - there is slightly too much fictionalization in the film, and while the purpose is, obviously, to "increase the magic", it actually decreases it a little. The ending is perhaps the best example of this problem. It's powerful, it's dramatic, it's moving - but it has nothing to do with the real events, and forgetting this fact is difficult while one watches the film, thereby actually spoiling "the magic" a little.

Secondly - the extras appear to have been prepared (and transferred directly from) a laserdisc release rather than DVD. Therefore, they are somewhat outdated and do not offer the visual quality to which the viewers of the DVD format are used.

(I actually have a third issue - not a complaint per se, but rather a minor note of disappointment: I was deeply hoping to see a short documentary on Hoffa - the real James R., that is, not the film - included on the disc. Unfortunately, there is none... and yet I suspect that shooting a short one, or even licensing an available video - such as "Where's Jimmy Hoffa?" - would not have been that costly for a major studio...)
