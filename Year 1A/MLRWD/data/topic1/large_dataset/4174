Someone told me prior to viewing that the body count was around 500. Of course, I didn't believe him.
After watching the film, 500 doesn't look like a far off number.
Hard Boiled is another one of John Woo's greats, created in 1991. Chow Yun Fat is a hard boiled cop, and he's hot on the trail of gun smugglers. The plot REALLY leaves a lot to be desired, but that doesn't matter. What matters is nearly half of the film is composed of relentless, hyperkinetic action.
The only negotiating is done through the barrel of a gun, and it is clearly evident in the entire film. People are killed left and right, including helpless civilians. But to the true action fan, this is a dream come true. This movie is a lesson in truly great action scenes, including the last scene in a hospital, where it is nonstop action for almost half an hour.
If you liked this one, buy John Woo's 'The Killer' as well. It is in the same vein as Hard Boiled. As long as you have these two movies, they are the only action movies you'll ever need.
