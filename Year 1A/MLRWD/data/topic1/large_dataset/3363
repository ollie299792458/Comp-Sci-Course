Of course it's not the Blair Witch Project. And it wasn't supposed to be. The director wanted to get away from that, which is why he stated at the beginning that it was a re-enactment and made it clear in the film that the original was a fake. I once heard a review saying that this movie did was the original did not. It made it clear that a witch did the killings and not some deranged psycho. That is totally false. Since it's a re-enactment, it shows the movie from the suspects' POVs. Who claimed it was a witch that did the killing despite evidence against them. In the end, it's up to you to decide. Was it Elly or are they liars? The only thing bad I have to say about the film is its lack of mystery behind-the-film and its lack of content on the dvd. So it's a cd-dvd. So what!? That's just ripping off those who actually bought the film soundtrack and score. Other than that, all you have is the secrets of esrever (which is way too easy to solve) and audio commentary. Where are all the juicy tidbits that we love!?
