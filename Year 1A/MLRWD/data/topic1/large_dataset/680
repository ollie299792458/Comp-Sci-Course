Michael Wood decided to follow the footsteps of Alexander the Great by retracing the path of that man and his army. Wood attempts much of the actual path himself, letting us see, and experience virtually, much of what the army experienced. The documentary is worth seeing for this alone, for despite the 2300+ years which have passed since Alexander's time, it is possible to get a sense of the distances, the heights, the valleys, the deserts and the bodies of water which the army traversed in order to "conquer the world."

The documentary was made several years ago - the date mentioned for the VHS version is 1998 - as Wood makes his journey, one region mentions Saddam Hussain being in power, and the Taliban being in the process of taking Kabul. Given the strife of the region, one has to admire Wood and his crew for their bravery and daring in shooting the documentary (as well as wonder how much paperwork they had to fill out). The conflicts in the area, as well as the well-documented carnage which Alexander and his armies inflicted, make this a far more sobering work than another one of Wood's documentaries, "In Search of the Trojan War." Wood, when interviewing locals along the route, finds that Alexander's deeds are often still remembered - and usually hated. Although Wood tries to admire Alexander throughout the documentary, Alexander's war crimes and slaughters and disregard for the lives of even his own people become more and more apparent. Wood tries to excuse this at the end of the four-part piece, explaining that we needed to understand Alexander within the context of his time. For me, this is insufficient. Great writers and thinkers had already come into being, and Alexander was certainly aware of them - after all, he was a pupil of Aristotle's!
