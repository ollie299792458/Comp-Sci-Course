This movie starts with interviews of the "man in the street" to demonstrate the ignorance of the general public about nuclear weapons.  That is no surprise as the "man in the street" is ignorant of nearly all technical issues.

So, let's set the record straight.  It is NOT "easy" to obtain enriched uranium, build a warhead, transport it undetected, and detonate it for maximal damage.  If it was, terrorists would have already done so, but they have not.  And, rogue states would have lots of weapons, but they do not.  The USA needs to worry much more about economic competition from other countries than terrorists with nuclear weapons in a suitcase (which would be a damn heavy suitcase based upon the size of material needed and the density of Uranium).  Maybe "The Hulk" would carry it for the terrorists.

If you want to see a much more realistic assessment of the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war, rent "Testament", "The Day After", or especially "Threads".  The last movie is a fabulously grim depiction of how a nuclear war would return the developed world to the middle ages, with all of the problems associated with short, brutal lives of 35 years.  The USA and the "former" Soviet Union successfully avoided such a global disaster for 40+ years.  We should celebrate that, not make up false crisis and pretend they are of the same scale.
