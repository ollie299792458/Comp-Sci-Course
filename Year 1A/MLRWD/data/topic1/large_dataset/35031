Well, let's see. We have a compelling plot, witty dialogue, fantastic animation, gorgeous women, and plenty of action. Wow, pass the popcorn. Mystery of the Batwoman is just that, a mystery. Who is she, and why is she wreaking havoc on the Penguin, Rupert Thorne, and a new third player? Even Batman can't figure it out. There are certainly plenty of lovely ladies to choose from, and not in the usual way that his handsome alter ego may be accustomed to. Alan Burnett's intricate storyline is more of a whoisshe than a whodunit, with Penguin and Co. the ill fated individuals, more than Batman, who desperately want this perplexing problem quickly and permanently resolved. They even bring in Bane to help find a solution. This story has it all, with about the only area of criticism, and a fairly minor one at that, being with the voice acting. Paul Williams and Henry Silva are regrettably absent from their usual respective roles of Penguin and Bane, and their gifted and pleasurable presence is undoubtedly missed, but the rest of the movie is so remarkably strong that it clearly compensates for this one unfortunate misstep. When discussing any animated movie, even one such as this replete with interesting twists and turns at every juncture, in the final analysis it still primarily comes down to one thing. Was it fun? The answer to that is a resounding and thunderous yes, and praise all around to Alan Burnett, Michael Reaves, and the rest of the talented team of animators and creators for producing yet another stellar and supremely enjoyable Batman movie. P.S. The bonus Chase Me short, or for that matter all of the extras, are great also.
