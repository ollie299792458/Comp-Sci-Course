This is a lovely movie which makes my eyes water at the end,yes real men do cry! Tom Cruise is simply amazing in his role as Jerry Maguire,he is a great actor,its a bloody pity more people in the media dont give him the respect he deserves for his acting ability.Instead they waste their pathetic careers reporting about his personal life & seem to forget just what a fine performer he is. Enough about these idiots lets get back to this classy film,Mr.Cruise is awesome as is Cuba Gooding Jnr. & Renee Zellweger is stunning,beautiful & emotional,all 3 actors are fantastic.Cameron Crowes direction is faultless & heartfelt,he has a great synergy with his all actors.The soundtrack  music deserves mention as well,the use of Mr.Spingsteens "Secret Garden" deserves a star for itself as does Mr.Dylans "Shelter from the Storm" at the very end,hip hip hooray! Look this is just one of those movies that makes you feel better for having seen it,thats really all thats needs to be added in the context of this brilliant film!
