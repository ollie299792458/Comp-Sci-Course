Now, as we know, this movie broke ground back in 1988 with it's spectacular animation and sound effects, earning it FOUR (4) Oscars, which were for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, 1988 Special Achievement in Animation Direction, and Best Film Editing.  The movie was based after a book, called, Who Censored Roger Rabbit, but the movie will keep you glued to your screen with gags such as "The problem is I got a 50 year old lust in a three year old dinky", which, in turn, earned it a PG rating, and for this, you should caution, or should I say, take yield, in showing this to kids at the age where these things make a lasting impression. But for the young kids with out those thoughts, you have no problem, except in keeping them interested, because to a, say, five year old kid, some parts are hard to follow, but the appearances of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Dumbo, and the Cast of Walt Disney's Fantasia will keep them on the look out for others like Tweety, Daffy Duck, those penguins from Mary Poppins and other familiar characters. For those older viewers there is the wonderful plot as alcoholic Eddie Valiant uncovers subplot after subplot to bring the movie to a colorful, breathtaking ending.  The musical performance by Bob Hoskins while keeping your kids entertained, you entertained, and Grandpa entertained.  The special features are great, they include deleted scenes, Audio Commentary, Three Roger shorts, a DVD game, a mini-documentary about the making of Roger Rabbit, Facts and trivia, Spilt screen comparison w/ and w/o animation, a in-depth, documentary, Toon stand-ins, showing the process of the animation, and a tad bit more. It also comes with two photos, glossed, of Roger and Jessica.  In the end, you'll love it.
