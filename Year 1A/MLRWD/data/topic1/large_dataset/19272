The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting.  But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance.  I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this.  He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter.

Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english.  Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you.  Wish you not here'.

It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making.

And then there's the lack of realism.  Half the time there is no one steering the ship.  In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day.  On this ship, no one steers at night.  When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's.  But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all.  They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond.

And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist.  He's not even in pain.  He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head.  This is what really spoiled the movie.  The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey.
