I have always been a sci-fi geek since star wars; I'm only 34 people, lol!!! First off, it's been done before, anyone remember V, the lizard people with big ship's, hell ya, remember Jane Badler; a.k.a Diana, yum!!!  All together the story is intriguing, I say this, when the first episode aired, earth was already taken, military devastated, million's upon million's dead, pretty much a bad case scenario for all. This is not what the story, series is about, how do we, as society, bond, then kick the sh#$ out of Extraterrestrial's or in this case, green bug's and that tall alien. With this being said, still fun to watch, in which, and could this really happen to humanity if something like this was to happen. When it comes to the action, tactical aspect of the series, very much real life if it happened. Acting, good, could be better, the children need to be more involved in the story than thee adult's, since they have something major to do with the story, maybe season 3. The special effects need some improvement, not sure if it with the budget or not using Pixar or ILM. All in all, fun, captivating, any new series needs work, but they are on the right track.
