My 4 year old loves this movie and so do I. It was cute and endearing, funny and entertaining. My son loves superheroes,but pretty much all shows and films are way too mature for him to watch. This movie was perfect!  I dont understand why Marvel and DC gear their products to grownups who really are too old for comics and cartoons. It would be wise to target the younger audiences so that they can flourish and grow with their beloved superheroes thus strengthening the franchise. My husband grew up watching the overly graphic, overly sexual and graphically violent superhero shows and movies that were popular in the 90s. I would never let my son watch any of those shows and movies and as a parent its nice to finally have a choice...a good PG cartoon vs the other stuff he shouldnt be watching but wants to watch cause its all there is. As a parent I am responsible for censoring my child's entertainment and often times have to be the bad guy who says No I'm sorry but you cant watch that. My husband is always wanting to share the things he loved as a child with our son, but in the case of superheroes cannot as we realize that we cannot allow him to watch most of what is out there. This film was a great way for them to share the Marvel Universe together. It was a safe PG cartoon that we can all watch together and love. As a mom I really loved this film, it tugged at my heart strings and even made me cry a little...Its about the orphaned children of all of the Avengers. I loved finding out which Avengers ended up with each other and seeing an old Tony Stark and old Incredible Hulk was kinda cool.  It was a great film and I really hope that they continue the Next Avengers and build it up into its own huge slice of marvel universe, for the next generation of little Marvel fans .
