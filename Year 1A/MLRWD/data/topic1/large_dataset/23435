"Calamity Jane" is one of those rare movies that offers comedy, music and gunslingers and does all three marvelously, giving you a lot of bang for your buck. Every song on the score is catchy and singable, and the stars all play off each other beautifully (if one overlooks Lieutenant Dan's stale but mercifully small performance). Doris Day is perfectly cast as Martha "Calamity" Jane Canary, stomping and spitting and getting as close to cussing as you can get in a family movie. The film never drags, thanks to the witty repartee and great chemistry between Day and Keel, and to Day's blustery, bravado-filled performance as the fast-talking, fast-shooting Black Hills tomboy. I've loved this movie since the first time I watched it as a young girl, and for different reasons in different stages of my life. I'm rather conflicted over how I feel about the film, because it does send mixed feminist messages. On the one hand, it has Doris Day as the consummate tomboy, ridin', ropin', cussin' and fightin' and doing everything as well as or better than the famous gunslinging hotshot Bill Hickok. On the other hand, the latter half of the movie suggests several antifeminist ideas: that a woman's life without a man is incomplete; that you have to clean the house and wear a dress to get said man to notice you (apparently being able to shoot a glass out of someone's hand isn't attention-grabbing enough!); that deep down, women are jealous and petty creatures ... but it's not as though most modern romantic comedies that feature supposedly strong women don't have the same type of cop-out ending. It was a disappointment in this case mostly because this was "Calamity Jane," and Calam was clearly supposed to ride off into the sunset either alone or with Katie, as one assumes the real-life, not-so-sunny and -heterosexual Martha Jane Canary would have done.
