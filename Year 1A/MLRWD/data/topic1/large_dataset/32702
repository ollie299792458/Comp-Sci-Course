Walking with dinsosaurs was a masterpiece and shouldn't be missed by anyone. This series however lacks on two key points. The first is that the animation and animatronics looks much more fake than they ever did previously. Even some of the CGI is very jerky, whales shifting unrealistically mid-jump, other creatures doing the same. Then when we get to certain 'rubber' puppets, they shake and vibrate in a way that just screams PUPPET!
If this were the UK region 2 version, there my criticism would end and the show would get a solid 4 stars.
However this is the US version and the shameful editing is to be deplored. A couple of austrolipithicus (gasp) have sex. Like creatures have been doing for hundreds of millions of years. But in the US edition this scene is blurred out.
Are Americans so pitifully prudish that they can stomach to see thousands of unnnatural acts of people shooting and killing each other in myriads of ways, but can't stomach 2 seconds of the most natural act in the world, sex, which if it wasn't blurred out, people would see was masked my grass anyway?
Shame on the censors, shame on the BBC for allowing it, and shame on the narrow-minded who won't allow others to make up their own minds about the scene.
For that, the US edition gets 3 stars.
