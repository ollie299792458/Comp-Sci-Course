This film is a brilliant one. It is sophisticated, engaging, and scary as hell. The special effects were done strictly on camera, I am told, and there are no cutting-edge CGI here... it's all careful editing and camerawork, which is amazing.

The way the story is told will be difficult for some, but it is filmed as though it were a book, although not particularly Bram Stokers book. Not to worry.

Gary Oldmans Dracula, though different from Lugosi and Langella, is frightening. He really pulls out the stops and displays some truly horrific mannerisms... and he makes this character his own.

Unfortuanately, the performance by Ryder seems stiff, pretentious and her accent is an absolute mockery, but the rest of the cast and the visuals are so strong, she can't bring the film down by much. Though young for the part, Keanu Reeves does a good job as Harker, and his accent is more credible. Anthony Hopkins and Sadie Frost, however are nothing short of brilliant and their characters are real standouts.

Lastly, hair stylist and wig maker Stuart Artingstall stole the show with his miraculous hair creations for Gary Oldman. He should have won an Oscar for them. I first saw this film in 1991, and the image of those head dresses were the one thing I remember above everything. It helped make this film memorable in a visually way and I still can't take my eyes off of them. It helped to make Oldmans character so memorable and so totally unique to him. It is said they are inspired by the Japanese Kabuki Theater in Japan, and in some ways, that very style mirrors the continuity and narriative of the script. Brilliant.
