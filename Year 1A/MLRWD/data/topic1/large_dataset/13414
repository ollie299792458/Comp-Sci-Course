I am getting rather tired of reading about how the movie is so terrible when compared to the book.  I do agree that the book is absolutely amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment while reading it.  I do, however, recognize that this is a movie based on a book and therefore when I saw it I was not expecting that it would be identical to the book.  I did enjoy this movie - it is breathtaking to watch visually and essentially the story is pretty faithful to that of the book.  What I find makes the biggest difference is that when watching the movie you lose some of the inner dialogue and description of all the events that are present in the book. Also, being that it is a movie some corners had to be cut in order to keep the length of the film closer to 2 hours as is usually the case.  Since I have read the book I know the story quite well and am able to enjoy the movie for what it is.  In my opinion I think it is a beautiful compliment to the book and I will enjoy watching it again since it is now a part of my DVD collection.
