I bought this edition for one movie only...The Black Room. Even William K. Everson in his "Classics of the Horror Film" (the book that turned me into horror flicks like no other book) didn't have much to say about this one. But the few photos in the same book spoke a different language though.
And what can I say? The Black Room is sure the gem in this otherwise mixed bag. The Man They Could Not Hang and Before I Hang I find pretty mediocre, with the first being slightly better than the latter.
On the other hand The Boogie Man Will Get You in my humble opinion is a complete failure. How could a movie starring Karloff and Peter Lorre and directed by Lew Landers be such a mess? With all respect to 40s humor, which was of course quite different to what we are used to today, movies such as Hold That Ghost, yes, even King of the Zombies prove that there was much more than this flick could ever offer. A complete waste of Karloff's and Lorre's talents if you ask me.
However, let's get back to The Black Room. An intelligent and atmospheric genre movie of the mid 30s. With Karloff delivering one of his best and most underrated performances as far as I am concerned. The clever editing and special effects plus Karloff's superb acting manage to evoke the illusion of those two rather unfortunate twin brothers...one being evil and one being good. The script delivers a plot that one could even find "real" medieval: the story of a family curse that over the centuries haunts the members of an aristocratic family, and finally destroys the last survivors of the same family, Karloff and ehh.. Karloff. You shall see...enjoy!!!
