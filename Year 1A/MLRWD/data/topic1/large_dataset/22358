I have been on a spiritual quest via books and tapes written by the foremost authors of that subject, including "A Course In Miracles". I would notice Louise Hay's books whenever I was on an amazon search, but dismissed them as being too rudimentary. Affirmations, I thought everybody has affirmations. How deep can that be? I'm practically cum laude on the subject. Then, one day (serendipity), I decided to purchase a copy of You Can Heal Your Life. The beauty of the art work and the "Hit Home" simplicity of the context made me view this book with humility and admiration for the superb job she did in crafting this book.
I am unable to keep a copy for myself. Everytime I think, "this is definitely mine", someone comes along and I feel they could benefit greatly from the book and I give it away. Two of these fortunate recipients are using it on a daily basis and writing quotes from the book on post-em stickers to hang on their walls.Yes, it's time to make another purchase; one for me and one for a give away. I know someone will turn up who will just love having it.
