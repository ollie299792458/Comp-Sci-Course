Given the social problems, injustices and pandemic of mindless violence that is now commonplace on a global scale, it is of great appeal when one learns of an individual who is both willing and brave enough to stand alone in the face of a bully and announce, "Enough! You and your behavior are abhorrent and unacceptable and will never again be tolerated by me.  I will do all that I can to thwart you whilst I can".  Clint Eastwood demonstrated such sentiment recently when he deservedly earned worldwide acclaim, for both directing and staring in, "Gran Torino".  Although comparable to Eastwoods' character, Michael Caines' performance in "Harry Brown" is so very, very, very good that the degree of empathy and admiration he elicits from the viewer is so phenomenal that one is left feeling drained, somewhat despondent and yet utterly determined to "do good" by the end of the movie.  As "Harry Brown" seeks out those responsible for an atrocity that wounds him deeply, one cannot help but to become caught up in the momentum and to begin to "feel" what it is like to live a life of fear, loneliness, isolation and a helplessness that is almost incapacitating.  That is until you then experience the feeling of the dispossessed man- when one has absolutely nothing to lose, as they have lost it all, they become their most dangerous.  Harry Brown is the "dispossessed man".  This movie is an absolute must see, especially for younger viewers as it offers valuable insight as to what motivates individuals to partake in group violence.  It also serves to remind the rest of us that we are all capable of being, "the hero we all want to see".
