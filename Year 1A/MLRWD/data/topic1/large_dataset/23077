Filmmaker George Romero may not be able to claim that he created the "zombie",but it can almost be said that he created the "zombie movie",taking it away from its Haitian Creole roots and,borrowing from Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend",created a surreal tale of a race of hellish monsters emerging to prey upon late 20th-century America in his 1968 film "Night Of The Living Dead".Then,just ten years later,he re-invented his own creation in his "Dawn Of The Dead",combining an abundance of unabashed violent bloodshed,still a rarity in American cinema at the time,with on-target satire of the modern consumer culture.Needless to say,this movie quickly became an icon of horror movies.
