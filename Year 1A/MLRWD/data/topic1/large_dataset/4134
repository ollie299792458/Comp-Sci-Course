Charming children and adults get into a variety of fun predicaments. The King family, their children, and their friends, in the town of Avonlea, in the early 1900's, on Prince Edward Island in Canada.

If you liked "Little House on the Prairie" or "Anne of Green Gables"; you should like this. Seasons 1-6 are excellent.

Realistic, likeable, characters, people I would like to know. Avonlea is a place that I would like to visit. Beautiful countryside, farm, horses, period costumes; women in their pretty dresses, period sets and homes, some humor, inviting activities, and a lively pace, carry you to a nicer place.

Episode six, "Proof in the Pudding", is exceptionally funny (Writer-Suzette Couture). The five young children are exceptional, they so understand the character they portray and the comedy they present, that they have a lot of fun doing it, and you are along for the fun. Great Aunt Eliza is just too funny; who the children have been told is hard of hearing, but really is not. The Aunt Abigail and Malcolm episodes of romance (with her unable to make up her mind) are pleasingly charming. (Writers smarter than me).

The various episodes are written by different writers; yet all have the same charm. This first season is all written by women. Mr. Sullivan spared no expense to create a variety of warm, fun, and humorous escapades.

This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $51รท13 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode. Sells new in Canada for $80.
