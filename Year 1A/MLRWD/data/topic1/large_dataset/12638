This 84 minute film, shot in around two weeks, edited by hand on a Mac and employing a decidedly different visual appearance might seem to viewers to be too low budget or hand-made to be worth watching.  However, if you do watch it, you'll find it a rich, interesting and captivating gem of a film, well worth the effort it takes to find it!

The film centers around two people - never named - who meet at a wedding reception and share an intense chemistry.  Flirting turns to passion - and that's where the interesting part of the story begins: in the conversations that follow.

The technique of shooting in split screen could easily have turned into a gimmick or an Oscar bid with bigger-budget movies.  Here, however, it is perfectly used - providing two sides of the same story, past and present, here and there and point of view.  We as an audience can edit the film ourselves, and while the process does take time to get used to, it leaves us with a film that will change every time we see it and gives us an almost infinite opportunity to notice new things.

But the real showcase of this film is not the visuals or the budget: it is the acting.  Helena Bonham-Carter soars as the far-from-home, potentially unhappy Woman, managing to show both comedic timing and realistic heartbreak.  Not to be outdone, Aaron Eckhart gives a convincing performance as the witty yet troubled Man, and provides a perfect Yang to Bonham-Carter's Yin.  The two actors have incredible chemistry, making the flirtatious opening scenes even more convincing, and fun.

The DVD itself has some pretty nice extras, including an interview with Aaron and Helena that was not widely released in addition to a feature commentary with the director and a few other, more technical extras.  Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, most of which is by French singer/songwriter and recent First Lady, Carla Bruni, whose folk voice lends the perfect atmosphere to the action.

In short, this is not a film to miss.
4.5/5
