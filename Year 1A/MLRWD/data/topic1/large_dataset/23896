The Breakup is caught between two worlds.  On the one hand, it wants to be a standard romantic comedy - and interestingly bills itself as such - with slapstick humor, fantastical characters, and an ending never in doubt. Yet, on the other hand, it is a drama, and offers a pointed look at the squalid roller coastal that is a breakup.  It is hard for a movie to fulfill both of these distinct roles, and this is where The Breakup fails.  For while Vince Vaughn offers his usual doses of humor, such antics make his character difficult to take seriously and thereby cause the dramatic element of the film to fail.  Quite simply, a film that offers a pointed inspection of the calamity that ensues in a breakup is not going to come out of mainstream Hollywood - it is going to be an indie film, and it is no doubt going to have the potential to be quite riveting.  Nevertheless, I applaud The Breakup for at least attempting to deviate from the mainstream (even if its promotion indicated otherwise) and seriously consider one of the most sordid elements of human affairs.  Sadly, it's potential was dulled due to its needs to try to finagle a way into the mainstream.
