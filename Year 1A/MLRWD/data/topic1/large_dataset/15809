Never underestimate Kings ability to write a great story!!! With the exception of a couple. But anyways this storyline and the concept of langoliers was somthing I'd never seen before. At first I didn't want to watch it,but then I found myself wanting to watch more of it!!! Despite how long this movie is,it passes by incredibally fast. Some movies are hard to bear watching for nearly 4hrs. But not this one. Don't let the time legnth make you turn this down.  You might not enjoy it at all,but you're prolly more likely to love it then hate it.Its very interesting about the a plane full of passengers in which 10 people fall asleep and when they wake up they have fallen in to a time warp. Despite no great special effects(WHICH I DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYWAYS)this movie was creepy in a sense. Esp. Bronsen Pinchot(the actors name in which I forgot his characters name). I guess I to underestimated his acting abilities.  Haunted by his dead fathers voice he is always scared basiclly,talking about the langoliers,peeling  magazines or news papers,and other things. I don't know how helpfull this reviews been and I'm  sorry if it wasn't helpfull at all. Anyways  My favorite character is the blind girl. Not sure why,but she is very bright and cunning. Well goodbye!!!
