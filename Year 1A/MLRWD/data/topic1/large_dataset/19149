Partner, John Ford was the master by which all others are measured when it comes to western storytelling. What we lovingly call a `horse operas' today, they are being reinterpreted by a generation trying to make a name of themselves and leave something for posterity to be cherished. Takashi Miike co-wrote and directed this work; a fusion between the Japanese gangster and samurai warrior along with gunslinger of the American old west. The result is an opportunity for their distributor to cash in on slick packaging to an audience who think of themselves of being chic and in tune with the neo-culturalists of today. However, for this "boomer" who grew up with Trigger, Gene, Jimmy and John, I can tell you once and for all if you want to again feel the longing of a man sitting upon his horse who is about to finish a 4-month trip pushed 2,200 longhorns north up the Chisholm Trail all the while longing for his family waiting for him back at their central Texas ranch, or of a man riding hard and fast from the law, while rubbing his backside raw from the saddle upon the horse he has `borrowed' while making his way to pick up the trail of the man who murdered his wife and son and framed him for this crime for which he was convicted, then you're wasting your money and wasting your time. I'm a big fan of the classic Japanese samurai swordsmen movies including the `Blind Swordsmen' series and also of several different styles of the American Western movie genre. Some call this new style of movie artistic and that I just don't "get it". Well, perhaps they're right. I may not be able to produce a western movie today with great artistic value which will hold up for generations to come. But, I know a quality western when I see it, one with a great story, a believable cast, locations with beautiful vistas, all the while with a powerful and supportive sound track. This movie fails on every one of these elements. My two cents is to keep your two cents, partner.
