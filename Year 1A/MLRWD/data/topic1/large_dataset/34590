I recently watched this movie, having seen it originally many years ago. I'll admit, my memory did not due it justice. I found it much better now than I did as a teenager. No expense was spent in the making of this movie. No fancy sets, no special effects, no great camera angles. Just simple story telling and yet very effective and satisfying. I've always appreciated Peter Cushing as an actor and he turns in another fine performance here. Forrest Tucker - tho never to be mistaken for Laurence Olivier, was competent in an undemanding but vital role to the film. This appears to be a one camera film, with the camera moving as the scenes cut. So there are no multiple angles. Not a problem. From my childhood memories I thought I recalled a different ending, in which Tucker turned out to be a Yhetti himself disguised as a human. Am I confussing this with another movie, possibly another one he did? In any event, that is not the ending of this movie. The story is simple and somewhat moralistic. Action is decent for single location and no special effects. Overall not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. I would recommend this for anyone who is a movie buff. Don't expect Star Wars or Mission Impossible and you won't be disappointed.
