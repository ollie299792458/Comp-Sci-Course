It has been some time since I saw this movie on television and I had forgotten how wonderful it is.  I am a Gene Kelly fan and I must say he really lights up the screen in this movie, his film debut.  Paired with Judy Garland, they start out in vauderville as seperate acts, both dreaming of playing the Palace (New York) one day.  After a late night cup of coffee, Harry (Gene Kelly) plays a new song for Jo (Judy Garland) on the piano and she begins to sing the lyrics.  They both realise that they make a good duo and so, form a partnership, Hayden and Palmer.  There are lots of ups and downs as they play two bit towns waiting for their big break.  World War 1 breaks out, and Jo loses her only brother, so when Harry purposely breaks his hand to avoid his enlistment orders she says goodbye to him and goes on the road entertaining the troops.  Most of Harry`s vaudervillian friends have enlisted and he realises what a coward he is.  He tries to enlist in the Army, Airforce and the Marines but with his damaged had is rejected.  To try to make amends, he joins some old pals and goes to Paris to entertain the soldiers.  It is here that he finds Jo and eventually they get back together.  It is filled with some wonderful songs, including the title track, For me and my gal.  If you are a Gene Kelly fan, this this is for you.
