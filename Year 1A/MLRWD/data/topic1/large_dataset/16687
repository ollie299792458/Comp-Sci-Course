"Glendarry Glen Ross" movie is outstanding acting show which could probably be shown for acting students to learn the profession. It would probably go without notice but its acting made a difference. Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin lines are amazing to watch. They play so realistically. Not to mention other actors who are also great.
I watched this movie number of years ago but I am going to buy the dvd to own it and entertain myself from time to time.
I only had a hard time understanding the term which is revolving in the movie all the time. I am not sure if I am spelling it correctly. The characters talk about "leeds" or "weeds". Since English is not my native language I would appreciate if anyone could explain to me what it means? I could not find the right description in dictionary. It is the key word they are using in this movie. I would appreciate any explanantion from Amazon reviewers of this term. My email is: jarekmalinowski@hotmail.com
I highly recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates great acting.
