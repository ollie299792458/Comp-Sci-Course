2 fast 2 furious lives up to its title- somewhat. it isn't the fastest or the most furious, but it's airheaded and fluffy enough to move quickly without being attatched to the strings of an actual plot.  
But its lack of an intriguing storyline doesn't destroy its fun factor.  the souped up hot rods polished to a fine sheen speeding down the streets of miami make for some rather satisfying guilty pleasures.
And if you'd rather feast your eyes on something more than oversized hot wheels in a rainbow of colors, you won't be disappointed.  the men have the pleasures of drooling a little puddle over shapely women, but we girls definately aren't left out in the cold.
Studly Paul walker with his charmingly innocent grin, and his accomplis Tyrese with his toned body (and urge to constantly rip his shirt off) would make any girl faint (if they weren't sitting in a chair)
if you want something quick, that doesn't require too much thought, is loaded with eye candy, light hearted, fun, and will help you munch your way through your stale, overly buttery popcorn, than this movie is what you've been searching for.
