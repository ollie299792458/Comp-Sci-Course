So we're at home watching the movie, we're 24:45 minutes in (I know 'cuz I hit the pause button) and four or five of us are discussing whether this is a comedy or not.  Even the proponents that were calling it a comedy admitted that no one laughed in the first 24+ minutes.

So we look for the case to see how it's labeled but we had rented it from Redbox so there was no cover.

So I went to my home office, booted up the computer and fired up the 'ol internet just to see if this movie is labeled a comedy.  Now remember, there are six people sitting around, the movie paused, and we're not a very petty, argumentative group, but waiting for the net to boot up was more fun that continuing on with this dreck.

Okay, so it turns out that it is labeled as a comedy/drama.  Suffice it to say, not only did the "drama" aspects fail miserably but, an hour and a half later when the movie ended and we were finally out of our misery, no one had laughed at the "comedy" a single time either.

Remember, you've been forewarned.
