If this newer version of Cinema Paradiso were the original version of the story, it would probably rate as a mildly above average offering of Italian cinemia.  Worth seeing in the theater perhaps, but certainly not distinguished above the usual continental European fare of adult melodrama.  But as a "director's cut" of a magical masterpiece, this newer version is a huge hatchet job.  The term "more than I wanted to know" came to mind so many times.  This version force-feeds us so many details that ruin the mystery and magic of the original.  From Toto screwing the theater's resident prostitute, to his getting back together with his old flame later in life (with all of the cliched dilemmas of never being able to recapture the innocence of youth), to Alfredo's complicity in the deceipt that prevented their successful marriage early in life, all of the tawdry details that didn't need to get told get aired like so much dirty laundry.  The adolescent Toto doesn't even come across as convincingly heterosexual in this version.
I'm sure that many fans of the film will enjoy revisiting the world of Cinema Paradiso, and no doubt find many of the new revelations fascinating, and the extended time frame an indulgence. But who among us can honestly say that the understated magic of the original hasn't now been explained away, and that the innocence hasn't been tarnished beyond repair?  Now that we know all of the gritty details that got left on the cutting room floor, even the experience of watching the original has been sullied beyond repair.  Stay away from this version if you still want to watch the original with the same sense of wonder.
