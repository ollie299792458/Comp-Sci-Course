This documentary is absolutely full of facts(which you should double and triple check for yourself) about the western governments participation in state sponsored "Terrorism". Too few people know this and need to be shown this film! I've showed atleast 30 people that I know. Of course, I'm always doing things of that nature. The voice you will hear throughout this documentary is that of Alex Jones. I've listened to Alex's radio show for severaI years now and am accustomed to his Texas tone. The facts presented in this film are indisputable. The conclusions that Alex draws can be disputed, but there isn't much room to do so. One state sponsored terror act that Mr.Jones does not cover in this film is TWA flight 800, which was a disappointment for me. It was a disappointment because over 200 AMERICANS saw a missile hit the plane. And like Sept.11. 2001, orginazations/individuals helped cover it up. Popular Mechanics wrote a piece about TWA flight 800 as well. Of course! It was a glitch in the fuel tank. Give me a break. For those of you who are still blinded by the B.S., this film should help rake some of the poo from your eyes. There are many other films about such things, but in my opinion this is one of the best. Please, for the love of this REPUBLIC, not Democracy(Demos+Ocracy[Latin]=Mob Rule) see this film. After you've viewed the film, do some research on the parts you believe to be untrue(Don't be lazy). I'm sure that you will be astounded. I spent four years in the Marine Corps, so for those of you who want to label me as un-american, you had better do so from the safety of your keyboard. Peace and love to all.
