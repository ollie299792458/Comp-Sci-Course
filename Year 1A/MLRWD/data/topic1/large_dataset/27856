To expound on my title, this is a movie about kids prison!  Great topics we fill our kids with these days.  The wonderful model of a fair teacher, teaching the beauty of poetry, then commits suicide on screen after the sheriff says he loves a good lynching as the only black character in the movie suffers the slings and arrows of the time.

Please understand that for my son and I it was a great movie to stop at the constant barrage of deceit, unthinking injustice and poor choices of figures in authority. We'll wait at least till he's 12 to go into the adult themes.  I'm amazed the folks that have signed on in this leporasity of a film because of the kids that don't get the benefit of Rafe Esquith's ideal of guided childhood.  I was first introduced to this film as an acclaimed teacher of my THIRD grader was letting me know of "film day" after completion of the Texas state wide TAKS test.  And this passes for Disney family entertainment?  Rather more like didatic Kubrick or Scorsese.  Only after registering the above points and a screening with the principal was the film pulled on the grounds of unchallenged immorality.

PG-13 does not mean an adult is in the room when the movie is running, rather that points of good and bad ideas are expressed as they happen.  The bite of the rattler in the opening scene reminds me of Naomi Klein's  Shock and Awe techniques we suffer without really understanding.  The poor kids that just soak it in as long as it has a happy ending and miss the chance by opposing the injustices, to end them.  IMHO.
