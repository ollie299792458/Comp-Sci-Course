I, like so many others who have written, fell in love with this movie as a kid in the 60's. It scared the daylights out of me, but I loved it. It was the song that always stuck with me and when I got older I discovered it on vhs and it all came back. I'm 43 now and my 6 year old has watched the vhs tape since he was 3, and he loves it too. I found an original Disney poster for it on eBay and it hangs in my office. Considering I am a priest, I get a few laughs about it when people see it. Dr. Syn is one of the few portrayals of my calling on film that is not an embarassment.

Here's a piece of free advice that would make them a another fortune (and I only mention it because I would like to see it) Re-make it with Johnny Depp and adapt his character Capt. Jack. If you read the original novels, the Vicar became the dred pirate Capt. Clegg before returning to Dymchurch as their cleric and smuggling leader.

Oh and release this classic on DVD to boost the interest first.
