I Spit on your Grave is first and foremost, an awful title for a film. The word "art" should never again be associated with this contrived and melodramatic film. The rape scenes are filmed from the rapists' point of view, and are FAR too long, in the sense that after 20 minutes, they lose their power, thus it becomes pornography. According to this sexploitation movie, revenge is a churchoing solution to violence. Something unforgivably dull about this movie is that there is NO soundtack. You would think they would learn that music is powerful after the harmonica scene, but unfortunately not. "I'm telling you (the town) it's too peaceful" is an example of the laughable dialouge that painfully ensues.
  Save yourself the misery and instead buy the powerful, artistic rape film "Last House on the Left" which is great whatever you classify it as, horror, rape, revenge, or 70's darkness. But sadly, I Spit works on no levels, so don't waste you're money on it like I did.
  Last Note- I Spit on Your Grave shows the rape victim get dirtier as she is sexually assaulted, and she is olny clean when she kills her assailents 'gloriously'. In Last House on the Left, it is the killers that become dirty and discusting after destroying their victim's innocence and lives.
