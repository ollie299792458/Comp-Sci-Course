Jim Croce's CD was the very first CD someone who wanted to go on a date with me introduced me to.  At that time I thought it was "cheesy" music and gesture, and I returned it back promptly.  Shortly after, I heard one of the songs at a store, "Don't Mess Around with Jim." It sounded so upbeat; chills run through my body when I recalled why I heard it for the very first time.

The DVD that did not arrive when it was supposed to (Christmas Holiday '09) was still a very beautiful surprise and a gift to the man who introduced me to Jim Croce's music, and who is now my husband. The music and scenes as well as song descriptions by Mr. Croce brought happy tears to my eyes.  Also, the story his wife told was something I can relate to in my personal life.  She used the term that she was talking about "squash" while he was on a tour in "Holland" and how different their lives were. Yet they managed to survive that ordeal.  The song he wrote at night and read to his wife in the morning, "The words don't come, I need to tell you I love you in a song" or someting to that tune is very romantic and powerful.  His explanations of the poetic texts during his concerts (in a duo and a relatively small audience)and his soft, gentle eyes put so much more meaning to the music and to Croce's life itself.  I would highly recommend this DVD and CDs of this great artist whose life was cut short in a tragic accident way before his time.

I would NOT recommend the seller, because they did not keep their end of the deal and did not send the product with next day shipment, what I had paid for.  It is called cheating.
