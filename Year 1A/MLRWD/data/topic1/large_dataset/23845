When I first starting really listening and collecting music the artwork on Janis Joplin's album Big Brother & The Holding Company intrigued me. The art was 'in ya face', painful, and evocative. 'Keep On Truckin' was the catchphrase of the young. The doco Crumb is disturbing, funny, and at last gave me an understanding of how the artwork came about. Crumb himself is earthy to say the least, and has no inhibitions when it comes to his own honesty. His family and their background is truly disturbing (note that word again) and highlights the behaviour and expectations of a father figure who attempted and failed to instill his rigid disciplines on young kids. The dad epitomises a parent from post-WWII USA; a strict, unforgiving military approach to life that fails in epic proportions to produce healthy 'normal' kids - the kind of dysfuctional kids who in this day and age go out and shoot people. A dad so out of touch with reality that his sons creativity and genuis turned into a decidedly weird survival mode. The sons are intelligent, the mom is scary. Great doco/historical piece on a man and era that infected and shaped the 60s & 70s. Here's to you Crumb!
