I learned about these tapes at a Weight Watchers meeting.  A woman who had lost over 100 lbs recommended them.  I thought that if she could do it, so could I!
I have been using these tapes for 4 weeks now.  I can already see a difference in my arms, calves, and thighs.  I skipped the one mile tape and started with the two mile.  It is VERY easy to follow.  I am unco-ordinated and hate excersize videos where the routines are so complicated I feel like I get nothing out of them (by the time I get the step its onto another step).  
There are four basic steps besides walking-all easy and simple. Leslie switches between the steps constantly so you are not getting bored doing one for too long.  She also adds various arm movements (easy) to keep your interest.  The weighted balls definitely add to the intensity of the workout.
Leslie has real people doing the excersizes with her.  She always has one person doing half movements so if you are not ready for a full extension, you can follow this person.  She also has one person who is not using weights, so if you choose to skip the weights you can follow that person.
The tapes are conversational and move right along.  I was very surprised by how fast the three mile goes by.  I was reluctant to move from the 2 mile to the 3 mile, but was glad I did.  I alternate the tapes with walking outside.
I highly recommend this workout series.  I hate to excerisize, but feel these tapes are something I will stick with.  The hardest part of this program is filling the weights with water.  However, you do this once and never again!
Good luck!
