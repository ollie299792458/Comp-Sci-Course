I lost my 10th Season in a move, so I ordered it online to replace it. It was due at the beginning of September, but I received it almost a whole week in advanced! They definitely held their end of the deal, which was to ship it out and have the customer receive it within a few days. I was thrilled about that. I would have given 5 stars, but the packaging is what did it. It was taped together in packing tape, which would have been alright, but it wasn't tightly wrapped. Since it was really hot the day that I received it, it was almost like the tape melted on the picture side of the DVD's becuase it had moved around in transit. Also, the cases they used had no cover on them. This would have also prevented the melting tape on a hot day issue. Upon receiving it, I had to work around the sticky mess. It probably would have been better to use just regular CD cases or the paper sleeves. Even if they had wrapped it in rubber bands or used masking tape, like the ones you use when you paint on walls, instead of the packing tape. This would have solved that problem. I can't complain too much because it really was a good deal (I originally spent almost $40 when I first bought it new, & I bought it now for under $10), but the packaging needs to be tweaked a little bit.
