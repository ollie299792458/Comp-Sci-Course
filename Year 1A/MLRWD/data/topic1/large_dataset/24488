"Show Boat" was a revolution. It virtually changed musicals single-handedly by integrated the storyline into the music, allowing the plot to be advanced in the songs rather than just having a "revue." That has probably been forgotten or overlooked but what can't be overlooked are the phenomenal songs by Jerome Kern. One of the best scores ever written boasts so many standards that it boggles the mind. I found myself singing "Make Believe" for days. "Can't Help Lovin' That Man of Mine" is also wonderful and "Old Man River" gives me chills evertime I hear the climax.

Oscar Hammerstein II writes the lyrics and book and, even though he later enjoyed tremendous success with Richard Rodgers, he makes a great partner for Kern. Even this reveals Kern's singular genius as he colaborated with so many lyricists and excelled with them all.

The cast is adequate to good with no one in particular standing out (with the possible exception of Ava Gardner) but make no mistake-the music is the thing.
