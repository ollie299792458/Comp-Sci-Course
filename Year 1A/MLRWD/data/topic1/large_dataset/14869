Sheesh, enough of the negative reviews already.  This movie simply rocks!  I never read the book and probably never will so I really don't give a hoot if it doesn't follow the canon.  So why should you get this?  The story, which takes center stage over special effects (unlike say, Star Wars I-III) is engaging... on one hand an allegory of our dependence on foreign oil (spice = oil, Dune = Middle East), on another, the ascension of a messianic/warrior-god figure and the cross purposes of the parties that surround him: the witches (establishment religion) want to control him, the emperor and the guild navigators (political/economic powers) want to destroy him, and the Fremen (the masses) will die for him to attain liberty... and control of their destiny.  This movie also does well as a pure play sci-fi adventure.  Lots of dark humor too.  Gotta love the Baron ("that floating fat man"), his fetish for boys, and his disease-ridden face.  Finally, the Dune soundtrack just rules: Toto performed the entire score except Prophecy Theme which was by Brian Eno (personally, I love the scenes in which this theme is highlighted... such as the arrival at Dune and the water of life scene... very atmospheric).  Enjoy it for what it is.  EE has a few bits tossed in which throws off the pacing of the theatrical version IMO.
