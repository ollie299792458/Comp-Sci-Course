I enjoyed this because I like to see personalities that can "stand strong" even in the most adverse conditions. Tohru, the main character, is exactly that personality.

That being said I do have to admit it was funny but there were few "belly laughs". It was enjoyable but not an "anime find" that I'll talk to others about.

In addition it isn't the kind of anime that makes you eager to watch the next episode.

You don't mind watching it but you're not staying up until your eyes bleed from lack of sleep because you "have to" see what happens next.

I gave it 4 stars because it was better than OK... but still... I would say more like 3.5 stars...

I can't think of anything to compare this anime to. It's like a reverse harem anime where a girls is the center and men are her harem.

Also there are some strangely feminine male characters. Momeeji being one who is all cuddly cute but is a boy who wears girls close (earrings and all).

Would I buy it again after seeing it? Most likely...

Did I rush home from work to see what is happening in the next episode? No ...

This is a casual fun easy to watch anime.
