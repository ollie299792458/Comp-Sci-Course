Only now and then i watch tv, but when i do i make sure i don't waste my time, i had 2 movies choice, and i choosed this one, but the sort of abstract start almost made me swich to the other, i was glad i didn't. Today i ordered the dvd for me to keep. The last i bought was "Million Dollar Baby" which when tv listing doesnt agree with me i watched many times. What people thought about the above movie to be an extremely depressing story, i found it extremely inspiring instead. And now I will watch "my first mister" even when tv agrees with my taste and i will again and again. There is nothing to say except you will want to remember how it feels to be part of life. Once you were young you remembered, today we grown up now and then need help. This is one of my help to remember. The movie should not be missed. Far from perfect but so much perfect.

What nobody said in this reviews is, that the lady didn't simply get to know this man and with time they starts to like eachother, instead she found him during her disturbing life and from the first second between so many more she could choose better, the choosed him for unknown reasons, and never let go.
