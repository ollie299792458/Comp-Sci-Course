I used to watch some parts of these movies and there are a few I could remember and I'm going to name a few occurences. 1.The scene where the monkey was getting its brains bashed out. 2.The scene where some guy was getting mauled to death by a bear. 3.The scene where some people where jumping out of a burning building. and the final scene I remember in one of the movies which number 4 in my memory countdown was the one where some odd guy cut off a few chickens heads and let there headless bodies run about till they all trip. The reason I gave you a few scene countdown was because I wanted to let the people know that there not dealing with an ordinary movie oh no no no no no NO!!! What you hold in your hands is the most revoulting, horrific, and ingeniouse movie ever to be made by man. the movies ae deffinetly not  for the youngsters to watch it will make any strong gore loving and horror loving fanatics jump right out of there wits. and the scary thing about these little dark gems is that some of these deaths are REAL.If you read some of the previouse reviews some say that the movie has some real scenes like the auptopsies and the animal scenes and that some of the people scenes are frauds(to me they look all real, fake or not it is the idea of death and doom that brought some these dark film galleries into are minds.) wich is hard to come by because all the deaths looks so real yet there is another movie called Faces of Death:Fact or fiction which you can find these special tapes too if your lucky. in this part the only thing I have to say is decide for yourself that it is real or not, decide what is bad or worse. Yet I also feel bad that the people and animals that gave there lives for these gore fest of deaths on tapes is that they died for a bad reason which can and will be a possible answers in all of our minds. After you buy and see the movies try asking yourself was this a nightmare or a dream gone wrong the outcome is up to you.
