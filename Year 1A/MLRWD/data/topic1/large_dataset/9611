Aerosmith has done it again. For anyone who has had second thoughts about attending an Aerosmith concert, this amazing DVD puts those doubts to bed. Album after album, Aerosmith has lived up to their own and the fans' expectations, and now to add to the momentum, they give us "You Gotta Move". This DVD chronicles the backstage experiences first hand, a history/summary of the bands' past, and also shows that America's greatest rock band hasn't lost their edge. Aerosmith is the best "classic rock" band of its time as far as retaining fans who became attatched to their music in the early 70's, and still to this day attracting a whole new generation of fans. Having attended an Aerosmith concert in 2004, I can honestly say without a doubt it's an experience that will put you on a high for a long time afterwards. This is true for "You Gotta Move" as well. Their sound is unmatched, the music unforgettable and legendary. As far as the voice-over aspect of the DVD, how can you possibly refer to yourself as a fan unless you know the history of the music you are listening to? Sure the main attraction is the music itself, but listening to the bands' personal thoughts about their music and how they made it this far helps everyone better understand and respect the music. I highly recommend "You Gotta Move" to everyone.
