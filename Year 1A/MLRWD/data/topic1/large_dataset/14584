Let me start out with this: If you are looking for a movie with Victorian British action, a la Zulu, but with a more modern touch, this is your movie. However, this movie is not in the class of, say, Zulu, Gunga Din or The Man who Would be King. I suggest all three of those movies over this one. I have not seen the older version of the book, but I am told it was better as well. There are a couple reasons why this movie is outmatched. First of all, while it uses the basis of the book, it does not go to far in to it. The book is more a social piece than an action movie, and while I do recomend the book, it is not for you action fans. This movie has some incredible action scenes in it, most notably the square formation bit, which you can see heavily centered on in the trailer. It's not to great on the plot side. It simply doesn't take enough time to go through what's going on, and I have a feeling if you haven't read the book, you'll be slightly confused. Third or fourthly (I've lost count) this movie is not to spectacuarly acted. Wes Bently, Heath Ledger, and Kate Hudson all do their jobs adequatly, but the one to truly stand out is Djimon Hounsou, but his character, Abou Fatma, isn't even in the book, and this African Mistic bit that he has in The Four Feathers gets redundant.
Once again: If you are looking for a movie with Victorian British action, a la Zulu, but with a more modern touch, this is your movie. However, this movie is not in the class of, say, Zulu, Gunga Din or The Man who Would be King. I suggest all three of those movies over this one.
