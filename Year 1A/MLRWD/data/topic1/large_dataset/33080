However, I will try to come up with some that do some justice to this amazing movie. First of all I'm not big into romantic movies. The only reason I went to see this one is that it had beatles music in it. WOW! While I was sitting in the theatre I was thinking to myself: "How can a movie be this great?" I mean the movie is perfect! The acting is superb, and not only are a few of the actors great, all of them are. The story is flawless, it takes the conventional love story and revs it up. The best part of this movie is how visually unique it is. At times it looks as though you are watching something that a person on crack would see. The blending of the beatles music is perfect. The songs go right along with the story. They did change the beat to some of the songs and sang them differently but they pulled it off very well. In fact the soundtrack was so good that I drived for and hour just to get one. As soon as the DVD comes out I am going to be first in line to get it. If you like beatles music I highly recomend that you get this movie. If you don't then still get the movie because it has a perfect story that is, well, perfect! You can't find a better movie than this one right here.
