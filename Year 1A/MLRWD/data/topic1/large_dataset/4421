The version I purchased from Amazon is the Milestone edition (not the Kino). Prior to purchasing, I read other reviews which said the contrast is better on the Milestone edition, the cropping isn't as tight, the picture quality is generally better and the music is far superior.

The only edition at present that I've seen is the Milestone, but I can tell you that it lived up to its hype. The musical score by Carl Davis is brilliant and supplements the film beautifully. The picture quality and restoration are both first-rate; it's easy to see why audiences flocked to see Clara and her co-star, Antonio Moreno. Incidentally, I enjoyed seeing Moreno in this very-different role from the one he played opposite Greta Garbo a couple of years before in THE TEMPTRESS (available in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S4IKG">TCM Archives: The Garbo Silents Collection (The Temptress / Flesh and the Devil / The Mysterious Lady)</a>).

IT, in case you're wondering, is (or at least *includes*) 'sex appeal.' This was a more polite way of talking about it...and sometimes subtlety doesn't hurt. It certainly doesn't injure THIS film.

Even though this edition is out-of-print, it's worth pursuing. Kino makes a great product and I have a great many films from them, but if you can lay hands on the Milestone edition, do it.
