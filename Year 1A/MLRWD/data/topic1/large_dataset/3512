Classic B.S. story about rich girls playing tourist in the big scary gang world. It was just laughably poor to watch the actors have such difficulty mastering the art of being so badly written, but the dice scene just pushed it from hilarious to disgusting. Bijou Phillips character obviously didn't know that once you toss dice to see how many people you HAVE to sleep with to join the gang, this takes away any right you have to decide who gets to enter what orifice and when.  What she assumes is 3 men one at a time (trashy, yes, but she agrees), turns suddenly into a very unwanted very painful gangbang. Anne Hathaway hears her friend screaming and resisting, storms into the room and pulls her out. Later in the film she proceeds to tell Bijou's character that this was NOT rape because she threw the dice, and she should get over it.  So...she does.

Be careful! The minute you agree to ONE situation, that means you automatically agree to anything they want. At least, that's what Havoc would have you believe. In the film's defense, it's a piece of garbage and I've never actually met anyone else who's seen it, so I suppose the message can be tossed into the trash bin as well.
