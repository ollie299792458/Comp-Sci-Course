Another movie that I liked and critics were hard on. The film is great until you get closer to the ending. I thought the ending was a bit lame and that the "mutant" son was not all that believable. Scary but not totally believable.

Despite some problems I had with the ending and the creature, I loved the the sense of mystery, suspense, and creepiness I got early on in the film. I like the idea of using a carnival setting for a film. Maybe I can't explain it as well as I'd like to, but there's something about carnivals and some of the people who work at them that is dark and criminal. The two teenaged couples are obviously out for a night of fun. Typical teenage stuff. This movie was made over 20 years ago, but our culture has changed little since then.

The best part of the movie to me is when the four teenagers are hiding in the funhouse, and they happen to witness a murder. They become trapped in the funhouse and realize that they are in extreme danger. I think that the most scary part of the film is when one of the kids (who is in hiding with the others) drops his lighter as the "mutant" and his father are having a father to son talk about murder and how to fix the problem. Of course that gets the attention of the dad and he realizes that there is someone else in the funhouse...someone who knows about the murder. He tries to coax them out of hiding and says that he just wants to give the lighter back. That doesn't work, of course.
