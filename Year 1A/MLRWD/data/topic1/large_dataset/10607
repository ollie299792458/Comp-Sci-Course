James Bond is back in this solid entry in the series, and is sadly underrated and underappreciated by many, despite all the things going for it. For starters, Roger Moore (in his last Bond role) is charming and engaging here; despite criticisms of his age (58 at the time), he plays the role with aplomb. Tanya Roberts was attacked for a stilted, screeching performance, but I suspect it was also the way the role was written, as a one-dimension damsel in distress (and Tanya does look stunning here). Then there's Grace Jones as villianess May Day; she is by far the highlight of the whole movie. All it takes is an upward turn of her eyes for Jones to show genuine menace; she is flashy, strong, unique, and makes a fabulous villian. In fact, if she was the main villian (and thus allowing more screen time) this would have been a 5-star classic. Unfortunately the main villian duties fall to Christopher Walken, who, while a fine actor, has played this villian role so often one gets the impression he could do it in his sleep. Other complaints include the lengthy running time, but in my opinion the film moves at a quick clip through many exciting set pieces, particularly the well-staged final battle atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Also of note is the addictive theme song from Duran Duran, well executed in the glow-in-the-dark opening credit sequence. With all this going for it, how much more entertainment value could you want?
