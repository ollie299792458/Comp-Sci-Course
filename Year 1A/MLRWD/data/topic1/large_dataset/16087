This film is a classic. While not the first to explore the "toys come to life and are evil" idea, this film still stands up today. Dispite it's more comedic sequals and countless imitators, the original Child's Play is suspenseful even though you know the doll's alive, because you're waiting for the moment when it reveals itself to be.

The story focuses on a boy named Andy Barkley, and his mother buys him a 'Good Guy' doll off a street peddler. Andy seems convinced the doll is talking to him, and after a series of murders his mother also becomes suspicious. It's only a matter of time before the Doll reveals it's true nature, and proceeds to stalk the family.

This Blu-Ray package also includes the 20th Anniversary DVD, so if you don't have a Blu-Ray player but are thinking about getting one, get this anyway so you don't end up buying the same film twice. Both the DVD and Blu-Ray include the same special features, with the only difference being the Blu-Rays fancier menus.

The Blu-Ray's video quality is naturally better, with images appearing sharper with more detail, and less grain than on the DVD version. The audio is also improved, with both discs including various commentaries.

There are some making-of documentaries and some small clips of a CGI Chucky saying various things. Although I really hope that this CGI Chucky has nothing to do with an apparent re-make, it doesn't look very good!

Even without the extras, the film is amazing and a classic. It has earnt its place in movie history as one of those films that changed the way we think, the same way Jaws made us scared of the water. This Blu-Ray release does a great job in keeping a whole new generation of film viewers scared of their toys, and that's just perfect!
