I used to be the sort that could not watch a movie w/subtitles or would avoid foreign flicks thinking of them as elitist.  No more.  After watching this movie for the first time in 2010 I literally moved to Buenos Aires and lived there for two years.  Although my Spanish still isn't good enough to fully enjoy this classic film w/o the aid of subtitles it began me on a voyage of cultural exploration and self-transformation.  This movie may not have the same effect on others but I'm confident that the intriguing storyline, edge-of-your-seat suspense, underlying sexual tension and a twist that would surprise even Hitchcock, will prove reason enough to watch this film

The Secret In Their Eyes is a movie that doesn't fit any one genre.  Love Story/Romance, Suspense, Historical Fiction, Detective Flick or even Buddy Movie.  If none of those reasons prove enough than the world class acting of the best Argentine Actors' Ricardo Darin, Soledad Villamil and Guillermo Francella or strong supporting performances by Pablo Rago and Javier Godino should help to attract those who have never seen these staples of Argentine Cinema on film.  I could also cite numerous other aspects of writing, acting, location or cinematography that should prompt at least a cursory viewing of this memorable classic but I hope you've gotten the gist of it by now.  This is simply a movie that can't afford NOT to watch.  My gratitude to all that were involved in the novel and film.  I hope my review makes you smile.
