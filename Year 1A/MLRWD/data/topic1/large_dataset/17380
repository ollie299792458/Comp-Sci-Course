I really wanted to like this movie.  Very much like the fate of the Army of the Potomac, it is a tragedy that so little was accomplished over so much time by the people at the head of this effort, considering the outstanding raw material they had to work with.

The flaws have been catalogued and commented on by other reviewers.  I will confine myself to saying that this depiction of Stonewall Jackson is downright bizarre.  Not eccentric.  Bizarre.  It is utterly unlike any account of the man that I have ever read.

The obvious and important thread between this movie and the vastly superior _Gettysburg_ is the inclusion of the character of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, his brother, Tom, and "Buster" Kilrain-- along with the 20th Maine.  This is, of course, consistent with the novel and viewers can be thankful for such a merciful distraction.

If you are to derive any enjoyment of this film at all, you will need to focus on certain scenes.

The candid talk between Chamberlain and his wife Fanny tracks with what we can know of such an intimate relationship.  It is also a showcase for Mira Sorvino who, in a few minutes, outshines virtually every other performer in this film.

The Battle of Fredericksburg is the most watchable of the three battles covered, though I do not recall ever reading of the Irish Brigade retiring in disorder after being shot to pieces on Marye's Heights.  God knows they could have, but they did not, and the film does them a disservice in depicting them as near routing off the field.

The soundtrack is disappointingly mediocre with the stunning exception of Mary Fahl's "Going Home," which is so evocative and hauntingly beautiful that I went out and bought her CD.

Regrettably, the few really well done parts of this film accentuate the deficiencies of the whole.
