This movie fails as a horror movie for the following reasons:

1) Every time something "scary" is supposed to happen they take as long as they possibly can to do something to try and build up the suspense. By the time they do get to the "scary" part you find yourself saying "well, I knew that was coming" or just laughing.

2) One of the best parts of early on in the book was done terribly in the movie. When Ben is describing what happened to him the first time he went into the Marsten house, it was so eerie in the book. In the movie you just see him sitting there talking about it.

3) The part that I most anticipated to be scary, wasn't scary at all. The part where the vampire kid scratches at the window was apperently a "moment of pure terror" even though it, well was laughable like most of the other scenes with vampires.

4) Most importantly, it was boring! Horror movies are supposed to keep your heart racing. Well this one was so long and slow and didn't get good until the last 35 minutes. But the movie was over 3 hours long so 35 minutes wasn't going to save it.

But it wasn't all bad...

For a made-for-cable movie, the acting was surprisingly good and for 1979 the visuals and makeup were outstanding! and one part made me jump!

Well, I guess it is true that Tobe Hooper hasn't done much good other than POLTERGEIST and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!
