What is obvious from the beginning of this movie is not necessarily that it 'borrows' from Ray Charles, Johnny Cash etc., but that it borrowing from the movies made about those singers.  Many of the sets are similiar and it mostly reminded me of the Scary Movie spoofs.  That said, the writers evidently found ways to insert comedic moments into Dewey's childhood, although most of the jokes hinged on how sad or pathetic things were for him, such as as being poor and having no appropriate toys to play with.

I particularly loved how Dewey would say he was only fifteen years old, since he looks like a 40 year old man when he says it.  Most of the humor was dumb, I'll admit, but still on target.  The beatles spoof was priceless, especially Jack Black as Paul McCartney.  Another great cameo was Jack White as a foul-tempered, arrogant and hungry Elvis.

The lyrical content of the songs were downright goofy, but each and every one sounded like it could have been an authentic song from the period.  His Bob Dylan 'phase' is hysterical and I love the lyrics of this song about 'the 3 eyed monkey getting closer to his toaster oven life'.  When his band-mates are confused about the meaning, Tim Meadows tells them angrily that this song 'is very deep'.

Jonah Hill makes an appearance as the ghost of Dewey's deceased brother. Although he died as a young boy, he appears full-grown and inexplicably overweight.  He appears at odd times in Dewey's life and is sarcastic and insulting enough to make it each visit worthwhile.

This movie could almost be a real biography of a real man and sometimes it is easy to forget that Dewey Cox is a parody and nothing more.
