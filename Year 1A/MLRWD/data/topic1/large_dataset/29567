... the romantic, Mariane Dashwood (Kate Winslet), exclaims to her wary younger sister Margaret while walking up a grassy hill on a windy day while the dark clouds of approaching rain hover nearby.  So goes a scene from "Sense and Sensibility", Emma Thompson and Ang Lee's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  The story, which takes place early 1800's England, focuses on the Dashwood sisters, Marianne, about 16 years old, and her older sister Eleanor, played by Emma Thompson.

After their father dies, the Dashwood family, including the mother and the three sisters lose their fortune and begin to embark upon a more modest life, being forced to move from their estate to a relative's "snug" cottage.

The film, in essence, follows Eleanor and Marianne as they are thrown into love with their likely and unlikely suitors,  the humble and slightly bumbling, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and the tormented yet dependable Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Another key element is the loving bond between the two sisters.

From the sweeping and lush English countryside to the historic streets of London, we see the two young women experience infatuation, passion, heartbreak, patience, wisdom, and finally, love.  Emma Thompson's screenplay is both funny and touching, sometimes pointing out how the times were hard for women.  She does not follow the book religiously but does an amazing job in capturing the essence of the Dashwood girls and their struggle to live a full life amidst their limitations of both class and sex.

The sets and the exterior scenery are beautiful, the acting amazing throughout the entire cast (including a younger yet still brooding Hugh Laurie).  It sounds like a cliche but it's true, you will laugh, cry and fall in love through the eyes of the Dashwood sisters.
