Just a great film! The imagery was stark and brooding, pools of light the only interruption to this dark world of black and grey. All the characters were there and rather then follow a single hero (save perhaps the murderer, stalking his prey) there was a multitude caught in this web, all with parts to play. Echoes of later 'greats' are framed here and still find use in cinema today (the use of angle, shadow, expression and sound or the juxtaposition of imagery and stereotypes: the innocent; the monster; the cagey detective; the thief). No music other then the whistled notes on the murderer's lips breaks the often silent street scape. The additions of extra scenes cut from the original release are great but often slow the pace and interrupt the mounting pressure, however the quality of the picture is wonderful, no silver tones lost in the haunting and beautiful B/W images, and clear voices throughout. Peter Lorre - those eyes: two frightened pools in the dark!

Ah, such a great way to spend an afternoon. I will watch this again when my desire calls for something more then the splash of red on a pavement, which too often today's suspense thrillers offer. Worth every dollar and more!!
