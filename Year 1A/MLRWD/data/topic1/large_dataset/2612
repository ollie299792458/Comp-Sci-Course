This has always been a great favorite among fans of the Doctor, and also a moment of great sadness.  Sarah Jane has long been the best loved of all the Doctor's companions, and her heartbreaking departure has long left a hole in the hearts of her many fans.

Now that this important story is finally available, it is a must for all Doctor Who fans, particularly those who have only recently discovered the doctor in his 9th and 10th incarnations.  Apart from the tiny "blip" in the storyline (K-9 & Company) where the Doctor ships K-9 to Sarah for a Christmas present, and when Sarah has a freak-chance encounter with several other incarnations of the Doctor (The Five Doctors), we have been left for decades with a shoe that never dropped, and countless fanzines trying to answer the questions of what was really between the Doctor and Sarah, why he really left her behind, what she did afterwards, etc.

"School Reuinion" finally answers these questions.  I urge the younger fans, who are discovering the relationship between Sarah and the Doctor for the first time, to buy a copy of "Hand of fear" and any one of a dozen earlier stories with Sarah and the 4th (and 3rd) Doctor.  We all now know that Sarah really was in love with the Doctor, and we also know why the Doctor could not allow himself to love her in return.  We all "knew" these things, but now it has been made part of the official canon.

"Hand of fear" and "School reunion" are Doctor Who at its best.
