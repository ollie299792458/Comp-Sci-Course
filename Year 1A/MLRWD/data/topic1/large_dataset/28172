I just got the DVD yesterday, and expected to see something of the scene alluded to by Parker and Stone between (then Pres. candidates) George Bush and John Kerry. In a word, NO... it is not on the DVD. I saw two different versions at the theater, and this is what was originally released. The 2nd time I saw the movie the love scene with Gary and Lisa was cut in half. The DVD has the full version.

The movie was great, even more laughs than before because now you can slow down and go back and see for yourself... but the Special Features offer more viewing pleasure than the movie. The wealth of hidden objects in every and I do mean EVERY scene are exactly what they tell you in the feature... you will sit up with the DVD ALL NIGHT LONG finding them. There are HUNDREDS of things hidden in the background.. marijauna plants for trees, palm trees made out of dollar bills, the list is almost endless.

The technical work of evolving, manipulating and filming the puppets and all the supporting model work is fabulous and worth the price of the DVD alone. I looked forward to buying this one for a long time, and it is a home run.
