So many of these reviews have really piled on the sludge.  Relax, this is a good movie!  All right, so it's a rather loose cinematic interpretation of Golding's novel.  That's what the film medium allows for.  The cinematography is sumptuous, the pace of the movie quick, the story absorbing, the message of malicious cruelty's natural advantage easy to read.  The young actors give very fine performances--the villain Jack is superb--and they should all get extra credit for having to do so much of this movie in their underwear.  As their uniforms and their old sense of selves deteriorate, the boy-cadets are reduced to their jockeys: and then in turn their jockeys are reduced to filthy scraps of cloth once they run off to join Jack's camp in the wild.  With their painted faces and matted hair this virtual nakedness makes the transformation to the savage state disturbingly complete.  If you like movies with a strong story-line and good cinematography, I recommend this (with reservations for children under 12).
