Watching Alien last night for the first time in a while, I noticed that there are things that might take away from immersion in the film, just for example my wife mentioned the cheesy music sound-track that seemed like it belonged in a movie even older than Alien (1979) and the computer effects that in 1979 were seemingly state of the art, look a bit hokey by what we are used to today, and of course the film is set in the future.

However where the film continues to succeed, is the realistic way the crew interacts, like a real gender mixed factory work team, and the management and non management crew interactions, even though they are Officer ~ Enlisted, this is a commercial ship and really it came off genuine for me.

The one great thing that I loved about this movie and the next is the anticipatory anxiety it so expertly draws out by making you think something will happen and then it may or may not, just like in life. In this, I think Ridley Scott, really hits the mark and changes the way we (at least I) think about what makes a good scary movie.

Sigourney Weaver is so wonderful as the Heroine Ellen Ripley, that I can't praise her enough; she comes across believable, tough and vulnerable, but ultimately tenacious and able to get the job done. I remember reading before that the alien in this film was a metaphor for how cancer can strike at any time etc. I don't know about all that, but what I do know, is this is a movie that requires only a bit of suspension of disbelief to create a thoroughly frightening movie watching experience.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good scare.
