A Robocop; a police officer that's part man and part machine; isn't a bad idea. Even given the malfunctions that are bound to happen, it has many advantages over a regular person in a uniform. There's a point here in which a man; a potential rapist; is holding a woman at knife-point. A regular cop would have to hold fire to avoid the risk of shooting the victim by mistake. But even with the woman struggling about in panic, Robocop is able to aim between her legs and shoot the man in the groin without hitting her. It's a risky move that takes the careful calculation of a sophisticated robot mind.

He also has super-human strength. He's able to bend the barrel of a gun with his bare hand. So the violent criminals of Detroit don't stand a chance while Robocop is on the force. The problem is the psychological baggage from the part of him that's human. He used to be a normal cop until he was gunned down by a notorious street gang. Now he's essentially dead; a man with a loving wife and kid replaced by a set of computer codes, prime directives and a dry corny sense of humor. But he still has memories, and emotions, and that, along with an open mouth area, makes him somewhat vulnerable.
