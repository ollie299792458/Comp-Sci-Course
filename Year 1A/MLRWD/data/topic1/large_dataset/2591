A few days after I finished reading Dear John I rented the movie with a free movie credit from Amazon.  The movie was okay, but as usual the book was better.  I did enjoy the movie because I enjoy a good love story and I did cry at some points, but it lacked any real "spark."

First of all, if you read the book you'll find that the movie is way different.  The general gist of the story is the same, but many of the details, character stories, etc. are totally different.  The ending is also completely different than the ending of the book, although I think the movie ended the way I would have preferred the book to end.

Also, the acting was pretty terrible.  I generally like Amanda Seyfried and I've seen her do better, and Channing Tatum couldn't seem to get the southern accent down very well...half the time it sounded like weird British accent.  The acting just didn't really flow, and the storyline was way too choppy.  The movie seemed to rush through the events in the beginning of the story, which I felt was the most important and enjoyable part of the book.

Did I hate the movie? No, and if you haven't seen it yet it's worth renting for the night.  But I personally wouldn't spend the money to purchase the DVD.
