You know its odd to think that it takes a documentary to humanize a totally human entity, one that has been around for decades. Computers do a lot of things for us yet they don't write newspaper articles, although a lot of people may think they do.  And that is what is fascinating about Page One. It lends faces and stories to the stories and the words that create the New York Times, both online and in print. I don't live in the New York area, I live in Long Beach, Ca, yet I read the New York Times many times a day because it is a publication that I trust.  And what I like about this documentary is that it tries to merge all of the issues that the newspaper business as a whole has and ones that media companies face all together. Where is the future? Is the future free? And if not, how much should it cost? These and many other questions that aren't going away any time soon. Page One gives you a glimpse inside the newspaper, writers and editorial meetings of how decisions are made at the Times.

One of my contentions with new media is that they say that legacy publications like the Times edit what readers get in the paper. And that new media allows the uninterrupted flow of information to the end user.  And I say, yes, that is what I  paying for, somebody with the knowledge and experience to craft a story that is understandable with facts, and even some opinion that give it credit. I'm purchasing the experiences of the person who wrote the story, and even their reputation.

I've never received the print edition of the paper, but I am devoted follower of the publication and the people who work for it. I'm glad the Times went to a pay site and I hope that it helps keep them around for decades to come.
