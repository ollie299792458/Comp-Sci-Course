We've all waited a while to see movies from Fox on Blu-ray, but this one was certainly worth the wait.

I'd say the most amazing thing about this movie is the 3-D pop to an absolutely immaculate picture.  Dark scenes, like the starfield and planets in the beginning title sequences and the night skylines of NYC really sparkle.  There is no edge-enhancement or pixelization to be found anywhere in the feature.

Bright outdoors scenes like the wedding, and the F4 battle with the Silver Surfer are pure demo material.

The lossless DTS-HDMA is another showcase soundtrack from Fox.  Although I can only hear the DTS 1.5 mbps core with my current setup, I can hear the music, rear surround and effects in such a rich presentation that it reminded me of my theatrical viewing of this movie.

There is an awful lot of extra content that I have not begun to explore yet, but the Galactus game is interesting.

Some of the other reviewers here mentioned problems playing the movie.  I can understand their frustration, but the insert inside the case clearly advises every viewer to update the software on their Blu-ray player.  I would not fault the movie or even Fox studios for this problem, but most likely the player manufacturer's who don't have current firmwares that can play this disc.  (Currently only LG and Samsumg are having issues.)  I played the movie without a hitch on my Sony BDP-S1 and my PS3.  I will mention that the BDP-S1 had firmware that was 2 versions older than the latest.  The player handled it flawlessly both before and after I updated to the latest version.  It is reported that the Panasonic, Sony, and Pioneer players are working well with this disc.

With the stellar picture and sound quality, extra content and games, this disc is truly worth a purchase if you like this type of film!
