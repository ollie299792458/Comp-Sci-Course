I first saw portions of "Peter and the Wolf" on PBS, and immediately wanted to purchase a copy. I was dismayed to find out that it was not available in REGION 1 format. I am glad it is now.  Suzie Templeton's short film is a example of the sustaining power and depth of Prokofiev's program music. The synthesis between the score and visual is seamless although the score was written decades ago. In this format, the descriptive nature of the music itself is clearly exemplified and personified. Film music is often written in response to the visual, while here the process is reversed. Templeton's greatest achievement is allowing the viewer to experience the complexity of this piece that Prokofiev ultimately wrote for children.

Furthermore, the extras included fill out the DVD package. A highlight is the documentary about the use of the "Peter and the Wolf" film as an educational tool to teach elementary school children about music, art, and the relationship between the two.

The film is not only entertaining it is educational.

Highly recommended to those interested in music education, animation buffs, and Russian music fans.
