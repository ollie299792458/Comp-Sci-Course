Being a fan since 1981 I gave up after '86-'88 when it all started sounding the same to me. And the last CD I REALLY liked was Powerslave (actually album at the time!!). But a friend has this and I must say I liked it a lot and several new songs immediately caught my ear!!! And when I found that "Bloodbrothers" and "Dream of Mirrors" were off the same CD I went and bought "Brave New World" and really enjoyed it. It reminds me of the classic era and I really don't understand the fans underrating this CD. Oh well.

It also has a pretty good representation of older material though I have several better versions of my all time Favorite - "Hallowed Be Thy Name". The band is in top form and it's VERY refreshing to hear that one of THE great voices in metal hasn't diminished with age like so many others!! Bruce must have a secret that Coverdale, Gillan, etc, etc don't know about!!!

But, as you can guess from the title of this review, I won't be truly happy until they pull their heads out and release the classic "Live After Death" on 5.1 DVD; I have just about worn out the VHS!!! Bruce, Steve, Dave...guys.....come on...please!!!

An edit - as I'm sure all Maiden fans know by now - Live After Death is FINALLY out!! Ya-hoooooo!!!! Took long enough though!
