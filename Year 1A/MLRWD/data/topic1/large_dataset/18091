"The General" and "The Twilight Zone" are, in my opinion, the two most brilliantly conceived films ever made. "The General" keeps you glued to the screen, with sight gag after sight gag. Keaton was a genius and this was never more evident than this movie. Kino did a super job of offering three different music scores, each giving new life to the film. I personally recommend Robert Isreal's score as it's more comical than the "adventuresome" score Carl Davis did. Don't buy the cheap release with generic music score and non-restored film print. It is this Kino print that you want to view.

"The Twilight Zone" is another of my favorites with brilliant camera angles and cinematography. I have yet to read a Buster Keaton book that reveals a "making-of" of The General but there is one superb book for "The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic" by Martin Grams. Also available on Amazon.com. Looking for two Christmas gifts that are top-notch, 100% polished and certain to please any film buff? Get this DVD and that book. It certainly made my birthday last month.
