Harrison Ford is an ingenious inventor who struggles with the American capitalism. So he takes his ideas and his family to live in the jungle at the 'Mosquito Coast' where he thinks the natives will be enourmously grateful for his ice-making machine. The story is told by his oldest son who does not judge on his fathers decisions for a very long time.

But in the jungle things do not turn out as expected. The plots has some unexpected turns and I really liked the characters which are very un-hollywood like, e.g. no one really is a hero or the glamorous saviour. However, during the families stay in the jungle, the father more and more looses contact to reality and gets obsessed with living from scratch, forcing his children and wife to follow him. I can understand that his wife is loyal to him, but I can at no point believe that she, as a loving mother, does not protect her children from their father. In my opinion, this is where the story looses its authenticity. The end is somewhat shallow, but you will have to look at it to make up your mind.

It is a very interesting movie with excellent actors and I can really recommend it if you are not looking for Hollywood-Drama or an Happy-End.

As to the features of the DVD, if I remember correctly there are none.
