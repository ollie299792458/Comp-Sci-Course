Okay, the biggest problem with this film is that it was actually made.  To have any Halloween fan actually believe that the "human" man that Michael swapped his clothes with could survive being rammed by a van, thrown down a hill, and then CRUSHED against a tree by the same van is obviously out to lunch.  Why did he NOT remove the mask while he was still inside the van?  If it wasn't supposed to be Michael, then why when he (the supposed human ambulance attendant) crashed thru the windshield did he sit up in the road like Michael?  That's because in H20 it WAS Michael.  Talk about doing anything to make a fast buck.  I was absolutely disgusted by the first 15 minutes of this movie and ended up getting a refund.  I did not buy this dvd because, in my opinion, it is the biggest waste of money.  And then to insult the fans (myself included), they kill off Laurie and make her character so ignorant.  As far as I'm concerned, Halloween, Halloween II, and H20 is the complete story.  No man in black, thorn cult crap, no babies in jars, etc...  H4 was actually good back in 1988, but since then even that movie has been so tarnished by H5 and especially H6 that it's not even worth watching anymore.  Michael was beheaded by Laurie.  End of story.
