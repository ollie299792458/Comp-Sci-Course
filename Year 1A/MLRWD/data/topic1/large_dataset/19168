This movie is a true classic. And no, this isnt coming from some old timer or a religious fanatic. Its just that i can remember when i first saw this movie, I'm 16 now and i was just 5 when i saw it. It instantly became my very favorite movie. The next week after i got the movie, i had memorized every line. I can sing the whole thing, accurately imitating the voices of all the actors, accents included. Thats quite something. The choreography is incredible, and surprisingly my favorite character is not Jesus, but rather Judas. His voice is particularly striking, especially so in the opening scene (which by the way has some of the most beautiful scenery i have ever seen). The tale it tells is also very interesting and engrossing. You laugh at the funny singing in the beginning ("what's the buzz"), you wince when Jesus is whipped, and you cry when he dies on the cross. It's simply that powerful. There is no other match to this movie that i know of. If a 5 year old can be emotionally touched by this, why cant you? Get this now, or else you will miss out on one of the true cinematic gems of the last 40 years.
