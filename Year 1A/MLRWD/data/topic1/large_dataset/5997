There are two influnces that seem to have created this movie---one, the appearance of Humphery, the humpback whale, in San Francisco Bay one year before the movie's release. The other, less obvious influence, IMHO, seems to be an episode of TV's MIAMI VICE called "Prodigal Son," in which Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs go to Tubbs' hometown of New York to grab some drug dealers. Just in case anyone misses the point, there's a psuedo-Jan Hammer-esque rock insturmental playing during the scene where Kirk &amp; Co. walk the streets of San Francisco (where James T. utters the immortal line "a double-dumbass on you!" to an Ess Eff motorist). This is by far the best TREK flick ever. 7TH HEAVEN'S Catherine Hicks plays superbly off Shatner as Gillian Taylor, while Chekov is really funny trying to to talk his way through an interrogation by paranoid Cold Warriors aboard the aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE (an echo of a scene in the Classic Trek ep, "Tomorrow Is Yesterday, in which a captive Kirk is interrogated by equally nasty types in a Nebaska Air Force base---alas, Pavel is not as smooth as Jim Kirk); There's also a scene in which Chekov and Uhura ask passersby about the mysterious Alameda, where they keep the nucelar "wessels" (as a resident of that Bay Area bedroom burg, that always cracks me up) and the final madcap scene in the SF hospital where Chekov is held. A keeper, folks.....
