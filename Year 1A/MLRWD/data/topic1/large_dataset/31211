Man oh man does Sam Raimi know how to make movies. From the Evil Dead Trilogy to Spider-Man. Darkman is in the middle of these great films starring Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake/Darkman and Larry Drake as Durant, the evil villain of the movie. The movie is a dark superhero film but it's no spider-man or superman. It's not based on a Marvel, D.C., or Dark Horse character, but based from the talented mind of Sam Raimi. It would be great to see comic books come out on this character though.
The is about Peyton Westlake, a very determind scientist researching skin replacements for people who have severly bad burned skin. As he is researching, his girlfriend stumbles upon secret papers at her work, that Durant wants that could get his employer in alot of trouble. So, Durant goes to Peyton's place and blows up the place, sending Peyton into a world of hell. Peyton is recovered with no I.D. because of his severly bad burnt hands along with a hideous freak accident burnt up face. Now, in revenge, Peyton sets out to get back those who ruined his life and his chance to marry his girlfriend.
It's an insanely wild movie that will guarantee fun and entertainment for all viewers. I haven't checked out the sequels, probably because they weren't directed by Sam Raimi and they came out straight to video tape. I heard they were ok, but not as good as its predecessor here, but I'll still check them out. For all of you Bruce Campbell fans out there (like me), Bruce has a little cameo at the end, so watch out for him.
