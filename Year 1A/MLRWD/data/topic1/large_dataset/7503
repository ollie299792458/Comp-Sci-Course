This could be the OG Cult-Classic movie.  Written and directed by Tod Browning who actually worked in a sideshow as a teenager.  The movie centers around the owner and operator of the show Hans who is going to come into a large inheritance.  Hans is a "little person".  Cleopatra is a trapeze swinger who is involved with Hercules, "The Strongman" and the two hatch a plan to get Hans' money.  Since Hans is attracted to Cleopatra, she is going to seduce him into marriage and then poisen him.

Everything is going accordingly until Cleopatra loses it and "Freaks" out at her wedding reception and the other members of the sideshow get suspicious of her sincerity.  The movie unfolds and the ending is quite disturbing.  The amazing thing about this movie is that all the characters are REAL.  Back in the day there was no CGI so Browning had to go with the authentic thing.  Also, as a director, he wanted the film to be shocking so the use of real freaks was necessary.  The film was so shocking for the time that it was banned in some theaters.

As a Cult-Classic, this is an A+++++ and a must own...
