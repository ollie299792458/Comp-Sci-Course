See my review of the 2004 remake as contrast.

This is, simply put, the greatest movie I have ever seen.

Peter O'Toole is exactly how I pictured Henry II: arrogant and volatile, yet somehow sympathetic; he can calmly discuss one minute and roar the next like the titular character he is. Hepburn as Eleanor is brilliant, a latter-day Helen whose beauty has long since started to fade, living to scheme against Henry and to manipulate her sons against him and against one another. The supporting cast, including the debut performances of Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins, is similarly spectacular. Let's just say this is Richard the Lionhearted as you never imagined him.

But the acting skill of the cast is only half of the game; part of the genius of this film lies in its dialogue. There is almost no action and yet never a dull moment (this from someone who likes big explosions as much as the next theatergoer). The quips and jokes, jabs and insults, are delivered with impecable timing.

My favorite exchange:

Henry (roaring, and dripping with sarcasm): How was your crossing? Did the sea part for you?

Eleanor (calmly, and equally sarcastic): It went flat when I told it to. I didn't think to ask for more.

Wow.
