For an amazingly complex book, I thought the filmmakers did a brilliant job. It stands alone as a movie. 
The only problem with eliding some of the characters, and the necessarily more attenuated plot was that we lost much of the politics and inner motivations of some characters - especially Jack Vincennes ans Ed Exley.
Also, everyone raves about Russell Crowe's acting, and he certainly does smash up a lot, but I found Kevin Spacey absolutely compelling. He burned up the screen. Guy Pearce was terrific too. James Cromwell is perfectly cast as the malevolent Dudley Smith.
Last night I watched Chinatown, same genre, earlier. Funnily enough I had never seen it, and realise it is now nearly 30 years old! 
It looks FANTASTIC. It feels fantastic. It is perhaps the perfect film.
Actually, it's why in the end I think LA Confidential is a 9.5/10, and Chinatown a 10/10. The latter has an original, not adapted screenplay, and can work its own rhymes and rythmns. LA Confidential stands on its own as a great movie, but if you have read the book you may hunger for a little more of the intricacies which, understandably cannot be brought to the screen.
