"Reservoir Dogs" was a cool movie, it may be too bloody for some people, but it's what you'd expect from the same person who directed Kill Bill.

The plot had me guessing almost the entire time. Perfect killers planning one perfect crime, but it ends up they have a rat in the group, but no one knows who it is. I personally like that kind of thing.

I also liked it how the director did the flashbacks, showing all the scenes leading up to the crime, showing how all these strangers came together to perform one perfect crime, only to have one of them screw it all up for everyone.

Not only does this movie have suspense, it made me laugh a few times. For example, when Mr. Pink started making a big fuss that he got Pink for his color as his code name.

I do feel sorry for that cop who was being tortured. He was helpless, everyone had power over him because he was strapped to a chair, and couldn't do anything except scream for help.

Overall I would reccomend this movie. It has crime, mystery, and a nice plot.
