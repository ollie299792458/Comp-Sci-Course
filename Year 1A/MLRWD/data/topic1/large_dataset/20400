In the Torah and Old Testament, Jacob has a dream about a ladder to Heaven.  Upon seeing the title of this movie, one might think it is a story about this Old Testament episode, or another religiously oriented movie. Far from biblical, the movie does have spiritual undertones.  My suggestion is - watch it at least twice. The first time, just to let the movie take hold and throw you around like a roller coaster ride, the second time to watch all the subtleties of the movie.

As Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) is wounded in Vietnam in the first ten minutes of the film, we are taken to a New York subway, where Jacob suddenly awakens from a dream of the war.  From there, the movie grabs you and won't let go. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

His life soon after becomes a hellish nightmare of memories, of his dead son (McCaulley Caulkin) and what appears to be wartime demons, as well as a Government conspiracy to kill him and his platoon buddy survivors.  Jacob begins to question his own sanity, while his girlfriend adds to his confusion.  Only his chiropractor (Danny Aiello) turns out to be the only one Jacob can trust, but also the stabilizing element that Jacob needs throughout the movie.

After seeing this movie on HBO years ago, I was happy to see it released on DVD.  The bonus features' documentary helps to clear up some questions I had about some scenes in the movie, and one of the deleted scenes clarified much more for me, the best answers for what the movie is about comes from statements within the movie itself.  If you blink, you'll miss the hints.

This movie is an absolute mindblower!  A very young McCauley Caulkin and a pre-Seinfeld Jason Alexander (with hair) add to the movie's enjoyable viewing.  The drama is intense, the movie moves along at a steady pace, without it dumbing the audience down by revealing it's secrets too easily.  "Psychological thriller" is too mild a term for this movie.
