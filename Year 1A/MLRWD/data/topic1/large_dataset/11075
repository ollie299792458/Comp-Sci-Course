A beautifully rendered, fascinating portrait of two competitive high-school teachers and their spouses whose marriages are simultaneously falling apart, for different reasons, reacting to the wreckage with varying degrees of academic detachment. Mark Ruffalo smolders in a nicely uncomfortable performance as Jack Linden, a terminally frustrated perfectionist who constantly finds fault with his wife, Terri, played with smudgy bursts of futile rage by Laura Dern. Peter Krause seems right at home playing the workaholic best friend, whose marriage to the beautiful Edith is marked not so much by apathy, as much as a vaguely menacing sense of self-loathing. The character studies are expertly dissected by screenwriter Larry Gross, but it's hard to give him too many props considering he's adapting Andre Dubus' dead-on material. Michael Convertino creates simple yet ominous soundscapes to great effect, especially in the "space" montage. Hugely underrated and misunderstood by many mainstream audiences, this is Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" remixed for the new millennium.
