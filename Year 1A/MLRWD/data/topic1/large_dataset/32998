As a child of the 80s, a premise that deals with a former child actor trying to make a comeback in the business after his life has hit the skids seemed great.  Add to this the flurry of 70s &amp; 80s nostalgia specials airing daily on VH1 and E! and I began to look forward to seeing "Dickie Roberts."
But, sadly, the movie basically never gets off the ground.  The viewer knows right away that this is going to be a movie where the potential was wasted.  A brief send-up of "The E! True Hollywood Story," which starts the film, has a couple of funny lines, but not nearly enough to indicate that the rest of the film will keep you interested.  Like "Joe Dirt" (and any number of SNL-alum movies), the central character in "Dickie Roberts" is basically a sad-sack who yearns for love from those around him, and most importantly, his own family.  However, after years of movies like this, in the year 2004, you're simply just asking yourself, "Again?" as the paperthin plot is revealed.
The movie *almost* redeems itself (kinda) with the "We are the World"-type closing credits video, "Childhood Actors of your TV," performed by the likes of Maureen McCormack, Barry Williams, Corey Feldman &amp; Corey Haim, Screech (sorry, Dustin Diamond), and Haywood Nelson.  Haywood Nelson should get his own movie.  Who didn't love Doowayne?  Anyway, even this great premise falls flat, and instead of a laugh riot (which it very well should have been), it's cringeworthy watching Adam Rich and some of the other childhood actors recite their lines.  
But, if you have seen and like this movie, I will recommend you getting the DVD as there are a lot of extra features, from commentaries, to deleted scenes, to an extended-video of "Childhood Actors on your TV" and more.  I give the movie 1 star, but the camp and train-wreck that I consider "Childhood Actors on your Television" to be gets 3 stars.  So, that's how I came up with my 2 star rating.
