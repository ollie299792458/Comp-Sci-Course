It,s June 20th 2008 and 114 degrees in Phoenix. So what do you do? Watch seasons 1& 2 of Rome HBO Series.I must say this series really hooked me and I spent several days watching 2-4 episodes.I cannot confirm the historical accuracy of this series. However the acting, costume & set design, and exceptional writing makes this best entertainment available.
All of the chartacters are interesting, although some do not live too long.With lots of twists and turns throughout the series and several plots going on at the same time, the viewer never becomes bored.This series is strickly for adults. There are several scenes with nudity,debauchery,and graphic bloody violence.For the most part I believe the director was trying give a sense of everyday life and survival during this period in Rome.
I have read many reviews of this series and I can agree with most. However the notion of season 2,not being as good as season 1 is bunk!To totally
enjoy this epic, you must see both seasons.I am 60 years old,this series rates as one the best in every catagory. I was pleased to see the plight of the common man and woman in Rome. Hollywood only shows Ceasar and his royal family. ( really how rough do the very rich have it) when you can buy anything.
Bottomline this is a really good show, you will not be dissappointed.
