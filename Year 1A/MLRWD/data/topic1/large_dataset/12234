When the first season began I wouldn't even watch because I had seen the movie. I figured that it was a a case of TV Execs who had run out of ideas, and we would be treated to more retreads. I started watching two or three episodes in to the first season. I am glad to report that I was so wrong in my estimates. This turned out to be one of my all time favorite TV series, if not my favorite. It was so well written with character development that you don't see very often. This series will hook you. You will really care about the characters. The actors are so natural that you forget that they are acting. I never understood why the ratings never picked up more than they did. I am so happy that it lasted for 5 years. I only wish that we had gotten a few more episodes. I am glad that it was written so that the last season gave us some closure, even though it made me sad to say good by to people that I felt that I had come to know. As I watched the final moments unfold I did so with a lump in my throat. I purchased the full 5 seasons to watch again in the future. It is that good. By the way, this series is not about football. It is so much more than that. I cannot recommend this series highly enough. With all of the garbage that passes for entertainment on TV nowadays, this was a real find, a real gem.
