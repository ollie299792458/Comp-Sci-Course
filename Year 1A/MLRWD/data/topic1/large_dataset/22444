If you don't like really cheesy monster movies than you probably don't want this set.  These movies are masterpieces not because of their effects or acting, but because the effects they utilize are the best they had back then and they influenced science fiction films to come for years.  You have to appreciate them for what they are to enjoy them (though I did laugh at a few cheesy parts I admit)

This set contains three Toho classics:

Battle in Outer Space is about how the Earth unites to fight off the threat of an alien invasion.  Rocket ships versus UFOs.  Very entertaining.

The H-Man is like the Japanese version of The Blob where a gangster gets mutated by radiation and proceeds to absorb people.  It's the darkest and slowest of the three.

Mothra is the first movie the monster Mothra appeared in before starring in various Godzilla films.  This is the story of how two magical fairies that speak for Mothra on Beru Island are kidnapped and Mothra goes to rescue them.  Very cheesy but very fun.

One thing I noticed is that the English versions of these films have the voice actors talking in a fake-sounding Asian accent, so that's one thing I didn't like cause to me it came off as a bit racist.  They could have hired a Japanese voice actor (who knows, maybe some of them were)  or just talked in American accents like they do in later Toho movies.  Just something to point out.  Each film also possesses it's original Japanese version.

The movies themselves are good but the discs are packed on top of one another, so I suggest you get a different case for them when you buy this set!
