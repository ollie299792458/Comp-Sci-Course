I have to start by being fair in that this movie claims to be a shoot-em-up, and in that category it succeeds. However, in every other category it fails miserably. Don't get me wrong, it has it all...the disenchanted former special ops guy, the damsel in distress, the evil but smart bad-guy, the government/corporation conspiracy, etc.  Unfortunately, everything is poorly executed and quite frankly, the writers simply did not try that hard to make a believable plot, or characters you could care about. What's worse is that the movie's core concept is to be a sinfully over-done shoot-em-up, but it fails in that respect as well.  The gun-battles are a been-there, done-that (10 years ago) affair. Finally, the acting is only sub-par.  Clive own does a respectable job with a terrible script and character, while Monica Bellucci is in such a role that no acting could save (and her acting was on par with a B movie actor anyway.)  The only notable performance comes from the films villain, who only barely succeeds in garnering extra notice.

As a fan of the above described type of movie, I was quite disappointed overall.  I expected an unabashed shooter, but got some complete mess.  I would recommend you spend your money on something else.
