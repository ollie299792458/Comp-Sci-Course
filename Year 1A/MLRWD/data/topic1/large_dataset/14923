This movie, along with its sequel "Before Sunset", works on two levels. First, it deals with two people who, in the course of less than a day, find a deep, personal connection. One could call it a connection of the heart and mind, but that doesn't really define it. It's more a connection of tolerance and interest in each others differences. Their enjoyment of each other and what each has to offer is contagious.

The second level is the presentation. The entire film is almost exclusively of these two young people walking through beautiful Vienna conversing in a way that is both intelligent and natural. There is no contrived drama here, only the kind of interaction that is very believable to any of us watching. As he is flying out the next morning, the only question hovering over the couple is whether their relationship will survive after separation. Their connection is special enough that you invest yourself in the characters and hope that they do. However, both the storyline and the characters are realistic enough to know that they may not. It ends on an ambiguous note and you are left to your own conjecture, at least until you see the sequel.

I have seldom enjoyed and related to a movie as much as I have to "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset". The performances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are as natural and understated as is the dialogue. I have watched these movies several times and each time I walk away with a feeling that I had witnessed something that could have and probably did happen to me. What more could you ask of a movie?
