I wasn't quite sure what to think when I started watching the introduction to this movie--sure, it had Helena Bonham Carter, one of the most talented actresses of all time, but how could that guarantee it was going to be a good movie?

I've watched it at least twice in the last few days. Though I do have to admit I'm somewhat romantic, in every moment this film is ingenious, delicious and hilarious. George Emerson, the son of Mr. Emerson (the comedic pair residing in Italy at the time of Lucy Honeychurch and Charlotte Bartlett's stay there) Lucy Honeychurch and Cecil Vyse are possibly some of the most vivid characters ever created. Each is cut precisely and perfectly to take their place in the film--the quiet but extremely individual George, the pouty and strong-willed Lucy, or the antisocial, self-centered Cecil.

Some of the movie's humor and social commentary is difficult to catch on the first viewing, but for those unobsessive, it is still very entertaining for nearly anyone.

Simply fabulous. I highly recommend it.
