I was thrilled to see this nearly complete collection finally offered for purchase.  However, I almost didn't purchase it due to a few bad reviews complaining about the packaging and "scratches" and glue spots on the DVDs caused by it.

I decided to take a chance and order it anyway and boy am I glad that I did!  I don't know what those clowns were talking about.  While they are correct that the DVDs are contained within a cardboard "book" with each cardboard "page" being a sleeve that holds each disk, my set has an internal plastic sleeve inside each "page" that protects the disk and allows you to slide the disk in and out without scratching or damaging it.  A few of the plastic sleeves were a little hard to get in and out, but I just spread the cardboard page open slightly more and now each plastic sleeve slides in and out quite nicely.

As for scratches or glue spots, I have seen none and after watching over half the collection have had no issues with playback.  Those complainers must be anal retentive types who are using a microscope to find these "scratches".

I'm glad I didn't listen to them and you'll be glad too if you you order this collection.  Since this is the "Essential Collection" and not the "Complete" collection, there are a couple of good detailed reviews on the website by Scott MacGillivray and Eric Perlin that give you lots of facts and also will tell you how to round out your collection.  Thanks Guys!
