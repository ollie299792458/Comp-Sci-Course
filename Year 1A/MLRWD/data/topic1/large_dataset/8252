I loved the animation, the musical score and mostly Tarzan.  Tarzan can tree surf and almost fly through the air.  This is what Burroughs imagined when he wrote Tarzan, but this could never be accomplished in real life.  In the animated world, Tarzan almost flies.
I loved his strained relationship with his ape-father Kurchak.  The scene where Tarzan hands the dead leopard to Kurchak and 2 stare into each others' eyes is almost mesmerizing.  Unfortunately we never get to see if Kurchak would've accepted him because that's when the humans enter the scene.
I also loved the scene where Tarzan and Jane were sitting in the tree and Tarzan touched his hand to hers.  For the first time he saw that there were others like him.  This led to a lot of confusion for Tarzan.
He wanted to protect his ape family, but at the same time, wanted Jane to stay in Africa.  This leads him to endanger his ape family.
The DVD is THX certified and the picture and sound definetely live up to it.  It uses Dolby Digital 5.0 (minus the LFE, but if you have a subwoofer you'll get plenty of bass).  The picture is done in deep canvas animation and looks as close to 3D as a non computer animation can.  
The only thing I hate about the DVD is you have to fast forward thru ads to get even get to the menu.
