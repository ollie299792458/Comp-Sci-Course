When you hear the word epic, what does it make you think? A great hero's difficult journey? Well, that's what I think and Ben-Hur fits into that sub-genre perfectly. This film is remake of the 1925 master-piece of the same name. In my opinion, this is definitely the better version.

All aspects of this film are top notch. Charlton Heston, Hugh Griffith (who made the best performance) and the rest of the cast do an excellent job. William Wyler directs this film so well that it leaves no doubt in your mind that he has to be one of the gretest directors ever. The cinematography and the editing are breath-taking. The use of the 65mm camera was perfect for this epic because it gave the film the wide screen grandeur that it deserved. The rowing scene and the chariot race were edited almost flawlessly. And the other aspects were awesome too.

My only complaint is that the film is a little too long and has alot of dialogue in it but it's still really good. I also love the treatment they did of Christ. Instead of picturing His face in the scenes that He's in (which is only a couple), they just show His back or somehow edit around showing His face. Very good work because it leaves it to your imagination of what He might've looked like.

The film received an unprecidented 11 Academy Awards (only Titanic, which is horrible movie in my opinion and LOTR 3 have tied it) and I think it deserved every one of them. No film of it's time has come close to being as great as this film. If you want to see a great film, then this is it.
