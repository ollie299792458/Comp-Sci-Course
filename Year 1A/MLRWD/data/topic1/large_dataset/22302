I came upon this movie while switching channels.  I have seen this movie on tv but never really saw the whole thing.  This time around, I caught the movie in the beginning.  From then on, my eyes were stuck on the tv. I finally decided to buy the dvd.

This is a great movie.  It is a great love story between lovers and families.  It was kind of long, but it went by pretty fast.  I was not a big fan of Brad Pitt.  But because of this movie, I am starting to warm up to him.  I have always been a big fan of Claire Forlani.  She was perfect for this part.  She is exceptionally beautiful.  Anthony Hopkins was superb as William Parrish.

This movie is about whats important in life.  I think Death's and Susan's love story is one the best of all time.  I cried when Susan knew who he was, but she said he is still Joe.  I cried until the scene where she runs after her father and Death because the 2 men in her life is gone.  Then, I cried again when the sweet guy from the coffee shop came back and realized she has a second chance at love.

This was great movie.  This movie is a classic.
