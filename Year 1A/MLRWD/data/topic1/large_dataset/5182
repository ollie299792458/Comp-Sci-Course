This DVD is one of the best i have ever seen. The level of extreme has NEVER been this intense. I was on the edge of my seat from the moment Mikey Shipwreck hit Rocko Rock over the head with a board, all the way to Tommy Dreamer hitting the Death Valley Driver to C.W. Anderson through the table. I saw quite possibly the most gruesome match in my life, which was none other than the barbed-wire match between Sabu and Terry Funk. But there were several other matches that astounded me, such as: RVD vs. Sabu in a stretcher match, Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee in a weapons match, Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis in a Mexican Death match, Beulah McGuillicutty vs. Bill Alfonso, and last but so far from least, the Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney. If you look up extreme in the dictionary, you need to add a mental image of Sabu and RVD, because the were just that in their stretcher match. Tommy Dreamer and Brian Lee's match didnt so much amaze as what happened after did. Tommy was choke-slammed right off of a balcony through 3 or 4 tables. Rey Mysterio and Psicosis werent TOO violent, but were just flyin' all over the place. Beulah absolutely destroyed Bill Alfonso; which is pretty funny seeing a girl kicked that much tail. And the Dudley Boyz match was just awesome as we saw a flaming table come out. But those most deinetly arent all of the matches; there are 19 in all along with several extras.

  Basically if you are an ECW fan, or even just a fan of wrestling in general, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. It is absolutely worth it's $15-$20 price tag. Just be warned that it earns it's TV-MA rating, because this one isnt for the squemish crowd. It will most definetly make you want to chant: E-C-W!! E-C-W!! E-C-W!! right along with the fans.
