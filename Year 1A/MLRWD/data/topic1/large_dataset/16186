Hey folks, let's get one thing straight - something all "True Grit" (1969 version) fans already know: this was one great Western! Sorry, but John Wayne really DID give the performance of his career and he really DID deserve the Oscar for Best Actor in 1969 (it was not due to the oft-repeated slight that it was a "sympathy" Oscar for the fact that he had not won previously). His performance was markedly better than Dustin Hoffman's much praised but "over the top" performance in "Midnight Cowboy." Additionally, Kim Darby arguably should have received the Best Actress Oscar that year and the movie - Best Picture. As for comparisons with the recent re-make starring Jeff Bridges - you can forget it. The Wayne version is vastly superior, even if it deviates slightly from the novel (hey, sometimes a screenplay IS BETTER than the novel). The Bridge's version suffers from actors who are trying too hard not to repeat dialogue in the same manner as in the classic Wayne version and, as a result, either mumble or fumble the novel's most classic lines. Add Elmer Bernstein's fantastic score and the mountainous autumn scenery of southwestern Colorado, and this 1969 film is irresistible. Maximum stars.
