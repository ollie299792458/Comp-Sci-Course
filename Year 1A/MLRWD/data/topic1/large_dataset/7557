Michael Douglas demonstrates that he is one of the truely great actors of this time.  He plays a college professor who has retreated into constant use of pot to compensate for his inability to produce a follow up to a previous best selling book.  Tobey Maguire is his gifted but totally morose  student who clings to him as an alternative to his less than attentive parents (real or "imagined") in a wildy improbable but extremely funny weekend.  Robert Downey Jr., a sometimes gay publisher, pops in for the weekend to push his author, Douglas, along in finishing his next book in order to salvage his employment with the publishing firm.  Frances McDormand is his married lover who announces to Douglas that she is pregnant with his child just as his latest wife has left him.  Katie Holmes, another student and wannabe lover, takes time out from her lusting to offer some meaningful insight to Douglas. Throw in a murdered dog, the theft of a Marilyn Monroe artifact, a houseparty, a "crazy" hood jumping man, a great sound track, mixed with humor, an incredible amount of absurdity and even a little pathos and you get "Wonder Boys."  If it all sounds a little confusing and a little off center, it is and that, with both a brilliant script and great acting by everyone in the movie, is what makes this a Modern Classic.
