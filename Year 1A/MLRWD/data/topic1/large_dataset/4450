I hope they hurry up and release every episode of Dallas, this show elevated the medium of television into stratospheric new heights, broke ground and made us love Jim Davis, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy and the gang - Dallas was so great that it was in impossible act to follow for everyone involved, it was as close to perfect as television drama has ever been. The first two seasons laid the groundwork and as the show became more complicated, bizarre and brilliant it broke rules all the way. Did we care that Pamela dreamt a whole season or that Miss Ellie was played by a different actress and then the original one again - no, it was simply entertainment that defined a time before television would become fragmented, a time when we would all switch on and watch and then talk about it the next day. One thing, please also release the 'Dallas - the Early Years' the comeback episodes and the pilot - and release all of the seasons ASAP because we really want them, I hope there are lots of extras and the quality is good.
