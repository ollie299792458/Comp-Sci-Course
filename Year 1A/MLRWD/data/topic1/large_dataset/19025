Why have all of you been waiting so long? Just order them from the Amazon UK and German UK stores. I have had all three seasons for almost four years. All have the original English soundtracks and are excellent quality video reproductions. Just check that your DVD player can be modified to play region 2 discs first. With mine it was a simple tasks of entering a series of number in sequence. US dollars price listed below each link. The first two seasons are great deals, even with shipping will cost less than the US versions. I loved this show as a kid and enjoy watching them now.

Again, be sure your DVD player can play Region 2 DVD's before ordering any of these. Enjoy!
