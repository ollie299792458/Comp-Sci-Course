If you were a WWF fan during this time period, this is a must have.  All the matches were good to great, with the exception of the Chyna vs. Ivory match that was a awful waste of time, and the fake neck injury at the end was a cruel joke.  Besides that, all the matches were extremely watchable.  The Dudleyz vs. E & C showed some people that it isn't just gimmick matches that are carrying their careers.  It was a solid match that never fails to lose your attention, with good selling for the concussions.  Next is Jericho vs. Benoit in a classic ladder match.  I'm glad to see a match like this that isn't all high-spots, even though those matches ae entertaining too.  Also, Benoit takes a wicked shot from a steel chair when diving through the ropes.  You've got to hear it to believe it.  I already talked about the women's match, so next comes the world title match.  A disappointment in the eyes of some people, but not to me.  Angle and HHH put on a great show, with HHH working Angle's knee the whole match while Angle gets in some of his great offense occasionly.  And then came the rumble, which was throughly entertaining, even though there was some slow spots.
