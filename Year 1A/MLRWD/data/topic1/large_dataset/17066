I love much of "The Band Wagon"--it's certainly the best of the "Potpourri" musicals, and truly one of the greatest of them all.
But I find it interesting that no one ever mentions the fabulous British music-hall veteran Jack Buchanan who, as far as I am concerned, practically walks away with every scene he's in, including his backwards tumble off the set just before "That's Entertainment".
The subtle but wicked virtuosity of his portrayal is a continual delight to watch.  His opening "Oedipus MODERNE" scene (both ONstage and BACKstage) is priceless.....and oh, SO accurate!
But I think his most amazing scene is where he sits on his couch and cleverly sets up James Mitchell to manuever Cyd Charisse into the show---and notice the fact that this scene is done in almost ONE CONTINOUS TAKE----it is brilliantly written AND acted!
Then the series of shots as the cast keeps opening the doors into the room where he is selling the concept of the show to the backers.....now THAT'S FUNNY!
As much as I enjoy the rest of the film (and "Triplets" is an absolute classic), I hate to leave Jack Buchanan's opening scenes, as I find the familiar formula of aging star (Fred) romancing the much younger ingenue so wearisome.  If it wasn't Astaire and Hepburn, it was Bogart and Hepburn....or was it Cary Grant and Hepburn...or Grant and Eva Marie Saint...or Wiliiam Holden and Hepburn...or....or....(not that a May/December romance can't be a cool thing....but c'mon!)
At least in the heartbreaking "Roman Holiday", Gregory Peck was the right age to romance Audrey.  
But I digress......
