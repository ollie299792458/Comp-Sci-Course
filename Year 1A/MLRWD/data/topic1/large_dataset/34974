So you meet this beautiful dame and it is clear she is out of your class,
but dumb as you are you go after her anyway. And she appears to yield
and you get married,
only for you to find you are playing in the band
behind her work. Everything goes on the rocks through the rapids
in a leaky boat for you and her. I doubt this is a new story:
trying to marry a princess if you were just a boy from town must
be very like this. She has more languages than the UN and you speak
sports, and know the team doctors for the profession football
teams. She can't boil water and you are lost at an embassy party
for a visiting head of state, who went to the Swiss boarding school
in the same town as she did. So what do you talk about after the
bedroom?
This movie implies that there is some French Republican compromise
that can save such a marriage: only Ring Lardner could get away
with this sort of comedy fantasy?
I loved it still knowing that it was just pie in the sky!
