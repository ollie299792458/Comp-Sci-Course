Dinner at Eight is one of the earliest films I have had the pleasure to see.  It certainly was a product of its times--the Great Depression, replete with financial empires on the brink, aging theater stars, gold-digging vixens, and wealthy patricians seemingly immune to the tremendous suffering all around them.

The terrific cast are a great ensemble, but the character who really steals their thunder is Kitty, played by a delightfully brassy Jean Harlow.  Harlow delivers one caustic, unforgettable zinger after another, calling her husband "a big slug . . . a crook", informing him she's an "introvert who has to spend her day introvertin'"; she lets her maid know she's a "dummy . . . a nitwit" and informs the audience during a row with the dissolute fanancier who is her husband that "I'm going to be a lady if it kills me!"

The plot is skillfully fleshed out with a great script, and the viewer soon learns that the Jordan Shipping Line is poised to sink, and Harlow's amoral husband is skulking around to seize the wreckage, in the guise of saving the family business.  His duplicitous behavior makes him a deserving recepient of Kitty's blackmail that, while wicked, manages to save the Jordan family from financial ruin.

I particularly enjoyed a scene in which the cook informs the Jordan matriarch, after we've seen Mrs. Jordan jump giddily over a jello-mold shaped to look like the royal British lion, that the "aspic" has been destroyed.  And why?  Because the cook was forced to drop it during a knifefight between two butlers over the maid, who we can hear crying in the distance.

It is truly a delightful film and fans of old Hollywood will not be disappointed!
