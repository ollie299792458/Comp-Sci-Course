Two people from different spectrums of the music industry. A Rock and Roller at the end of his career and trying to hang on falls in love with and helps an up and coming Pop Star Diva, who is willing to do anything for the man that she loves. Romantic.
Yes, a remake. This was based on a story done in two other versions, however the story line varies in each (Star is Born with Frederic March and Janet Gaynor; the other featuring Judy Garland and James Mason. But, how great that in a wonderful, but CRAZY time of the 70's that someone should remake this story in the view of the music industry (which was changing in all direction), instead of the movie industy as it had been in the past. Kris Kristofferson portraits Norman Main as character close to his own career and life. Barbra Streisand is fantastic with her wonderfully amazing voice that moves an suprises you in so many ways in her portrail of Ester.  Both do a wonderful job.  Barbra's waredrobe from her closet is fantastic. Only, if I had her closet.
I remember the first time I saw the movie; that New Years Eve so many years ago. Still enjoying it to this day. A wonderful time the 70's.
