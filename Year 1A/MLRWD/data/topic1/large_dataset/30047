I decided that because Water and Fire were such brilliant films, I had to see Earth as well.  Deepa Mehta is an unbelievably remarkable film-maker, and I knew that Earth would be up to her usual genius - beautiful shots, tenderness and pain, all I have come to expect from her.  Earth, however, so aptly titled, went far beyond what I expected.  First of all, its educational aspect cannot be overlooked - I thought I knew Indian history, but things on a page are very different from the visceral definition of what they mean captured on film.  The sudden barbarism of people who had lived peacefully side by side for centuries, is beautifully rendered using a group of friends who represent all the factions that emerged at Britian's departure from and catastrophic division of India.  The agony of loss and suffering of love are painted so believably by this most intelligent and creative director that you are there, aching with the characters.  Earth is a painfully beautiful film, devastating and gorgeous at once, and totally, frighteningly, unforgettable.
