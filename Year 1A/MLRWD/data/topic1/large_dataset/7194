I have loved this movie since I was a kid.  Before I bought the movie on DVD I had not seen it in years.  So comparing what was in my mind's eye as a kid (an epic battle with lots of booms and bangs) to a 30 year old adult was quite a different experience.  Now I look at it as if it should have been called "D-Day For Dummies".  
The acting is pretty much sub-par, but overall the picture shows what happened in a semi-factual sense of the events that happened on that day (even as some other reviewers have pointed out that some of what happened in the film and what happened really are a little skewed).
As stated above, I though the acting was a little off (particularly any of the allies).  They seemed to be just giving off speaches about the whole plan, what was involved and what was happening at any moment in the film as if the people around them (including the audience) had no idea why they were there or what was involve (John Wayne's idiotic speach in the parachute packing hanger was the epitome of these speeches).
At any rate, overall for an earlier film, it was a very good attempt.  
Also, comparing the realism of death as to that of Ryan is not fair since movies of this date had to be subdued due to that particular age of movies and the public. So, comparison between the two is hardly fair.
