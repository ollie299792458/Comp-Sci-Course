Ghostbusters is a classic comedy film. I just got the blu-ray of that film recently and the picture, audio, and extras were all amazing on it. It is by far the definitive edition of the film period. Now there is Ghostbusters II. First of all it was an impressive followup to the original. Not as good but is a worth see. It was just as funny as the first film and the special effects were as good as the first film.

But there's something I'm not laughing about. The first movie is on Blu-Ray (yes indeed), but the sequel isn't? WHAT? Yeah everybody claims that the sequel is extremely underrated and some people claim that the sequel is inferior to the original. Some of the actors and filmmakers prefer to look at the original more than the sequel and I respect that. But the sequel was pure entertainment to me and Columbia should put this out on Blu-Ray soon with a great transfer, which the previous dvds have but no extras. The third movie is in production and should be out in a year or two and all the original, Ghostbusters and actors are coming back, with the exception of a couple, maybe. So is director Ivan Reitman. Maybe Columbia will put it out then. I'm not keeping my fingers crossed on that though

Also, another note to add: Columbia put out Men in Black in a great Blu-Ray release. Where the hell's the sequel to that movie on Blu-Ray? The third film in that series is currently in production. Maybe they'll put it out then.

That put, Ghostbusters II was a great followup to the classic original but a Blu-Ray release would give this movie the justice it deserves.
