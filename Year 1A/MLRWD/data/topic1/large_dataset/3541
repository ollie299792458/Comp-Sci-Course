Just saw this @ the theater 2 weeks ago, better believe I've pre-ordered it; this is Primo, hard-rockin', Kick-Ass Stones, right up there w/ "Ladies & Gentlemen...", plus ya get Bill Wyman !! I've followed the Stones since the beginning, but can't improve on the eloquence of these other reviewers:this band's passion & commitment are unparalled, plus they do a rampaging "When the Whip Comes Down" that'll knock ya flat. As Mick says, "gonna make ya jump all nite"...this should do it!
  UPDATE: got my copy couple weeks ago; it's actually BETTER than when I saw it in the theater, the sound is pitch-perfect, as some have said, & the "cinematography", I guess it is, has long, sustained "takes"; it's blessedly free of super-fast cuts & shifts a la MTV, THAT's the way to film Rock n' Roll !! And, perhaps "it's only rock n' roll", but there 's something exhilerating about watching guys living out their passion: Keith prowls that stage so @ one w/ his music that it's a joy to behold, & yes, Mick is extraordinary, dude is INTO his music, & they take us all with them. Makes ya feel "ain't it good to be alive" for sure...GET IT & be prepared to be blown away big-time.  MAB
