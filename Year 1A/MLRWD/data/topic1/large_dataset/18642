Regarding Escaflowne being the best, I cannot say that it IS the best. But rather, floating near the top of my top 5-10 of the many, many animes that I have watched.

There have been some times where upon finishing a series or a movie, I would get a bit disappointed that there would be no more. After watching Escaflowne, I had felt it.

It is hands down far out. The storyline had me bedazzled throughout the series. The storyline is a very, very emotional experience (though I thought that it was a bit too frustrating at times)... I would say at the same level as that of Gundam. The animation was also captivating. The artists really thought things through when illustrating the massive Guymelefs (mecha); the physics of their movement was extremely life-like, contributing to the spectacular fight scenes.

Just to give you an idea of my taste in animes, I will leave you with a list of where it stands among my favorites (in no particular order) to lt you gauge it for yourself...

- Robotech (Macross Saga/Invid Invasion)
- Gundam (MSG, SEED to name a few)
- Cowboy Bebop
- Gungrave
- Bubblegum Crisis
- Rurouni Kenshin
