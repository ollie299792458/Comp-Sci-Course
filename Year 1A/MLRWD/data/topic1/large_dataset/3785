A find for the Dirty Harry fan, all of the Dirty Harry films plus a collection of associated documentaries, all for a song. First we have Dirty Harry, the gritty film that made "Do you feel lucky, punk?" famous, introducing "Dirty" Harry Callahan tracking a serial killer. Next is Magnum Force, where Harry tangles with vigilante traffic cops and reminded everyone that "A man has to live by his limitations." That is followed by The Enforcer, where Harry has to lay down the law on terrorists who kidnap the mayor. Next is Sudden Impact, which made "Go ahead, make my day!" a household word. Harry is forced to take a vacation when things get to hot in the City, but trouble finds him there too and he must solve a crime while trying to take some time off. Finally, there is The Dead Pool, where Harry discovers a lottery on which celebrity will die next. This film includes a car chase that is both homage and parody of Bullitt, where Harry and partner are chased up and down the hills of San Francisco by a radio-controlled model car loaded with explosives.
