If you don't like Gilbert and Sullivan, you should avoid  TOPSY-TURVY; clocking in at about two hours and forty minutes, it would probably be a torturous experience.  For everyone else, however, I give this movie my  highest recommendation.  TOPSY-TURVY concerns itself with a period during  which Gilbert and Sullivan find themselves at a professional impasse.  Their inability to agree on a suitable story for collaboration eventually  leads to their most popular operetta, "The Mikado."  Director  Mike Leigh's object, however, is to tell the story behind the story; he  lets us peek into the professional and personal lives of Sullivan, Gilbert,  and the D'Oyly Carte Company.  Jim Broadbent anchors the film with his  tremendous performance as W.S. Gilbert; he is infuriating and arrogant, yet  plagued with self doubt and even occasionally gentle.  Alan Cordeneur does  well as Arthur Sullivan, yet his performance is less involving and we don't  get to know him that well; but perhaps that was the point.  Leslie Manville  is quite touching as Gilbert's long suffering wife, Kitty.  The D'Oyly  Carte performers are played with just the right combination of humanity and  theatricality; in particular, Timothy Spall as Richard Temple (bewildered  and hurt that his role as the Mikado might be whittled to almost nothing!)  and Dorothy Atkinson, charming and alluring as Jessie Bond, are  outstanding.  There are generous musical excerpts from "The  Mikado," "The Sorcerer," "Princess Ida," and  Sullivan's non-Gilbert music.  There is so much more worth praising in  TOPSY-TURVY, but instead I'll just close by saying: DON'T MISS IT!
