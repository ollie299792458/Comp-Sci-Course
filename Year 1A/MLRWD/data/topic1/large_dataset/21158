Alright, while this movie was not the work of the century by any means, this movie was DEFINITELY money well spent. I loved how the characters represented the full spectrum of realistic gay men, from the closeted gay to the jaded old gay to the lonely gay. The characters felt much more real than the characters I have seen in other movies. Not to mention how the scene with 'Smartypants' gave me goosebumps! It was just so....visceral. It felt so real, yet unreal in a very beautiful way.

I have to say that this film was quite possibly one of the best I have seen in a long, long time. The main character is a John Doe who goes through a couple different aliases throughout the movie. Every one of his escapades fleshes out a different piece of his personality in such a way that by the end of the movie you feel like you know who he his without really knowing who he is.

I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie for a date or maybe to share with your friends. Hell this is even a good movie to just watch alone with the dog on the couch.
