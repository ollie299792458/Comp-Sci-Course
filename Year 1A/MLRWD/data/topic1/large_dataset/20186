While this film features cross cultural misunderstanding and the ordinary experiences of daily life, in the wide open spaces of the desert and in the delicately scored absences of dialogue we begin to see clearly the emerging inner lives of Sandy and Hiro.

For Sandy, life is nothing special. She enjoys her job well enough, she's close with her Mum, she gardens and smokes the odd cigarette. Everything is par for the course until the day her company assigns her the task of chauffeuring a prim Japanese visitor around, a man she detests nearly as soon as she meets him. For Hiro, words and all aspects of life are carefully measured. Hiro is equally unimpressed by the unselfconscious loud-mouthed Sandy (who also, he tells his associate on the phone in Japanese, has a large bottom). The difference in manner and physicality between these two characters is revealed beautifully. It becomes a source of fascination for us just as it does for them.

Things take an unexpected turn and crisis demands communication for the sake of survival. Through this hardship, their experiences of life and of one another begin to bloom. Sandy learns the importance of the thing that is not said. Hiro learns not to ration the life of his heart.

This is a wonderfully surprising, tender, thoughtful film. The performances are richly nuanced. Equally rich are the visual and sonic landscapes, which create room for feelings and experiences to unfold in an extraordinarily satisfying way for the viewer. This is the kind of film you wish you'd seen sooner and it is one that will stay with you.

I agree with some other reviewers that the end is a bit drawn out - but judge for yourself.
