After I have seen and heard awful reviews, this movie was quite a surprised to me.  Sure it does not feature Paul Walker or Vin Disel!?  Lucas Black did a good job filled in to the main role.  As we all know, Street racing and customized street car with unique painting originated in Japan, and I thought it was brilliant idea that this movie took a place in Japan.  Sure it has a quite a few flows as American kid never ended up going to Japanese traditional public school.  And Lucas Black's military dad never had to live in that pig stay.  They do have a nice western houses for them to live either on base or near base, but never lived downtown area where 30 miles off from base...
The drive sequels are great as first two movies in different way.  It was such a treat to see them on street of Tokyo.  And Those unknown Asian actors contributed quite a depth of characters to make this eyecady/popcorn movie more realistic.  It still amazes me that The Fast and Furious movies always have been meant to guilty pleasure/pop corn movies, but it always has great and strong character developments and cultural portraits.
