Surreal, hallucinatory and menacing study on non-communication, grief, blame, self-loathing and rage gone horribly wrong in a blended-family.

  The viewer is presented with many series of either ghostly attacks, horror hallucinations or wishful or blame-evasion fantasies in the aftermath of a bad event.  I wasn't quite sure who's fantasies were shown.  I thought only tiny bits of truth from these fantasies fed into the final explanation.

  Insensitive, Incommunicative Dr. Dad has an troubled 1st wife and two kids.  He brings home a nurse from his work to care for the troubled wife.  She is shallow, pretty, but not genuine or kind, and emotionally dead Dr. Dad is too dead to see it.

  There might've been a vicious cycle of the Mentally Troubled Wife vs. Nurse-Dr. romance, you can't tell which intensified which, until it all boiled over.

  Or on the otherhand, maybe the wife was permanently mentally ill, so the Dad drifted into a relationship with the Nurse.

  Since Dr. Dad isn't telling the kids anything, & has abandoned them in everyway except physically, they are left to fend for themselves.  They can only guess what is going on & thinking they are the only ones to protect their Mom, they go on a vendetta against the "intruder" Nurse.

  So much hatred, anger and pettiness is present in the blended family, that when an important accident happens, it gets horribly & vindictively "forgotten" in another petty squabble.

  Much destructive self-loathing and blaming of each other ensues.
