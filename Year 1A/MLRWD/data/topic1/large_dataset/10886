2004's "little film that could", following "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "Lost In Translation". A film whose subtle touches, scenes and words stay with you long after you've left the theater. A few serious plot holes in the second half can't cancel out the writing, acting and "I-know-someone-just-like-that (and sometimes it's me)" realism of so many of the situations and characters' reactions to them.

The location shooting (almost all the wineries and restaurants are referred to by their real names; the Windmill Inn, which in real life is a Days Inn, is one of the few exceptions) adds to both the realism and the "indie" feel of the film. Likewise the writers' knowledge of wine is extensive - though it's odd that Miles would shout "I'm NOT drinking any EFFING Merlot" when his most prized bottle, a 1961 Cheval Blanc Bordeaux, is 40% Merlot.

Obviously the most discussed scene concerns the gorgeous metaphors exchanged by Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Maya (Virginia Madsen) on Stephanie's back porch. Absolutely nobody in the theater exhaled until the cutaway of Miles cursing himself in the bathroom. Here's hoping the Academy will use a strategically-placed bleep to permit what one wit on IMDB called "The Virginia Monologue" to be shown in its entirety when they acknowledge Madsen's nomination. Some here have protested that "people don't really talk like that", but Maya has an impressive academic resume (a professor's ex-wife who's taking post-graduate courses), and who among us hasn't used a nice buzz as an excuse to make profound pronouncements? (Nobody really says things like "the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world" either....)

The plot holes (spoilers):

- Jack *had* to know that it was Miles who spilled the beans about the wedding.

- Jack's confessional about really loving Christine. If it was on the level, it runs totally counter to the scenes where he raves about Stephanie and considers calling off the wedding. If it was a put-on (remember, Jack's an ACTOR), then the audience was never given the "wink" to let us in on the scam.

- Miles is built up as the ultimate "loyal friend" with a sense of duty, yet as Best Man he abandons the wedding before the reception where he has the obligation to make the toast. This is not only completely out of character, it squanders the tragi-comic possibilities of the reception (Miles + Jack + pregnant ex-wife + alcohol...).

But again, the thoughtfulness and performances overcome these annoyances. It's also interesting that a film set entirely in California is so non-Hollywood: the lead is a balding overweight alcoholic with a blanket of back hair, there are no CGI effects, the one car crash goes "wrong", and even though there's a lot of sex, neither female lead has a gratuitious topless shot (and trust me, NOBODY is going to do a screen capture of the film's one frontal nudity scene!).
