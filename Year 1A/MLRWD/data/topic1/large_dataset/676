There's a cliche that anyone who likes this film must either be an anti-intellectual conservative/military type, or a homosexual.  Unless I'm a rare exception or something, that cliched stereotype just isn't true, as I fit into neither of those categories.  In actuality I'm a 40 year old guy with very liberal political views, and very definitely straight as an arrow.

Saying I like this movie is easy.  Defining exactly why I like this movie isn't quite as easy, however.  Part of it is admittedly some 80's nostalgia, although that doesn't explain why I enjoyed the film back in the 80's when it first came out.  I *was* actually in the Navy Reserves in the 1980's, although I joined well before the film came out (1983).

Another aspect of this film I enjoy is the gorgeous cinematography and camera work -- truly candy for the eyes, those gorgeous San Diego sunsets and such.  I also liked the relationships in the film and honestly, until it was pointed out by others, I never even suspected there was anything homoerotic about it.  The thought never crossed my mind.  I'm still not quite sure I believe this accusation.

Anyway, ultimately it doesn't matter that much why a person likes a movie.  If you like a film, watch it... if not, don't.  This one is definitely in my top 25 alltime favorites.  It has become a permanent part of pop culture, and actually helped to define the 1980's as a decade.  For that reason alone, it should be seen at least once.  If you end up not liking it, just pop in a different flick next time... no big deal.
