Just tried out this workout and it is killer! I have been doing a rotation of several Jillian DVD's for about 4-months and was getting bored and decided to add a new one. One of things that I felt was missing from my other DVD's was solid lower body results. Most of them are always a lot of kickboxing and sculpting of the arms. But, I never once felt sore in my legs. After doing this dvd's lower body workout, my thighs felt ALIVE! The burn is no joke here. I used 5lb weights and the first time I did Last Chance + Upper body back to back I couldn't get through it all. Now, I am not sure if this is a massive calorie burner though. I felt the cardio circuits were very basic calisthenics, not super high intensity and not very interesting. You will sweat though, don't get me wrong. I just love the sculpting here.

Now, I also understand people taking issue with Jillian's lack of professionalism in some of this, especially when compared to my other DVDs from her (shred, BFBM, NMTZ). But, she still does a great job motivating, explaining the moves, and gives you a hardcore workout. If you are like me and use DVDs mostly for cues and background noise, then this is perfect. But, if you are the type who is glued to the screen and hangs on every word, then yes, you might get annoyed.

Overall, LOVE this workout! It is a great compliment to other Jillian DVDs.
