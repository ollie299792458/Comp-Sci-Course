I loved Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet and Cleopatra which I saw twice. Now that she passed I wanted to see more of her and her legacy. In one of the reviews it says Mrs. Taylor thought this movie was trash . Well I am not convinced , anyone can look good on a fantastic set like Cleopatra or a fantastic script, but to take a mediocre movie and give the performance of a lifetime- that's an amazing actress. This movie dealt with a different moral code of the time and Mrs Taylor was brave to take on the issues. Understanding the underdog and making them look in a positive light from a different perspective is something Elizabeth Taylor did in her life too. It seems to be the niche' she played in many of her movies too.  I just can't think of another actress today that could have done this role as good as she did. It sort of reminds me of the role of Marilyn Monroe in Bustop only that one had a happier ending, and also Breakfast at Tiffanies with Audrey Hepburn while this movie, darker,  had a deeper message about humanity.
