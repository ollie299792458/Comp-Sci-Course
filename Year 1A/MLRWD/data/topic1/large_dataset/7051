Men often have the sense that they need to maintain their masculinity to be appreciated by society. (often women) Since I pursue a career that work very closely with men to achieve the personal and social status they want to achieve, I have constantly heard my fellow brothers talk about the movie as if it is a meteor that has crashed on Earth just because there are two guys in this movie kissing and making out. My response is: big deal?

This movie crossed the boundaries many viewers place on themselves about how "human beings" should behave. In fact, I am sure that many female viewers of this movie understand more about the "attraction" and "love" that made and destroyed these two characters better than most men do. But putting all that aside, I think all of us can agree that this movie has many extraordinary values, and if we can accept these values, or even appreciate these values for the true messages this movie delivers, then doesn't it just make sense that, whatever your viewpoint is, this is still a movie worth watching?

Great job hollywood, keep up the good work.
