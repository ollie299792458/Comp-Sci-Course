I can only repeat the great things already written about this film -- but on another level, THELMA & LOUISE probably changed the very face of movies, and its influence remains today.  
How, you may ask?  Through one scene and one scene alone, the definition of male sexuality in American cinema was forever changed.  It also made Brad Pitt a major Hollywood star.  
I'm talking about the scene in the lonely hotel room where Pitt took off his shirt for Geena Davis, revealing six-pack abs, well-defined shoulders, a muscular chest and nary an ounce of fat to be seen.  Brad Pitt took off his shirt and the women of America lost their collective minds.  The reaction in movie theatres to that scene was so visceral that every Hollywood leading man since has learned the potential value of hitting the weight room to "pump up".  
Think about it.  Today, a movie producer wouldn't dream of casting a leading man who wasn't at least in top physical condition, and preferably with a killer bod to boot.  Before THELMA & LOUISE, a good male hardbody was a luxury in movies, and it usually manifested itself in action movies -- think Schwarzenegger or Van Damme. Today, a Hollywood male actor has zero chance of being considered "sexy" unless he's got that Brad Pitt bod that America first saw in THELMA & LOUISE.
