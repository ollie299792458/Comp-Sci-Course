I watched this movie because I am interested in cultural representations of suburbia in America.  I did heavy research on such imagery and saw repeated references to The Truman Show.  So I watched and I was stunned by how Truman's entire world was fabricated to create the "ideal" life, much like a suburban environment.  
The irony is, that the Truman Show was filmed at Seaside, a "new urbanist" development designed by architect Andres Duany, a critic of suburban design.  New urbanism is supposedly a movement against the conformity and sprawling layout of traditional suburban development.  Clearly, Truman's "new urbanist" environment is just as conforming and fabricated as suburbia (if not more so).  In the Truman Show, the main character played by Jim Carey realizes exactly how controlled his environment is, and essentially loses it and tries to escape to the "real world."  
While the main plot focuses on the paranoia of having his life broadcasted worldwide, I was more fascinated with the representation of this "new urbanist" environment (which actually exists!) as a freakishly-controlled bubble or a design experiment.  It's a great critique on new suburban, "progressive" design ideas.
