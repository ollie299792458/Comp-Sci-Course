It seems like a movie based on the exploits of the MST3K charters would work so well.  They are all over the top personalities (for robots) and always have the wittiest observations on the horrible movies they watch.  But as a fan of the now defunct show, I feel there is something missing  from the film.  
Of course there is no real story.  It is just Mike  Nelson floating up in space with robots being forced to watch bad movies by  the evil Dr. Forrester.  It is almost like a B movie itself, but with witty  comments and better acting.  What makes the show so great is often the  comments they make on the films.  The main characters (Mike, Tom Servo and  Crowe) are visible watching the film in a theater and can be heard making  wise cracks about how bad the movie is.  Just like when you are watching a  bad movie with friends.  Unfortunately, the movie (which the Dr. claims is  the worst around and might be right) doesn't give them much to talk about.  The uesless "This Island Earth" isn't even bad enough to  acknowledge.  The story line of the bots breaking the spacecraft and fixing  it is kind of funny and they do manage to make a few good wise cracks, but  it isn't one of the best bashing.  It is just like an average episode of  the show.  I would recommend getting a few episode as a cheap as you can  and enjoying those instead.  The film is still funny and witty.  A marginal  recommendation from me on the "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The  Movie".
