I have watched "Jesus" many times since it first aired on CBS, and each time I have enjoyed it all the more.  Granted, there are numerous fallicies to the film - often blatant contradictions with Scripture - but the spirit of the film portrays a side of Jesus I know quite well.  He laughs.  He plays.  He splashes His disciples with water.  There is a joy about Him that I haven't seen in other films.  A tenderness in His eye and a genuine humility about Him is what I saw in this film.
Some have problems with Mary of Bethany being in love with Jesus, and perhaps with Jesus being in love with her back (it was never outrightly stated that He was).  I don't.  Yes, Isaiah 53 says that Christ had nothing about His physical appearance that would attract us to Him, but His personality was 100% attracting for some.  How else would He have gotten so many followers?  I, for one, know that I would have been in love with Him had I been around in His days.  He's the perfect Man!  What young girl in her right mind wouldn't fall in love with the perfect Man?  In fact, 2,000 years later, I have fallen in love with Him.  Why is it so hard to believe that a young woman in His time would fall in love with Him?  I think it was completely possible.
The film is great for those who are looking more for the personality of Christ than for specific Biblical accuracy.  The overall theme is what draws me back to this film time and time again.  I suggest watching it together as a family with a Bible close at hand to discuss the inaccuracies in the film.
