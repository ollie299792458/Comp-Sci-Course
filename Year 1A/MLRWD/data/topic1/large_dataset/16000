It may not be as realistic as the first one but thought it was still funny and i am christen i go to church and all but i think if you don't like it don't go online and cry about it because i hate people who do that cause i want to see them write and produce a movie instead because its hard so here is my honest review the movie was fantastic they really improved adding a 3D feature and its a story of to friends meeting after being separated like no other ever made and i have to say it it was worth paying extra to see in 3D with new guest like waffle bot, maria's dad and family also it is not a family movie it is rated R so before you go and went it and freak out when your kids see breast and hears swearing you should not watch it unless you are 16 and over don't watch it also its not insulting Christmas you people are when Christmas comes around at my house we don't open presents we go to church and wish Jesus a happy birthday not run around with trees and gifts and on my last sentence i recommend it 100% and have a good day
