This film had something for everyone: a loving view into a Jewish family, including a beautiful Shabbat ceremony we rarely get to see on-screen; a relationship between two women, each of whom wants to find the right someone who "gets" her; and a theme about having the courage to go after the things you want the most. 
Scott Cohen is gorgeous and appealing as Josh Meyers, Jessica Stein's difficult boss, ex-boyfriend and friend of her brother. Cohen moves Josh from bitter and judgmental through a significant journey, especially when he sees Jessica summon the courage to be happy and seek her dreams. He shows off his unique ability to bring complexity and heart to otherwise difficult characters.  He sings beautifully, too!
Tovah Feldshuh is brilliant and touching as the Jewish mother with a true understanding of her daughter. This is no caricature here: she has one of the most touching scenes in the entire film. Jackie Hoffman was fun and funny as Jessica's best friend and coworker Joan, who lives vicariously through Jessica and Helen's adventures.
Jennifer Westfeldt (Jessica Stein) and Heather Juergensen (Helen Cooper) wrote, produced and starred in this wonderful, touching, funny view of single life in New York today. In fact, New York itself was a character in this film, providing both opportunities and barriers to the relationships among the characters. The writing and performances are fast and brilliant, and the characters are drawn very well. It's sometimes hard to hear this fast-paced film because the audience is laughing so much. I highly recommend it!
