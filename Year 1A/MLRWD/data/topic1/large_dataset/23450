I think there may be confusion regarding the footage in the Unrated Director's Cut of this film.  I was confused when I first saw this particular DVD.  Watching it straight through again at home, I didn't notice anything different about the unrated version and the version I had seen in the theaters a while back.  So, I watched it with the commentary track (Vin Diesel, David Twohy).  Supposedly, a few scenes had not made it into the theatrical release, but I could have sworn that everything on the unrated version DVD was in the theatrical version as well.  
My recommendation is that if anyone is trying to decide which version to buy on DVD, get the unrated version.  I say this because on the commentary track, director David Twohy mentions which scenes were supposedly not in the theatrical release.  My feeling is that without those scenes, the character development would suffer a bit, as well as the overall pace of the film.  
Besides that, the quality of the DVD is very good.  Picture and sound are nearly perfect, and there are plenty of special features.  
Many people didn't like this movie, but I am not one of them.  If you liked it, I would definitely recommend getting the DVD.  And get the unrated version.
