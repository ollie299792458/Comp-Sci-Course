Do not watch this long, terribly incoherent movie. 
The scenes do not flow together in a sensible manner. There was NO storyline. In essence, the whole film was just some senseless hallucinations of this guilt-ridden paramedic played by Nicholas Cage. 
There were too much illogical ideas in this movie. The characters in the movie were behaving in a way I really don't understand. Why was the other paramedic beating up his patient - cuz he despied him? What happened to Nicholas Cage in the end? Why did Nicholas Cage stop his narrating towards the second half of the movie. I was, annoyed and at best, baffled, for the length of the film.
Trying to make comedy of a dark theme such as death was a failure here. The handling of mood in the movie was simply ridiculous. One moment, the viewer is put through a serious, dramatic tension, and quite abruptly, fun, disco music takes over. It was difficult to adapt one's dispostion to suit the movie with its incoherent style of mood.
To talk about real drama, this movie really doesn't have it. The movie keeps repeating the same idea - of how the paramedics arrive at a scene where someone dies in their hands. There was no outstanding, central storyline -  Perhaps this could explain why there was even no conclusion for the movie!
The movie's good point was the noteworthy performances of the actors. But the incoherence, flat storyline pretty much destroys everything.
I'm actually surprised at the sizeable amount of aclaim for this movie. With that in mind, I think it's fair to conclude, this movie is one that some esoteric folks will appreciate, but for the regular viewers like me, this is one that's best left untouched.
