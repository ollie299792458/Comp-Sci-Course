It is disappointing to see just how poorly the video angles, camera placement and editing were done. The energy of the tap performances and the dancers was never the focus of attention - instead, the producer(s) seemed  to want to go crazy with their continuous jumping from one camera to  another without any thought to showing the performance in its best light.  The camera angles continually changed around the stage , with extreme  closeups of head and torso that simply did not do *any* justice to the  dancing.
The original "Riverdance - The Show" video is a *much*  better edited performance, albeit with fewer actual tap dancing scenes. The  performance of another similar video "Lord Of The Dance" did not  sit well with me either, perhaps because the originality and energy of the  dancers was subsumed in an over-produced, over-glitzy performance. Some  improvement in the editing over *this* video, but still not anywhere as  good as it could have been.
I would recommend the original  "Riverdance - The Show" over any of the subsequent  performances  that have been released. Now, if I could only find that performance in DVD  format - the only release that I know of is VHS!
