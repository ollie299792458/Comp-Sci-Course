I come across this movie one day at a used store where you can buy or sell movies Cd's and games. Not in the mood to purchase anything just killing time one afternoon and seen the packaging which caught my eye. I read the back and ask the guy if he seen it and he said he never heard of the movie before, so on that note and something telling me to buy it I did. Don't regret it a bit, for 8 bucks it was worth every dollar.

 Slow for a lot of persons out there whom like the newer cookie pattern horror; Scream, I know what you did...etc. But great for persons whom like to take there time to get there. This movie is a relief from today's standards and goes back to what horror/slasher films where slow low lighting basic plot and dialogue and cheap style camera work. And suspense building.

 Story takes place having Minersville Pa (20 min. ride from my house)being the back bone of a missing child in the late 80's and a bank robbery in today's time in Allentown Pa go wrong where two people are then hijacked and held hostage at remote location between Allentown and Bethlehem Pa where they thought was abandoned but don't realize that they are Victim's themselves to what lies ahead. Very well thought out with traces of Elm St., Halloween, Friday The 13, Amityville, The Shining etc. Enjoy and hope this helps in what I think is a rare gem.

 For those to note Allentown Pa is aprox. 25-30 minutes from Minersville if you get a little confused to the gap between the two places.
