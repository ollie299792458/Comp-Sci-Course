Back in 1939 aged 13 on holiday in Wales my parents took me to the cinema to see 'Four Feathers'. I was enthralled by the location and the acting and from that day the film became and still is my favourite. By 1945 I was serving my National Service and in December we embarked on the troop ship 'Strathmore' destination unknown. Off we sailed across The Bay of Biscay into the Med, a brief stop at Malta, on to Port Said through the Suez Canal where they announced our destination.....Khartoum.

And so I visited the scenes of my favourite film where I stayed until November 1947. In those days the Sudan and its people was a very friendly place so it saddens me to read of the long and bitter struggles that have existed there to this day.

Naturally whenevr 'Four Feathers ' is shown on TV it is a must for me and always will be. Wonderful colour,scenery,acting and a real 'Boys Own' adventure story. No swearing, no sex and no special effects.
