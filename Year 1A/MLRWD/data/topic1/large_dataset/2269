I went to see this film because Regis Philbin said it was the latest spy film out and it was great.

I expected a James Bond type thriller with all the action, women, gadgets, etc. that we come to expect from films of that genre.  I was disappointed with the opening scenes of the film when it became apparent that the time frame was the Kennedy era, and I was thinking, oh great, no computers, no cells phones, and no gadgets are going to add up to boring.....

As the movie unfolded, I was pleasantly surprised that the subject matter of how the CIA was formed was presented in an interesting, intriguing,
and intelligent manner.  All the actors and director, Robert DeNiro, deserve much praise with this effort.

All the prior reviews that describe the pro's and con's of this film are pretty accurate, but overall it's worth the trip to the theatre with one caveat, if you are under 45 or 50, you probably won't be interested in it unless you are a history buff.
