Though a few segments fell flat for me ("Matriculated", "World Record"), the others more than make up for it.  Combining anime creators with the Wachowski's post-apocalyptic vision was a stroke of pure genius.  "Second Renaissance" plays as a prequel to the first film, sort of a pre-history of The Matrix.  "Final Flight of the Osiris" and "Kid's Story" serve as a go-between, bridging the first and second films.  The others are kind of an anything goes approach, but attain a cohesiveness in style and theme. "A Detective's Story" has a downright tangible future noir feel that I can't recall seeing since Blade Runner.  The ghost story "Beyond" manages to be spooky, fun and beautiful all in the same frame.  The extras on the DVD are great fun as well, extremely informative, and packed with clips of the anime those interviewed are referencing.  The soundtrack CD -- available separately or in a two disc gift pack -- is the equal of the film, a great CD that'll likely stay in your stereo for some time.  Nicely done, and a must have for any Matrix or anime fan.
