One thing is obvious...the whole crew of this movie has been paid to come onto Amazon and vote down anyone who dares to say anything negative about this piece of crap. Whatever, who cares. I'm only here to save you money, not gain votes. Votes aren't going to buy my next car or get me money back for this piece of constipation debris.

Okay, so it's one of those movies that looks like a bunch of high school kids got all their friends together and said "let's make a horror movie." So all the mangled victims are smiling, laughing, taking their tops off, etc, while they're dying. There's not one moment of suspense or anything resembling horror and that's okay because every hollywood movie these days sucks beyond belief. The worst offence, though, is the story...

Anyone in their right mind knows this whole Piranha thing could've been solved by calling in a BP boat to spill enough oil to destroy the entire ocean and kill all the fish. Duh.

If you need a couple hours to kill while you're waiting to have all your teeth pulled, this might be for you cause it doesn't really achieve much beyond numbing your brain and reminding you that you only have so much time in the world and then you die.
