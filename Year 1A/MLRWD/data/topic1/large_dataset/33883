True Romance is one of the most overlooked movies of the 90's.  Unfortunately it was not a commercial success.  It's estimated budget was 13 million and box office returns were around 12.2 million.  Who knows why.  My opinion is that it was poorly marketed and studios didn't quite know what to do with this ultra violent, sharp dialogue style that became synonymous with Tarantino.  However it has achieved a certain cult status since it's release as more people came to realize Tarantino's involvement.

Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and Tony Scott directed. Boy did the two of them deliver.  Each character has a diamond sharp set of lines to deliver that are worthy dialogue for a lead.  The cast is full of A-list celebrities and performances that will be burned into your memory for life.  Gary Oldman as Drexel the pimp with racial identity issues, the epic sit down between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and Alabama's compelling sincerity are a few of the many stand out elements in this wonderful film.  Even Samuel L gets one of his classic cameos in the beginning.

What more can I say without ruining this movie for those who haven't seen it?  Part of what makes it so special is all the surprises.  So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.
