This is an epic adventure tale of a U.S. Navy Gunboat crew's experiences in late 1920's China. I originally saw this film when it was released with my older brother.  I was 10 years old at the time. Viewing the film,  particularly at that age, was a significant emotional experience for me.  By that I mean it shaped my perception of the world.  In my view, McQueen's  portrayal of his character's (Jake Holman) isolation from others and  "aloneness" (and the broader theme of every individual's  isolation) is unparalleled in screen history.  There are scenes in the film  where a facial expression or look across the camera of McQueen say more  than volumes of dialog ever could.  This is McQueen at his best  demonstrating his expertise, perhaps superior to any other actor before or  since, to visually express emotion without dialog in a remarkably subtle  and believable fashion.  McQueen matured as an actor in this film. It will  be impossible for anyone who has ever felt alone (who hasn't) not to have  great empathy for McQueen's character and come away from this movie  emotionally drained.  Neither this film nor McQueen's performance have ever  gotten the attention or recognition they deserve.  This movie was a unique  achievement.  In addition, McQueen's performance is supported by a superb  cast.  It would be a mistake not to see it.
