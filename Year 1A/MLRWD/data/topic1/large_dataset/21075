This is Volume Two of TCM's popular series,and it's even better than the first one.The films vary in quality."Female","Three On A Match",and
"Night Nurse" are typical low-budget WArner Bros.programmers of the
early Thirties-well-made,fast-moving fun."The Divorcee" and "A Free Soul",
on the other hand,are big-budget,full-scale MGM star vehicles-strong scripts,excellent performances,fine direction.Norma Shearer was never better(she won the Oscar for "Divorcee"),Lionel Barrymore was at his peak
(he won an Oscar for "Soul"),and Gable gives a star-making performance.
This is good classic fun!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OSC4G0">Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Volume Three (Other Men's Women / The Purchase Price / Frisco Jenny / Midnight Mary / Heroes for Sale / Wild Boys of the Road)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JDF8">TCM Archives - Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Vol. 1 (Waterloo Bridge [1931] / Baby Face / Red-Headed Woman)</a>
