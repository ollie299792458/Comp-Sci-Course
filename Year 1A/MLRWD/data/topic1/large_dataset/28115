Ugh. Where to start.

I rented this due to the higher ratings, and that I love zombies. I was VERY disappointed. The cinematography is good but every other aspect of the movie is pretty terrible.

I'm not a huge movie nerd or anything but the acting was TERRIBLE. There was a couple of instances where an actor would be cutting another off in the dialogue and would pause, so the other actor could interrupt--as if the timing wasn't right. There were also some cliche one-liners that were pretty pathetic. The actors seemed to be over-acting a bit while doing emotional things such as reflecting about life, etc. I felt like if even I could pick up on that, they were probably in some pretty poor shape.

If you walk faster than a slow shuffle, it's an impossibility to get bitten. This makes the zombies not very scary and every moment anyone is in danger, creates a feeling of 'COME ON! How did you NOT see that coming? They've been walking up to you for 20 minutes!"

The plot is, for the most part, pretty predictable. There were several loose ends, gaps or purposeless segments that were never tied to anything, such as a village shaman, how the infection started, etc.

The character development was weak and left me not really caring if the main characters survived, which is not how you should feel during a movie.

Save your money for a better movie.
