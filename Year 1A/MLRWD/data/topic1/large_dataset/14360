As I watched the opening half hour of this film, I thought to myself, "How is it that I never knew about this?" A fascinating and encouraging look into the anti-war efforts of Vietnam soldiers, this movie is packed with information and stories about widespread opposition that I was never aware of.

The image of soldiers throwing their medals away in Washington, DC is a powerful one, and a testament to the courage of those willing to take the unpopular stance of opposing the government's standard line of the war being a necessary one. Vets are interviewed who suffered violence, insults, and spent time in jail for their beliefs. To be reminded that there are those who have risked and endured far, far more than myself and friends in opposing violence is very encouraging and emboldening.

Perhaps the only thing that taints the film is the continuous presence of Jane Fonda, who - while a strong voice against the war - famously accused American POWs of lying about being tortured by the Viet Cong when they were captured. The film does not examine this controversy whatsoever, and treats Fonda as just another anti-war demonstrator who happened to be a celebrity.  Being an anti-torture activist, this did not sit well with me.

However, about 90% of the film did resonate very positively with me, and I highly recommend it for any peace activist who needs a bit of encouragement and for those unaware of the courage in the (surprising large) anti-Vietnam-war movement.
