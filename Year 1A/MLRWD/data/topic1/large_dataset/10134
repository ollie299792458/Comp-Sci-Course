It seemed like eternity, and a lot of rumors from gossip magazines, until the Sex and the City movie was released. As an avid fan, I devoured every minute of it.

Here are some important things to note:

*The beginning was everything I could've asked for. I loved Aiden, but Big just had something just as unique as Carrie that I always loved. I always rooted for him, no matter how many times they broke up. I loved seeing Carrie happy for a change.

*The marriage of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston (it was so weird to hear his first name over and over!) True to form, Mr. Big finds some way to break her heart. But he did it in a BIG, BIG way. I was truly angered by this. The whole time he was sitting in his car I was thinking "you're such a coward." It seems so unreal to me that even Big would sink to something that low; but he did, and luckily, in the end everything worked out for the both of them.

*Charlotte and Harry's daughter(s). I know after the very last episode of Sex and the City, when we see Lily for the first time, everybody was dying to see what she actually looked like. And of course we all wanted Charlotte and Harry to have a baby, because frankly they are the perfect couple. I was over-joyed when she found out she was pregnant; we've been watching these girls for so long, it's almost as exciting as a family member getting pregnant. Having gone through a troubling time with my first pregnancy, I really think Charlotte did an amazing job portraying the fear of a "high risk" pregnancy.

*Smith and Samantha. Although I didn't like that she moved to L.A. at first, and thought she would remain there, the movie took a twist and she ended up right where she belonged. Part of me is sad that they broke up because quite frankly Smith is the best thing she's ever had, but part of me was happy to see the "old" Samantha come back. I love her antics, the way she talks and the way she acts. And the way she ended things were beautiful but true to form. She loved him, but she loved herself more. Very empowering.

*Miranda, Steve and Brady. Their roles were so very deep in this movie.. Especially with Steve's mother. And, as Sex and the City always does, they gave them a situation that many couples are faced with; infidelity. My heart did break a little when she moved out, and you could tell he was heartbroken, but the outcome did not disappoint me. And to watch Brady grow was so amazing; I am sure many were just as excited as me to see what he looked like after a few years had gone by.

*Jennifer Hudson's role in this movie. She did such an amazing job as a supporting (literally) actress. She's strong, she's blunt, but she was exactly what Carrie needed at that moment in her life.

*And last, but certainly not least, the four of the girls together, just like old times. I always get jealous of their support system. They are there for each other throughout everything. Even with Samantha some thousand miles away, you could feel the same strength of their friendship that you feel throughout the series.

This movie did the series justice, which pleasantly surprised me. I would highly suggest it for all the fabulous SATC fans :)
