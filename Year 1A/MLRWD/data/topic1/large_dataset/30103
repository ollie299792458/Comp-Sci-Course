There's nothing I can add to what has already been said about these films themselves, and how beautifully they showcase the genius of Buster Keaton--his brilliance with stunt gags in OH and with cinematic tricks in SJ.

I would like to comment on the music.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I find the added music score of SJ mostly apt and a credit to the moods and tones of the film, although there are moments when it draws too much attention to itself. The music for OH, though, just doesn't work.  A great deal of it is ragtime--for a film set in the 1830s!--and it often doesn't match up at all with what's going on on screen.  (An exception is the climactic waterfall sequence, where the music is pretty good.)

I have an old videotape of a "Great Performances" showing of "Our Hospitality" from the late 80s or early 90s, with a magnificent orchestral score by Carl Davis.  I wish THAT version was available on DVD, but it doesn't seem to be.  But at least these films do have orchestral scores, and not piano or organ accompaniment--which can work well enough in a theatrical showing, if it's done well, but which in general diminishes any film it's attached to.
