Now this is the kind of film that Orson Welles would have loved. Miike does it again by surpassing the stunning stylizations of ''Izo'' to come up with a wonderful take on the flexibility of the western genre. Just as the spaghetti western twisted the stylistic forms of traditional Hollywood oaters, Miike bends both into a hyperrealistic dimesion where gunfighters/samurai/yakuza (each with their own multi-levelled gestalts) can do moral combat. No wonder Tarentino loves this guy.

Think of the plot of Corbucchi's ''Django'' (as boroque a spaghetti western as you will find) filter it through Leone, toss in Kurosawa's Yojimbo, and stir liberally while adding dashes of Hideo Gosha and Nick Ray's ''Johnny Guitar.'' Get the picture? Maybe you just have to see it. Don't take my word for it, but this is a beautiful homage  by one of the world cinema's most brilliant auteurs. A gilmmering hallway of mirrors, reflecting infinitely on what has become a truely international mythos - that of the American west.
