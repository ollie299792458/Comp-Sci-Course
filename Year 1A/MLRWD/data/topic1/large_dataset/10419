Clint Eastwood is a great actor, a great director, a jazz musician and an ass-kicker when he has to be; with Gran Torino he uses all of these skills.

Clint portrays Walt Kowalski, a retired auto-worker, a man who's life is a juxtaposition of his wife's death, his disconnect with his children and grandchildren, his Korean War memories and lastly his own mortality. He lives in a neighborhood emptied of friends, most who have moved or passed away to be replaced by Hmong immigrants from Southeast Asia. Walt and his Hmong neighbors understanding of each other and eventual friendship is what this film is about.

Walt is tough, but not your typical tough-guy; he show's a range of emotions through out the film. And Gran Torino is not your typical shoot em' up revenge film, it's much more cerebral than that. Oh, there's action alright, and Walt's nobody to mess with, but Gran Torino is more "Unforgiven" than "Dirty Harry". It's a complex story, with complex characters living a "gritty" existence.

A very good film by any standards, and a must see film for Eastwood fans.

Oh yes, Kyle Eastwood did a nice job with the soundtrack. The title track performed by Jamie Cullum is excellent. Very haunting. Nice jazz.
