I thoroughly enjoyed this film - it may not have the world's best script, and is quite possibly not the best movie of the year, however... i liked the direction in many ways, this had some lovely sequences in it, especially the 'in-between' worlds sequences, simply beautiful. The casting was quite adequete. Susan Sarandon was sensational, she is becoming quite the 'Bette Davis' of our era i think. The consummate actress who, i think, due to her talent, will never stop working, and there will always be a role for her. I always find Rachael Weisz interesting to begin with - but she never ends up taking me anywhere too interesting, or holding my interest at that! The best performance of this movie is Stanley Tucci as Mr. Harvey. Anyone who remembers him in 'Shall We Dance' must reflect on that film after seeing him in this one, and conclude that he is truly one of the most versatile and talented movie actors of our generation. He makes every scene of this characterization of the child killer - although seemingly simple man - so intriguing and interesting to watch - I was captivated by his every scene.

The story and the subject matter - based on the well known novel of the same name - is disturbingly shocking, and ultimately terribly heart-breaking. Peter Jackson's depiction on film of this story helps the audience 'feel' the sublte aspects of the relationships - and this is what I like most about the film i think.

I am very surprised there is no Special Features on this DVD. I would have thought there'd be at least a featurette about the making of the film, if not a Director's Commentary. I would be very interested in watching this movie with Peter Jackson's commentary - as i liked the direction very much.
