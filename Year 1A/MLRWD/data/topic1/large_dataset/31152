Judging from the reviews below, you would think this movie was on the verge of something great. WRONG.

IMO The storyline was very weak. I will give you a few examples.

The movie introduces too much information. For example, Frasier's girlfriend's brother (Notice how I don't know his name). He's introduced to the movie in the first 10 minutes as a person who is always in trouble with the law and shares an apartment with Frasier and his girlfriend. The next time you see or hear about this character is near the end - he's sleeping on the couch.

The next horrible character was Jodie Foster. She is introduced as a "problem solver for hire." However, her role is useless because when she confronts the bank robbeer she doesn't solve the problem. She is sprinkled throughout the rest of the movie for no reason at all.

In the movie, the robbers take everyones cell phone. One of the hostage has his kid with him. The kid offers to put his PSP into the bag. The robber, who seems fond of the kid, tells him to keep it. Considering the the PSP has wireless access one would assume this decision will come back to bite the bad guy the end. It's called FORESHADOWING. Instead, the PSP is shown as a device which has violent games on it that can influence our kids. Good message, but it was a wasted message.

Finally, it was not clear why the bank robber was robbing the bank. It was not clear how he knew which safe deposit box to steal. It was not clear why the bank robber wanted to expose the head of the bank as an evil person. It was not clear if the robbery was personal or if it was random.

Overall, the movie did not build up it's characters. The characters are flat. There is no growth. If you are a movie buff, this movie you can afford to miss.
