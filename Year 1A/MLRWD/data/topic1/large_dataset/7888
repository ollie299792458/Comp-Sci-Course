So, the follow up to 'Lock, Stock' and the general consensus seems to be that it's been rubbished by the US. Come on, the Brits don't often make a quality cult film like this! This was a good follow-up and the action flowed a little better with the dialogue being slightly sharper. Vinnie Jones, though having a small role is excellent. Whilst being similar to Big Chris in 'Lock, Stock', the character is a tiny bit softer and funnier. Jason Statham is excellent as the cool-headed Turkish, backed by the funny Tommy. Remarks that audiences couldn't understand the accents so the film failed itself, are unfair. The majority of films on the market are American and we have to deal with the huge range of accents. The director has made a huge effort to keep the accents and settings authentic e.g. Brad Pitt went on location with some gypsies to get his accent right (backed up by Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham). Perhaps what this film does best is to point out that not all Brits sound posh!!! This is a good cult film on this side of the Atlantic and Guy Ritchie is set for big things. Give Brit films a break, we sat through 'Reservoir Dogs' didn't we?!
