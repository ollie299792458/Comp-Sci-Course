i went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it.  maybe "enjoy" isn't the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot.  in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks.  but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out.  it succeeds here.  it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence.  Sure, it makes the Gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say " it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side"..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking.
