Why I'm so honered cause his dad Melvin Van Peebles directed "Sweet Sweet Back Badasssss Song" the first black cinema movie. New Jack City has a drug lord name Nino Brown played by (Wesley Snipes) who he and his crew too over a apartment building which made them even richer. Ice T is a cop in this movie back which was a shock to see back then cause he not too long made a song called "Cop Killer" anyway back to the movie he has a lost cause crack Pooky played by (Chris Rock) who he shot at first cause he tried to stell his money then he became a junky them Ice T character "Scotty" got him off the streets into rehab Pooky wanted to pay him back by helping him take Nino down so his job was to see if he can get a job at working for Nino Brown under cover with wering a belt that has a hidden cam. Their are some problems with letting him take a job like that cause he has to sell drugs and the cops are afraid he might get back into taking drugs again same goes for Ninos employes they recoginze him from the past he use to be their best customer it won't do no good if he just eat their products.
