So I'm a sucker for an epic; this one is definitely that.  Filmed in Jordan and Morocco, it's the desert in wide screen glory.  And there's even a story in there, which, while not at all historically accurate, does occasionally move the desert scenes along.
No one gives fanatic looks quite like Peter O'Toole, and the quiet way in which he says something as simple as "yes" is fascinating.  This was Omar Sharif's introduction to the western film world, and he's just wonderful.  Anthony Quinn is over the top, stealing every scene shamelessly and with panache.
In the character supporting roles, Claude Raines is as smooth and elegant as ever.  Alec Guiness is, what can I say, he's Alex Guiness -- a man who almost disappears into each role and yet is so distinctive.
Maurice Jarre's music carries the movie along; without his genius, this epic would have been rather flat.  The soundtrack is well worth your money, by the way.
This is one of my husband's favorites.  I quite like it, too, as long as I don't see it very often.  A long separation between viewings keeps it relatively fresh, and one can spot something new each time.
