First, I should say that I will always see any movie with Reilly or Hayek in it.  They are among the best performers these days.  So, even if I hadn't read the books, I would have probably enjoyed this movie.  But I did read the books, and I thought that this was a very faithful adaptation.  Sure, a purest might quibble with a few plot changes, but they worked quite well.

  The storyline involves a teenager who becomes a vampire's assistant.  He is a really decent kid, and we follow him as he learns about the world of vampires and "freaks."  In many ways, the book is actually rather compassionate.  I liked the treatment of the "freaks."

  What I particularly liked about the movie was the way the world of the cirque was presented.  I loved the sets, the costumes, the intelligent design in everything.  Finally, while I loved the performance of the stars, I was amazed at all the fine talent in the support cast.  Orlando Jones, as the thin man, is fun, for example.  And I found the depiction of the snake boy very touching.  I thought Mr. Tiny was wonderfully done, along with the "bad guys."  I think the performer that played Steve was very, very excellent.

  So, I understand this didn't do so great at the box office.  If that is true, it is a shame.  It deserves a sequel or two to finish up the story arc!
