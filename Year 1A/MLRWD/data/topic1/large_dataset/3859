This movie is what I call "Pure" Sci-Fi... one that takes our reality, then adds a Science-Fiction element to it.  [i]Contact[/i] will not bore you if you get into the movie.  Ellie Arroway, portrayed beautifully by Jodie Foster, shows you just what a scientist's life is like, slightly Hollywoodized, on the silver screen.  Her spiritual, emotional, and scientific journey is one I don't think you'll want to miss.
Are there aliens out there?  Is the main question and plot of this movie.  "It would be an awful waste of space."
It also delves a bit into the politics of the science world, which is refreshing and different for a Sci-Fi film.  The plot is also quite similar to the book, which I also recommend reading.
The DVD, while preserving the sound and video to almost perfection, has included some worthwhile features.  The "making of" sequences tell quite a bit how a movie comes to light.
Last but not least, if you're still not convinced, then you should get the movie just for the beginning and climax.  Keeping an open mind will help you understand just how those parts of the film are interesting, theoretical, and contraversial.
