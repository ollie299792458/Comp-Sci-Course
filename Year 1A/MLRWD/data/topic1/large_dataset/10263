I don't usually watch movies more than once or twice, but I've probably seen this one twenty times over my lifetime.  I'll go further in portraying myself as a dork and say that I think of it often.

There are so many hilarious tidbits in this movie that it would be a waste of time to chronicle them.  I would like to say that seeing this movie demands your respect for the comedy veterans that paid their dues during the 50's and 60's who end up in this flick.  Aside from younger folks like Randy Quaid, John Byner and Austin Pendleton, there are a number of faces people my age grew up seeing on lots of B-level shows like Love American Style, Bewitched and the like.  Real Ham and Egger's who made it in the business.  Their timing is polished and spot-on.

The pace is frantic and the dialogue is so funny.  Nothing is ever allowed to bruise the laugh....old school stuff.  Like many others, I'm not a big Babs fan, but she is incredibly funny and pretty in this.  Ryan O'Neal and Madeline Kahn are hilarious.  For all of you music majors out there, just keep in mind your most socially inept, poorly dressed, clumsy musicology teacher and you will surely relate to Dr. Bannister.

Of all the scenes I love, my favorite is the short take between Dr. Bannister and the hotel manager.  The deadpan, the barely controlled rage.....classic.

Check it out.
