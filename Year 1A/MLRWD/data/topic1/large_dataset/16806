The Covent has been called on of the year's best independent horror films and deservedly so.This has one of the best openings for a horror film ever.A car pulls up in front of a boarding school and out walks Christine armed with a baseball bat,a shotgun,and a can of gasoline.Upon entering,she opens up a can of whoopass on a group of nuns and a priest with the bat before blowing them away with the shotgun.(Pretty damn cool,huh?)
  The rest of the film is fantastic with a great cast including rapper Coolio and Bill Mosely(better known as Choptop from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2)as 2 crooked cops.It also features Adrieanne Barbeu who played one of the most annoying characters ever in Creepshow.This movie also features the gorgeous Chanton Anderson.The Convent also has gore galore including plenty of decapatations,eyes gouged out,faces being ripped off,and heads being smashed.However,this film is not without its flaws.Some of the scenes don't make sense like when the female lead runs up to a cop screaming for help and covered in blood.What does the cop do?He shoots at her.What the hell?I thought policemen are supposed to help people not shoot at them.Then there's the oral sex scene which,in my opinion,could have been more grapic and violent.I'm assuming it wasn't more graphic because of those bastards at the MPAA(may they all burn in hell).And finally,this movie could have used a lot more T&amp;A.With all the cast members,you'd think there would be more sex.About the only T&amp;A scene is the bloody shower scene with Chanton Anderson.How she keeps those big beautiful melons of hers in that top,I may never know.The only reason I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of T&amp;A.Still,this movie is well worth the price.I'll never grow tired of watching this movie.
