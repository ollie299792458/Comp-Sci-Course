I fear the man who gave this item a 1 star probably is pretty grumpy.

I liked this film. It seems to ask some certain questions (are zombies really dead?), and offers a possible insight impact on people who don't want to be undead--by being buried with your head removed.

I found the film perpetually strange. I grew up in the 50's and watched the shows of the times, and the goofy allusions to this time frame are used very well. All the cliche's from the fifties television shows (and "Lassie") are highlighted and given a run through.

Odd to think that the "vast wasteland" once spoken of, is now considered the role model the Right Wing holds so dear.

One real annoyance: how come Billy Connolly didn't make any commentary?  And why would a master verbal comic decide to do a role where he has no speaking parts (growling doesn't count as dialog)? He does use his face to an amazing  degree, and makes you realize what an actor he could be if only given that one good role.
