This was a beautiful movie.  The sets were fantastic, the scenery was moving.  It was, in fact, the only movement whatsoever in the entire production.

This movie was painful.  Really, really painful.  Nothing of any consequence happened... or seemed to.  The story was all in the background, a context through which the characters altogether failed to move.  Keira Knightly is breathtaking, but she and Alfred Molina portray the only two characters who seem to have any life to them whatsoever.  She was really only in a few scenes, nowhere near enough to redeem this production.  The main character was sodden, gloomy, and altogether uninteresting.  The best single word to describe him would be "pathetic" if only there were some pathos, some connection between him and the viewer.  Sadly, that connection so spectacularly fails to develop that, when I found that I had missed a line of muttered or mumbled dialog (the majority of the plot is conveyed via a sort of moaning, whispered narrative voice over) I found that I really did not care.

Save yourself, you'll never be able to get the two hours of your life back if you waste them watching this movie.
