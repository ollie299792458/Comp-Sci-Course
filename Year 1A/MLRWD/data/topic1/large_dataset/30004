For my first time watching "Joy Ride", starring Paul Walker, Leelee sobieski,and Steve Zahn this action packed thriller kept me on the edge of my seat. This movie is about 2 brothers taveling to new jersey and along the way deciding to pull a prank on a truck driver using a CB radio. One of the brothers posed as a girl and started messing around with the trucker hoping to get a good laugh. What they thought was a practical joke turned out to be completely different and causing the trucker to stalk them and make them run for their lives.

What makes this movie great is how it's not like other movies where you can probably predict what will happen next. "Joy Ride" will keep you guessing. When you think you know what will happen, something completely different occurs. The thrill of this movie how its believeable. People can take jokes too seriously and take it to drastic measures like the trucker,"Rusty Nails", in this movie.

I recommend "Joy Ride" to anyone who loves thrillers! This one will definaltely leave you wanting to see more and keep you guessing. I really enjoy horror/thriller movies and this by far is an amazing movie. I look forward to seeing the sequel to it and im sure you will too.
