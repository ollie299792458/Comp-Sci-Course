A Walk in the Clouds is not a new, ground-breaking film that challenges the intellect.  But it never said it was trying to be.  It is the warm, familiar Tollhouse Cookie just out of the oven in a kitchen full of exotic deserts being made, constantly trying to outdo each other.

Keanu Reeves, whom I usually detest, gives a surprisingly warmer side and shows emotion in his dialogue (which is completely free from sexual innuendos and the use of the word "dude"-a first for Mr. Reeves, I believe).  Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n is a fresh new talent.  Giancarlo Giannini has a convincing character of a man who doesn't pull any punches, yet alludes to a deeper, more human side underneath.  Anthony Quinn, probably the biggest name in this production, is the warm, sweet grandfather, who has the best lines of the film ("I have faith in my son and I have faith in you.... but your fly is open").

There is a reign of Romanticism in this film, and in the tradition of Like Water for Chocolate, A Walk in the Clouds is designed to evoke the senses, setting the majority of the movie in a rather large Napa vineyard, and having such scenes as the one where the family crushes the grapes (without the assitance of Lucille Ball, I'm afraid).  Such scenes are complimented by the music, with a decidedly Mariachi feel.

A Walk in the Clouds is meant to be a film that tells a sweet story of a love that conquers its adversaries (much like many of the MGM movie musicals-Brigadoon comes to mind), and leaves the viewer with a satisfied, warm, feeling at the end.  What's perhaps the most remarkable about it is that it succeeds in doing so.
