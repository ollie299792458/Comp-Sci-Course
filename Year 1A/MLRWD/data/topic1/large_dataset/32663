I teach a health policy class and one of the things we learn about is political advocacy. Harvey Milk was a true grassroots political advocate!  This movie shows this role far better than I could ever lecture on the topic.  Also - students (college) like a variety of teaching methods so using this movie paired with a discussion about the role of a political advocate - the challenges, the triumphs, the techniques, etc is fabulous!  The students like it - and I like it.  I do put in a disclaimer re: the religious right bashing, gay bashing, and display of gay intimacy (which by the way is very tastefully done) so students are prepared and may choose to opt out or close their eye/ears during these scenes (so far no one has).  These are adult students by the way.  I lost my orginal copy - so am ordering this agian. {sigh}  I know I'll find it as soon as the order goes through - doesn't that often happen?

But it - watch it with friends - have a lively discussion about political advocacy, the environmental factors that drove Mr. Milk to become so invovled, and the enviornmental factors that lead to is demise.

Unlike a previous poster - I liked the back and forth with the news footage and the movie - it gives credibility to the re-telling of Mr. Milk's legacy.
