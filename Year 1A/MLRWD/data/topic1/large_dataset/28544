A movie which could really have been a philosophical, meditative masterpiece such as Schumacher's later Flatliners, but instead turned out to be a cheezy, obvious tale with some pathetic plot "twists,"  The Lost Boys is perhaps one of the most unfortunate films ever created.  For some reason, the creators took a paradoxical approach of telling a  moderately comical story about some vampires but ended up creating a  crumbling mess of cloying cuteness through which one may catch glimpses of  what grandeur they could have achieved had they put more depth into it and  turned it into a parable about generational decay and its relation to the  supernatural evil. As it stands, even the reason for the existence of all  those "damn vampires" is unclear, because their commander lacks  any depth whatsoever and appears in two or so scenes - first, to serve as a  comic relief, then simply to get killed. The haunting symbolism of  roller-coasters and bizarre special effects hint at the moral depravity of  the "lost souls" of the generation - all in vain. From the  beginning credits to the final "humorous remark" of the main  characters' grandfather, The Lost Boys is a shameful failure.
