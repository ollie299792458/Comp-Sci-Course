I saw this first in 1985 when I was 23 years old. I don't remember what I really thought about it then. I guess I thought it was "okay".  Well, the library had it and so I brought it home. For 11 years or so, we had no TV or movies in our lives. Now we have a 13" video player and watch all the great old classics. We wanted to see this to see Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn as older folks together, since we have liked them in some of the old classics.
My opinion of this film...it is horrible. It was a big waste of time for me,but I saw it through to the end, to see what I remembered. All I remembered was that the old folks swam in the pool with the cocoons in it and felt better. That's about it. If I had remembered all the inappropriate language ( I just don't like hearing people swearing, and to hear old folks swearing and using sexual gutter language is even worse!) I wouldn't have bothered to watch it. I love how in the old films, everyone got along just fine without swearing all the time. Why do the modern films have to have it? People call this a family film??? I wouldn't let my children watch it, when everyone is swearing and grandpa uses words like "boner".  I don't go for fantasy stuff and I felt this film was a bit corny in that area. 
One very humorous thing was the clothes in this film. Sure,you can expect old folks to lack in taste somewhat, but everyone did!  It was hilarious...I mean were some of those outfits for real, or a joke??? Those plaid pants, those brightly colored leisure jackets with weird patterns...
I am a Christian and also did not like the fact that this film gives people a false picture of the reality of eternity for man. 
Was glad when this was over, but my 19 yr. old daughter was gladder. We put in a 1930's film right afterwards to help us forget the cinematic strangeness we had just witnessed. How nice to watch a good film where people can communicate effectively without any swearing!
