I sat through this film in a state of double disbelief -- inspired equally by the ludicrous contrivances of the plot and the rave reviews it has managed to garner.The chief witness in a murder investigation just happens to be the chief detective's partner in adultery.  She just happens to notice her next door neighbor throwing the victim's shoe under a bush. There is no logic to any of this. If the neighbor, for example, were getting rid of incriminating evidence, wouldn't he discard it more than a dozen steps from his own front door -- and in the dark, perhaps, instead of broad daylight? The entire plotline is full of similar holes, non sequitors piled on non sequitors, incredible behaviors upon even more incredible behaviors. Are we to believe, for example,that a man whose child was criminally murdered only two years before would refrain helping his wife when she phones him in terror after her car breaks down on a deserted road in the middle of the night? Even if, for whatever arcane reason, he feels unable to rescue her himself, would he not at least send the police? And what about her?  When she gets no response from her husband, why doesn't she phone the police herself?  Instead, she hails down a truck and rides off with a stranger. And whatever puts it into the psychiatrist's head that her husband is having an affair with her male client?  Only her own emotionally disturbed state. Yet the detective jumps to the same conclusion, for no reason. Dreadful, clumsy and amateurish writing and direction. A waste of fine acting talent.
