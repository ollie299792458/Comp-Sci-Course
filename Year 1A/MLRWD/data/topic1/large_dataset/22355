I simply couldn't believe what a hidden, under- hyped little gem of a film this was. I don't condone the behaviour of Mark "Chopper" Read, but Eric Bana's portrayal of him is possibly the funniest screen performance I have ever witnessed. There are two commentaries, one with the real man himself, and interview footage with him also as an extra on the disc. I just think that the glamourised (although I don't really think that's the appropriate word) depiction of him in this movie is unbelievably intriguing, entertaining and often downright baffling. When I bought the DVD, I watched both commentaries and all the extras straight after watching the film, and I usually don't even bother with extras on most discs. As other reviews on this site have said, it is Chopper's nonchalance to the brutally horrific acts he commits that is strangely, disturbingly, well, hillarious. I would even say it surpasses Samuel L. Jackson's role as Jools in Pulp Fiction as a simultaneously terrifying and comedic character.This man is sick in the head, but possibly the most likeable, amusing psycho you could ever hope to meet, well the celluloid incarnation at least.
