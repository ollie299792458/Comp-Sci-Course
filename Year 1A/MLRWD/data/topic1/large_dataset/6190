Chasing Amy is definetly Kevin Smith best movie of all time. Written after the horrible Mallrats experience, it is full of sensibility without losing Smith's trademark foul-mouthed but beautiful humor.
As a matter of fact, this has to be one of the better "romantic comedies"  of all time. WHy? Because it is not conventional. And as any one who has fallen in love knows. Love is not conventional!
So straying from the "sure win formula" of telling the story of how "boy likes girl, girl likes boy, boy dumps girl, girl comes back!", Smith exploits a very difficult relationship scenario to explore macho fear of "not fitting in on a woman's past," "the male bonding experience" and how it is affected by the "entry of the the female factor" and the bad juedgement one tends to make when you are blindly in love.
And all this is nicely laid out on top of wonderful pop-culture references and comic book allusions tha are the wet dream of any "fan-boy." 
This Criterion Collection DVD is the perfect dressing for such a great movie, as it includes all the scenes that were left out of the movie, a very funny comentary track wit the whole crew, and some more extras that you will enjoy!
IF you only will see one Kevin Smith movie, watch Chasing Amy. You would not be dissapointed!
