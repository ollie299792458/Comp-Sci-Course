I'm wondering why this movie does not get the recognition and press that Rebel Without a Cause and Giant get...because this film was, in my opinion, the most intense and most powerful of James Dean's short-lived career. Elia Kazan really had an eye for detail, expression, and composition and with an actor like James Dean, how can he go wrong? This movie is comical, at times shocking ( wait til you see the mother and the nurse), and bittersweet. Nothing is fair about the circumstances of the characters and a seemingly "certain" situation can change from day to day; this is what the audience finds relatable. Relying on what documentaries have informed us about Dean's own life, portraying a character who is constantly attempting to please his father must have brought Dean face to face with his own demons. Every emotion and fit of anger must have been right on the surface of his conscious mind--which he was able to utilize to his advantage and for our enjoyment. This movie is definitely one of the best!
