Where do you begin with such a classic in film-making? The movie speaks for itself, but what this Ultimate Collector's Edition offers in terms of extras makes this worth every penny you spend on it, regardless of how many times you've seen the film. Rarely is a "collector's edition" of a film that's 50+ years old packed with this many great bonus features. The original trailers are always nice to have, and the before and after comparison of the film's restoration is truly telling. The colorized version is wonderful, and our children were delighted with it. We also get a poignant look back in time with the lives and careers of Alastair Sim, Charles Dickens, and George Minter remembered by those who worked with them and knew them well. Not to mention the audio commentary that's a perfect bonus for those who love this film. Overall, you can't go wrong with this Ultimate Collector's Edition two disc set. My only question is why aren't there more truly enlightening stories like this told these days?
