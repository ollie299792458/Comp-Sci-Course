I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater and was thrilled when it was finally released on DVD.  It's a cute, screwball romantic comedy that actually gets funnier as it goes along - most comedies these days seem to lose their momentum as they head toward the conclusion.  Some good, funny performances and a happy ending make it worth a look.

My only complaint is with the DVD.  First, the movie is not widescreen.  This isn't a huge deal for this movie since it's character driven and the cinematography isn't the main draw.  Still if a widescreen print were available it would have been nice to use it.

The main problem I have is with the director/cast commentary.  I haven't even been able to get through it because the audio is not synched up with the movie.  The film soundtrack is fine when you watch the movie by itself, but during the commentary it's off by about 2 seconds.  Maybe this won't bother other people but I got a headache trying to watch and listen.  I wrote Strand Releasing who put out the DVD about the problem but never got a response.  I haven't seen this problem mentioned here so maybe I have a defective copy.  But be aware of the possiblity before you buy the DVD.

So, 5 stars for the movie but it loses one for DVD problems.  BTW, it looks like the DVD may be going out of print (Strand only lists the VHS as available on their website) so grab a copy while you can.
