This was one of those movies that I only grabbed from the thriller section cause I was sick of the typical slasher, paranormal type of movies. I did not expect much from this, but I got a lot more out of it them I thought I would.

So the plot goes: A psycho in his car a few years ago was running people down for fun. Then he got into an accident and is now mostly prothetic limbed. But he still gets his thrills out of running people down and murdering them.

This man runs down a woman, who has her own past demons with cars, and she ends up joining up with Rennie Cray, man whose wife was run down by the killer and he has been seeking his revenge since. Together they end up chasing this killer in his car down, avoiding the police and go on an action packed suspense ride to the Bates motel.

Overall, it isn't much on the plot side, its more a thrilling entertainment story, not gory or bloody or anything, but overall a decent movie.

It's a little bit of "Joyride/Roadkill" with "Hitcher" and some elements of a "Mad Max" road chase. If you enjoyed those movies, you may just like this one.
