Pleasantville is beautiful to watch and also a brilliant social commmentary. 
The Pat Robertsons of the world will tell you that control is how to stamp out "evil". Yet the prohibition didn't end the use of alcohol, and countless laws haven't stopped adultery. Forced conformity will only create a situation where free will is stifled, but it will not make them into "good" people. Only when human beings are allowed to explore and choose freely will they grow and mature. Not surprisingly, this film gets bad reviews from conservatives and fundamentalists who despise any choice besides the right to bear arms :)
Pleasantville shows that the idyllic world of 1950's tv (and the righ-wing) was just a fantasy, portraying a cleansed, edited version of reality: no minorities, misfits, poor or other unwanted. The residents of Pleasantville only become true human beings after being allowed some freedom from the limits of their pretend world. Of course this freedom cuts both ways, but that is what free will allows.
Great special effects, excellent performances by Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon and Jeff Daniels. Definitely one the the best films of the decade!
