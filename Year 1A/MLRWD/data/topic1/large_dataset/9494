After watching Kevin Smith's,"Chasing Amy," I have to admitt that I was pretty disgusted with film. Being only fifteen and a Christian pratically my whole life, some of the content in the movie made me not appreciate it that much. But being a Kevin Smith fan, I purchaced the screenplay "Clearks," whch also has the,"Chasing Amy," screenplay with it.  After reading "Clearks," I decided to read Chasing Amy anyways. And I ended up loving the story.  The story is about comic book creators Holden (Ben Aflec) and Banky ( Jason Lee), and how their friendship is begining to drift away when Holen becomes friends with,and eventually dates, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams).When Holden first meets Alyssa, its love at first sight. Alyssa though is a lesbian, and only wants to be friends with Holden at first. Then she realizes that Holden is the one she should be with. When life starts to get good with Holden and Alyssa, Banky finds out some dirt on Alyssa. The dirt Banky found out makes Holden evaluate his relationship. I am not going to say anymore about the plot from there, but trust me that this is a movie worth seeing. Look beyond what is going on and listen to what the movie truely says. The movie has its hilarious moments and its heartfelt ones too. I reccomend that you also watch "Clearks"and "Mallrats" before so you can understand the jokes better.Jay and Silent Bob return, but not so much more in this movie compared to their others.
