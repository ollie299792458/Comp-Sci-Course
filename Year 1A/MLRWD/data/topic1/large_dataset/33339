I don't claim be a movie expert, but this is the best film I have ever seen. I already owned a VHS copy, but on buying a DVD player I paid good money to have this disc shipped to me in England - and boy was it worth it!  The picture quality is as good as you will find anywhere and the sound is  superb too. The DVD is also jam-packed with extra features. The film's  commentary is provided by Frank Capra Jr. He has a wonderfully relaxed  style and doesn't just sound as if he's reading from a prepared script.  Along with Ron Howard's commentary for Apollo 13, this is the best DVD  commentary I have heard to date. A special feature unique amongst DVDs must  be the radio version of 'It Happened One Night', first broadcast in 1939,  again starring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. Whoever had the idea of  including this on the DVD deserves a salary rise. The disc also includes  trailers, cast lists, some beautifully illustrated posters and also a Frank  Capra Jr introduction. This really is an extremely impressive package of  Frank Capra's masterpiece.
