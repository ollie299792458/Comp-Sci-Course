This is an interesting movie at different levels.  This movie has an ensemble cast - many twists and turns, going into the "game world of virtual reality".  It has been compared and was released around the same time as Matrix, which also dealt with multiple levels of reality.  From the lower level of reality, it is a story of a group of people testing a new game.  The story moves from one level of reality to another, playing the game, and is based in part on the premise that there are game people who want to live 100% in virtual reality and those people who are angry that some people don't want to live in "this" world and create a fake or illusory world - contrary to what is best for the culture.

The higher level question is what is reality; and what do we create by the use of our minds to "create our world."  There is a line in the movie were Jude Law's character Ted is stating that the "game" world reality they were playing has no rules or structure and everyone is moving about looking for a purpose (or something to that effect).  Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, who is the game's creator Allegra, in the level of the game, says: how is this so different from other realities?

This movie and Matrix, in different ways, ask us, the observer, to question reality to see what we create with our Minds and that in turns brings to us that which we "see and believe" is true.  We create our own reality - all else is illusion.
