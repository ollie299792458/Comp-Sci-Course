Although unintentionally hilarious, one cannot help to revel in the madness of movie queen Joan Crawford's, out of control perfectionism. Though sloppily edited (it's obvious many scenes were omitted that effect the continuity of the film), it still is a highly entertaining study of one of the greatest actress's in Hollywood's, behind the scenes so-called "horror show," with her adopted children...Most notably her daughter Christina. Faye Dunaway is at her campiest best, showing us the many sides of a very abusive, yet very insecure("They say she's getting old." "Box office poison." "When You say Mommie dearest, I want you to mean it")complex woman. Dunaway steals just about every scene in this film, chewing at every ounce of the scenery she can muster. The infamous wire hangers moment, although admittedly humorous at times, has got to be the most chilling  thing since Linda Blair's head spinning in the 1973 film, the Exorcist. The kabuki make-up alone that Dunaway sports is horrifying in itself...Just over look the flaws, and sit back and enjoy this rollercoaster ride of a movie.
