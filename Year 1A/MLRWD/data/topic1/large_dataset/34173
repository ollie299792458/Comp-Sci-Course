I bought this movie at first, only because Joan Crawford looked beautiful in it. I didn't know the subject matter. I was STUNNED to find out it is a film that makes an Atheist proud!

It has GOT to be the earliest (and maybe the only, outside of some very recent documentaries) film exploiting the chronic hypocrisy of religious fanatics. It is extremely well done. Joan Crawford goes through all the motions of the usual "conversion":  Rebellion, resistance, softening-up, "repenting", then finally becoming brainwashed and dangeroulsy vulnerable.  I don't want to spoil the FANTASTIC ending for you--but let's just say you'll jump for joy!

I have NO idea why this film flopped back in 1932 other than the fact that it was allegedly a more "pure" time and film goers may have been stunned or too disturbed by it to like it. I would really like a Crawford fan to tell me why Joan accepted the role, was even loaned out for it. She was brilliant in it.

Anyway, I cherish this film. You might, too. This is a public domain film, so the quality is not great, but the content is so powerful, that matters very little.
