I never tire of watching this movie, as always Rupert Everett is perfect in the role as of course is Colin First. I just LOVE Judy Dench's Lady Bracknell she does it so very well and is totally believable in the character. Reese Witherspoon does a good interpretation of Cecily actually doing a reasonably good English accent.  My favourite part? this scene when the ladies meet for the first time...

Gwendolyn - I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were- well 42 a little older than you seem to be- and not quite so very alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly?
Cecily - Pray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.
Gwendolyn - Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.

Priceless!
