I remember reading about "Intruder" in various horror film magazines and horror film websites over the years --- reading about how Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Dan Hicks, and Bruce Campbell (the people involved with "Evil Dead 2") all having individual roles in the film --- reading about how all the pretty decent gore effects have been cut from the final version of the film --- never being able to find a copy of the film on VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray anywhere!!!

Well, all I have to say is "Thank God, for Synapse Films!" The brillant minds at Synapse have finally released a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of "Intruder" in a Director's Cut version with all the blood and mayhem beautifully restored back into the film! If you are a fan of 80's slasher cinema, then picking this up is a no-brainer!

The plot of "Intruder" is simple and to-the-point: A group of people working the late-shift at the Walnut Lake Supermarket in Michigan are slowly being killed off one-by-one in gruesome ways by a mysterious killer that has entered the store!

Seeing this movie for the first time ever, in the version of the way it was meant to be seen, and on Blu-Ray was a total blast! You can tell the cast and crew had to have had a good time making this flick and it totally shows! And as for the gore effects...they are AWESOME for a low-budget slasher flick like this!

This is a perfect film to watch when you have friends over for beer and pizza! And all I have to say about the ending is ---> "WOW! I loved it!"
