I actually cannot imagine this film being produced in anything but black-and-white.  It is a chilling Cold War story with an ultra-climactic ending that perhaps could not be predicted in its scope.  The other reviews have been quite complete and valuable in recounting the tale, while not quite revealing the ending.  Excellent!

In addition to its Cold War suspense genre, this is a powerful behavioral study, and Richard Widmark is at his best as a combination of a latter-day Captain Ahab and Captain Bligh in his continuing and ultimately disastrous effect on both individual and organizational behavior!  This film will have the viewer on edge throughout the story, and perhaps filled with an inexorable sense of dread, right up to the unpredictable and incredibly devastating climax.

The film ranks right up there with "Seven Days in May" and "Fail Safe," while being at least the equal of the former, and much better than the latter.  For the collectors of suspense dramas, your collections just might be incomplete without "The Bedford Incident."  As an aside, I would compare this film favorably with "The Oxbow Incident," an equally under-rated western film with a similarly sobering climax.
