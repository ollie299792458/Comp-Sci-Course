DBZ is absolutely amazing (in Japanese), if you're here reading this review you don't need me to tell you that. I bought Vol. 1-5 remastered... I can honestly say I won't buy any more of these sets. I really don't like the cropping or the supposed remastering. While the visual quality isn't necessarily HORRIBLE to the naked eye, it is nowhere near as pretty as it's supposed to be (as seen on the official Japanese DVDs). The Japanese audio is also improved on those releases, I really recommend buying some of those if you can afford it.  You will NOT be sorry.

One of the main reasons I love the Imperfect/Perfect Cell saga is because it glorifies a very strong Vegeta in all his stubbornly snooty insufferable greatness before he once again sets himself up to be torn down. [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER] The Final Flash is probably my favorite attack in the entire series, words can't describe the power behind it, it's cool-looking and scary. I've noticed that Vegeta has the best ki attacks of anyone when he thinks it's his last resort (the HUGE red-hot energy ball on Namek that Freeza deflected, the Final Flash, and Final Explosion.)  Vegeta/Trunks vs. Cell is the main focus of Perfect Cell saga, if you like any one of them you will be more than satisfied with this batch of episodes--if you don't mind the cropping, that is :/
