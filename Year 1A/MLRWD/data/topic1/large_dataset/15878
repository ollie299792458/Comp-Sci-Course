If nothing else, "Kwaidan" can at least be called imaginative. It was the most expensive Japanese film in existance when it premiered at Cannes and took away the Grand Jury's Prize in 1964 and Kobayashi's first color film.  He used this to his full advantage. There is no wasted frame, no color taken for granted here. This is an atmospheric dreamworld vision of a folk-tale Japan where night skies are a moody purple with bright gleaming stars or a classic black drear, snow sparkles beneath it in majestic rolls, and water is either dead-still or crashing epically on the rocks.  This is to legendary folklore Japan what Tim Burton is to small, misty towns surrounded by woods. The characters are conficting with spirits and souls of the dead as well as their own. Each story deals with a person who has become involved with ghosts in some way, shape, or form. Of course, this does have a kind of unrealistic beauty in coexistance with what is supposed to be horror, but the horror seems a bit dated and almost devoured by the beauty rather than enhanced.  Now I've never been taken in by cheap slasher movies, but this film makes me wonder if I have been spoiled somewhat by something, because while these stories are classic Japan, the endings often have the common predictable twists of American campfire stories. Don't count on a tie-up that'll make you jump or even wince. If anything, these stories might add an air of creepiness to the room. That's not really what makes this film memorable though. The Criterion Collection made an incredible transfer with not so incredible special features. Of course the picture is so beautifull you won't care and the film is too long to cram too much in so i'm not being critical.  Check it out though, you might like it.
