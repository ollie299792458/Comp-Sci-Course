What I found interesting about the fourth season was it's ability to contain the best of OZ and ultimately ended up showing that the show was on it's last legs.  I haven't seen season 6, but season 5 was decidely less good.  Season 4 starts off with a huge bang, and things just keep getting crazier.  Schillinger and Beecher are still warring, and some bizzare twists go on in a war that you honestly keep wondering if it could ever get more bizzare.

You are introduced to several new characters for season 4.  One that is introduced, but very few comment on, is Martin Quirns, the new manager of EM city.  (Briefly new manager.)  Quirns is a guy I just couldn't help but hate.  He was smug, corrupt, and belonged with the inmates, not managing them.  Interestingly enough, you almost can't help but root for O'Reily and Said as they attempt to take down Quirns in their own interesting plots.

The Latinos are taken over by Morales, who I think played the best leader of the latinos.  He was a businessman, but a very brutal and ruthless one.  The minute he entered OZ things started taking a turn for the decidedly worse.  unlike the others, Morales has a loyalty to one thing and one thing only; his power.

Season 4 is also host to one of the most shocking moments when one the most sadistic prisoner Simon Adebisi meets his end, and everyone is shocked by who the killer is.

Yet at the same time with all the drama, you begin to see the show cracking.  The expiremental drug episode was just a little too over the top, as was a man being buried behind a wall in the prison.  Unfortunately this stuff continues as you go further and further into the final two seasons of OZ, as they simply seemed to run out of material.
