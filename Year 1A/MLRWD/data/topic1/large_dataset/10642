This a great set to buy, own, and watch! I just bought the series for my fiancee' who used to watch it as a kid for her birthday, but we already cut into it started watching them at 2 in the morning! The box outer box design is great, the 3 inner-hard plastic boxes are sturdy and graphic! Each CD is also colorfully graphic and the graphics of the cartoons themselves look great!
This collection has clear sound and is an overall buyer! I'm not at all any kind of marketer for or against this series,simply one highly satisfied customer. I highly recommend it for those who love and appreciate the best of best cartoons available that are worth watching and collecting. This cartoon has a really intriguing plot and is really enjoyable for any audience. This whole review is coming from a 100% heterosexual man who loves to watch and collect only truly great and worthwhile entertainment.
The price I payed at Amazon is the best I found anywhere where this set is sold ($57.99, no tax, no shipping,and delivered right to your home!).No boot leg, no imperfections, no hassles, speedy delivery; just like an avid collector like myself and my fiancee' always hope for. Enjoy the show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
