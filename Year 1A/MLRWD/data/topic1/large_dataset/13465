This was a great movie, yet you don't get the same effect as you do reading the books. You don't get to know the characters well, and there aren't as many witty dialogs between the 3 characters in the movie. Yet, I think they still did a great job on it. It captures the second book good. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert do even a better acting job than the first film. They play their characters outstandingly real. I also think they did a great job on the new characters, like Lockhart, Colin, Lucius, and Ginny. I also think the special effects look great. Dobby, the mandrakes, the pixies, fawkes, and the basilisk look great. The 2nd DVD, which is special features, has hours of exciting features. There's 19 deleted scenes, interviews with all the cast members, and an interview with JK Rowling and the screenwriter, Steve Kloves. Plus, there's fun and exciting games to play. A much better and interesting special features disk than the first movie had! A great addition for your Harry Potter collection. I also highly recommend the Harry Potter books if you like the movies.
