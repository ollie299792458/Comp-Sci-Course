A lot of times the biggest challenge to getting people interested in Astronomical Science is that there's so much to learn and understand before it becomes entertaining that most people get either bored or overwhelmed with it before they even get started.  For example 'The Planets' was a fascinating show for me, but it bored my nephew and niece to tears, and though I spent a pretty penny on it, their parents shelved it because they never watch it.

'The Universe' by comparison is a lot less factual and dense, but there is a wealth of good general information and basic astrophysics concepts to be found in this series.  At the same time it's packed with dazzling CG graphics, cutting edge STI (space telescope images), and lots of bangs and explosions ('Life and Death of a Star' was by far my favorite episode).  If you're someone that doesn't understand the first thing about Astronomical Science or even if you enjoy it but just don't want to be bored out of your mind watching a bunch of eccentric scientists hypothesizing about concepts you don't quite fully understand, this is the series for you!
