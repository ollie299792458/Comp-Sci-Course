I just viewed this and initially found it very engaging, but after a few minutes, something seemed amiss. It has the feel of a rationally-based and honest science documentary, but anyone with a science background will realize they are twisting and obfuscating the facts. Ultimately, especially if you view the DVD extras and do your homework, it's obvious this is a propaganda tool made by christians, and it's in lockstep w/ so-called intelligent design (also debunked).  This would be a great poetic or philosophical romp, but because it's really portrayed as hard science, it in the end becomes misleading.

Oddly, there is no mention of the well-known Anthropic Principle, which is all this DVD is. Oddly, no counter-theories are presented, such as the background of multiple universes implied by string and other theories.  No mention of Hawking's direct counter-arguments to anthropic principle. The facts are cherry picked using confirmation bias. There's a nagging tendency to compare Earth to other planets in our solar system, rather than to all planets in the universe (major math error there).

The authors are "surprised" that conditions on earth seem so rare. Certainly a lottery winner is likewise initially surprised, but a lottery winner would recognize that the rules of statistics were not violated by him/her winning.  As Hawkings suggests, if earth wasn't in such a nice place, we simply wouldn't be here to wonder why we're here... someone else far away would be doing it.

If you love programs like What the Bleep, in which a psychic who claims to channel "Ramtha" lectures us (incorrectly) on Quantum Physics, and use out-of-context quotes of real physcists to bolster her view, you may like this one too.  I found it tiresome and misleading.
