Trying to choose a favorite episode in the most sophisticated detective spoof of all time is like trying to choose your favorite child! It's almost impossible for there's always something special about each one that tugs at your heart! So it is with The Thin Man Goes Home...as equally charming on it's own merit as all the others in this series. It's quite a slower pace than we're accustomed to, but then Nick and Nora do manage to get involved in a murder even when going back home to visit Nick's parents. Thankfully the plot involved here is at least understandable, while I was never able to follow Nick's reasoning in solving his other storylines! It's a great tribute to the charismatic personalities of William Powell and Mryna Loy that they continually hypnotized the audience into overlooking the screwy plots written for them. My only criticism is that Nick openly spanks Nora in front of his parents! It seemed a bit chauvinistic of Nick's character to exhibit such behavior and unlike Nora's strong independent nature to allow him to humiliate her in that respect. None the less, this flick is an important piece of classic movie history, and should be appreciated for the magnificient acting talents of it's two stars!
