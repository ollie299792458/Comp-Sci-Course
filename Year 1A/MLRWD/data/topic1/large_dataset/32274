Seeing as how there are 260 other reviews (as of this writing) ahead of this one, I would guess that just about every thing that could be said about this terrific movie HAS been said.  Rather than bore the reader, let me just suffice to say that the viewer of "Forbidden Planet" is truly in for a treat.  The unusual tonal sound quality, great matte painting, wonderful (for the time) special effects, introduction of Robbie the Robot, and a great cast including Leslie Neilsen (as a serious actor) Walter Pidgeon, beautiful Anne Francis, Warren Stevens, and Earl Holliman make this a great film for all science fiction fans.

In this humble reviewer's opinion, "Forbidden Planet" ranks with the great of this era which included, "The Day the Earth Stood Still", The Invasion of the Body Snatchers", "The Incredible Shrinking Man", "Them", "The Thing", and "War of the Worlds".  If you are a collector of the science fiction films of this era, then "Forbidden Planet" MUST find a place on your shelf.

The transfer of the film to DVD is very solid.  The 5.1 surround sound is terrific and the extras (including the film, "The Invisible Boy") that are  part of this 50th Anniversary Special Edition make for a great value.  ENJOY!
