Kurt Russell exceeded himself in this film. He ran the gamet of emotions with intense believability as an actor. The first time I saw Breakdown was a few years after it had been released which made me think, "how did I miss this one?" The genuine feelings of loss and  true desperation conveyed for his wife is spot on.

  A husband and his wife traveling down an empty highway into the unknown evils of his "fellow man" is the crux of the film. Interestingly, Breakdown never early on needs to "prove" how much love the couple have for one other. That one element, love, becomes immediately apparent when his wife vanishes. It socks you in the gut, and that look is all over Russell's face as he makes his first cursory search in a dusty roadside bar.

  There are only about six or seven charactors of substance in Breakdown and that is not a detractor. The thwarters of Russell's plight are played with such mean son of a bitc*ery that you want to reach out and ring their necks yourself. The plot is not filled with major complexity which adds to it's astounding depth and simplicity. Great well thought out action scenes drag you through the rural landscape. I really believe the film has never received the proper recognition it deserves. While watching the movie, your envolved!  A display of raw humanity is upheld by the players on every level.

  There is nothing missing from Kurt Russell's acting in Breakdown that makes it anything short of Acadamy Award material. Definetely capable of repeated viewings. This is a perfect film for blu ray (which as of this writting has not been released) and all kinds of extras. Pull the gear shift!!!
