Sergeant Nathan Harris's unit, Echo Company, is deployed behind enemy lines to secure the area.  Danfung Dennis, a very skilled photojournalist, captures the essence of this deployment.

Brown sand, brown dust, brown clothing, nothing but dry barren brown.  Add to that the people of Afghanistan whose village is being secured who do nothing but complain about Echo Company's attempt to help them and you have a bleak depressing understanding of what our soldiers are experiencing.  At every turn the Afghan people seek to hinder the soldiers:

"Where did that man carrying a bag of explosives just now go?"  "I did not see."

"Where did those three men who were armed just now head?"  "I did not see."

The soldiers apologize for any damage done to the Afghan homes and crops and promise to make it right.  Even that is met with simply, "Leave."

And then Sergeant Harris is suddenly back home to the screaming lights of WalMart, Walgreens, the hospital.

This is his story, the story of being in the midst of constant danger, camaraderie and respect from his men to get a job done; then severely wounded he is instantly just a young man in rehab trying to walk, trying to deal with pain, trying to get back to everyday American life.  It is very tough.

Ashley, his wife, is a brave woman; day in and day out caring for Nathan, helping dress him, driving him to his medical appointments, being his mental support.  It is a rough job.

This movie gives you the reality of the fact that regular people end up fighting this war in Afghanistan for a people who are not thankful.  It made me think we should just bring our men home and save them from this hell.  It is a thankless job and they deserve our respect.

(though not rated, this film has two scenes that are gruesome, the death of one of our men and the mutilated body of an Afghan man.)
