At age 14, I'm not one for Barbie. Even as a child, I remember often tearing heads and limbs from my beloved dolls, as well as cutting hair. When I was seven and this movie came out though, I was obsessed. I had the songs memorized and would often belt them out at the top of my lungs along with the accompanying CD. Of course, seven years later, I did not expect to be impressed as I watched it with my little sister. But I was pleasantly surprised with the intriguing storyline, well-developed characters, and the hilariously exaggerated villain (portrayed brilliantly by comic actor Martin Short). I even find myself occasionally watching it on my own laptop (with headphones of course, God forbid someone hear the movie). My sister and I may laugh at some of the Barbie-fied lines of dialogue, but I have to admit that this movie is a treasure, especially when compared to later Barbie movies, with ridiculously recycled names and teeny-bopper songs.
I must say that the songs are the best part of this movie though. Not only does Short supply us with a funny, over-the top villain song, but the Annalise/Erica duets are top-notch, rivaling Disney productions of the '90's. Not only are they catchy, clever, and plot-moving, but the singing voices are impressive, hitting notes like the true Broadway singers that they are (Melissa Lyons as Eponine in Les Mis, Julie Stevens in Annie).
I guarantee that though you may laugh at this seemingly ridiculous movie, you any your little girl will be captivated.
Additionally, I've decided that Barbie should hit the Broadway stage in a true musical adaption of this movie. Seriously, if no one knew this started as a Barbie film, it would make millions.
