This Japanese psycho-thriller made in 1998 was the breakout film for its director, Takeshi Miike, known far and wide for his avant garde style of film making and his creative use of gore and plain weirdness.  The film is about an aging widower named Aoyama, who seeks to remarry again.  His friend who is a producer suggests that they hold a mock audition to find him a new wife.  During the audition, Aoyama discovers a quiet and beautiful girl named Masami, whom he soon starts a relationship with.  At this point you may think "If a film was made in the United States using this premise, It would be a romantic-comedy starring Richard Gere or Hugh Grant!".  However, that's when the film spirals into one of the scariest and most gruesome films I have ever seen as it is soon found out that Masami has a hidden side caused by years of abuse.  If you liked films like Perfect Blue, then this film is your cup of tea.  It should be noted that when this film was first screened to international audiences at film festivals, nearly half of the audience either walked out or fainted.  A truly intense thriller to be watched at your own risk.
