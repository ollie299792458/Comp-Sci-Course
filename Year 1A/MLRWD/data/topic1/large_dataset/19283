This movie did have beautiful scenes and backdrops. It was, however, very confusing for the first half hour, and some things I still didn't understand at the end. It would help if the audience had some prior knowledge of the painting on which the movie was based, and the time period of the artist's life.
I had an issue with the full frontal nudity in the beginning of the film, plus several unnecessary sexual scenes. I felt that it was irreverent and in poor taste. Of course, if there had been a rating for the film I might have known what to expect, but it did not and I was required to see the film for a class.
The movie attempts to demystify the painting of Pieter Bruegel, "The Procession to Calvary", which is a comparison of the crucifixion of Christ to the Spanish occupation of Flanders in the 16th century. A sensitive topic without question, and one that deserves to be
handled without the coarseness and vulgarity so typical of today. Although, I must say it seems that they did their best to keep the violence to a minimum. A crucifixion would have been far more graphic than the one shown in the film.
The film does have good reviews, and if it hadn't been for the offensive scenes, I would have given this movie a much higher rating.
