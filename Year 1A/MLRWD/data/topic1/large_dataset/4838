Frailty is the first movie that I've seen since Seven that I've left the movie theatre with a deeply affected air.  This movie is not a traditional screamer that freaks you out.  It is more in the vein of a Poe short story or even one of King's darkest novels.  It follows the story of Finton Meeks a man who apparently knows who the hand of god killer is and wants to tell a Sheriff at the F.B.I. headquarters in Dallas, Texas.  As he unfolds his story it becomes more apparent that he is telling the truth but also that he is hiding something.  The ending is absolutely brilliant.  This movie is so good that it will actually blur the lines between good and evil and what is real and unreal.  All the actors gave great performances especially the boy who played Finton Meeks as a young person.  Also Bill Paxton did an excellent job with directing the film.  This is a classic horror movie that is on the same level as "The Shining" and "Pet Semetary."  This movie is not recommended to those who can not stand disturbing movies with Religious themes.  But it's a great horror film that is reccommended to all other adults.
