I was at a party crowded with Americans who had spent time studying abroad, and somehow this movie's title came up, and everyone at the party nodded with a delighted "Ahh yes..." kind of knowing grin, because we all knew without having to articulate it that this film captures 95% of what living and studying in a foreign country is all about.

 Other people have described the plot and characters a bit, so I won't be redundant. I will add, though, that if you're in college or headed to college and you're thinking about studying in a foreign country, SEE THIS FILM! You will most assuredly hit the same highs and lows, and you'll end up having just as much fun and just as many headaches.

 This movie combines the humor of "Breaking Away" with the cleverness of "Lost in Translation" and has a good-vibe quotient right up there with "Finding Nemo" or "Chariots of Fire." As a brilliant reviewer below wrote: "This is not your father's foreign film." It's easy to follow and easy to understand. And it packs a nice little (non-preachy) cultural message or two.

 Tragic warning: the amazing Audrey Tautou is only on-screen for about 10 or 15 minutes.
