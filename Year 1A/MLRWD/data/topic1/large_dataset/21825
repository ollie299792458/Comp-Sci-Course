I first saw this movie when I was about six and have loved it ever since.  Beatty took this tough project and turned it into a dazzeling and fun film.  Lets face it, comic book films are not easy to make.  Batman, Batman Returns, and this are the only three that I really love and admire.  All the other Comic Book films failed one way or another.  The performances in Dick Tracy are all first rate.  Beatty is very good as the no-nonsense detective and Madonna is nothing short of amazing as Breathless Mahoney.  Madonna took a role that could have easily been made into a cheap sleaze but instead molded Breathless into a deep, interesting character.  Al Pacino is also wonderful as Big Boy Caprice.  This is one of his best performances in a spectacular body of work.  There is one other performance in this movie that is often overlooked which is that of Glenne Headly, who plays Tess in a way that not only shows vulnerability, but care and compassion as well.  The set direction is wonderful and the storyline is quite good.  Warren Beatty, congradulations for creating a movie that truly a joy.  This film can not be missed.  Rent it, buy it, love it!
