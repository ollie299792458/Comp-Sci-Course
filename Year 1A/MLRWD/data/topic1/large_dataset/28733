I am most surprised by what some stupid people will write, about a wonderful story. IF it is a true story, I have no idea, but I do remember what it was like being 15 1/2 and being confused by what my body was telling me, and Jane March, did a super job in this movie. "Soft porn"? Well, okay, it has some sex in it, but the story line is so good. It's about a poor trash white girl, who falls in love with a older rich "Chinese" man. She doesn't even realize she is in love, yet she is at the end, yet she STILL can't admit it to her self. He is a rich "Chinese man" who tells her in the beginning that he doesn't want to do this, because he could fall in love with her. Forbidden love is always the best love. Yet, this love is ever lasting. The scenery is beautiful. Awesome photography, beautiful flowing music. At first, I wasn't too sure of this movie, but as I got lost in the story, I was so sorry it ended the way it did. It had no other way of ending! Chinese men with white women, was only for men with whores. White women, with Chinese men, was only for the money. How CAN a movie such as this, end any other way? Even in France, racial mixes such as this weren't allowed. There was no were for this couple to go. She (the girl) couldn't tell even her family the truth, and while he (the Chinese man) tried to tell his Father, he HAD to marry of Chinese decent. What a sad love story. It's so sad, that more people couldn't see that in the USA. Simply a SUPER movie.
