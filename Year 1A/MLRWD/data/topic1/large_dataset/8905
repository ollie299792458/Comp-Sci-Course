I'm giving this five stars because it is simply an awesome document of rock 'n' roll's greatest live performer backed by the world's most kick-ass bar band.  The sound and picture of this DVD is almost shocking in its quality.  You'll think that you're looking at an aquarium with the E Street Band playing within instead of a television screen.  However, despite the five star ranking I can't help but remain a little disappointed.  This could have been THE live musical document in DVD history.  Why the Springsteen camp elected to put the HBO special on one disc and then throw a bunch of extra songs on a second is a mystery.  I was at MSG that last night and it was magical.  Anyone watching this will feel its pulse, but what would have put it over the top would have been to sequence this in its proper order with all songs included (except "Code of Silence" and "Further On Up the Road" which are new songs probably withheld for a new album).  The second disc then could have been used for songs played on the penultimate evening ("The Ties That Bind", "Don't Look Back", "Jungleland", "The Ghost of Tom Joad", "Back In Your Arms"), additional interview footage with more screen time for the band - these seem to be fascinating people especially Steve Van Zandt.  Subsequently we could then see and hear the deafening crowd chant of "E STREET BAND / E STREET BAND" and the entire song that led up to Bruce almost breaking down in tears as he sang the last lines of "Blood Brothers".  Despite these faults this is certainly a must-have for any Springsteen fan, hell any fan of rock and roll.  For those of you with Britney / Creed / Matchbox 20 / etc., fans in your home, please pop this in and give them a rock and roll education.  They'll probably thank you for it.
