I've been a military history geek all my life.  In addition to being a founding member of the U.S. Civil War Center at LSU, I've had bit parts in several Civil War films and been an adviser on others and helped prop departments before.  I've also done reenacting for decades as a hobby.  Having said all that, this movie is okay, but it attempts to do too much in too little time - and it suffers from that.

Gettysburg was a superb movie and gave that epic event in our history the time it deserves.  Gods and Generals attempts to cram two years of war into the same time it took to give a decent impression of just one battle.  This is more of an attempted biography of Stonewall Jackson than anything else, and it loses its focus on that attempting to jump around from subject to subject.  There are numerous historical errors, particularly in regards to Robert E. Lee's early days as a Confederate commander.

It's not a bad movie, but it's not great, and it had the potential to be great.  The battle scenes are great, but the story just doesn't seem focused.
