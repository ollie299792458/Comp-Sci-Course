I was really psyched when I heard about Clerks 2, because the original had a mix of clever, crude and cute humor, not to mention tons of interesting dialogue content(from crude to intellectual humor).The second clerks misses the mark set by the first installment. There is total lack of intellectual or cute humor and unique and diverse dialogue. The humor this time around is all based upon crudeness. The same crude phrases and jokes are annoyingly repeated over and over again, like beating a dead horse. Even the customers this time around are quite lackluster. The movie actually has a plot, but its rather bland and cliche. I miss the randomness of the first movie(which had a setup similar to most Seinfield episodes) and how it was split into different days and different scenes, almost as if it were comprised of little skits. Kevin Smith took away all the amazing things that made the original Clerks great when he made Clerks 2, and came up short trying to create a decent plot with interesting dialogue.
