To tell you about what happened next in Back to the Future II...
Sooner or later back at Biff's hotel he's watching a movie with two lady's in his jacuzi, while Marty has the remote and turns off the TV. He ask's him about the Sports Almanac. He said he got it on November 12, 1955. That was the day that the doc sent him back to the future! [As seen in Back to the Future part I]. Then Biff picks up his gun thinking that he's trying to steel the book as Marty steels matches. He then runs while Biff is shoting at him. He goes out the door and here's the elevator ring and Biff's bodyguards come out of the elevator and starts chasing Marty. Marty goes through a door and goes down a few steps then he jumps over to another set of steps to hide as he runs up to the top. Biff's bodyguards come through the door going all the way  downstairs as Marty jumps over and goes up to the roof to try to escape. Then Biff comes through the door and see's the door to the roof just closing. Then back where Marty  is on top of the roof he looks down there was no latter to escape at all. Then Biff comes in. And tells Marty that he killed his father. Marty then jumps off! Then Biff see's him standing on the time michene with the Doc driving! The Doc opens the door. Biff gets slapped by it and Marty gets in the car. He then tells the Doc that they had to get back to 1955!!!!... Again you can read my 2nd review on Back to the Future part II and write to me and I'll tell you what happens next.
