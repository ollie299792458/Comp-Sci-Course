Don't be mislead! Change isn't necessarily a bad thing! In this season Vince reveals a darker side that we've seen in all the previous seasons, but the difference in S7 is the depth that we explore this aspect of his personality. Turtle becomes more successful in his ambitious side, that came around toward the end of season 5 (when he first thought of taking over the Limo business), and E's temper plays a more active role again as he tries to protect his best friend (since the show is based on themes of friendship, it's only natural he becomes more aggressive in response to Vince's downward spiral).  While many weren't thrilled with the darker aspects of the season, I found them to be right on the money. After all, the show tries to take place in real time, with the time spent off-season being accounted for, and after 7 years of Vince's super-stardom it's only natural the guys become more settled into the town and the lifestyle, which brings about drama over time. After all, we can't expect to watch 7 full seasons of Vince getting laid. I don't see the depth in this season as changing personalities, but rather enhancing them, and the character development was not far fetched from what has been building over the past few seasons. Additionally, since there is only a short season remaining of the series, it's natural it starts to boil down to some sort of change. Overall, this series is solid, and packs new excitement and depth without getting rid of its core values. Definitely worth a watch!
