the haunted palace alone makes this totally worth the purchase!!i like tower of london also,but haunted palace is the best of the two.the haunted palace is actually a very entertaining adaptation of an h.p. lovecraft story  which i believe is titled the [case of charles dexter ward.]the story line as the movie begins is set in the 16 or 1700,s,it seems joseph kirwin played by vincent price is a warlock using strange rituals from the necronomicon and a strange being in a pit in his dungeon under his warlock,s altar to mate with the town,s sexiest women!the towns people notice the strange unholy events and know joseph kirwin is behind them,so they form a mob and go to his strange castle and decide to burn him at the stake or a tree as the case maybe as a witch!before the burning commences joseph kirwin utters an eternal curse upon the town,s inhabitants and all their descsendants!!so 150 years later kirwan,s relative;charles dexter ward[also played by vincent price]and his wife played by the beautiful[Debra paget] inherits the strange castle..however with the inheritance of the castle is the vengeful spirit of joseph kirwin who comes to posses charles dexter ward to seek vengeance on the descendants of those who burned him and to continue the rituals in the necronomicon!!the gothic sets and decor of this great movie in my opinion are awesome!this movie is great for halloween or any time you want gothic drama done roger corman style!!!
