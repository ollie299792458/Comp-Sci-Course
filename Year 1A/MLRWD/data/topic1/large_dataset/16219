I have this movie on a VHS format and will be upgrading to a DVD at some point in the future.  Yes, the movie has been dramatized by Hollywood in an attempt to keep the non-chess players in the audience interested.  Being a tournament player myself I can tell you that the last moves in the film between Josh and Jonathan were rushed, like speed chess, and, unless they both were in a time crunch they would never have moved that fast. Slow and methodical wins the day.  Lawerence Fishburn's character was a composite of at least two other influences in Young Josh's life.  Props to Ben Kingsley's acting as the American chess master, Bruce Pandolfini.  However, the real pandolfini is also an advocate of speed chess and probably, also a lover of a variant of that game called "Bug House."  The real Bruce P. does show up in a small cameo in the film as the young, mustached spectator watching young Jonathan playing the former Russian Grandmaster in the park.  His line to both Kingsley and "young Josh" is "Another Bobby Fisher."  All this aside, the feeling of what it's like to play in an actual tournament is shown very well.  Joe Mantagna's acting as the senior Waitzkin is very well done; my favorite bit with him was when he took on Josh's public School teacher over "this Chess thing."  If you play serious chess then this movie is a great choice.
