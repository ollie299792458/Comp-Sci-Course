As mentioned in other movie reviews, I absolutely love horror movies!!!  Unfortunately, there is a ton of crap coming out these days.  I have found that you must kiss a lot of frogs to find a hidden gem.  Fortunately, this movie is a gem!  It does not seem low budget, the cinematography is incredible (amazing landscapes with the mountains and snow) and the zombies look great!  The gore is perfect and they do not go over the top with CGI.  One of my biggest complaints is when they beat the CGI horse to death and you feel like you are watching a video game or something fake (last 3 Star Wars movies are a perfect example of how CGI can help ruin a movie).  The acting is very good for a horror movie and the story itself keeps your interest.  This is not just a horror movie.  It is more of a horror with comedy mixed in.  Similar to the Evil Dead.
So we have:
Good plot - Check
Excellent cinematography - Check
Relatively unknown movie - Check
Well done special effects - Check
Gore - Check
Well done Zombies - Check
Respectable acting - Check
Babes - Check
Scary/Funny - Check
Good ending - Check
The only complaint that I have is the subtitles, but that is no reason not to watch a movie.  You can always watch the dubbed version.  The last 30 minutes is CLASSIC and gets an A++++ from me!!!
If you are looking for a fun movie, I recommend this for sure!  It has become one of my favorites!!!  Please check it out and let me know what you think!
