Yes, this slacker fan classic is just as good today as it was in 1998. And this version is loaded with a good number of extras.

Now, I see super-fans are disappointed. It's true, if you own a earlier DVD version, this edition, even with it's extra disc doesn't add anything super-special. And, this version is hardly definitive, super-fans will want more, no doubt.

But for the casual fan, the person who doesn't already own a copy and just wants to watch this fabulous film, along with enough extras to make a casual fan happy- here ya go.

Now, I am writing this review assuming you have seen the film. If you have not, this film is almost impossible to describe. It's a slacker-comedy, with a mystery and some by-notes on the meaning of life. Satire is there, but nicely understated. You can watch this film on several levels, but I suggest just cracking a cold one and watching it for the fun of it.

But although "The Dude" (played by Jeff Bridges at his best) is foul-mouthed, this is not a gross out doper movie like many which followed. There's also a fab supporting cast, and solid locations.

A solid strike of a film.
