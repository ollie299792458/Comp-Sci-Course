I just watched Fiddler on the Roof for the first time.  I watched it on the suggestion of a friend, a man who was born in Poland during the interwar period into a very religious, observant Jewish family.  His descriptions of his close-knit, loving family and its values, steeped in rich tradition, is something I find both enchanting and heartbreaking.  Knowing that a beautiful way of life was destroyed, starting with World War I and crushed during the Holocaust, makes me want to learn as much as I can about it before everyone who experienced it firsthand is gone.  When I told him that I wanted to know what life was like in the Shtetl, he told me to watch Fiddler on the Roof.

I am not a lover of musicals in general, but this one captured my heart; I was enchanted and wrapped in the colorful and warm world of Tevye's family from beginning to end.  I loved seeing the world of the Shtetl, which I have read a lot about, come to life.  Being a musical, I'm sure it's not completely accurate, but many of the scenes were familiar to me from my reading.  To me, the story is about the pain, inevitability, and hope that goes along with change.  It's the beginning of the end of Tevye's idea of family; his five little girls who strain against the confines of tradition as they grow up and fall in love with men who aren't chosen by their parents.  It's the beginning of the end for his community, as the world is quickly modernizing and the ever-present anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe intensifies.  It's the beginning of the end for his very way of life.

The music was absolutely wonderful.  I especially liked "Tradition," which makes me smile whenenver I think about it, and the lovely "Sunrise/Sunset," so sweet and hopeful.  It's a love story, and a history lesson, a plea for tolerance and a bittersweet glimpse of a beautiful way of life, all wrapped up in a magical, colorful, richly rendered and beautifully performed musical.
