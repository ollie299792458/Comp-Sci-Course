First of all, this film takes place in pre WW II history, perfectly setting up a more lush and exotic (Nazi-free) environ for the story to unfold. What really makes this movie a good time though, and a feast for movie fans, is it's countless references and homages to everything from Star Wars to The Thief Of Bagdad. But it's not just the in the references... the whole tone and feel is closer to a 70's Italian horror film in lusty embrace with a B serial from the 40's.  Instead of retreading the first one Spielberg and Lucas amped up the colors, matte paintings, grizzly effects and freaky  scares to create a delerious explosion of pulp vivacity. Raiders was the intro (so pretty tasteful in it's style), Last Crusade is a more family friendly and vanilla concoction, probably hastened by some family's outraged cries after seeing Temple. But boldened by the success of the first one -- Temple of Doom is the chapter that was made for FILM FANS and FILMMAKERS. It's crazy, gross, scary, politically incorrect, but above all -- a blast to watch.
