This movie offers a relatively true rendering of the Shakespearean classic "Much Ado about Nothing" and boasts a robust and generally speaking talented cast able, ultimately, to fill each of their respective roles.  Michael Keaton offers particular sparkle while proving his vein for comic turns once again; Robert Sean Leonard as Claudio and Kate Beckinsale as Hero contour their roles with that grace which looks so comely on Shakespeare's young-lover characters.

However, one Achilles heel that invariably gets impedes one's being able to accept and get lost in this Elizabethan romantic comedy is Keanu Reeves' impenetrable and very northwestern accent which hinders him from credibly embodying the resentful envy of Don John.  Beautiful as he irrefutably looks in this part, the second he opens his mouth, we are - as we so often are with Reeves' period films -  transported back to the 20th century and reminded of plasticene accents in high-school productions of yore.

Still, that shouldn't deter you from having a gander at the talent collected for this piece.
