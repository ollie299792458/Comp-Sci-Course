I've always loved both the book CHARLOTTE'S WEB and the original version of the movie. My son, who is ten, convinced me that we needed to get this live-action version, as well, and I'm so glad I did.

Dakota Fanning, as Fern, is adorable. Wilbur is a perfect mix of naivete and wanting to make the world a better place. Templeton the rat displays just the right amount of endearing obnoxiousness. The two corn-crazy crows are hilarious. But, for me, what made this film worthwhile was Julia Roberts as the voice of Charlotte.

There was something about her soothing, maternal voice that made this film so wonderful. Towards the end, when Charlotte is "languishing," both myself and my children were teary-eyed -- not just out of sadness for Charlotte's demise, but due to the fact that the world, after experiencing some of Charlotte's special brand of love, seemed just a little more radiant.

This is the perfect family film, one that I will happily watch over and over again -- alongside my children.
