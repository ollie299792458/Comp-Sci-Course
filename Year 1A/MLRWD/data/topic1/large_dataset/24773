We purchased this original 1947 movie of Miracle on 34th Street because I had lost the copy I taped years ago. We also have the 1994 re-make of this movie which my wife had never seen. We watched the newer version first then waited one day and watched the 1947 original. Now don't get me wrong, the newer movie is not without merit and is truly a quality film also. Even the fact that the original is in black & white makes no difference whatsoever. It is truly the superior film. The details and differences in the storyline, the acting and the magic are simply just more endearing. The original is just plain better and will never be improved upon. This is usually true for most all re-makes; not all of course but most. One example of a re-make that is at least just as good as the original is the Marlo Thomas 1977 version of the Jimmy Stewart classic "It's a Wonderful Life". Marlo's version is titled "It Happened One Christmas". Marlo plays the Jimmy Stewart character and is "Mary" Bailey this time. Great film; as good [or better?]. You'll have to decide for yourself.
