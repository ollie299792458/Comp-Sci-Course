You have Julia Roberts here as a photographer.  Enter Jude Law (who is involved with Natalie Portman's character)who as he's being photographed and conversating with her forms an intense crush on her and is determined to have her.  His girlfriend (Portman) comes in, senses something is amiss, but cannot do anything about it.  Movie skips ahead (not confusingly) and we find a lot more about each of these characters, including Julia Roberts being together with Clive Owen.  That doesn't stop her from indulging in a relationship with Jude Law the whole time.  The two of them are no match for the ruthless and I mean ruthless vengence Clive Owen takes on them all.  Some of the vengence involves him seeking out Portman and the two of them had the sort of coldness in their personalities that made it work.  Strangely, I didn't feel sorry for any of these people at the end, personally I found each of them (even Roberts) to be resigned to their choices.  Incredibly selfish , beautiful people who screw with each others minds and rationalize it to fit their purposes.
