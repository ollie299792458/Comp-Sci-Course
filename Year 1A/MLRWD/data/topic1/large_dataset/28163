It's a pity that Hollywood cannot produce films that rival foreign movies of the genre of Run Lola Run. It's powerful soundtrack, the brilliant photography, witty direction and above all, fine pieces of acting, combines  together to deliver a masterpiece.
Run Lola Run is about the uncertainty  in how things 'could have been' had 'this' happened. Upon viewing, one is  immediately led to place themselves in the shoes of Lola , don't be  surprised if you find yourself screaming - ohh, I wish I had read the  newspaper earlier in the morning, I wouldn't have missed out on the deal  they had down at the Mall,... or conversely, romantically recollecting - If  I hadn't missed the bus the day I met Jerry we would have never been such  good friends,... - everything that we do, our actions, even the subtlemost  of events changes every following event - that is the main theme. The  director does a brilliant work of explaining how every action shapes the  future in a cleverly crafted movie with a very apt soundtrack. This is one  movie you won't forget too soon, if you want to see a title with productive  context, yet not drab as a documentary, or fast-paced and context-less as  most Hollywood Action productions, watch this. It never drags even for a  moment, provides the viewer with food for thought, while at the same time  produce a brilliant work of visualizaion and above all, a novel and  absorbing unpredictable storyline.
