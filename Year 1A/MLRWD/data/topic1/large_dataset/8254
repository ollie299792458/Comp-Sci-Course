This movie has it all, on paper at least.  A great premise, a talented cast, great shots plus all the intrigue and mystery of a great film.  To me where it falls short is the script.

To me the dialog is trying to be WAY smarter than it is.  Which to me is the most frustrating about this movie.  This might be how Shakespeare would write dialog if he was a modern day 17 year old douchebag.  The dialog just confuses an already complex mystery of who is allied with who and what each character's true motives are.  I see a review that says the dialog is "hard-boiled lingo that's both comic and poetic", no it is just contrived and boring.

While the some of the actors really suprised me with their great performances. The characters in this film don't ever get the depth and backstory each deserves and for this I think the movie suffers.  To me the thin characters make me think this was maybe written by someone in high school.

Beyond all the faults, I still was interested until the end.  Once I suspended belief in the plot & characters I got past the dialog I still was watching and was glad I saw it.

I think it is worth a view, maybe on rental 1st, because it is not for everyone.
