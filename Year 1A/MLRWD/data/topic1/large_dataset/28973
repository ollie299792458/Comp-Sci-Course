Giving this 4 stars because while the DVD would get 5, the fact that MGM misleads consumers several times makes it drop a star.

There are 5 DVD versions of Thelma and Louise:

1. Orion edition - the first release of the film, it was in a snapper case by Orion Pictures.  It's been Out of Print for quite some time.

2. MGM first edition - essentially the Orion disc, but in the first MGM case (with the blue sky background and the snapshot of T&L)

3. MGM Special Edition (with slipcover) - a flipper disc with the special features, the slipcover is different from the regular cover art.

4. MGM Special Edition (without slipcover) - same as #3, sans slipcover.  It's still a flipper disc.

5. MGM standard edition - Essentially the first MGM edition, except with the new transfer used on the special edition, and it's not a flipper (so you don't get the documentaries, trailers, music video, or storyboards).  The coverart is exactly like the MGM special edition (without slipcover), though there is no "Special Edition" banner.

MGM's DVD factories or wherever they make their DVDs sometimes mess up and put the Special Edition cover art in cases with the standard edition.

To always make sure you get the actual special edition, make sure it comes with the cardboard slipcover.  Because 9 times out of 10, if you pick up one that says Special Edition and it's a single-sided disc, you got the standard edition with the wrong cover art.

I got burned at Sears when I purchased Thelma and Louise: Special Edition, and discovered to my horror it was the standard edition.  I had to go to Sam Goody and find the slipcovered-special edition and buy it again to make sure it was the actual flipper disc.
