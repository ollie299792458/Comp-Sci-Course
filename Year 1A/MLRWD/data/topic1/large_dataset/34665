Have you ever seen Solaris with George Clooney?  I love this film.  It moves a little slow (the director of the film is the guy who directed Oceans 11 but he was trying to impress the artsy crowd with Solaris) at times.  But it is about, in the future, a psychiatrist whose wife committed suicide, being asked to go to a space station that is circling this wierd planet named Solaris.  Seems everyone on the station has been going bonkers.  When he gets there he finds that for everyone there, the planet reaches into their memories and brings someone to them that they have an unresolved issue with.  His wife comes back to him.  But here is the trick: his wife is constructed from his memories about her, and that is the cool thing about the whole film.  See, when we meet people, especially when we have relationships with them, we think about them and remember them in ways that are not actually correct with who they are.  So since his wife acted a little wierd, he remembers her as a 'crazy person' and never really got to know her.  His 'new' version of his wife is incomplete in her head; she is only his idea of her, which is as a sad, incomplete person.  In flashbacks the movie shows that he has missed the idea on her; she actually was quite stronger than him at times.  But of course their relationship could not go on because he NEVER really got to know who she was (as he says in the film, in a beautiful line, "I was haunted by the idea that I had remembered her wrong.").  They will keep repeating the same old arguments, because they don't allow that the other can change.
