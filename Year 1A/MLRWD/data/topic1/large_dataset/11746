There are but a few movies that are made for children which grasp within them the childlike wonder, a hope for goodness to be rewarded and the joy when it happens, and showcase them to the audience.

There are even fewer among them that bring the latent child present somewhere in the hidden recesses of the adult person front and center, and be unashamed to be seen in all it's vulnerable glory.

Ratatouille, ladies and gentlemen is the rare gem that does it breezingly. The geniuses at Pixar achieve this impossible task with sublime panache, that too, with a creature that almost all of us revile: the sewer rat.

The premise of the story is simple. Remy, a rat living in Paris, prefers to raid kitchens instead of scrounging the gutters for food. He is also blessed with the talent for cooking exquisite meals. He find inspiration in the philosophy of late Chef Gusteau: a culinary legend: that "Anyone can cook". One night, while cooking at Chef Gusteau's restaurant, he is discovered by a Linguini, a cleaning boy, in a moment when his guard is down. Remy and Linguini, become a culinary duo with Remy guiding Linguini in creating delights for the refined palate and the restaurant soars to acclaim.

With such an unlikely artist, would the patrons advocate their habitat? This forms the premise of a inspiring story about breaking one's confines and stereotypes, and risking losing everything for what one truly believes in, that's delightfully woven by director Brad Bird and Pixar.

I was eagerly awaiting the release of this dvd and it is worth every penny of the 20 dollars that it is being sold for here. I applaud and bow to the talent and artistry of everyone involved in creating this reaffirming story and picturizing it.
