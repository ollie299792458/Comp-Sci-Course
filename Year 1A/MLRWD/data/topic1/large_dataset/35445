Clueless takes you back to the 1990's and you remember your days back then. It's a not-so-typical chick flick and the movie itself is great. It has attitude and sass.

This DVD not only includes the movie, but it includes SO MANY special features. The special features include clips of the cast returning to the set to talk about certain areas of the movie. Also, the special features are more in quantity than what DVDs usually have.

Here is a list of the special features that you will be receiving if you purchase this product:

1) The Class of '95 - A look at the cast then and now
2) Creative Writing - Writer/Director Amy Heckerling talks about creating the world of "Clueless"
