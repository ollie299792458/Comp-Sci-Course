When I pre-ordered this from Amazon, the FedEx delivery went sadly awry. The product was dropped off at my home but apparently purloined by person or persons unknown. I took the matter to Amazon and lucked into an excellent conscientious customer-service rep who called, on a *Saturday* to double-check on the shipment status. Still nothing. So guess what happened next? A replacement copy was at my door by early Monday afternoon. No hassle, no questions. Now THAT's what I call customer service!

As for the Blu-Ray disc itself, while it has no special features that were not on the standard DVD, I feel vindicated in upgrading from the standard-definition disc. Whether or not Warner Home Video (the cream of the mass-market crop) did entirely new scans or not, the clarity and presence of the image are palpably superior to the standard-definition one, which in itself was nothing at which to sneeze. There is some cloudiness in the underwater footage, although it remains superior to all other submarine model work in films because director John Sturges used an independently moving camera to track the sub's passage through the ice. Hollywood's preference for a locked-down camera when shooting model work rarely yields results this convincing. Even on flat screen, the immediacy of foreground figures in Sturges' compositions, especially in the command center of the submarine, translates to Blu-Ray with an impressive illusion of Cinerama wraparound. The movie itself is as engrossing as ever -- downright nostalgic for those of us who find the Manichean dualities of the Cold War reassuring in comparison to the infinitely more treacherous world of today.
