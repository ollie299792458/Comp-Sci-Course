Jeremiah Johnson is a film that I saw at it's origional release in 1972 at the drive in theatre in San Francisco where I lived at the time. I, even as a youg child, appreciated this film and the experience of it has proven to be rather emblematic of what  taste I would later develop. This film harkens back to simpler times,a time when Men and Women lived a more simple existance and exacting from nature only what was needed; At least that was the case for this character. Jeremiah has turned his back on "civilized living" and has turned to the mountains for serenity and a self actualized lifestyle. This film does not bounce around or involve itself with a tightly woven plot scheme,but rather is methodical in it's approach to storytelling. It tells it's story plainly and simply. Speaking of freedom,and of man's search for himself and for the real meaning of life. I hope anyone who is interested in this type of work will consider making purchase of this film. If you happen to enjoy period pieces or non-fiction then you may also find it worthwhile. Jeremiah Johnson cuts through the clutter and represents a jewel in the rough in film making.As a footnote I would mention that a fine and significant cameo style performance is made by actor Will Geer of "The Waltons" TV show fame. I believe that this is Robert Redford's best effort. ****5- star rating
