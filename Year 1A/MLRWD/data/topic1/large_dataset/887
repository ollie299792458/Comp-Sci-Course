Since I gave the movie four stars, it's obvious that I liked it a lot.  Nicolas Cage portrayed an admittedly cynical and amoral gun runner (Yuri).  The movie could, arguably, be thought of as a capitalist success story in the Horatio Alger tradition.  The movie was full of scenes of gritty realism.  The street scenes in various third world countries and the contrast to the lifestyles of the local ruling despots merit particular mention.  There was unusual cinematography, as well - particularly the "life of a bullet" sequence at the beginning of the movie, that ends with the bullet entering a child's brain.

However, I found Yuri's wife Ava's betrayal of him to be unrealistic in the extreme.  After all, she had been a dutiful "trophy wife" who had been living off of Yuri's so-called "ill-gotten gains" for years.  Why would she, all of a sudden, out of the blue, develop a "conscience"?  It made me wonder, was she having an affair with the cop who was investigating her husband, or what?  Or maybe the authorities were going to charge her as an accessory or even a co-conspirator, and she "flipped" to save her own skin.  Hey, it's happened enough with the mob in real life; why not here, as well?
