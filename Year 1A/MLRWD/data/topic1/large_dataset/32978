First of all, I loved the movie in theaters and was anxiously waiting for the blu-ray release. While the movie is still funny, there are several aspects of this blu-ray/dvd release that I'm really disappointed with.

As others have mentioned, and was disappointingly clear in Amazon's description the 3D is an older style on the DVD version only. There is no high def blu-ray 3D included in this release. So far there have been no announcements on a proper blu-ray 3D release.

The master audio sounded great but they used a really high compression on the video. Any time there is a lot of movement or action on the screen the video tears and pixelates horribly. One of the worst was when Preston was running towards the swimming pool. The screen tore across the top and there was a fuzzy pixelated blob around Preston as he was running. There were several other points in the film where the picture quality degraded into a fuzzy mess.

I watched both the directors cut and the regular version. The directors cut was 5 minutes longer, but it wasn't obvious to me what was in the 5 extra minutes. I have to wonder if a Jackass movie really needs a directors cut version. I would have much rather they left it out and increased the video quality.

The extra features also didn't do much for me. While there were a few gags and stunts that weren't in the movie, for the most part it was just additional camera angles for things that were in the movie. It seems they kept all of the really good stuff for Jackass 3.5.

In the end, the movie is great and I'd give it 5 stars.

I feel they really messed up the blu-ray release and it's 2 stars at best in my book.
