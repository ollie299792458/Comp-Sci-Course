Nothing short of Brilliant. A must watch for anyone who cares anything about our environment. A stunning portrayal of our Earth we all call home, it shows how close we may now be to a tipping point. In brief, it showcases the incomparable beauty of our Earth and acknowledges its vulerability to environmental change. During this documentary, a disturbing fact is brought to light, that in 50 years, a single lifetime, the Earth has been more radically changed than by all previous generations of humanity. It is more important now than ever before that we shoulder our responibility and show our kids that our home is in an ever increasing need of our attention.
We need to be the generation that highlights the mistakes of our past and gives our children as much information and as many tools as we can, so their generation and that of their children will be equipped to take on the future challenges of the environment.
I beleive this film does address many of the issues that we are currently facing and the more understanding of our environmental situation, the more likely the success of our engagement in its recovery. We need to elevate our kids cognisance of their global, borderless environment. To have them become aware that we can all play an important roll in our Earths future. That collectively we can accomplish great achievements but that one person can also make a significant difference. It is only through our own awareness that we may inspire our youth to become proactive custodians of our planet we call home. Find the time to check it out, www.home-2009.com
