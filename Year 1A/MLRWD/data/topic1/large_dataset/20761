I like Morgan Freeman.  He's an exceptional actor.  I like him so much that I've never seen a movie that he was in that I didn't like.  I tried to like this movie; I tried to find something redeeming in it, anything at all, but it's a zero.  It's filled with guns that come from nowhere, magical shooting ability from a high school teacher/baseball coach who somehow is able to control a Steyr AUG on full auto with no former training, a helicopter crash in the woods that no only doesn't get anyone killed, but the occupants suffer not a single scratch, and hundreds of other mishaps that should not be overlooked by a director with the movie making skill of your average high school student.  It has absolutely no suspense, no surprise ending (it's simply random), and very little action, basically there's nothing to like about this movie.  It does have two good points.  First, it's only an hour and half long, so you won't waste too much time.  Second, if you look in the special features section you'll find previews to a couple of movies that look pretty good.  If you've got to see it borrow it, it's not even worth renting.
