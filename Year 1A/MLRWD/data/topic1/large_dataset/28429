I generally scoff at horror movies - most of them just aren't that good and I have a hard time appreciating the various levels of bad acting, bad scripting, bad effects, etc.  So I certainly didn't pick out this movie for myself, my husband did.  The redeeming future, of course, what made me decide to even give it half a chance is my adoration of Kate Hudson.

So, I was more than surprised when I watched it.  I enjoyed it completely and reiterated to myself that sometimes movie covers are so misleading.  I do not believe this should have been placed in a horror section.  I think we will soon have to see a new section for thrillers that are more drama/mystery than action and gore.  I guess that is how I would peg this film - somewhere in there.

This movie isn't filled with loads of historical information, but I think even period-piece admirers will appreciate the characters and setting as long as they can handle the superstition and lore.  This is hardly gory, but I would not buy this for a young adult who has "dark" tendencies as the setting of New Orleans makes dark magic seem very do-able.  On the other hand, for those of us finally and thankfully past that stage in our life, this is a great evening in selection!
