Except for spiderman 2 this is the best super hero movie ever, but it still could use a little work and thats why i'm waiting for the extended 3 disc DVD.  I rented the movie today, and its definetly worth buying, but the movie could be a little longer, and use some more action and more info on the story and characters.  The action is is good but of course it doesnt compare to the matrix, the fights are slow at times but still well done, but there is more then action to keep you interested.  Ron Perlman is very funny and as a kind of little kid sense to him, but he also is believable when he is serious too, which isnt that much.  The movie is funny, intelligent and complicated, suspensful, and action packed.  As far as the DVD goes is the pictures good the sounds blah blah blah, the extras are very good, but i would wait for the extended DVD in October and i am.  8 out of a 10, buy Van Helsing when your at it its better, comes out on the same day, has lots more action, and Kate Beckinsale.
