One of the best of the Golden Age of Disney, Alice in Wonderland remains a delight for all ages.  Unlike recent Disney films using computer generated images, Alice was created by hand. Beautifully drawn, one frame at a time, by true artists who could create subtle emotion on the faces of the most nonsensical creatures.  This was true artistic talent, something sadly gone now from Disney Studios.  One of the most likeable things, besides the witty story, the absolutely whacky characters and the endless movement from one crazy situation to another, is the fact that unlike all of the Disney films in the past 20 years, the film makers do not PREACH their own agenda at you.  How quickly have films like Pocohontas and Squanto, rife with holier-than-thou moralizing about a Utopian world despoiled by inherently evil and stupid western males, passed to the second or even third tier of forgettable Disney fims.  Alice in Wonderland remains at the top with films like Pinnochio for one reason, they entertain. Unlike the boring, preachy, agenda riddled and UNFUNNY "cartoons" presented to kids today, here is a funny feast of escapism that with cause your kids to actually laugh while having their imaginations set free.
