I have loved "Creepshow" since I saw it in the theater so many years ago. I loved horror comics as a kid, and this movie is the perfect homage to the genre; the stories come across as if they came straight out of "Tales From The Crypt", "Ghosts", "The Witching Hour", and so many others of my beloved creepy comics. Written for the screen by one of my favorite authors, Stephen King, and directed by horror master George Romero, "Creepshow" is, to me, pure horrific genius; this combination of writing and direction elicited wonderful "outside the box" performances from a very talented group of actors, and is what really makes this movie hold up even today as a terrific horror piece. I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film in its various media - theater, VHS, DVD, and now blu-ray, and it can still coax a jump out of me!

The blu-ray itself is the best transfer I've seen to date, but it's still not perfect. There is some "telecine wobble" throughout the film, but it seems that may be inherent to the source material; it's been present in every version I've ever seen. Overall, however, I would say that the film looks very good; the colors are well-saturated, and the sharpness and contrast of the picture is generally quite good, especially considering the movie's age. There is some transfer debris, such as specks and scratches, here and there, particularly noticeable during "Something To Tide You Over", but it's still the best "Creepshow" has ever looked for home media.

Horror fans, rejoice..."Creepshow" is finally home on blu-ray...can you watch it with the lights off?
