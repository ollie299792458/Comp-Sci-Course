I picked up the book Stephen King Goes To The Movies where this story is featured. When I read the synopsis and what Stephen had to say about it in his commentary, I was kind of on the fence by the time I got around to reading the story. However, once I read the story all doubts were thrown out the window. As wacky and off the wall as the concept of the story is, I thought it was great!
A couple months later I look the movie up on Netflix and it turns out it is an instant watch (which means I don't have to pay for it or wait for the disc to come in the mail for those out there who aren't familiar with Netflix.) The first thing that catches my attention is that the movie is 1 hour and 45 minutes. Now how do you take a short story and make it into an almost 2 hour movie? Despite this, I had an open mind going into the viewing.
It started out pretty good. Pretty much like the story. People get caught in the machine and what not. Luckily the movie didn't stray too far from the short story... to start with. After about 30 minutes things start getting added in. Unneccessary things! Too much. More than I ever wanted to know. This would have been a highly enjoyable horror movie if it would have been kept at an hour tops.
I will say that I was surprised at how good "The Mangler" actually looked. Going into the movie, I imagined horrible animation. The acting was okay but nothing noteworthy in my opinion.
Overall, I decided to watch this movie simply because I am a big Stephen King fan and am working my way through most of his books and all of the movies based off of his books. In the end, my advice is for people to read the short shory (as goofy as it sounds) but skip the movie unless you are a huge Robert Englund or Ted Levine fan.
