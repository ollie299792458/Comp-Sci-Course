According to the review by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, "...this touching story is invaded by the Grandma from Hell, who takes a chainsaw to the plot, the mood, everything. A real chainsaw, not a metaphorical one. The Grandma is not merely wrong for the movie, but fatal to it -- a writing and casting disaster."

Ebert was right about that!

However, I found the movie to be a huge disappointment for me because of the fact that the storyline didn't stay truthfull to what the movie was all about, the character's narration from the diary.  About 30 minutes to the end of the movie, we don't hear anymore about what the female lead character is thinking.  If the narration would have stayed truthful to the premise of the film (a la "Goodfellas" or "Taxi Driver" ), it would have been much better film.

Instead, this film focused on the wrong characters.  The Grandma played in drag by Tyler Perry was horribly acted.  Perry should be taken to the back and shot for micro-managing this potentially great film into a total mess.  Perry wants this film very badly to be like Richard Pryor in "Which Way is Up?" or "Soul Food".  Maybe if Perry took his creative hands out of the cookie jar, it could have worked.

The sad part about this film was it really could have been so much better.
