For everyone to know I don't watch wrestling. I don't have dish which sucks. I have heard alot about the wrestler Kane from everyone at work they all say he is the best. So I wanted to see what the hype was about and where better then a horror movie starring Kane as the killer. Well lets say one thing good soundtrack with top rap and alternative songs, too bad I haven't seen a offical soundtrack yet. I have seen alot of horror movies and i mean alot. This movie is no step in a new direction then any other horror movie but where this movie succeeds, is it's so fast paced and isn't afraid to show anything. The end is the best part about this movie, you must watch it to see what im talking about, awsome special effects. The only thing about this movie that sucked was I had to travel 47 miles to see it. No place in my area was showing it because Lionsgate had a shortage of film one theater told me. Kinda dumb if u ask me but all I know is it's the best horror film I have ever seen and can't wait to buy it on dvd. Completely took me by surprise at how great it was compared to what I thought it would be like. Well I reccomend seeing this movie and buying it the day it comes out. See No Evil 2 is in the making from what WWE Films is reporting. They are writing the plot and finding actors for the second, do out next year.
