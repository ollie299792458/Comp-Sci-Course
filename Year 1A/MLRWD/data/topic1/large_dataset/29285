My husband was humoring me as I started this DVD, with its orphaned cheetah cub.  Oh no, a cute animal movie, he was no doubt thinking.

Well yes, Little Duma, with his squeaks and kittenish big eyes, is cute, but not in the syrupy Disney way but as a precious, real tiny creature.

The story begins with Duma's mother meeting a bad end from a lion. A young boy and his father rescue the cub.

At the halfway point, the movie swerved into a quest for Duma's home.  The film felt like part Mad Max, with an improvised vehicle veering across the polychrome desert, and part Huckleberry Finn, with a young runaway and an older, savvy guide.  We both (and that includes my husband, Mr. Macho, forced to watch an animal movie) were fascinated as Duma, his young master and an African sidekick make their way across desert, lion-filled savannah and crocodile-infested river.

We both got around to seeing March of the Penguins last week and found Duma to be about 8x more fun, and probably less disturbing for kids, with a mature and satisfying ending to the young boy's sojourn with his wild friend. It certainly deserves to be a hit DVD.  Do see it if you like good scenery and wildlife.

Duma will resonate especially with those who have been on safari.  It reminded me of visiting Kenya in 1999 and watching a pair of what our Swahili-speaking drivers called "duma" resting in a clearing.  They were a couple of cool customers, happy to lounge around surrounded by a half-dozen Toyotas with camping tops filled with amateur photographers.

The "Duma" of this DVD moves around a lot more than the ones we saw on safari and appears to hit 60 mph in a few scenes. Let's hope for a new release down the road with a good bonus feature on how the filmmaker got one of the big cats to snuggle in bed with a child actor!
