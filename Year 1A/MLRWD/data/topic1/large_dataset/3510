This extremely original, milestone of a film still packs a wallop almost 40 years later. This is the kind of film that will force even the most casual film viewer to notice the acting, the direction,  the script, the editing, the cinematography and the soundtrack. Everything that goes into master filmmaking was applied to this film. It is positively a work of art, and it's mighty influence is still being utilized in the new millineum. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and although many have copied, none have quite captured the uniqueness of Bonnie and Clyde.

The entire cast is brilliant, with Faye Dunaway's performance being one of the absolute best in the history of film. She is beyond incredible with this role and in a mistake free world, she would have won the Academy award that year.

High praise must go to director Arthur Penn. What this man created and accomplished with this film truly changed the art of filmmaking forever. I dare anyone to view this film and not be impressed with it's technical achievements, or, it's emotional impact. This is unquestionably a "must see" film for any student of filmmaking, or, for anyone whom appreciates an innovative film that succeeds on every level and remains a timeless film. Highly recommended, indeed.
