A great classic film that has it all--entertaining interpretation of a classic story, cheeky characters with quirky idiosyncrasies, great adventure, cheesy acting, and great special effects for its time.  This is a film my brother and I grew up with, and of course, as cheesy as it is, we watch it repeatedly and bring a certain "MST" commentary to each sitting.  A very young Pat Boone presents a whimsical, anachronistic portrayal of a young Scotsman with an eager albeit na√Øve loyalty to Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason).  The fact that Pat Boone released his "In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy" album makes watching the film even more entertaining.  I can only imagine young Alec playing his accordion to "Crazy Train" while descending to the center of the earth.
Another Amazon.com reviewer said concerning this film "Warning. It can be addicting."  This is VERY true.  If boredom ever strikes me, for some reason, this film seems to fill the void.  
Overall, this is a great film.  A classic sci-fi film that puts the 1999 version to shame.  If you want a good old-fashioned sci-fi flick, this is the one to get.  Watch it with your kids.  Watch it with family.  Convince your girlfriend that this is the most incredible movie in the world (she'll be swooned to the Robert Burns poetry).  The next thing you know, your "heart will be in the Highlands" and you will watch it again, and again, and again (just like "Cats").
