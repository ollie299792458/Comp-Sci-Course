This is a unique film that shows a different side of Japan, in a way like the original Japanese version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7S34">Shall We Dance?</a>, but what makes this film even more special is that this is a Hollywood movie about the cultural side of Japan.

Obviously I'm not going to spoil the film by revealing the plot, so I'd like to concentrate on other things. If you have been to Japan and have experienced the ramen noodles, this film will make you smile all the way especially after the ramen restaurant appears. The experts know that this kind of slightly old and 'scummy' restaurants serve the best ramen! If you watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG4RMU">Tampopo</a>, you must have seen how serious Japanese people are about ramen noodles, and that the whole thing about good ramen is discussed at a philosophical level!

My favourite part of this film is that the role of the Ramen Master is played by a brilliant brilliant actor, Toshiyuki Nishida. He is a VERY well-known and my favourite Japanese actor, but unfortunately people outside Japan haven't had much chance to see his work, because this film is his first ever Hollywood movie appearance. His appearing in Hollywood scene was long overdue, but at last he has arrived!

Brittany Murphy is lovely, too, and through learning how to make good ramen with her very tetchy Master (Nishida), she starts to see what is really important in her heart, and there is this wonderful moment of eye contact when these two stubborn guys who don't understand each other with language can exchange something in their hearts.

I'm glad that this kind of film that shows an ordinary life of a working class Japanese man has been introduced in this way, because as far as I know Japan has a lot more than just gadgets, bullet trains, karaoke, ninja or samurai. Hope you'll enjoy it!

Just one minor point I didn't appreciate much was the music that is played each time the ramen shop appears, because it's so Chinese! I think the idea is that this tune is used as a 'theme' of this shop, which is the central stage of the whole film, but in my view the music is slightly misleading!

FYI, you might recognize the Ramem Master, Toshiyuki Nishida, from his famous role as lovely 'Pigsy' in legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00211YJT4">Monkey (1979)</a>, which has had a large cult following in the UK and in Japan, and is still shown late at night sometimes in those countries.

Hope this helps! (I miss ramen now!)
