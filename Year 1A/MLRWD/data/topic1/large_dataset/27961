Contrary to the "odd" opinion of odd numbered ST movies falling short. STIII in my opinion hardly does, in fact it reaches heights not seen in most of the ST movies following. ST1 doesn't do too bad either. The story focuses on Kirk and how he does all to at first search and save some aspect of his friend, Spock. We get to see aspects of Kirk's career, a new starship which may make the Enterprise's family way of life obsolete. We first see the first take of the barbarous facets on the Klignons who continue to bark and growl incessantly through the TNG and the other ST series and movies. STIII really wasn't meant to be the middle part of the trilogy. Younger fans did not live through the times when the movies came out with each movie rumored to be last. This was still when any Star Trek movie coming out was a phenomenon. Only because of Star Wars and Lucas boasting of 9 "episodes" did Paramount had to compete with 20th Fox sequel sci-fi. The scenes are portrayed poetically and while Nimoy was a first time director he was an amateur photographer even before the original series (see autobiography "I am not Spock" circa 1967) and you could tell his visions come through in some breathtaking vistas especially the return to Vulcan. Arriving at spacedock with James Horner's great variation score of ST:II is one the best ST scenes seen in any Star Trek. Spacedock was probably reconfigured from the Mother ship in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" by the special effects company ILM. Great adventure, stunning pathos, even more bittersweet goodbyes are experienced before the ending which does not let down unlike many other sci-fi movies. Even a reference at the very end harkening back to the ending words of ST 1. STIII tooks risks , made changes, and had no reset button which was expected of the tv trailer's words "The LAST voyage of the Starship Enterprise".
