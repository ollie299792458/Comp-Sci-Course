Between '98 and '00 I somehow missed the two-season run of Sports Night.  I'm an avid TV watcher, but it somehow slipped beneath my radar, such that I'd barely heard of the show until a couple of months ago.  And this despite the fact that the show won three Emmys!
That's when I learned that one of my favorite TV writers (Aaron Sorkin, The West Wing) had also written this half-hour "dramedy."  (I hate that word, but it's better than "sit-com," which doesn't do Sports Night justice.)  I'm such a huge Sorkin fan than when I saw that the (unfortunately short) series run of Sports Night was available on DVD, I bought it without having ever seen a single episode.
And I wasn't disappointed.  While it's clear that with The West Wing Sorkin has polished his dialogue style, it's still unmistakable here: sharp, smart, staccato exchanges between characters, so quick and lively that it makes the characters seem even more intelligent than they are.  It's not exactly realistic, but it's what I WISH reality was.
Like The West Wing, there's a great ensemble cast, too many to list individually.  Most have gone on to other projects.  And like The West Wing, Sports Night has its heart in the right place, as characters struggle with love, friendship, and work.
A great show.  Though the DVD set isn't heavy on special features, it does pack all 45 episodes into six discs and one three-box set.  Well worth the money.
