Last night I sat and watched SEVEN MEN FROM NOW.  Just been released after a long absence. Randolph Scott, always good. Very stoic hero, with little to say but a good screen presence. Lee Marvin, playing his usual tricky character. Other bad guy was John Larch. The female character was played by Gail Russell. Very understated performance by a very attractive actress. Scott played his usual character of a man on a quest for vengeance against the men who killed his wife during a robbery.

Script was by Burt Kennedy. A good, literate script with some telling lines. Directed by Budd Boetticher. Some fabulous scenery. Desert and semi-mountain backgrounds. By contrast some lush locations too. Flawless photography.

Made in 1956. It runs for 78 minutes, but every one of those short minutes is worth it.

I'd spent a busy afternoon at the keyboard, so mug of coffee in hand I settled down and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. A great way to unwind. Highly recommended. This is how a Western should be made.
