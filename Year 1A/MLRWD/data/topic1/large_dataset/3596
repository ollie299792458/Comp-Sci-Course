There is no doubt that Sandra Bullock is one of the most versatile actresses of our time.  She can do comedy, she can do drama, she can do light, she can do serious.  But she isn't a one-woman director/writer/actor team.  The movie lacked dreadfully in its underpinnings, and Bullock was left to hold it together.  And, mind you, she is the prime example of 'grace under fire;' Bullock and her team, the ever-gorgeous Miss Candice Bergen, almost-Miss Michael Caine, and Mister William Shatner, salvage what they can from the lacklustre comedy and make it an interesting and entertaining movie.
There is no doubt, Miss Congeniality is worth seeing.  Bullock, Bergen, Caine, and Shatner are strained, but each put fine performances forward.  Sporting little in line of a script or intriguing plot, these four actors rescue the movie; but, I'm still not quite sure why they signed a contract to start with...
In any event, Miss Congeniality is funny and an all-around good movie.  Despite the lack of a decent script and plot, I felt fully entertained throughout the movie.  If nothing else, see it to give these actors some incentive to do a better movie next time; one where they don't have to moonlight as Directors and Writers.
