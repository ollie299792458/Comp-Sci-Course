Following a potent hero's journey template, Boys Don't Cry packs a vast and profound message about American society.  It feels especially pertinent in an age of red-state vs. blue state cultural diviseness.  First-time director, Kimberly Peirce, a real artist, avoids such alienating and inaccurate generalities, and grounds her progressive values of equality and opportunity in the psyches and motivations of her characters.  Beginning in a roller-rink fantasia, the film immediately draws one into Brandon Teena's (the deservedly accoladed Hilary Swank) enthusiastic and unattainable dream.  As the plot develops, Peirce expertly balances the ominous and the exciting, pitting Brandon's relationship with Lana (a dynamite Chloe Sevigny) against Lana's violent ex-boyfriend, John (an eerie and charismatic Peter Sarsgaard).  The engrossing drama exists within the socio-political mileu of rural disadvantage, ignorance, and substance abuse (how many scenes convey characters drinking alcohol?) enabling the viewer to reap a multi-faceted and rewarded viewing experience.  Highly recommended.
