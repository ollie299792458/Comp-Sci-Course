First of all about the movie itself: this is good, if not great, Hitchcock. It's very entertaining if a bit stage bound, and the performances are uniformly fine.

That out of the way I thought I'd expand on the 3D aspect. I actually saw the 3D version about 25 years ago or so at a Hollywood theater on the Strip. It was part of a double feature with "Strangers on a Train" (there is a connection as it has been noted that the Ray Milland character in "Dial", a tennis pro, could have been the Farley Granger character in "Strangers").

I recall reading that when one reason Hitch shot the film in 3D was to bring out the realism of the stage play. This is evident in many scenes in the way objects are juxtaposed with the actors, such as lamps and furniture, as well as distances (seeing into the bedroom beyond the living room). In other words, the 3D served the story rather than the other way around.

But there were at least two showcase scenes where the 3D was key. The first was when the Grace Kelly character is being assaulted and is frantically waving her hand behind her (ostensibly to get the scissors). In 3D her hand was right in front of our faces, and we are basically helpless to assist. The second, while not as dynamic, is where the inspector presents the latch key, directly to the viewer.

As for the glasses, they were polarized--they did not have the red/blue lenses that people associate with 3D. The film was photographed using a process where to view it you wore what were like lightly shaded sun glasses (I think I still have them in a box somewhere), and therefore, with the color intact, it didn't detract from the film.

Though it lacked the sensational aspect of films like "House of Wax", the 3D was nevertheless effective in its subtlety, and I wish Warner could release a 3D version on DVD. I feel fortunate to have seen "Dial M for Murder" in 3D, and hope we all get the opportunity to see it in the future.
