One can't really call this a children's movie, even with it's fairy tale charm and animated characters.  People of all ages will love the time-honored tale of Beauty and the Beast - uh - with a twist, shall I say?  A mean, ugly old ogre forms an unfriendly, unlikely, sometimes friendly, alliance with a donkey - whose voice is done by none other than Eddie Murphy. The donkey IS a pain in the ....rump, but without this donkey's help, Shrek the green ogre won't rescue the beautiful princess Fiona for Lord Farquar.  The dragon (yes of course there is a dragon) is formidable, danger lurks everywhere, and the princess is trapped high in a fortress tower.  Shrek's home, his "swamp", has been over-run by fairy tale creatures - all with no place to go since Lord Farquar has evicted them from their homes. Lord Farquar and Shrek make a deal: Shrek and the donkey rescue the Princess Fiona to be Lord Farquar's bride and Shrek will get his homey little swamp back.  But what happens if things go awry?  True love is never certain and often blind, but then, we all knew that. Didn't we?
