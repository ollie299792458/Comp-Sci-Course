i remember watching this movie when it first came out.  i related to it , at the time, as i was a kid in a soft ball little league team, myself - and there were all sorts of similarities between my own life, then, and the lifes portrayed by the kids on team "bad news bears". mostly, though, this movie is a dramatic comedy supported throughout by the great walter matthau, playing a has-been little league coach to a group of kids who are , for the most part, as un - eager as he is to carry out this particular brand of patriotism. although the movie portrays the coach as a drinking man, i must note, it is best to view his characters antics as more of a prop that the director uses to denote this mans position in life as one that is lacking greatly in self esteem -  and so oddly mirrors his rag-tag team of players with their youthful doubts and pre -mature world weary ness ; they're all in this together , is the case. and so, by the way , is tatum o'neal- in a supporting role as the tough/cool girl who is as cynical as the rest of em', of course - and yet old enough to realize and allow (-and smartly acted by o'neal enough to convey, by the way -) that sometimes the reality of life and love can simply break your heart - even if the reality of that love is still your life. i found this movie to be much more dramaticaly comprehensive then i recalled it to have been when i watched it in the seventies; it has a lot of substance as sustained by matthau , o'neal and also vic morrow, who does a great character sketch throughout the film as the over - wrought little league coach of the "champion" team which matthau and his own are up against.
