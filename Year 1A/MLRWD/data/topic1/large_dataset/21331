The Beatles originally wanted nothing to do with this film. They figured it would be a knockoff of the old Saturday morning cartoon, so contributed only a handful of songs they didn't consider good enough to release on  their own albums. Now that the film has become a cult classic, the  surviving Beatles all sing a different tune, and are all fans of Yellow  Submarine.  The DVD looks and sounds incredible. The songs are as timeless  as ever, and George Martin's score is the finest work of his composing  career. Happily, the music is available on an isolated track here, so you  can hear Martin's WONDERFUL music (compare it to his limp score for  "Live and Let Die") and the Beatles great songs in all their  digital glory. The special features are mostly nice (play around with the  submarine graphic on the opening page), although the commentary by a  second-string participant is somewhat dull, and the featurette was  apparently transferred from a washed-out original. 
And it's a good thing  the music and animation are so great, because there's really no story or  script to speak of. The actors who voice the Beatles do a respectable job,  although George sounds nothing like George. Still, with the great songs,  great score, and extraordinary psychedelic animation, this is one DVD that  every Beatles fan needs to own. I bet Paul, George and Ringo do! 
All you  need is love!
