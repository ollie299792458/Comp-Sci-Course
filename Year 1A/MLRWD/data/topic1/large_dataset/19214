Lucy is the BEST Mame there ever was. Lately I have noticed that more and more people are giving this movie a good review. Why? Probably because it's actually good. Hard to believe for some of you who have it stuck in your  mind that this movie is awful and doesn't deserve a chance. Lucy does not  sound horrible. She sounds just like any normal human would. I would like  to see some of you get in front of a camera and sing your heart out like  Lucy did. She KNEW she wasn't a singer, but she tried anyway, and I think  she should be commended for that. I think it's horrible that so many people  constantly bash this woman, especially when she's no longer here to defend  herself. Had she been here, though, and read these reviews, she would have  been so heartbroken. She would have thought her fans had deserted her. She  cried so much when this movie's reviews came out; some of you just need to  find out what she said and how much she ached and cried. I'm not saying lie  about your opinions of this move, but do you really need to be so horribly  brutal and throw cheap, unnecessary shots at Lucy? Certainly not. This is a  great movie, as is Lucy. Watch it and do yourself a favor, and if you don't  like it, please don't blame Lucy. Remember, she only did what she was told.  She had no control of scripts, songs, lyrics, etc. If you didn't like it,  it's not Lucy's fault. She went all out and gave her all for this film, and  it's so obvious.
