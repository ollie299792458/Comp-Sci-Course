The people associated with this film and project have certainly given us new material to consider recently!!  This is such a good, professionally done film with beautiful scenes and views of Jerusalem, the southern Talpiot hills, etc. What a wonderful 'travelogue'!! Gives you a good idea of past and present there.  Makes you see that these people really lived then, and the film gives a clear presentation of all the archeological evidence as it has been analyzed so far. And coming from guys who have researched major archeological and crime-scene sites in the recent past, this is just exceptional.  That people of their calibre would spend so much time and energy to try to bring us all the possible stories of truth in this matter, and not bury it in some dusty warehouse, is just a great testament to their faith and courage that the truth can triumph.  Keep up the good work, guys!!!  We have just one Question:  did anyone in 1980 possibly look at the heel bones of the "Jesus, son of Joseph" ossuary before giving them up to the Jewish authorities for reburial?????  we just cannot imagine that they would be so disinterested that they would let that examination pass by??. . . maybe someone did, and that's being covered up????  That info would surely change the statistical analysis!!!
