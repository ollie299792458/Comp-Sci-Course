The guys who wrote all the hyped up reviews here must have had a hand in creating this waste of film, plastic, foil, and time. This thing ranks at the level of a college contest for a home brewed movie and at that it's a loser. They mock the desire for a better life that women from less fortunate circumstances share, and they mock the American public with their reviews here designed to line their pockets through misrepresentation.

To be fair, if this DVD was played at a party where the viewers perception of reality was 80% dimmed by drugs and alcohol and anything was funny, then 80% of the reviews here could be legitimate. If you don't plan to watch this DVD with your reality altered then by all means don't stop here, go find a real movie that can inform or entertain.

A 2 star movie would be 20 times better than this with it's false ratings misrepresented here. Take a clue from how the false positive reviews here were piled in on certain dates on which the collaborators operated.
