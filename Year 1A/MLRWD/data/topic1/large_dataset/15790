Timothy Dalton played Bond pretty well in this movie - very similar to Craig's Bond in terms of under the surface violent boil. But Dalton is just too swarmy to be Bond. Robert Davi is also good as Sanchez, though his character is more suited to an episode of Miami Vice than 007.

There has never been a worse supporting cast in a Bond movie.  From the very first scene, I was wincing at poorly played lines.  The actors -- and I use that term liberally -- look like they are reading off cue cards.  David Hedison particularly embarasses himself as Felix Leiter. Carey Lowell is beyond terrible - continuing a Bond tradition of looks-before-ability female casting.

The production values of this movie are Made for TV.  So many of the set pieces look like they could have been featured on an episode of the A-Team.  Is that a Grand Marquis Bond in driving?  Many of the props look like carboard cut outs.  Even the film quality seems shabby.

When you see a Bond like this, it's really hard to imagine how the plug wasn't pulled on the franchise earlier.  This thing is running on fumes.
