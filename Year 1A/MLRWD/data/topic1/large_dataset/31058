Ok, the story line was a bit weak, granted.  But, even if the movie was a total disaster, I would still get it for Peter Strauss alone.  The younger crowd will obviously be enthralled with Ice Cube and company, which is fine, I liked Ice Cube's performance.  But, for us in the older crowd we get the treat of Emmy winner Peter Strauss.  To me, Strauss is by far, the best actor to come along.  But I'm not biased! For those in my demographic, could we ever forget Rich Man, Poor Man, Jericho Mile, Kane and Abel and so much more?  Strauss is a seasoned veteran of the small screen.  But, it was great to see him on the big screen.  I'll get the DVD for his acting alone.  Plus, sidebar note, Willem Dafoe is fantastic in his own right.  I guess the movie was balanced with the hip hop group and the guys who played it on the level.

My biggest complaint is that they killed off Vin Diesel.  I don't understand a guy who was so brilliant got axed so easily so they could make room for a new triple-x.  Wouldn't be better to have him in a witness protection program to live out his days and just bring on new triple-x's as needed?  However, along with Strauss and Dafoe, this movie is still entertaining.  The director stretches the story line a bit, but it's a movie after all!  Still, it's worth the price of admission and the purchase of the DVD.
