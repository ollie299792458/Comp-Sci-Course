Quite possibly the one of the best films about WW1 ever made Dawn patrol was actually a `talkie' remake of an original silent film. The new film reused the flying sequences but added scenes of the pilots and officers on the ground living the wild life.

The film centers of Errol Flynn and David Niven as two of the few surviving experienced pilots in  a squadron of young men who are dying daily in the skies over the western front. Following the real life experience of such men who knew they would die long before the war ended, each night is a drunken party, in theory to celebrate the heroes lost but in fact to try and hold despair at bay

Over them is Basil Rathbone as the commander they hate for unfeelingly sending them up daily to die, but they don't see him as he really is, the officer tortured with the knowledge of each death and bordering on insubordination as he appeals  to his superiors for a chance to give his men the time they need to be better trained. Rathbone himself was a veteran officer of the trenches of the First World War and seems to draw on the feelings he must have felt seeing his own men die in his role as the torture commander.

Having set the stage things then change half way through the film as Rathbone is promoted and turns command over to Flynn, who suddenly finds himself in the same tortured position as the man he unfairly hated as his close friendship with Niven starts to unravel.

Although some of the terrain looks more like southern California than northern France this is an amazing film for it's flying sequences and far more so for it's drama in the interaction between men who don't dare show weakness to even themselves. All too often the `adventure' films of Warner Brothers were escapists schlock but in Dawn Patrol, setting, actors, script and direction all come together to deliver an amazingly good and powerful film.
