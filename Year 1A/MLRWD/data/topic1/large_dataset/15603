A BEAUTIFUL MIND is about a brilliant mathematician John Nash, (Russlle Crowe) who is working on a new concept at Princeton University, but when he is informed by William (Ed Harris) a government agent, that a top secret operative is being developed and that they need his help to decipher a intercepted code, He reluctantly agrees.

Pressure, stress and time sensitive code cracking send him into huge bouts of paranoia and depression. In the mean time, he must keep his assignment a secret from his wife Allicia, (Jennifer Connely)
his best friend Charles (Paul Betanny) and anyone else, for that matter.
Little by little as the codes become increaingly more difficult and an ever impending threat draws near, he begins to crack under the constant pressure.

This movie is a rare journey into places that few dare visit.
It will stimulate positive thinking and will have the viewer questioning thier own understanding of it.
I can appreciate a movie where intelligence can be underestimated and over thinking can be out done.

I highly recommend this movie, the story is mind bending and, at the very least, will definitely give you some food for thought!
