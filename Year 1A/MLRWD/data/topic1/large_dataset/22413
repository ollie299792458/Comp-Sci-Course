I watched Charlie's Angel yesterday night and I have not slept since yestarday night. The reason that I did not sleep is about a scene in the movie. In the first hour of movie quiet fun and full of action. Everything was quiet good for me and my husbund until we realized that in the part of Lucy and Cameron danced as a belly dancer. If you guys listen the music in that part, you will understand that the music that they dance is not a belly dancing music, it is the Islamic call ( the actual name is Ezan) for inviting the Muslim to five time praying to the mosque. I was shocked because this was an insulting scene of all muslims. The film producers were making fun with an important Islamic tradition. In other word, while the Muslims consider the Ezan as a religious thing, according to the film producers it is an enjoyment in the belly dance. Now I am coming my title;What is really going on in Hollywood? Do not they think what are they doing or this is a deliberate way to insult all the Muslims? Do not they know the motion pictures play an important role in American and world societies?
