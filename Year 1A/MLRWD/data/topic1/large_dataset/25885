Okay, I'll admit it.  I was a little embarrassed purchasing the double movie pack because ... well, I have no kids and I figured these movies were primarily for kids.  But after reading all of the high rated reviews here, I just had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  These movies are great!  No matter who the targeted audience was, these movies will be enjoyed by people of all ages, with or without kids.  
I had a wonderful time watching Toys.  The animation was great, the voice acting was just wonderful, and the storyline was very enjoyable as well.  I liked it so much that right after finishing the first movie, I plopped the second movie in the DVD player.  Again, I was very impressed with the clever, humorous and touching scenes.  And as with the first, the voice acting was very good.  To top it off, if young ones do watch it, it provides some good lessons on caring and friendship that shouldn't be missed.  
My recommendation, buy (or rent) the movies.  You don't have to be a kid -- or have any -- to enjoy them.  But you might want to watch them more than once, so the purchase is probably the better deal.
