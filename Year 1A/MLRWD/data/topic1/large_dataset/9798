My friends saw this tour live and I didn't realize what I had missed . . . until I saw this video.
For those who are tired of bands looking like they're still in the recording studio while performing live, this video is  a must!
Peter Gabriel, and co., developed an elaborate and visually  stunning performance - on two separate stages nonetheless - that can get  even video audiences out of their seats and cheering.
This is not a  concert - it's a theatrical event!
For Peter Gabriel Fans, this concert  was about 90% new material.  Most of that was from the "Us"  album.  However, the personal nature of the album was mirrored well by the  song selection and powerful performances by Peter Gabriel and Paula Cole.  These songs include "Blood of Eden", "In Your Eyes",  "Don't Give Up" and "Shaking The Tree". 
Other faves  include "Sledgehammer", "Steam" and "Kiss That  Frog".  "Salisbury Hill" is a welcome entry, and  "Across the River" is a moving performance.  [There are more  songs, but space here is limited.]
The band is in top form:  Along with  Paula Cole are familiar faces like Tony Levin (Bass), David Rhodes (Guitar)  and Manu Katche (Drums), with Jean-Claude (Keyboards) and Shankar (violin)  rounding out the main band.
Words are not enough.  You must see it to get  a taste of this truly monumental tour.  I don't want to spoil anything, but  I especially enjoyed the last part of "Secret World" near the end  of the concert.
