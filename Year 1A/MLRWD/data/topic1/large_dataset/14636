I'm pretty new to this rating products thing on Amazon. I don't fancy myself a real movie critic either, it was just a fun pen name. So, when I'm reviewing a movie on HD or Blue-Ray; I try to give an opinion to people who haven't yet seen the movie. As well as to people who have, and just want to know if it's worth re-buying it over in a hi-def format. This is one of those movies I watch on a regular basis, even though I know exactly what's going to happen. Because it feels like visiting an old friend. ABOUT THE HD-I feel that any movie that you want to watch repeatedly is worth owning on HD or Blue-Ray. If...you have a TV that is capable of showing the difference. The one thing I was hoping for was that the vintage footage from the late 40's and early 50's would be sharper. No. And thinking on it it shouldn't be. The hi-def format does just what it's supposed to do. Reveal the old film for what it is...old film. But the rest of the movie does benefit greatly. Like when Ray 'looks' at his watch by feeling it, I can read the tiny wording on the dial face. I've been getting these movies on HD for a very good price is one reason I've been buying on HD instead of Blue-Ray. I hope these reviews help with your buying decision.
