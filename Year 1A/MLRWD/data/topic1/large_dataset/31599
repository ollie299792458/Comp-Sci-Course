I am not exaggerating when I say that, in my opinion, this is the finest  movie ever made.  Elizabeth Taylor(who gained weight &amp; went out of her  way to appear much older to get this role) and Richard Burton give the best  performances of their careers.  Mike Nichols(The Graduate) does a wonderful  directing job.  This adaptation of Edward Albee's dark play is perfect.  There is not a wasted line in the entire film.  The language and subject  matter of this movie were quite controversial when this movie initially was  released(1966).  It is as intense and unsettling as sitting between your  favorite married couple as they have the worst argument you can imagine.  George Segal &amp; Sandy Dennis are brilliant as the young couple who come  over to spend an evening with George &amp; Martha(Burton &amp; Taylor).  They unwittingly walk into the dreadful twilight years of what appears to  be one of the most disastrous marriages ever to grace the silver screen.  The wit, realism &amp; nastiness of this film have to be seen to be  believed!  Segal &amp; Dennis' characters are at the beginning of their  marriage when they meet George &amp; Martha.  They will never be the same  after one night in the hell of those wicked hearts.  There is very dark  humor, intensely painful moments, as well as plentiful suspense and shock.  I don't want to give away the details...so I won't.  Ah, but these are  just words on a screen.  Get this movie and experience the most  well-written movie I have ever seen!
  As far as screwed up alcoholic  love stories go, this is right there with Days Of Wine &amp; Roses/The Lost  Weekend/Barfly.  I had to pause it a couple of times the first time I ever  saw it...just to let the tension settle some.  It's that strong!
