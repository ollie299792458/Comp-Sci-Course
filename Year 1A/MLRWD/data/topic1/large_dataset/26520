I WENT THROUGH TWO PAINFUL MEDICAL PROCEDURES THE DAY I SAW THE,"RED TAILS."
JUST HAD TO SEE HOW LUCUS MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT.  HIS MONEY WAS NOT SPENT IN VAIN.
TO SEE THE MEN FLY IN PLANES THAT NO ONE ELSE WANTED, GOING UP AGAINST THE GERMANS ME-109S, KNOWING THAT IF THEY WENT DOWN, THEIR CHANCES WERE POOR IF NOT WORST.
BUT IN MY HUMBLE EXPERIENCE, IT WAS THE P-51G'S THAT STOLE THE SHOW.
I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET SOME OF THE REMANING TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, AND TO THE MAN THEY SO VERY PROUD OF WHAT THEY DID, BUT EVEN MORE SO FOR BEING ALLOWED TO FLY THE MUSTANG.
SOME OF THE SCENES WITH THE MEN SITTING AROUND SHOOTING THE BULL, PLAYING CARDS AND GENERLY RELAXING WERE AT TIMES A LITTLE SLOW, BUT AGAIN FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.
REMEMBER THIS, NOT ONE THING WAS SAID WHEN THEY WERE THE FIRST FIGHTER GROUP TO FLY TO BERLIN WHILE ESCORTING THEIR B-17S.
SOME OF YOU WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE AND PLAY IT OFF AS SO MUCH HOG WASH, BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER, IT CAUSES THE PRIDE TO STAND UP AND SALUTE.
