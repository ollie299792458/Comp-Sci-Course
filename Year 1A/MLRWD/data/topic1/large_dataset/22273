Did you ever read the reviews of a movie and almost decide NOT to rent it because of the mediocre comments?  Then, you get the movie, you aren't expecting much.... and the movie BLOWS YOU AWAY???  Well, THIS is the movie.  FORGET the reviews on here with less than 4 stars. "Typical"?  "Boring"?  These people must be on serious..and I mean SERIOUS..hallucinogens.

This was the most SCARY, SUSPENSEFUL, WELL-FILMED horror movie I've seen in about 10 years.  And I've seen them all....trust me.  The camera work, sound effects, acting, and production values were FANTASTIC.  Every scene was perfectly filmed.  American horror movies today don't even come CLOSE to the terror you will experience watching this movie.  Afterwards, if you watch the DVD Extras and "making-of", you will REALLY appreciate what the director and actors went through - to make everything you see seem so real.  Their actions and expressions are EXACTLY what real-life people would do under such terrifying conditions.

This movie STANDS ON ITS OWN in every way...  But I would compare it to "The Thing" for the snowy isolation, "Susperia" for the foreign feel and heart-pounding suspense (and sound effects), "Mute Witness" for the unbelievable chase scenes, and "Halloween" for the intense stalker moments.  I am buying this movie TODAY for my DVD collection.

If you love GREAT, SCARY, SUSPENSEFUL, JUMP-OUT-OF-YOUR-SEAT horror movies, do yourselves a BIG favor and rent this one.  Here's what you do... Put the sound on high... shut the lights... and enjoy the roller coaster ride!!!
