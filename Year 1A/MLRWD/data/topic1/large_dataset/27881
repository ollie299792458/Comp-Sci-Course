I liked this movie, I thought it was compelling. As I expected though, there were some on the right who called this movie unamerican and anti-american in their reviews. This is to be expected though. Though quite a number of conservatives share the concern of those on the left for the use harsh interrogations means (and sending prisoners/detainees to nations such as Egypt where we know they will use torture to acquire information is definately one of them) quite a number on the right don't really share these concerns. Which is most ironic, because it is the far right that usually states (often because of deep religious convictions) that it has absolutely moral truth and authority. Often this supposedly comes from the deity they worship. So, if you support the practices depicted in this film then you lose that "absolute moral authority/truth/ rightness" that you have. It is the left who much more then the right who are principled when it comes opposition to the use of torture or torture lite. Which is most ironic, since they are said not to have a moral compass or that they practice moral relativism. Again, this is not to say to be very religious or even conservative one can't oppose torture or "harsh interrogation" but all too often the more religious one is, the more one supports these things.  Lastly, I fully expect to be called unamerican or some variant of it, on someone's comments, because that is what unfortunately far too many people who can't defend their position without emotion, resort to very frequently. This film is pro-American, it stands for American values of due process and freedom from being tortured by the state. It lives up to America's highest ideals.
