This horrible version of perhaps the best Holmes tale is almost unfathomably bad. The short version of this review is: Avoid at all cost! THEN go see the Jeremy Brett version, which is THE definitive Hound!
The only favorable quality of this version is that the cinematography isn't too bad and there are some nice atmospheric shots. But the casting/acting/story... hideous. Holmes and Watson are mis-cast to begin with. Neither Hart or Roxburgh can pull off Watson/Holmes to save their lives. It's obvious that not only did neither of them study Conan Doyle's work carefully, they are completely incapable of delivering a line and not having it be DOA. 
The acting is just BAD BAD BAD! (the directing too) Dialog falls completely flat almost always. Especially in scenes where there should be something there! For instance... the discovery of Holmes' hideout on the moor... Hart/Roxburgh stand there and delivery their lines like they're high school drama students reading the script for the first time! They're perfectly still, have no sense of timing, and have nothing behind the lines at all, and Watson barely acts surprised when Holmes shows up. It's almost unwatchable! This seems to be the dominant mode for the entire film. Furthermore... Roxburgh reads his lines in such a bland way he's almost parroting them. We're supposed to be convinced this guy is thinking?? 
I'm not completely against another version on Hound being made... but this supposed 'update' is pointless. Beyond the terrible acting the butchering of the script and the stupid (and oft discussed by other reviewers) use of cocaine during a case is pathetic. (For a GOOD story about Holmes' drug use see Brett in the disturbing "Devil's Foot".) 
Bottom line again: See the Brett version, the best. Or really, any other version besides this one.
