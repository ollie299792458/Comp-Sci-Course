This is a great movie to have in your library. It is basically a film along the lines of The King and I. Jodie Foster is the perfect match for her role. She grabs you and draws you in, making a personal connection with the characters. Chow Yun-Fat is, also, a very good fit for his role as emperor.

The film makes you take a good look at how personal realtionships within your own family are about the most important thing you have. It also draws attention to the importance of respecting others. I'm not going to use the word 'tolerance'...but for the closed-minded, tyranical types, this film will ease that person into realizing the many good qualities in other people.

Oh, and don't forget the falling-in-love portions of this movie. Crossing boundries for those forbidden pleasures alway make for a good time.

This is a great film for those who like to ride the emotional rollercoaster. You'll laugh, get ticked-off, cry, get the warm-fuzzies...you get the point.

So, grab your sweatheart, get a blanket, pop some popcorn, turn the lights down and enjoy this timeless work of art!
