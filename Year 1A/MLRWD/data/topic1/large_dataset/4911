Jonathan Rhys Meyers creates a brilliant character with Brian Slade (a bisexual rock idol of the 70's), as does Ewan McGregor with the character of Curt Wild. The romance captured within the film is of glittering beauty and emotion, and to be honest, left me in tears at times from the absolutely heart-wrenching beauty of it all. Christian Bale also delivers an excellent performance as Arthur, a teenager filled with confusion and a need to find a place in his own world; Arthur becomes a character which most persons can identify with in the aspect of awkward teen angst. The portraits painted throughout the film are absolutely stunning! The actors and actresses all are wonderful within their roles, and various bands give cameos throughout the movie. (The Flaming Creatures aka Placebo, being most memorable for myself) The fantasy sequences and emotion-filled music and concert sequences add a great deal to the movie. The imagery is fantastic and beautiful. Not only is the storyline and poetic language administered in the film gorgeous ("The world has changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history."), but the music adds a great deal of color to the movie. I'd seriously recommend giving this movie a shot; it's definitely worth it.
