I saw this movie in a sneak preview in the theaters:

This movie was soul-suckingly bad.  Apocalypse bad.  Suicide bad.  Pauly Shore bad.  Give me a paper cut and rub lemon juice in it bad. It was bad.

Here are the good things about the movie:

1.  J-Lo dies in the first ten minutes.

2. Ben Affleck was NOT the suckiest thing about the movie.

3. It was not that long.

Here are the sucky things:

1. It stars a bizarre-looking little urchin girl.  I don't know if you ever saw "Twin Peaks" or the HBO series "Carnevale" but it stars a dwarf named Michael J Anderson.  If you put a long brown wig on him and dressed him up like a little girl, he would be a twin of this little vixen.  She was a revolting little toad, a bad actress, and a worse singer. She sucked my soul.

2. The print was hideous, and this is from a movie not even released yet.  Even though it had Vilmos Zsigmond, a fine cinematographer, it looked like each reel was from a different movie, and not a very good movie.  At times it was green, washed out, over exposed, and just visually painful. A little bit of my soul was lost here.

3.  The editing SUCKED.  It ripped out the shreds of what was left of my soul, and the souls of my ancestors. I could see my soul leaving my body and floating up to the ceiling of the theater as I silently screamed.

4.  The movie reeked of false sentimentality. If the scriptwriter got paid by the cliche he would be the highest paid man in Hollywood and possibly the world. This screenwriter should be shot, hung, poisoned, drowned, and then killed.  Oh wait...Kevin Smith was the screenwriter.  Mr. Parent Boy wrote the screenplay to celebrate the joy he feels at being a father.  Note to Kevin: Not so much share those feelings with others in the future; I want my soul back.

In short, I am not so much recommending this movie.
