Everyone who worked on this film has a solid track record of delivering on their promise.  The film had a great premise and started out with the  correct amount of suspense.  At some point it lost me.  Maybe it was when  the sexual innuendoes with the game station went from subtle, to obvious,  to absurd.  Maybe it was when I realized that the actors weren't just  acting like they were acting bad, but really were acting bad.  Maybe it was  when the retarded dialog finally got to me or the fact that the movie was  clearly written by someone who has no idea how computers really work.
I  really wanted to like the film but couldn't shake the feeling that  Cronenburg initially had some very interesting things to say, and made a  great film.  He then took it too the studio which said, "4 hours are  you nuts?  Cut it down to two hours."  
To which David replied,  "But then I won't have all the time I need to explain my interesting  philosophy with a ripped off name." 
"Well just keep the scenes  with Jennifer Jason Leigh's butt.  I think we can market that."
