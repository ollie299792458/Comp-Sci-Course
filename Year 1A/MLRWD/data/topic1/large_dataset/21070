Well, the opinions for Luc Besson's latest movie--The Messenger are so extreme.Some said that it is wonderful,impressive but some said that it is aweful.I'm not surprised that Luc Besson's movie would arouse so many  controversies for his work is so innovative.  Whenever an artist wants to  deal with history in his work, he will face a singnificant problem--the  accurancy.Some argue that to be loyal to history is very important but to  me art is art,history is history(To me movies are Art).If art work reveals  nothing more but merely presents the history once again,why do we call that  Art?So,some changes or some polishment of history events in movies is  acceptable or even necessary as long as it dosen't go too far.All I want to  know is how Luc Besson would portray Joan.Luc Besson,of course, has read  many books about Joan.Do you think that he did not know how Joan was  described.He knew,of course.Then why did they still portray Joan in this  way?What did the director want to tell us?Making amendments to history is  not a big deal but the motive of doing such amendments is what I concear  most.  Remember the name of the movie is"The Messenger !Is Joan  really a messenger?That was what Luc Besson wanted to explore.And his Joan  is not longer carrying a divine image.She is just a human.A human can never  be perfect.So somtimes Joan will be fierce,weak,confused and proud.Some may  not like this image of Joan.They may think that it ruined the heroine.For  centuries Joan has been portrayed by history, books, legends,  sculptures,literature and paintings as divine,virtuous,gentle and  brave.Finally it became a fixed image of Joan.People can hardly accept  others .Luc Besson's Joan of Arc did explore a new field for the  interpretation of the maid of Lorraine.It smashed the virtuous,  perfect,divine image of conventionally protrayed Joan.It is innovative and  his Joan is much more humane.Then why must his Joan be so  fierce?Actually,the image of Luc Besson's Joan of Arc was shaped to serve  the themes of the movie.The second theme is satire against  battles."And the battle of our pride,greed and hunger deep  inside".Remember what Joan said in her last confession?She said she  was just like all the others who believed that they are allowed to do  anything when they fighting for their ideals.She said she was proud,she was  selfish and  cruel."Fierce","Proud","Selfish",and  "Cruel" are simply descriptions about all human being.In  fact,robbery,murder,rape are no longer crimes or sins under  nationalism,patriotism and for those who are religionists in our world.We  believe that we can hurt others,start battles when we are fighting to  achieve certain "high goaling"...The battle scenes may not be as  good as those in "Braveheart" but it carries a much deeper  meaning that "Braveheart" did.  Some said that Milla Jovovich  acted badly.I think she clearly understood what Luc Besson wanted to  present and how his Joan of Arc should be like. So she did her best to fit  her role--Joan of Arc as a simple,talented,brave girl.And she acted pretty  well. Even much better that she did in "The Fifth Element".I  don't mean that her performance was perfect.But on average her performance  ws great,impressive and convincing. She impressed me so much that I could  feel glorious with Joan at the coronation of Charles 7th.I was shocked and  touched by her acting when Joan's stong belief, self-esteem were  challenged,denied and finally collapsed when facing the God(I don't think  the word conscience is suitable enough for the role of Dustin Hoffman.It  should be a mix of God and a representative of the war deep inside Joan's  heart).Milla's green eyes were always shown with unbreakable confidence and  will.She was so mighty and heroic when she was in her armour,riding a horse  and waving her banner.Her performance is wonderful.For those who could not  accept such an interpretation of Joan of Arc would not, of course,enjoy her  performance. Never mind.Every individual is unique.Everyone has got a  particular image of Joan of Arc in his mind.And I am glad to see that so  many controversies over this film because only good film can arouse as many  differential says.I do think that The Messenger is the best Luc Besson has  ever produced.I've seen it 8 times in the theatre without getting bored.To  me,it is really a masterpiece!
