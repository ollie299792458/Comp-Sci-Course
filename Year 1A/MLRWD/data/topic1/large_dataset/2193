4.5 stars.  In so many words, this is a classic Western.  Anyone who loves Westerns does or will love this film.  The three main actors are all memorable, the story is engrossing, and Sergio Leon's direction is excellent.  The cinematography is superb, ranging from widescreen vistas baked under the Spanish sunshine to repellent close-ups of dirty bounty hunters and the like.  What I did not remember about this film is how incredibly huge it is!  Some of the location shots are extensive and a couple of the scenes encompass Civil War magnitude with thousands of extras(no CGI here, thank the Lord!).  Anyway, I could praise the film, the acting, and all that to no end...but this particular DVD package is fairly lame.  True, it is cheap, but the fact that the sound is only 2-channel is a big disappointment.  With only two of my five speakers blasting that most famous score had me a little deflated, to say the least. However, the picture quality is better than has been suggested, and there is a specail feature of 14 minutes of footage that was flitched off for the U.S. release of the film.  This film is very entertaining, and for the measely price they are asking for one could certainly do worse than this DVD.  Just be sure to wear headphones so you won't notice the 2-channel effect so much.  Take it easy.
