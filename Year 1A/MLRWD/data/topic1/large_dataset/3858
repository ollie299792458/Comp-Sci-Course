This is such a cute movie with the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii.  Henry avoids commitment by only dating tourists, but then he meets Lucy at a diner.  When he comes back the next morning to have breakfast with her again, however, she doesn't remember having met him.  A friend then informs Henry that Lucy has no short-term memory due to a car accident.  Every day she does the same thing, believing that it is still the day of the accident.  Her family goes to great lengths to make her sure she still believes that, so she doesn't freak out every day as she realizes the sad nature of her condition.

But now Henry is involved.  He can't get enough of this girl and is quickly falling in love with her, so he helps her move forward with her life.  Every day he is presented with the challenge of making her fall in love with him.  The idea behind the story is so unique and is pulled off very convincingly, with lots of fun and funny moments.  Henry and Lucy make a cute couple and the acting is wonderful.  The ending was perfect - very sweet.  The only issue I had with the movie was the unnecessary profanity and occassional crudeness.  Aside from that, this is a movie that I could watch over and over.
