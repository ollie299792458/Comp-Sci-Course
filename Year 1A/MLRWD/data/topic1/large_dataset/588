Finally, the whole OVA series 1 and 2 in one box!
BUT WAIT! It's missing something! Yes... the Mihoshi Special (a fun and totally non-canon romp through the world of Tenchi) wasn't included in this OVA set. Also, the new version of Washu's Encyclopedia seems a tad dry.
-- Otherwise, I can't recomend the series more!
The OVA is the best series of all Tenchi, including Universe and Shin. This is where it all started...
Ryoko is no longer an irritable Space Pirate, Ayeka has much more depth, Sasami is her cute old self (but quite a bit wiser!) and Washu (excuse me, LITTLE Washu) is finally back to her pure form... as the greatest scientific genius in the Universe who *doesn't* blow everything up. Perhaps the biggest and the best change is from dunderhead and obnoxious Mihoshi to the sweet and lovable (but incredibly unlucky... or IS she lucky?!) Mihoshi that we members of KOME love to represent.
In fact... the only one who didn't change is Tenchi ^_-

This is a must have for any anime fan... see what Cartoon Network DIDN'T show!
