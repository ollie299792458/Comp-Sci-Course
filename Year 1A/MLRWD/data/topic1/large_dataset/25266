This film is a haunting and moving insight into friendship and the spirituality of love,and how these things affect the emotional process of creation.As artists, we can relate to Joseph Cotton's "winter of the  mind" since we all struggle to find that simple life experience that  will inspire us to create truth or beauty in the world.Friendship and love  can be the catalyst."Jennie" shows this process with simple  warmth and humanity in a way that is all too rare in today's  mega-movies.The story is punctuated with real insights into the emotional  courage it takes to live a life in the arts.This is amazing for what is  basically a Hollywood 1940s romance film.Wonderful performances by Ethel  Barrymore, David Wayne and Joseph Cotton!The reason for my four star rating  instead of five is ironically due to the disappointing quality of the  portrait itself-it looks like an exercise out of a  "How-to-paint-portraits" manual.The painting doesn't truly  capture Jennie's character nor does it really look like her!For  comparison,check out Medina's and Albright's amazing paintings for the film  "The Picture of Dorian Gray"!Selsnick should've hired Medina to  paint Jennie!Ultimately though,this beautiful story moved me to creation.I  would love to own this movie and watch it when I'm creatively  stuck!Recommended to everyone with an artistic,romantic bent.A major  frustration that this video is out of print!
