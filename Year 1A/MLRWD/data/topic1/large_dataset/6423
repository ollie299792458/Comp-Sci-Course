I had heard that "The Adventures of Captain Marvel" was very good, and I wasn't disappointed. The basic story is cleverly tailored to provide situations for cliffhangers, some of which are a bit weak, but most are very good. But the most impressive are the production values and the special effects. As has already been noted, the flying effects were a match to anything before "Superman" in 1978, and infinitely superior to those of the "Superman" TV series with George Reeves. But that's not all: a sequence on a ship during a storm very cleverly combined rear-screen projection with live-action "waves". As Captain Marvel, Tom Tyler has a real presence and is one of the most convincing superhero incarnations. On the other hand, his acting wasn't that good. The other actors were ok. 
Objectively speaking, the violence is nothing by today's standards, but I was shocked at some of Captain Marvel's actions, especially when he deliberately throws a baddie off the top of a tall building. This is somehow refreshing.
There are a few plot inconsistencies and continuity errors (at least once, Billy Batson is wearing one set of clothes when he changes into Captain Marvel, and a different one when he changes back). Moreover, the authors seemed to think that Siam - modern Thailand - was a British colony, which it wasn't.
But that is of little consequence. I can only recommend this serial.
