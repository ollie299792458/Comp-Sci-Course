I just got done doing this for the first time, and liked it overall.  It's different from the other barre/fusion workouts I have (I have P57, Pop Physique, Core Fusion, Squeeze, Ballet Body, and Ballet Beautiful, amongst others), and I love how it doubles as a cardio workout since the moves have you sweating.  It reminds me most of Pop Physique and Squeeze, but is different enough to warrant purchase.

To do the workout, you'll need a set of 1- or 2-pound dumbbells, a mat, and a stability ball.

The workout uses mostly small pulsing moves with the weights, mixed in with lots of plank and push-up variations, which I loved.  Darby also really targets the triceps a lot, which is nice for those of us over 40 who are fighting the bat wings. She uses the stability ball in the last part of the workout to work the legs, and does so in some unique ways.

This would be a five-star workout for me if it weren't for these drawbacks:

* the constant pop-ups made it hard for me to both see and hear Darby's cueing; at several times during the workout, I hadn't even realized that she had gone on to a new move since the person was still talking; these were extremely annoying, and I can only imagine that they'll be even more so as I do the workout more (I need to see if they get turned off if you go for the "music off" option)

* the "Bubble Girl" that pops in and out (Darby dressed in various costumes) was useful to see form, but she was often doing the moves differently than Darby's lead in the actual workout -- and her facial expressions looked like a scary Barbie doll; I appreciate that they were going for something different, but having a "normal-looking" Darby instead would have been a whole lot better

* the workout also comes in at 104 minutes long, and the final stretch is only done on one side, before the screen fades out

Overall, I can see that doing this workout on a regular basis will definitely yield results, but I just wish that it didn't have these annoying features.
