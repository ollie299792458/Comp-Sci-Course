Criterion Collection has done a wonderful job on this package.  You have everything: the complete television version, the theatrical version, and a generous documentary on the filming.  Of all Igmar Bergman films, this one is the most rich in Bergman ideals.  If one gets the impression in earlier films of case studies for a Philosophy 101 class, here these ideals are better developed and interwoven into the story.  Some people say this movie is anti-Christian, but one thing any Christian can learn from the priest, is that right and wrong are difficult to know sometimes, even for a priest.  Throughout this movie, religious values are questioned, but, one of the strongest believers is the Jew, Isak - and his Hebrew tale in Episode four (TV version) is one of the most enlightening soliloquies of the whole film.  People are often stunned by the richness of the sets for the Ekdahl household - this so brilliantly offsets the coldness and bareness of the priest's house.  In just every way, this film is full of thought, and, imagination.
