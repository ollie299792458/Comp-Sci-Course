I know this is a bad movie, but look at this: A bad movie, with some cool chopped heads and Mila Kunis...It looks good to me.
It's not really a sequel, because they have to put Patric Bateman as the main charachter, but no...ther's only a cameo, and it's not even Christian Bale.
Personaly I didn't like the first one.It was a little boring, and the only things I saw were naked chiks and blood, I mean that's great but what about the story?.
I don't know there was just something missing.
Here we have Rachel Newman(Mila Kunis)as the main charachter.
A very hot, clever girl that would do anything to get the position of the teacher's assistant.
What do I mean by doing anything?...murdering the students.
The movie was too short.But what I really liked was the way it was told.With humor, funny dialogues and of course, Mila Kunis like I said.
Who's director Morgan J. Freeman?(Not the actor, I'm sure).I've never heard of him.But he did a great job.
Locations were pretty good, gore too and acting was not bad at all.
William Shattner(As the teacher) did well.Mila is the one that makes this a good film.Without her it would be just another stupid horror B movie.
