Notes on 8-1/2:
In praise of reticence...
Many critics and reviewers mention the "Creative Block" that the
character of Guido(Fellini) experiences. I don't think that is the
case. Rather I believe Guido(Fellini) knows what he can do, and how to do it.
What he is actually questioning is whether his next creation, whatever
it might be, is worthy of being created at all. Is what he can do,
artistically valid? When Guido sarcastically and self-mockingly sings:
"I have nothing to say"; then speaks: "But I want to say it anyway." is
a telltale not to a creative block, but to a questioning of the
legitimacy of his creative spirit at this point in his life. Ultimately
his character, comes to the conclusion that it is not
worthy of him giving it birth. The alleged "space-ship" is actually
Guido's (Fellini's) egoism, nothing more, and all his acquaintances
must climb it. I choose not to see it as a phalanx, and find that
interpretation to be an over simplification.
Whether 8-1/2 is a cinematic masterpiece
is not at issue in my argument. If it, in fact, is a cinematic
masterpiece, it was a great work of artistic genius FIRST. I believe
these two things can be exclusive of one another. Lean's Lawrence of
Arabia is a cinematic masterpiece, but NOT a great work
of artistic genius. If you see what I mean.
If you look to "Amarcord" (a film that follows 8-1/2 by ten
years), you find many of Fellini's so-called memories are congealed into that
unmistakable cinematic masterpiece. However the cinematic masterpiece
that Amarcord is, is not the great work of genius by a mature artist
that 8-1/2 is. Consequently I would recommend Amarcord to anyone, while
I would highly recommend 8-1/2 only to a select few.
