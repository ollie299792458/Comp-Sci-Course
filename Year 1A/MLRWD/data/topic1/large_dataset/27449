If Paul Newman isn't this country's greatest actor, he's in the discussion.  I felt that way before seeing 'The Verdict', and this could be his best work.

I regret waiting until now, but this film is timeless. Very little alteration would be required to set this movie in 2011.  Writer, David Mammet, and director, Sidney Lumet, play a large role in the experience, but most of the credit goes to Newman.  He's one of those actors who, if placed in any time period, would be interesting.

It's easy to emote when playing an alcoholic.  It's natural for writers, directors, actors to portray a drunken clown.  'The Verdict' offers the greatest drunk in movie history.  He gives the movie its 'moral foundation', without glamorizing the affliction.

The writing, film-making and cast are top-notch.  While this isn't a fast-moving story, there is not a moment of lag. You are witnessing an actor at the top of his game, delivering a universal message about truth and justice.  Lawyers don't need to scream in the courtroom to deliver a point.  Once again, Newman proves that there is a different approach.
