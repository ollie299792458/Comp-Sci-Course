This happens to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The plot meanders everywhere, the actors are stiff as boards, and even when they do show some acting ability, there is not enough direction to create any character development. Finally, until one explosive moment there is no action to speak of. I actually fell asleep during the movie and had to be awakened because my snoring was louder than the vapid dialogue.

If I were Sean Penn I would be embarrassed - he is truly a good actor who probably was too awestruck by the usually great Sydney Pollack to complain. Nicole Kidman - sorry but I can't see you in this role. You are not weathered enough.

Plot has so many holes and unbelievable sequences. How can a single person be allowed to float around the UN building during at any time of the day and end up overhearing news that will shake the world ... in a rare language no less? Come on!!!

The one star I gave it is for the banter I had with my fellow viewers making fun of this garbage. I am thankful that I rented this as a $40 trip to the theater would have been too painful!

Do yourselves a favor and skip this unless you enjoy poking fun at poor cinema.
