I really never thought I'd say this about a Jamie Kennedy film, but this one is superb.  I admit I've never been a big fan of Kennedy (although he did make me laugh sometimes on THE JAMIE KENNEDY EXPERIMENT), but after seeing this, I have a whole new respect for him.

I related to some of the people in HECKLER, having been the victim of criticism myself.  The movie isn't just about "hecklers," but about how cruel people can be, which is a topic I've wondered about often; why are we so cruel to people we don't even know?  I question it most when a person isn't known at all, but even I've said mean things about famous people.  I guess it's because you can be more honest in terms of criticism (whether it's of a performance or just how someone looks) when you don't have to take a person's feelings into account.  It feels freer.  But that doesn't make it right.

Some of my favorite comics, actors, and others speak in this film.  Even the people I didn't know or like, though, made me listen.  I know how it feels to be hurt and criticized, and yes, you have to expect it, especially if you get into show business, but I'm glad Kennedy made this film.  Entertainers, filmmakers, comics, and actors all have feelings, too.  And some of them have great zingers to heckler's noise.

I do wish there had been more female comics (or other entertainers), but I was glad to see Maria Bamford and Jewel among the ladies who appeared.

HECKLER is one of the better ways I've spent an hour and a half, and it's nice to not wish I could get the time back after watching a film.  That happens too often these days.  I have to say, Jamie Kennedy impressed me and I'll be more open to his work in the future.
