This film has all the ingredients of a great movie - Fritz Lang directing,
Barbara Stanwyck and Paul Dauglas starring, authentic locations filmed on fishing boats and in a sardine cannery on Monterey's Cannery Row, but a real dud of a plot to hang it all on. Stanwyck returns home from New York to rekindle her unhappy love life by marrying a steady rock of a fisherman played by Paul Douglas, but she really wants the wild and daring projectionist played by Robert Ryan. After the birth of their daughter, Douglas is enraged to discover they are having an affair and she wants to leave him. Here is where a snail seemed to take over the script and write as many corny metaphors to avoid any decisive conclusion whatsover. At least they could have brought Marilyn Monroe back during the last half hour of hysterical monologues to wake me up. Couldn't Douglas stop asking "what if" and just strangled Ryan in the projection booth? The storybook ending only added to my boredom with the second half.
Marilyn Monroe does nicely in her role as a tough cannery worker fighting off her abusive fiance (Stanwyck's brother}.  Ocean waves roll in during suspenseful points in the film but nothing happens. By the way, since when did running commentary and extras on a DVD entitle a film to be better than it is?
