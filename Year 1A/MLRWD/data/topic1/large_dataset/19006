Fortunately for me, I rented this movie from the local public library, so it cost me nothing more than time. The previews of two usually decent actors in a plot that had at least the potential to match the wheels within wheels of "Matchstick Men" attracted me.

Alas, this movie hit the ground decomposing. The plot, of a plan between ex-CIA and MI-6 professionals(Julia Roberts and Clive Owen)to steal a multi-billion dollar formula for curing baldness from greedy American corporate interests and sell it to greedy European corporate interests, all the while not really trusting each other except while having sex, is lost in the midst of all of the morally deficient characters trying to prove how clever they are to one another. The dialogue between Roberts and Owen repeats itself a lot in a poor attempt at comedy, and the characters who end up outwitting this morally bankrupt couple at the end are not even explored.

Nevertheless, the movie drags on for a seemingly interminable length of time following them around the world, including a Cleveland populated by taxis with New York license plates. I ended up watching it with a morbid curiosity just to see if anything really surprising or redeeming would surface, only to sigh in relief when the end credits started rolling.

Watch this movie only if you are a person who thinks you are cleverer than everyone else or if you are seeking a cure for insomnia. You will find the latter.
