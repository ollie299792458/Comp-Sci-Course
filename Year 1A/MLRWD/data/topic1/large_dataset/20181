A film that captures the sentiments of the play exquisitely, "The Laramie Project" is another collage-like indictment of emotion by Moises Kaufman.  All of the actors give impeccable performances of a truly well-conceived and written script.  As with "Gross Indecency," in "The Laramie Project" Kaufman juxtaposes numerous dialogues and discourses one on top of the other.  It is incredibly well done, and compliments his documentary-esque writing style, providing a biting and personal critique of not only the inhabitants of Laramie, but, through the lens of Laramie as a microcosm for America as a whole, the entire society that America has constructed and turned a blind eye to that would allow such a senseless death.  The film, as the play, captures the raw, uncontrollable anguish that hasnt truly been provoked in queer cinema since "Boys Don't Cry."  A wonderful piece of art and an even more beautiful exploration of human nature, and a fitting tribute to the life of Matthew Shepard, this film is incredible.  The only true shame is that the people that NEED to learn a lesson from it will never watch it... those who do watch it are going to almost always consist of those who already agree with the sentiments it shares.  Therefore, it is preaching to the choir and isnt, in reality, an effective "tool" in the fight against homophobia and what some deem "homo-hysteria" in America.  So everyone reading this should first watch it for themselves, and after you finish wiping your eyes, invite someone else to watch it with you.
