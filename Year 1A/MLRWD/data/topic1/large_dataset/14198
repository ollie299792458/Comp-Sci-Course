THE PARTY is a walking contradiction - lightweight silliness that demands your attention. If you play it otherwise occupied, waiting for dialog to cue you to tune in, you miss a whole train of interconnected gags running through it. Word is director Blake Edwards had it planned as dialog-free - thankfully he didn't follow through; Peter Sellers' Indian inflections are such a joy to hear.

Even though I'd taped this movie, I broke down and bought the DVD, so now I can leap effortlessly from favorite scene to favorite scene - the caviar handshake, the endless apology to the host, the walking into the end of the joke, *the intercom*, the battle of the waiters, the toilet paper roll...good to have the option, even though it is better to watch one unfold into the other.

In Hyrundi V. Bakshi, Sellers created one of his most sympathetic, endearing characters ever. And the late '60s groovitude of the movies' look and feel is encapsulated in Claudine Longet - so fresh, sunny, and delicate here. Sigh.

I do have to agree with many reviewers (and this does apply to pretty much any party); when you see elephants, it's time to leave (like many wacky '60s comedies, it collapses under its own weight in the last reel). Others have wondered about the producer's daughter and the other kids with the elephant being too clean-cut to be hippies - well, obviously, they're Young Republicans!
