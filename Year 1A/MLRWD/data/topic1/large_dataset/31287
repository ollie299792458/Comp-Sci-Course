When I first obtained this movie I didn't know what to expect. Many times I saw this movie lying for rent in blockbuster, it had a catchy cover but the synopsis of the back cover never caught my attention. It wasn't until one of my friends gave away a whole bunch of 80's flicks and guess what? Risky business was there; so I went ahead and gave it a chance.

For those who are unfamiliar with the story of the movie then don't worry it's quite simple. The movie's plot revolves around the character of Joel (played by Tom Cruise) who is the ideal  son; he gets good grades, perfect attendance, top of his class, and plus he is very obedient to his parents.....until.. Both of Joel's parents decide to take a trip out of town without Joel. They leave Joel the responsibility of the house, car etc. But when Joel's friends keep pushing him to take a chance at taking risks and having a good time Joel doesn't hesitate to think twice. So up to know everything  is fun and games....until.. Joel meets a young charming prostitute named Lana (played by Rebecca de Mornay) who teaches him how to have a good time. there's a lot more story in the picture that of course is not new, it has been seen and used in many  recent teen flicks, like The Girl Next Door, Orange County, American Pie. Actually the story of this movie is very similar to that of The Girl Next Door. for example; good boy gone bad, boy meets a hot girl which he thinks is out of his league, there's a pimp involved who control's the hot girl. All of these details are reminiscent in both flicks

As well the movie has some of the most memorable scenes, along with an awesome soundtrack from Tangerine Dream... Tom Cruise's first big staring role is still worth every penny even if it's heavily dated.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5
