I have to admit, I really don't understand the negative reviews for this film, which everyone in our family found extremely funny and clever. Eddie Murphy, as usual, plays more than one role, and in this film his  performance is even more exceptional than usual as he portrays two  completely different character types without the help of prosthetics.  Commentaries by the other actors in the film and by Frank Oz all referred  to Murphy's uncanny ability to slip in and out of character at the blink of  an eye, and to his wonderful extrapolation of a character scripted to be  simple and naive.  Much of the humor in the film is subtle, based more on  the reactions of the characters to situations or comments than on any  actual dialogue or action. But the dialogue, written by Steve Martin,and  enhanced by adlibs by Murphy, is very, very clever and witty. Perhaps all  those negative reviewers just didn't get it.In general, I found the film  sweet and funny, have watched it three times already, once with a running  commentary by Oz, and have never once found it boring or unintelligent;  quite the contrary.
