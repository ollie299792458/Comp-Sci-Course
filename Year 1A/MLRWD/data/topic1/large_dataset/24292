Fete of Death
The cat woman is doomed--and, what's more, she knows it--on account of her affliction in this film noir classic.  Becuase she knows she's doomed, she becomes sexually repressed.  If for no other reasons, disregarding its sexual suppression aspects, "Cat People" is a brilliant, scary, though understated, film because of two outstanding creepy scenes.

The first occurs when the cat woman stalks another woman down a deserted, silent street in the dead of night.  The only sounds we hear are the clicking of the jeopardized woman's heels echoing through the night.  At first, the cat woman's heels, too, can be heard following the targeted woman, but then, ominously, as the cat woman becomes more and more catlike, the sound of her clacking heels disappears.  The eerie scene ends when a bus screams to a halt next to the woman as she looks upward and sees branches shaking above her head as if an animal is climbing the tree nearby.  The scene harks back to a similar scene in "The Leopard Man," another excellent film directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced by Val Lewton.

The other masterful creepy scene in "Cat People" involves the same woman as she is again stalked by the cat woman, this time as the woman swims in an indoor swimming pool in dim light, surrounded by foreboding, looming shadows as they play fitfully over the lapping water and along the gym room's walls.  Instead of the clacking heels in the aforementioned scene, we can hear only the swimming woman's forlorn paddling in the pool, echoing tinnily across the swimming-pool water around her and then off the walls into shrieking quiet.  And we can feel it in our very bones that the cat woman is preparing to attack ...
