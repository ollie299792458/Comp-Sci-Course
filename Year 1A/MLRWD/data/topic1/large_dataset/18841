Horribly written and/or horrible execution...take your pick. The scenes were to cut up and fragmented and the whole movie seemed rushed. The acting was emotionless and forced from every actor in this film. I believe a robot could have shown better emotions. The only part that was convincing was the drunk party at the neighbors house.

Then they tried to make it look like Nathan (Taylor Lautner) was crying. A high school production team could have done better on his fake tear effects (and probably the whole film for that matter.) Heck you could have easily edited in the effects with any entry level video editing program and it would have looked better.

According to Wikipedia the budget was $35million. I honestly don't know what they spent the money on because you could have rented all the cars in this movie, bought some cheap pyrotechnics, editing software, tickets to the game and train ticket, hell even bought the cameras and other tech... still not even get close to $35mil and could have made this film with money to spare. Ok sure you need a good stunt team and they did hire some A list or former A list actors... but to abuse their talent in this film is just not right.

I honestly don't know how this made it to the theaters other the fact that Taylor Lautner was in it so perhaps they were targeting the teenage girl crowd and getting some of the Twilight fans to watch. Even then I would be insulted if I saw this in the theater and was part of that demographic. This should have gone straight to DVD/BlueRay or Netflix.
