Just a quick note about Bond and Ms. Galore. Fifteen years later, I bought the hardcover books which reflected some effects of the movie, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142002046">Goldfinger (James Bond Novels)</a> in the Ian Flemming version, Pussy Galore has a romantic affection with women and it disgusted Bond.  It was good that was left out of the film at that time, because I was just 8 years young when a group of friends watched it.

While living in Chigago's "Logan Square" area, we went to the - still in its' illustrious glory - "Congress Movie Theater" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U6YA84">Photographic diagrams - Description and location of the theaters and halls of Chicago</a>. Sitting in the balcony, the movie was breathtaking and dazzeling and made me closet the special "007 Suitcase" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDVNMG">From Russia with Love (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a> for my newly purchased "33 1/3 LP" (which was lost that my basement flood), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008BL4N">Goldfinger [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>] Which sold by the concession stand.  but I played it over and over and enjoyed the picture stills from the movie. Good times!!!

Although I purchased the CD and DVD of the movie, the LP had special significance with the special sound quality from the vinyl LP and the fold-out picture review of the album cover. I haven't seen the Blu-Ray, yet, I will soon re-purchase the Blu-Ray due to the upgraded audio like DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and other features.
