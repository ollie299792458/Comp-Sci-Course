3 days ago, I saw this DVD in my friends house and he told me that he hasn't seen it it yet. That day was the last day of watching "Hamlet" in our school. We are studying Hamlet and our teachers showed it to us. 2 Years ago We also watched Othello, and I was shocked by Kenneth Branag. Hamlet made me the Fan of him. With the excitement of watching another wonderful Kenneth Branagh film, I brought it home. Next day I was alone. I closed the curtains and turned up the volume, and started the film.  I was shocked at the end. This film was more than I expected. After that I tooked my Frankenstein book, which I had never had started for 5 years, and started to read it. I discovered that it was far more different than the film. But WHO CARES??  We are not looking at the same version as the film. I look at the quality of work done and influence one me!(That I am still in the mood of film).  Some reviews, even the top 500 reviewer, made some mistakes. 1) Kenneth Branagh is not English, He is Irish. 2) The influence of the film refering to the captain Quinn is that he is in the same situation as Frankenstein. Going on the way he believes or going on the way as he can be alive. 3) Those kind of stiches were the only kind at those times. You cannot think of an aesthetic stich on the Monster. 4) How can any horror film can be suitable for children. No one should care for it.  Cast is terrific, the film is good, and the effects are well designed. I am sad because of people don't like this shocking film.  The only way you can make a comment of the film is to watch it.
