Whilst we had to wait until the next season (4) for Seinfeld to win an Emmy Season three gave us some classic episodes which should have been at least nominated, such as The Parking Garage, The Limo, The Subway and The Parking Space to name but four.  And who can forget everywhere, people at work and wherever else you went the next day reciting "These Pretzels are Making Me Thirsty" from the Alternate Side episode when it first aired.

This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of season 3 as well as the standard features which are on all other season sets, ie Yada, Yada, Yada Comentaries, In the Vault Deleted Scenes, Notes About Nothing and Inside Looks Brief Interviews.  Again we the viewers learn interesting stuff from these features such as Jason Alexander explaining during Inside Look of The Pen how he threatened to quit after George being left out of the episode. Whilst there was a lot of great information I was a bit disappointed with the commentary on The Parking Garage as it was just a couple of directors on an ego trip telling us what a great job they did, how the garage looks real and stuff like this. Surely Jerry or someone could have joined them to make it more entertaining.  Also included on Season 3 is Kramer vs Kramer where we meet Larry David's inspiration for Kramer his old neighbour Kenny Kramer.

Like all the Seinfeld seasons this is a must own for any fan of comedy.  Seinfeld is one of those shows you just watch over and over again eagerly awaiting the lines you know are coming.
