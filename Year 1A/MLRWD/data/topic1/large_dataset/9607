There are a series of Warner Brothers musicals during the early-mid 1930's with unique, spectacular musical numbers directed by Busby Berkeley.  "42nd Street" was the first in the series and probably the best, although "Footlight Parade" probably ties for 1st place as the best of the series.  Hard to believe this is nearly 80 years old, but if you are at all interested in trend-setting classic movies, then "42nd Street" is a must-see for you.  The entire cast is terrific including a young Ginger Rogers in a secondary role before she teamed up with Fred Astaire.  Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are charming as the romantic leads.  Warner Baxter as the show director on the edge of a nervous collapse is also very good.  The classic musical numbers "Shuffle Off to Buffalo", "Young and Healthy" and the climax title song are fantastic.  Busby Berkeley was a genius as a dance director known for his overhead shots down at the dancers who would perform kaleidoscopic patterns.
In this age of CG special-effects, this 1933 movie milestone is absolutely astounding. Although the Production Code was already in effect, it was largely ignored by studios like WB so there is plenty of sexual innuendo and lots of female exploitation esp. with the revealing costumes.
