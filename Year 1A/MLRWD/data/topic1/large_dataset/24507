When this movie came out there were comparisons to Kick Ass. Then it got lost in the shuffle with Super. This is not a comedy, though there are a few nice moments. This is not a movie you can put into any real category. There are real emotional moments - over the top acting by some of the peripheral players - and more than a few disjointed scenes. But it is all completely watchable thanks to Woody Harrelson. Some day people will look back on his movies and realize that he is a movie star. When he is on screen you watch. And that is why you need to see this movie. He plays the main character as a real person. There is no wink at the camera. This is a man who truly believes he is fighting the good fight. He truly believes he is going to avenge his mother's death. Harrelson's character has a great supportive friend and family to turn to but decides to keep them safe by taking on "Captain Industry" by himself.
This is not a perfect movie, but it also should not be overlooked. Just go into it knowing it is not a dark comedy. It is not perfect, but Harrelson created a character that stuck with me, and I think it will stick with many of you as well. Even the feel good ending worked for me because...well....watch and you will see why.
