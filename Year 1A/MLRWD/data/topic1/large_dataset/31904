This is one of the best documented shows by The Derek Trucks Band, and we are lucky enough that the mix and visuals are perfect, so we can watch this show from out basements. The band is in absolute top form, play incredibly, and really make a fun show that I come back to time and time again. The rythm section is tight as anything, consisting of Yonrico Scott on drums, Count M'Butu on percussion, and Todd Smallie on bass. They give every song its own individual soulful groove, and propel the soloists to the height of their abilities. Kofi Burbridge, Derek, and Mike Mattison alternate between the roles of lead and backround instruments flawlessly. Mike's vocal range is fairly incomporable, and he has a way in which he can adjust the smokiness in his voice to the material. Kofi is a genius who has mastered not only every keyboard he plays, but also the flute, and adds another really interesting layer to the group. Derek Trucks, the leader, is absolutely incredible and lets it rip.

Everyone says that Derek can play well with the slide, but needs work with his sans-slide, finger playing. They speak lies. His finger playing is just as good if not better than his slide playing. The slide gives him the ability to imitate horns and gospel singers, but once he takes the slide of, he has the technical facility and creativity to create a godly lick on the spot, execute it with his own individual flare, and make you keep coming back for more. His rythm work is nothing to laugh at, as is evidenced on For My Brother, as well as many other tracks.

Basically, get this DVD, you won't be sorry.
