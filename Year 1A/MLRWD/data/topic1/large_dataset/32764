The 20th Anniversary DVD of Platoon has not yet been released in this country, but it was released last month in England as the "Platoon: Ultimate Edition".  As I own this disc, I will review it here.  My sources tell me that the forthcoming US disc will be no different.

I will not debate the merits of the film here.  It is polarizing and you either like it or despise it.  Instead, I will focus on whether or not it is worth upgrading to this version.  In a word: YES.  The new High Def transfer is a significant improvement over the previous edition, with a lot of dirt removed digitally, and much more saturated, yet cooler colors.  This new color palette, which more heavily favors blues and greens, really suits the jungle sequences well.

But the real reason to upgraded is the utterly incredible DTS track.  The previous 5.1 mix had very little going on in the surrounds.  This one has a very aggressive surround track, which really puts you right in the middle of the war!

The two new featurettes, "One War, Many Stories" and "Preparation For The Nam" are good, but don't add a lot to what is already in the great "Tour of the Inferno" documentary and two existing audio commentaries.  I would like to point out that it appears that none of the extras from the previous special edition have been left off of this one, so there's no good reason to keep the old disc.  But at the end of the day, the new 5.1 mix is the biggest reason to buy this disc.  The other stuff is just a bonus.
