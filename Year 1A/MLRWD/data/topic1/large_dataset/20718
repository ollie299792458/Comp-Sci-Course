I have always loved this movie; I didn't quite understand it but I love to see when people can fall in love and get married and no one was more deserving than this couple,Laura(Dorothy McGuire) and Oscar(Robert Young). Laura is a plain young woman but has a pure heart of gold; She is a good natured person and most helpful when needed. Oscar is a gallant young man who was about marry another lady but goes into battle and gets wounded and disfigured, which is not great for his bethrothed but she is willing to make a go of it; His parents of course, want to be with him and he marries Laura to offset them coming there permanently. Although, she likes him shyly, after all, a girl, homely or not, has her pride and wants to know she is wanted by her husband. Nevertheless, the wedding goes off without a hitch but they find that to each other, they are beautiful young and without flaws. but to the world, it is as if the same. When his parents announce that they are coming, naturally, they are excited and all, but the housekeeper,(Mildred Nattick)is fully aware that the visit will not be pleasant. nevertheless, they are happy in each other and that is what matters. good film. I must add Herbert Marshall plays a blind pianist who becomes the couple's friend and is great medicine for them both. kudos for that.
