More than enough good things have been said about this wonderful movie. I'd just like to comment on its unbearably sharp wit again. The "Constitutional peasants" scene near the beginning is a killer, here are the first few lines of it.
Arthur: Old Woman!
Peasant: Man!
Arthur: Sorry. Man. What knight lives in that castle over there?
Peasant: I'm 37.
Arthur: What?
Peasant: I'm 37. I'm not old.
Arthur: Well, I can't just call you "man".
Peasant: You could say "Dennis".
Arthur: I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Peasant: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
Arthur: I did say "sorry" about the "old woman", but from behind, you looked...
Peasant: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior.
Arthur: Well, I am king.
Peasant: Oh, king! Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. If there is ever going to be progress...
And so on. My god, the Pythons were brilliant.
