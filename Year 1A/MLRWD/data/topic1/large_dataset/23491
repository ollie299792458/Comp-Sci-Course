When I first saw the preview for this movie I was enraged at what they had done to my childhood favorite. All my life I had wanted to se SR come to the big screen and it finally gets there and they do this to it. Now having said that, being a real SR fan and as long as the car looked mostly accurate, I gave it a chance and went to see it in the theater. Long story short, I think I stopped at 8 times. I took everyone that would go with me, to see it. The Mach 5 is really what the show was all about, nothing else matters. And as long as they created a version of the car that was at least a respectable effort, that was all I cared about. I am not a film critic. All I know is that the film moved me emotionally. But that was mainly because the characters were so dear to me. And of course, the coolest car ever created, real or otherwise. I really just got a huge kick out of seeing a real life depiction of the Mach 5, and they did alot better version that that one guy did who custom-made a couple to auction them off. I still would love to see a more accurate version of the car, I mean exactly like the original series. Critically speaking, this movie did not get a fair shake. I saw soooo many reviews for this movie from people who never actually saw it! who reviews a movie they haven't watched!!! Yes this movie is a little acid-trippish. Yes it is long. Yes it is not exactly as the original. But it's SPEED frickin' RACER, and it's on the big screen, and the car looks totally awesome! 5 STARS.
