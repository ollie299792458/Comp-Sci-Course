While this film was criticized for being overly-melodramatic, it remains an accurate portrait of the many issues surrounding the diamond trade in Africa.  The Kimberley Process may have sharply reduced the number of illicit stones reaching some markets, but people like the rebels, smugglers, and traders pictured in this movie have no trouble whatsoever turning their ill-gotten stones into cash even today.  The blood diamond trade flourishes in not only Sierra Leone but in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well--and operates much like the Revolutionary United Front ran it's diamond mine in the film.

Leonardo DiCaprio's fine performance and Djimon Hounsou's breakthrough role as the fisherman forced into slavery in the mine make the film worth seeing even without the message-laden plot.  Kagiso Kuypers also did a great turn on the screen as Hounsou's son, Dia, who is kidnapped by the RUF at the beginning of the film.  That particular subplot could have made a fine movie on its own.
