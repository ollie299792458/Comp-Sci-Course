Loved this movie and didn't even know what to expect! Great acting and some definitely recognizable actors. Decent FX. Original plot line. Even the song at the end was the icing on the cake. I was frustrated at first with the movie caption, felt like it wasn't enough detail and that is was probably another cookie cutter B movie - quite the opposite. Set in the west/mid-west - post when we were first discovering this territory, more like the old west right when we made the first indian reservations. People disappear, cowboys assume it was Indians - search party ventures out. Search party w/ a contingent of military (post civil war union soldiers). They interrogate Indians hardcore, discover a small glimpse into whats really going on and split into two groups. One chasing the real cause and the other on a witch hunt. Then things get interesting. The real story and cause of the disappearances, ties into realistic points in our history. Great suspense and a bit of well placed gore all on top of a creative plot in a genre where its become hard to find something original w/ an acceptable budget that allows you to due the story some justice, rare. Cool movie!
