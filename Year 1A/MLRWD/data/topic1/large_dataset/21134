Sometimes you just find the movie that hits every nuance of your life just right. I watched it once and it more than sort of mirrored what life was  like for me back then (I was 15 at the time).  Linkletter could so easily  have turned this film into a farce, a big blatent parody of the Seventies  that would have been humorous, perhaps, but with a bad taste in the mouth.  Instead, his direction is gentle and unassuming, and we're allowed the  experience of traveling back into time, when pot was everywhere, parents  were tolerated, and the village idiot running the corner grocery believed  that everyone was old enough to buy beer.  It's a pleasure to see Mitch  follow in Pink's footsteps, while wondering uneasily if Pink is going to  follow in Wooderson's footsteps.  It's even fun to hear everyone, girls and  guys alike, overuse the word "man", because that's just what we  all did.  I have the movie, I have both soundtracks, and I've shown it to  my older children.  Don't miss this movie.  Watch it with someone who was  from that era and can relate.
