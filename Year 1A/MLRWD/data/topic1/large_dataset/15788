The movie Best In Show is a classic in the mockumentary genre.  It is the kind of movie that one can see over and over again and still laugh and laugh.  Try not to just fall in love with the two gay guys. McKeanen and Higgins were fantastic as the couple.  Of course, there played the cliches, but still they did it so wonderfully that one did not necessarily mind that they were not breaking into any new territory.

O'Hara and Levy were just a perfect married couple.  She as a woman who is experience in the ways of adult entertaining, and he, a two left footed goof.  Ohhh not enough good things to say about them.

The only "downer" character to me was Guest.  I just did not particularly find him to be that enjoyable.  He was much better in Waiting for Guffman.

The amazing part to me about this movie is the fact that there is essentially no script.  Just an outline of how the movie is to go, and the actors and actresses take it from there.  How wonderful they do.
