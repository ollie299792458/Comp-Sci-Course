If Barns was alive his worth would be up there some 35 billion dollars only for his paintings plus more for his business. Howard Hughes opened his charity and with some 10 billion dollars his charity is doing great, making progress and doing better than even when Hughes was in control but poor Barns who hated all those other rich people and wished that only the average Joe would get the chance to see his art and learn about art ended up with his wish and will in the dump due to his trustees. Worse, his enemies who confronted him while Barns alive, ended up controlling the art. This documentary shows that human beings in majority of the time are more interested in their own interest and opinions, all for one regardless of their race, colour, origin, etc... Lincoln University trustees certainly did not do much good for their group either. Few characters in this documentary with questionable motives happen to be the charities that I hear their names on NPR all the time... A must see. Politics, greed and humanity at its highest and lowest. Bravo.
