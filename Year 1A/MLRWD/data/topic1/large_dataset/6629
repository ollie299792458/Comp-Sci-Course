It appears that there are a number of aspects about this film which is not historically accurate, inspite of the fact that the director Shekar Kapur constantly points out that this and that as seen in the film actually  happened.  For those who watch Hollywood films expecting every last detail  to be historically correct are deluding themselves.  I doubt that such a  film exists, since everything is in hindsight and re-interpreted.  That  aside it is still a remarkable film.  The visuals are absolutely stunning  -- in particular the coronation scene. Kapur, brings to life historical  personages and gives them real human personalities and not text-  book-cardboard-cutouts.  Furthermore, I appreciated Kapur's effort in  conveying all the politics, conspiracies, alliances etc that a mononarch  has to tend to in his/her daily life.  This aspect is very well illustrated  by Cate Blanchette in the scene where Elizabeth addresses parliament and  the religious leaders.
Okay, it's not 100 percent accurate, but can we  not allow the director some artistic and dramatic license?
