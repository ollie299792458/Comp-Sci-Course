First things first....Is this a Great Movie?....No....Is it at All Plausible or Believable?...No, not really...Is it Entertaining?....Hell, Yes!!....This movie is a delightful throwback to all those  Great Cheesy 70's Exploitation flicks that usually starred Charles Bronson; Little Plot, Lottsa Action!!...The movie delivers this in Spades!!....I am not familiar with John Cena;  He kinda looks like Matt Damon on Steroids;  but he makes a credible action hero;  kind of like they were trying to do with  Brian 'The Boz' Bosworth  a few years back....But it's the loopy script and a Great Over-the-Top Performance by Robert Patrick as the Head Baddie that really makes this movie Rock!!....Patrick easily steals the movie with his great swaggering performance; but, Hey; All the baddies in this are entertaining.....More so than the 'good guys'.....This 'B' Movie is Very Well shot and Directed; with GREAT ACTION SCENES THAT DELIVER; This is a Superb example of a Good No-Brainer Popcorn Action Flick....Just Don't rent or buy it expecting 'Hamlet".....
