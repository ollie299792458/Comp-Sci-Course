Regardless of what critics say this is a good film.The entire film has never been seen,and it isn't here either.There are still a few hours of cut footage somewhere.But for now this version is what is available.The production,writing,music and even the acting is far above what we are subjected to today,with most films being filmed and edited like a music video,by marginally talented people.Give this film a chance,a single entire viewing in one sitting and you'llbe won over.It is long,but there is an intermission,just like in the theater.By no means a great film,but a very good one.The only complaint I have is that after doing such a beautiful job on restoring the picture and sound,the Fox people left out the "Exit Music",which was included in all previous editions.I understand that this is being corrected for future pressings.This film is a good oportunity to see how real filmgoing was back in the 50's &amp; 60's when you had reserved seats,Huge screens,great sound and above all a quiet appreciative audience to enjoy the spectacle with.
