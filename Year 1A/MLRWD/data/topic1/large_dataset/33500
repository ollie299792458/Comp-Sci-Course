I am sometimes befuddled by Blu-Ray, there are times when a recently released movies only looks so-so and then there are movies like UNFORGIVEN. Throughout the movie Leone's film savvy can be seen in Eastwood's directing style....the movies opening scene sets a mood. We, the audience, are caught in the rain (which by the way makes you want to grab a blanket and light up the fireplace), and almost immediatly start forming opinions about the key characters including Eastwood who plays a somewhat dark character. The movie is nicely placed with a very predictable but enjoyable plot. As for the Blu-Ray aspect it is a 10 with one exception the movie is so "bright" at times the characters seem to become a part, or "get lost" in the natural shadows. Not sure if that makes sense but you will know what I mean when you watch the movie. The audio is stellar if not exciteable...you will not need surround for this one. The final gunbattle is again dark and clint seems to have no contrast to his environment. This aside this is a must own as it was an instant classic the second it was released.
