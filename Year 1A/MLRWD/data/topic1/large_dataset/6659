I have never been a large fan of TV if it didn't fall under the comedy category.  I don't like to invest much time into anything television related and I still suffer from that ailment.  Thankfully, complete seasons of televisions shows on DVD has solved my problem.

I heard lots of hoopla about Lost during it's initial airing but by the time that I was sold on the show, I had already missed 3 or 4 episodes.  I decided to wait for the DVD release because I hate not knowing all the individual storylines, which in lost accounts for plenty.  This definitely saved me tons of anticipation because each episode leaves the viewer wanting more, so I continued to watch more.  I finished the first season in about a week and am completely hooked on the show.

I won't explain the storyline of the show, I am sure it can be viewed elsewhere among these reviews, I will just say that Lost is well worth the price even if you have watched the series on ABC.

The overall image and sound quality makes the show come alive on DVD, a feature missed on TV.  Plus, there is plenty that you miss when you only view each episode once.
