I borrowed this DVD from a friend with some trepidation, being a fan of action movies for many years, cutting my teeth with the Die Hard series, Terminator series and so forth. But with the first viewing, I was pleasantly surprised. The first section before the real story is interesting, with an action sequence more akin to a music video than action movie with rapid-fire camera work and stylish choreography. Once the story gets going, the movie hits a nice stride, with the Rock doing a fine job in his various situations, switching effortlessly between disarming humor and cold-steel seriousness. The supporting characters are fine as well, being irritants to the Rock's serious mission, but somehow working well as an ensemble, and the action sequences are true action rather than wrestling-transferred-to-screen as you would think.

A couple of minor complaints, however. It's always nice to see Christopher Walken in another over-the-top performance, but his ranting seems more suitable for some other movie than this one.

Also, the aforementioned music-video style fight at the beginning stands proudly on its own, but is styled so differently from the rest of the film, it almost trips you up.

Still, very entertaining, and very different from the movie I THOUGHT it would be. Nice work, fellas!
