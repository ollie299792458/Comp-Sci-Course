This is hands down, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I liked how it kind of reunited all the characters(ben affleck, matt damon, jason lee, chris rock, shannen dohety, dante + randall, etc), and the cameos by all the stars were funny too, especially george carlin with the "will give head for ride" sign.
  Anyway, people are villifying this movie, saying it offends gays, but it really shouldnt. In this movie, silent bob was really going to (...), and in dogma, jay thinks about guys while (...), so its all just in good fun. And the
part w/ james van der beek and jason biggs about everything being gay and homophobes was funny and showed that the movie isnt trying to put anyone down. And all the gay jokes were just that-jokes. They were just supposed to be funny, and believe me they were. They were mostly said by Jay, whos just a stoner idiot, so they werent meant to be taken seriously.
  But all in all, this movie is the funniest one ive ever seen and all five of them (clerks, mallrats, chasing amy, dogma, jay + silent bob) are going to be remembered for a long time. Even if you havent seen any of them, go see this movie, because the plots arent related at all. Dont listen to all the bad reviews, this movie is hilarious and thats the bottom line.
