I already have this film in my collection. When I saw it in the video store I nearly gasped because I have not seen it in a long time. The part that always stuck with me was the scene of George C. Scotts character quitely sitting down then hearing a thumping sound coming from the staircase. When he investigate the cause of the sound. He sees a ball bouncing down the staircase hitting each step as it comes down. upon examining the ball he realizes that it's his dead daughters ball wich was put away by him after his daughters death. He picks up the ball and drives to a bridge and throws the ball in the water. When he arrives back at home he enters the door and heres the same thumping sound as before. He looks up the staircase and sees a ball bouncing down every step again. when the ball finally rests on the floor in front of him. He notices that it's the same ball that he had thrown away earlier. He backs away  with a look of disbelief. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a well told ghost story without the fancy special effects thrown in.
