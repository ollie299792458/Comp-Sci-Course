I was 6yrs old when this movie first came out. So the first time I actually saw this movie, was in 1983 when HBO was offered in my area for the first time.
Wilders character "George Caldwell" is a book editor who is traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago for his sisters wedding, aboard the "Silver Streak" where he meets a vitamin salesman Bob Sweet (Ned Beatty) and a woman named Hilly Burns, played by Jill Clayburgh who works for a historian named Professor Schreiner who's on a publicity tour for his new book about "Rembrandt" letters.

The funny parts are when Caldwell (Wilder) gets thrown off the train like 2 times. The second time when he meets a thief named Grover (Richard Pryor) after Caldwell steals a police car in an attempt to meet up with the Silver Streak to get back on it. And a 3rd time where he simply jumps off with Grover T. Muldoone (Richard Pryor) to avoid being shot. The climax of the movie is when the Silver Streak runs out of a control because of a tool box placed on the dead mans pedal. Where the train ends up is something you just have to see for yourself! This is a KEEPER if you still buy DVDs and need something that's classic comedy and suspense to your collection!
