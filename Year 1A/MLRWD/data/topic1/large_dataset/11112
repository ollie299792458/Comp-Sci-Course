John Candy & Steve Martin both star in this classic mid-1980s comedy movie. At their best, Candy and Martin were great comic personalites, at worst they made some terrible movies, thankfully both shine at their greatest in this.

John Candy's "Mess Around" scene is timeless, to this day, every time i hear that Ray Charles song, i think of that scene.

Candy, plays a annoying but overall nice businessman (the president of a shower curtain ring company!) and meets Martin at an airport (after stealing his cab!).

Martin plays a nice family man, who is trying to get home for the holidays, but he doesn't ave much patience and understandably takes this out on Candy. Throughout the movie, Candy wants to remain friends with Martin, although Martin makes it quite clear (as polite as he can) he dosent want a friendship with him.

However, and call me a softie but this is my favorite part of the movie, Martin then realises how much of an "adventure" the two have shared and decides to make friends with this annoying and sweet guy that has come into his life.

This movie is a true comedy classic!
