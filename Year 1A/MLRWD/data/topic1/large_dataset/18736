A wonderfully misunderstood film. Alex Cox (Repo Man, Straight to Hell, Sid & Nancy) directs a hilarious satire with moving performances by Ed Harris. A political response to Reagan's invasion of Nicaragua in the 1980's, Cox uses satire and stark, stunning imagery to portray America as an imperialist nation blinded by manifest destiny. Set in 1855, Harris plays a humanitarian public figure sent by a capitalist to settle Nicaragua and bring the country democracy. Similar to Napoleon of "Animal Farm," Harris eventually becomes a power hungry and merciless tyrant who betrays every principle he once stood for. Filled with countless deliberate historical inaccuracies such as cars, personal computers and issues of Newsweek magazine, and while slightly uneven at times, Cox makes very distinctive choices that leave the audience with something to talk about.
Anyone who is a fan of Alex Cox, the Marx Brothers, political satire or just plain anarchy should not miss this film. It is a MUST BUY seeing how it will probably NEVER make it to DVD and will continue to be out of print.
