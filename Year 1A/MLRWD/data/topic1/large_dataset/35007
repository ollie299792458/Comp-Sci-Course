I loved this movie.  I was one of the many that stayed away from it when it was in the theaters, despite having enjoyed "Being John Malkovich."  I had heard great reviews, but there was something about it (starring Nicolas Cage?  About The Orchid Thief?) that I wasn't buying.

At any rate, I watched it on DVD and was so glad I did.  This movie has to be the most creative adaptation of a literary work that I have ever seen, which should come as no surprise since Charlie Kaufman wrote it.  It is very clever but never precious, thank God, and the concocted story of Charlie and his ( in reality) non-existent, hack-screenwriter brother is a fantastic complement to Susan Orlean's book.  This movie is really entertaining  and accessible, while also serving as a funny critique of the mainstream pap produced by Hollywood studios.

While annoying in so many of his other films (save "Leaving Las Vegas"), Nicolas Cage is very good as both Charlie and his twin.  Meryl Streep is--no surprise--wonderful in her role as Susan Orlean.  She is so funny in this movie.  Chris Cooper is also great, as usual, and really disappears into his role as the orchid thief.

A creative, hilarious, really well-done movie.  I can't recommend it enough.
