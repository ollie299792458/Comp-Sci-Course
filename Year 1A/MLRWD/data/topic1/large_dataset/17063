I was first introduced to Thunderbirds over a 2 hour bus ride.  I initially felt a bit slighted by the movie selection.  I was about 2 seconds away from putting my headphones away and taking a long nap when it hit me out of the middle of nowhere--the theme song!  How much more brillant can you get than lyrics such as "it's cool when spaceships come out of your pool?"  My heart skipped a beat and my hands began to sweat as I fumbled to put the headset back on and continue watching this bright and brilliant film.

I promise you after seeing Thunderbirds you won't make it through the day without saying at least 20 times, "Thunderbirds are go!" or "FAB."  I feel much more culturally aware when I am able to bring my philosophical reading of Thunderbirds into intellectual conversations.

I can't wait until I have this life-changing cinematic triumph in my personnal collection along side Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda, The Pianist, and Gettysburg.  It is truly a delight.

Keep it up Jonathan Frankes, keep it up!
