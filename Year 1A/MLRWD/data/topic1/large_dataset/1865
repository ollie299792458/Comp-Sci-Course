I first saw this movie when it came out five years ago. At the time, I was stirred by its quiet, gentle beauty and moving, realistic performances. I have seen it several times since and have enjoyed it every time. "The Horse Whisperer" delivers peace into my crazed life.
The story centers on a high powered Manattan magazine editor (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and her family. Her daughter becomes involved in a very serious accident with her horse, which results in the loss of one of her legs, the death of her best friend, and severe emotional and physical injury to her beloved horse. Several months later, her mother, at her wits end with her daughter's emotional state, drives the daughter and the horse out to Montana to visit a Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), a man who can heal the most severely wounded creatures.
Of course, it is not just the horse or the daughter who need to be healed, but Scott-Thomas's character as well. However, the movie never verges on the maudlin and instead treats all of its characters and their issues with respect. The cinematography is gorgeous. Every time I see this movie, I want to get into my car and drive out to Montana.
I would recommend this movie to moviegoers who enjoy serious, modern stories. There is a strong romantic undercurrent to the story (inevitable with Redford in the lead) but it does not overwhelm the movie. I would not recommend this movie to individuals who need a lot of action or humor or adventure in their films. This film's beauty lies in subtle, quiet moments not overly dramatic scenes or heart stopping adventure.
