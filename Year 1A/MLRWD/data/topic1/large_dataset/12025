I plan on purchasing this the day it comes out.  I saw it opening day, and having seen it on stage twice, I really think the movie version is amazing.

Many of the songs were cut out for the film version, but considering the musical is almost four hours, I think it was perfectly understandable for them to cut out the songs that they did.  I found the most appealling aspect of the transformation to be the sets.  I knew that, with this being a film version, they would have the ability to move from scene to scene.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that the musical takes place on stage with few set changes.  But being able to see different rooms in different buildings and various areas of the city really made the movie enjoyable.  Also, having all but two of the original cast memebers made the film that much more impressive.  Some of the lyrics were changed, but not to a degree that made the music any less enjoyable.  It was also impressive to see some of the lyrics transformed into dialogue for this version.

I think whether you've seen the musical on stage or not, this is still a film worth seeing.  The music is incredible, the acting is awesome, and the cinematography itself is phenomenal.  Definitely check it out.
