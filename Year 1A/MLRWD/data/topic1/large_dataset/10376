In Misery, we find ourselves faced with a cat-and-mouse game that gets even the toughest tough-guys biting their fingernails. Paul Sheldon, America's best selling novelist and author of a book series entitled Misery, is on his way to drop off a new book to his literary agent.  On the way, his car fails to remain on road during a blizzard and he ends up in a heap in his now upside down car.  What d'ya know, a nice woman is walking in the middle of the blizzard and happens to find him!  Annie Wilks is actually Paul's "number one fan" and now nurse, and after she finds that Paul has killed Misery, is on a rampage to get her back.  Forcing Paul to write another Misery novel and setting fire to the story he was taking to his literay agent (due to its "vulgar language") she is beginning to make sure that Paul is remaining the "perfect" writer he has always been, and to stay in the "cockadoodie house forever!" This book is one of King's finest, and will leave your stomach in your throat.  Skip over this, and you're making a horrible "cockadoodie" mistake.
