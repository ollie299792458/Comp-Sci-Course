This film was kind of disappointing, especially since my expectations were high: an adaptation of a Woolf novel, a costume movie, gender issues...

Not everything about this film was bad. Tilda Swinton was quite good, the images were often beautiful, and the narrative was (on the surface) not too difficult to follow.

But my problem is that the film leaves so much unsaid you very quickly have no idea any more what it is about, and worse: it loses its dramatic tension. This probably has everything to do with it being an adaptation of a novel. I have not read Orlando but I know Virginia Woolf's style of writing with the long introspective passages. Maybe if you have read the novel the film makes much more sense, but now I felt like the 'knowing' glances Swinton every so often throws at the camera served to replace pages of inner monologue.

I can give much more examples of scenes so minimalistic that it becomes ridiculous (the moment Orlando finds out he has become a woman; the moment when Orlando is pregnant and walking on the battle fields of WW1), but I think my main point is clear: please directors, when you really want to adapt a difficult and literary novel to the screen, remember the people in the audience that don't know the book. There are already too many films that are barely more than a meagre summary of an incredibly good novel.
