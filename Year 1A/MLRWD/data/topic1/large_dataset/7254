I'd heard great things about this movie but honestly, I couldn't make it through the first fifteen minutes--so violent!  I'm a Veteran of two wars so you should take everything I say with a grain of salt when considering my review.  It's been my experience that others, like myself, who have personally experienced appalling violence are more sensitive to it.  In other words, those who have only ever experienced it through movies and television are more desensitized to it than I am.  I understand that constructs a paradox that is a little hard to accept, nevertheless, I've found this to be true based on my own experience.

As to the movie, I am a huge period flick fan so I thought I would 'give it a go'.  Big mistake.  I nearly lost my lunch in the opening five minutes.  I didn't finish the film (as I said before, I had to shut it off after less than fifteen minutes) so I can't comment on anything else.  I will say however, that if violence deeply bothers you as it does me, probably a good idea not to watch this film...or else have someone preview it for you so that they can tell you when to cover your eyes and plug your ears.
