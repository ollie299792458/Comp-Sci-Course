Great villians. Great character addition. Great stand alone eps. This season has it all. Spike's transformation from kooky villian into reluctant hero is the biggest highlight IMHO. But there is plenty for everyone to enjoy. Buffy's mom has an arc in this season that is at once poignant, heartbreaking, and beautiful all at once. Much like the season itself.

Glory is your villian for the season. She is a handful being a God and everything. Very well played by Clare Kramer she mixes manic tendancies with biting humor to keep the show light. Her miniature minions are always good for a laugh and never good for an original compliment for their dear leader.

Dawn is introduced here and instead of sinking the show with a useless character Dawn is used well and Michelle does a respectable job. She after all has the daunting task of joining a great cast on a one of the best shows ever.

I don't know if Season 5 is the best but it easily has the best ending of any Buffy season. The last 3 episodes are genius all well crafted and executed. I loved Season 6 but you could have easily ended the show here and not hurt the Buffy legacy.
