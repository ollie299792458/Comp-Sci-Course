I had heard good things about Gattaca but I finally rented it only after I had exhausted all other possibilities.  I shudder to think of all the flacid films I sat through when I could have been watching this excellent movie.  The cast is impressive, the story is engaging, and the music, photography and settings combine to produce an atmosphere that makes this a beautifully-crafted, visual yet cerebral film.  
Dealing as it does with eugenics, "Gattca" attempts to reach you at the cellular, nay, molecular level.  Not to put too fine a point on it, writer/director Andrew Niccol(The Truman Show) infuses the film with metaphors of reproduction and genetics, not the least of which being the title itself (refering to a fictitious government space program, "Gattaca" is nevertheless unmistakeable as an acronym for a sequence of DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine, cytosine).  There is a particularly poignant scene in which a double helix, in the guise of a spiral staircase, presents an imposing obstacle, and at various times individuals themselves become metaphors for spermatocytes (in swim races and while rushing off in a space ship to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, itself a metaphor for an oocyte).
As intelligent as it is though, the film is an artistic exposition of themes, not a scholarly dissertation on a very complex set of issues. It would be unfair therefore to complain that the film doesn't do justice to the weighty issues it presents. 
The score by Michael Nyman (The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The Piano) provides an aural texture that compliments the visuals in a remarkable way, rather like a down-to-earth "Blade Runner."  In fact, I would describe the film as part Philip K. Dick, part Aldous Huxley as in "Blade Runner cum Brave New World."  One of the best and most timely dystopian films out there.
