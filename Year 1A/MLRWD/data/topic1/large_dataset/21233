If you like the British sense of humour, politiques and its intrigues, as well as a cycical way of looking at British politics, this is the series that you will enjoy.

The Yes Minister series, starring Paul Eddington, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and Derek Fowlds, is set in the 1980's. The Minister for Administrative Affairs, the Right Honorable Jim Hacker, MP, is an ambitious minister who has real ambitions to make life for his fellow citizens better. Alas, if it weren't for his Permanent Secratary, Sir Humphrey Applegate, who usually has a different point of view on things, a bit like "a terrorist and his hostage" (although neither of them knows who is the terrorist or the hostage). Between the two chairs sits Bernard Wolley, Jim Hacker's Principal Private Secretary.

This series is state of the art comedy. It was created during the early Thatcher years to help beat the excessive power of the civil service that stalles all sorts of innovation for the purpose of "good government".

This series is still broadcasted on the BBC, so you'll be able to enjoy some free samples if you wish. Let me know if you like it :-)
