This is not a workout video. Hatha yoga is not traditionally meant to be a workout. But if you want to properly learn yoga in the privacy of your own home and have enough routines to actually feel it in the morning, this is the video for you. It's slow enough for the newbie to keep up with the poses properly - focusing on your breath and your alignment. I've participated in a variety of yoga classes and watched many videos. To me, this is the best one for anyone new to Yoga or to anyone returning to Yoga. I love the instructor's voice and the filming location is amazing. I use this every day instead of lifting weights or doing traditional muscle toning exercises. In addition to running or walking 30 minutes every day, this will definitely help you lose weight while creating definition as well as improve balance of body and mind. However, if you are looking for something more challenging, then look into Vinyasa Flow DVDs. But if you've never done yoga, this is definitely your first stop.
