I only watched this movie because I subscribe to HBO and it was free on demand.

Spoiler alert: It sucked.

The beginning shows Katherine Heigl getting ready for a date with the overused 'zoom in on woman applying lipstick' shot. Josh Duhamel, her blind date, shows up an hour late and clearly couldn't care less. They stutter through small talk, she discovers he didn't even make a reservation, he accepts a call from a woman he clearly has intimate relations with, she storms out of the car and they decide to blow the whole thing off.

Unfortunately their best friends are married to each other and name them godparents of their baby, which means that in the unlikely event of their death they are granted custody.

Guess what happens?

I won't spoil the ending, but once again I'm reminded as to why I don't watch these types of movies. Woman has successful career but lackluster love life, man has successful career and doesn't want to be tied down, meets successful career woman who makes him rethink his ways, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's just so...typical.

Maybe it would have been better if Katherine Heigl contracted some disease from Josh Duhamel and they were forced to be together because of it. Like it was so bad the government wouldn't let them leave the house and spread it to other people. But the disease turned out to be the same disease that killed the parents (oops, did I give away too much?) and the baby is the only one immune. She's like a super baby, and instead of 'Life As We Know It' it's called 'My Parents Chose These Idiots As My God Parents And Now They're Dead And The Idiots Contracted The Same Disease But I'm Immune Because I'm A Super Baby'. Now that'd be a movie I'd see.
