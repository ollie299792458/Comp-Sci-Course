A Horrible Way To Die is a mediocre horror/thriller. It follows a recovering alcoholic and her serial-killer ex-boyfriend. It was decent and may have been a 3 star flick, but it's held back by some significant technical flaws.

What did I like? There were two scenes that made me say "wow". I enjoyed the twisted ending. And the music was great, although out of place at times. Acting was good, most of the time.

What did I dislike? This movie barely has any thrills or frights to be classified as a supposed horror/thriller. It felt a bit long, even with its already short length. The storytelling also jumps around a lot, and it can leave you slightly lost. It has very annoying transitions that are always blurry for several seconds. Also, the cameraman is constantly moving; every scene has the camera bouncing and swinging for no particular reason.

Overall, it was an okay movie. I do not recommend directly paying for this movie. As of 7/12/12, A Horrible Way To Die is available on Netflix Streaming, so stream it if you really want to watch it and save your money.

This movie has nudity and sex (not clearly seen because of the cameraman), and excessive blood and gore. (most of the violence is done off screen, we see mostly the aftermath.)
