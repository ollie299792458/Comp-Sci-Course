One of the biggest box office smashes of 1999 and considered to be one of the best romantic comedies of the last TWO decades. In roles that earned Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant Golden Globe nominations, they give some of their best work to date.  Only the lazy, would be able to say Roberts is just "playing herself." Just more oridinary folks thinking that they "know" a celebrity because they read about them in a magazine and watch their movies. In fact, she's playing a character and playing each note really well. With the most radiant smile and a laugh to cherish - she is a true MOVIESTAR (a word used way too much). In this film she's vulnerable & tough, funny & sweet, selfish and selfless.  From her that moment at the dinner table as she fights for her brownie, to the moment where she proclaims her love to Grant telling him "she's just a girl standing in front of a boy..." to her anger over the invasion that one celebrity of her stature receives. It is a glorious performance. Entertainment Weekly said she should be considered for an Oscar nomination - I agree. The movie gives ROMANTIC COMEDIES a good name.
