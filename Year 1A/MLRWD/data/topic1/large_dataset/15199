I didn't see "Ghost Ship" in the movie theater; the first time I watched it was at 5:00 AM before I went to work.  I watched it completely through and almost was late; I was so intrigued I bought the DVD on the way home.  I am a fan of the supernatural, as well as history: movies, TV shows, miniseries, books.....and I wasn't disappointed.  The special features made the DVD worth buying (and it confirmed my supsicion that the boat was patterned after the doomed Andrea Doria), as were some of the principal actors. The sets were stunning, and the effect gruesome, though at times a bit over the top.
The plot is sometimes predictable, but I liked the villain who manipulates the crew by using their main character flaws against them: greed, lust, and guilt.
This movie isn't for everyone; if you're looking for completely orginal work (I will defer to my fellow reviewers since I never saw Event Horizon) or chainsaw-wielding maniacs, this is definitely not your movie. However, if you're looking for an atmospheric thriller, get ready to board "Ghost Ship".
