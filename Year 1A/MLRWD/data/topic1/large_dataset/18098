--is what Kevin Smith is!  My first introduction to Smith's films was with the (in)famous and perverse Mallrats.  When I first saw it, I thought it was hilarious and witty.  Then next I saw Clerks, another perverse yet wonderful comic adventure invloving everyday New Jersey "cats".  Most recently, I saw Chasing Amy, and I was even more impressed by his work!  With Chasing Amy, I think you get a more personal and mature view of what Kevin Smith's writing is all about.  And the common link I've enjoyed in each film is the absolute fearless attitude he has about every aspect of modern film-making.  He works on a low-budget, and it works just as good if he had millions of dollars to work with.  In each adventure, we are put into this little world respectively dubbed "askewniverse" after the name of his producing company.  It feels so personal, there is no barrier between the audience and the characters, which is what I think makes his films so successful.  And you have to feel special when you understand whats going on when they are referring to an incident at the YMCA in each of his films.  I love the little idiosyncrasies he places throughout his charming trilogy.  Anyways, pick this one up on DVD even if you have it on VHS, you won't be sorry (the commentary is great)!
