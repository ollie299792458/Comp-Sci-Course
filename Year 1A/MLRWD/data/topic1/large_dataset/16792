(1) A Bollywood love story which morphs into a political thriller (see Maria Alvarez Folgado's superb review for full details)!
(2) Beautiful cinematography which conveys a love for India and a love for Kashmir (although Poland serves as a stand-in for Kashmir).
(3) An exquisite little love song recurs throughout the film.
  I frequently fast-forward through music, but I greatly enjoyed listening to this this simple little gem of a melody.
(4) One delightful scene is the conclusion of a dance that some school girls are doing as part of a Republic Day celebration.  The dance concludes with an aerial view that shows the girls' deep saffron, white, and green costumes creating the horizontal bands of the Indian national flag.  I was momentarily distracted and puzzled by a single dancer in black (actually navy blue) who also happened to be spinning.  It was when I realized that she represented the wheel in the center of the flag, and that her wheel was literally spinning, that I spontaneously applauded my DVD player (and the choreographer and cinematographer). What a delightful visual surprise!
