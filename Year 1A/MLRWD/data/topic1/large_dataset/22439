I am enjoying this series immensely.  I was very young when this was aired, but I remember it pretty well.  Of course I remember the American introduction with Johnny Rivers's great song, "Secret Agent Man."  After watching all of the episodes, I made the point to my wife that John Drake did not kiss any of the women.  One of the lines in Rivers's song says, "Oh no, you let the wrong words slip while kissing persuasive lips."  I Googled Patrick McGoohan and found out that he put it in his contract that there would be no kissing.  He also was not interested in being James Bond because he felt it was against his religious convictions.  Perhaps he didn't want to kiss a woman other than his wife, even though it was just acting.  In any event, I really respect his views concerning those issues.  Danger Man does not suffer in the least from the absence of kissing.

The series is excellent.  I like A&E's packaging.  They are contained in a nice box.  There are eighteen, one-sided disks in the set.  The picture quality is excellent.  Great clarity!  I really enjoy old black and white British television.  It is great!  There are two color episodes in the set.

It is near impossible to pick a favorite episode.  However, there is an episode where Drake poses as a butler for a  wife-beating creep.  Drake has to keep his cool.  I love great acting, and Patrick McGoohan is outstanding in this episode.

This show has a lot of class!  If you like old British television, this series will not disappoint.
