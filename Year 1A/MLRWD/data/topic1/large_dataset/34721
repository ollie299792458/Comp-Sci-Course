The most heart-felt movie I've ever seen is a powerful mix of sharp-eye, hardhitting autobiographical remembrance of a nearly bruised childhood and a celebration of the wide-open, spontaneous and lyrical qualities of cinema  to capture pointed truths of family, school and street lives as seen  through the curiously haunted eyes of one Antoine Doinel, a modern-day  Dickensian hero in a decidedly unglamours Paris, searching, often  wrongheadly, for love and acceptance while, almost against himself,  challenging the authorial rules imposed on children growing up in  conformist post-WWII France. The film's tone is one of anguished  bittersweetness and quiet defiance, counterpointed by bursts of joyful  freedom and naughty prank playings as shared by many in their  pre-adolescenthood. Doniel's friendship with the well-off but neglected  Rene is also among the most moving portraits of childhood friendship ever.  An unforgettable portrait, a cutting social study, a New Wave classic and  Truffaut's best, but most importantly a timeless and univsersal  "true" story. And yes, the last freeze, when it comes, is a  stunner. Gosh, I just love it!  (P.S., this relatively small and quiet  masterpiece also happens to be the all-time favorite film of John Woo,  imagine!)
