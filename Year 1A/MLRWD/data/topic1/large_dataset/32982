Millions is a wonderful movie that presents a little boy's faith in God and how his faith affects others.  I watched it first without the grandkids, and while it was sweet, I thought it might be a bit over their heads.  The movie is set in Manchester England and the accents are very heavy.  I was afraid the kids would have a hard time understanding, but they caught on faster than I did.  The cinematography was unusual but seemed to contribute to the children's enjoyment. All watched the entire movie with rapt attention. (this a really saying something, because they normally don't sit still that long).  At the end they where all sitting there with mouths open in astonishment.
They are 7, 10 and 12.  All loved it and wanted to watch it two more times that weekend!  The next week they wanted to watch it again.  It is clean and full of valuable lessons.  It made real how the saints help us.  Recommended especially for Orthodox and Roman Catholic families.
Mom's should watch first because of the scary villain guy and to tiny parts that may cause concern.
