There are very few sequels that live up to the standards set by the original. Only Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back and this one are great compared to the first in the series. I would even have to say that Back To  The Future 2 is better than part 1. When Marty finds out ther's trouble for  him in the future, he, his girlfriend and Doc Brown go to 2015 to see what  their future will be like. But when Marty buys a sports almanac, Biff gets  a hold on it and when they go back to 1985, Biff rules all of Hill Valley.  So they must go back again to 1955 and then they find the almanac and burn  it.  But before they go back, Doc is struck by lightning in his car and  sent back to 1885. Now Marty must be helped by the 1955 Doc to get back- to  the future! The #1 reason why I liked this one better than the first is  because I like the graphic description of the future (which is more like  2115 than 2015), and that I would've bought that sports almanac too. What  will happen next? Will Marty go to 1885 or safely go back to 1985? Find out  in part 3!
