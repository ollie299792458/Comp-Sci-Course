This isen't a run of the mill type of thriller.  But it may be difficult to like while viewing it for the first time because there are many relevant things in the plot that are not shown in the proper time sequence.  By that I mean that there are essential plot developments missing that take place very early in the childhood of Rowan (Halle Berry).  That is the missing link to the whole story which only becomes apparent at the very end, when Rowan's journalist partner Miles talks about them and other important event that happened later.  For that reason most of the movie has this strange feeling to it that the viewers will probably feel that they are missing something.  But it all becomes clear in the end, in a very drastic and suspensful way.  It is at the end when we are finally told why certain things happened, and why people acted the way they did.
Like I wrote the movie may seem and is rather slow in its development towards explaining what is really going on, but you just have to stay with it until the end to find out what it is all about.

What really surprised me was the end to this movie, and also the many negative reviews that this DVD got.  I can't agree with those that claim that this is a bad or boring movie in anyway.  I think its rather an unusual thriller, that takes a bit of time to get into, but today's audiences are so caught up and weaned to quick action TV series that they apparently can't appreciate a good thriller anymore, even if it means staying focused on it until the end.
This is a good thriller, and especially one that just seems to get even better when seeing it again for the 2nd or even 3rd time.
