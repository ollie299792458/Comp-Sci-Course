The Tyson Documentary was excellent.  There are always two sides to every coin or story and when the public only gets the media's side...there are things not revealed.  Tyson does an exceptional job of taking the viewer on an intimate and personal journey through his life.  He reveals the good, the bad and the ugly from his youth, his rise in boxing, his relationships, jail, rape allegations, the rich life and being broke, among many other chapters in his life.  We get a close look at his kids and see the fatherly side of him.  Along with his narrative, you see clips of footage from boxing matches, interviews, etc.  The infamous ear biting of Evander Holifield is analyzed and gave me a new perspective on that fight.  If you have ever had an opinion or judged Tyson, you should watch this documentary and then discuss it at the barber shop, beauty salon or somewhere...

I also recommend Robin's book to supplement this documentary:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026IBXKA">Grace Will Lead Me Home</a>.
