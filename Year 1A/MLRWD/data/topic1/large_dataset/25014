Having read The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer and hearing the book was used in the making of the film, I was very excited to see Nord Wand and I couldn't wait for the film to be released in America. However, when I finally got the movie and the 2 hours of the film rolled by, I was disappointed.

The climbers are portrayed as competitors who hate each other and climb for glory rather than for love of climbing and love of the mountain. This is exactly the opposite of how they behave in The White Spider, which is an historically accurate account written by a man who was part of the 4-man team that climbed the Face for the first time in 1938. What was most incredible to me was how the Austrian team was shamelessly portrayed as a pair of selfish men whose lust for glory caused the tragedy of 1936, which is an outright lie that slanders two men of climbing history.

The dreary, competitive, unfriendly spirit between the climbers is the exact same mood as in The Eiger Sanction, which is a silly (but fun) Hollywood over-dramatization of alpine climbing. This is fine for a fictional piece, but for a film based on such an important event in climbing history such as this one, I would call it a travesty.

On the plus side, the technical portrayal of climbing in that period is reasonably accurate, and the film offers some visually incredible scenes high on the North Face. If you watch this movie expecting dramatization and take it as fiction, even though it is not supposed to be fiction, you will probably enjoy it. However, if you had hopes that a climbing film produced by Hollywood (or in this case its German counterpart) would finally capture the true spirit of climbing, you will be very disappointed.
