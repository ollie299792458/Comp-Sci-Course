I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person.  I understood the matrix the first time, I can follow political thrillers, I know how to work my VCR, and I didn't go see "Scoobie Doo."....so I feel pretty confident that I'm right when I say that this movie was completely unintelligible.

It's not that it wasn't interesting, in fact, it draws you in with a mass suicide right at the beginning, but it goes nowhere from there.  There are glimpses of social satire, such as the disgustingly terrible girl band that seems to make people want to kill themselves, and the fact that cell phones and internet are used to recruit people into the "Suicide Club," which is run by a five year old boy with a bad cough.  There's also lots of talk of having a "connection to yourself" which is indirectly touted as a deterrent to suicide.  I also found it significant that there was never any sincere dialogue between the characters...every one seemed very distant from one another.

Anyway, my point is, there's something there, but it never actually materialized.

Watch it if you want to laugh at incredibly unrealisic gore, or if you love asian girl bands, or if you like quasi-artistic pretentious indie films, or if you're just plain curious.  BUT, do not watch it if your looking to see a film that has a coherent plot or an intelligent script.
