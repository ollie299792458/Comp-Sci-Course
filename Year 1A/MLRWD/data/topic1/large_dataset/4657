I suppose we would have to compare this video to the 1985 production of 'King David' starring Richard Gere. There is far more action in this earlier film, which brings me to the point in this review. It must have been stymied by that wretched breed: ACCOUNTANTS! a pox on them! There was far too much in the production that smacked of cost-saving, particularly the 'Goliath' scene which rendered it incomprehensible c.f. the Bible account. Now that I have that off my chest, they have redeemed themselves by employing great actors. I particulaly liked the portrayal of Saul by Jonaththan Price. They could have added another 30 mins. or so to the 1st. part and issued it separately as 'SAUL', then a 2 part series on 'DAVID'. Jonathan's effective portrayal of a man going from greatness to madness is worth the price of the video alone. Leonard Nimoy also portrays the prophet Samuel very well as a compassionate man of God who must stick to principle, no matter how much it grieves his soul. As other reviewers have stated, too much is missed out. Overall, good acting makes up for the short-fall in detail, worth buying, get the 1985 version as well!
