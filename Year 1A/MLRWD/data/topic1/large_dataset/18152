I am so glad "X-Men" turned out as good as it did. Bryan Singer is a wonderful director and writer, and I felt he did an excellent job with it. He co-wrote the script along with Tom DeSanto. The cast is perfect for their roles, especially Hugh Jackman. There's so many big-name actors that could've been wrongly-chosen to play Wolvervine, but this Australian actor was born to play Logan. He has the look and everything down. I am so glad Fox didn't make the mistake of getting together a director and production team that would turn the film into a camp-fest, like Warner Bros. let Joel Schumacher do on the hideous "Batman &amp; Robin". 
The only complaint I had on X-Men was the editing. I read the movie tie-in novel before I saw the movie, and the movie leaves out several things I liked. For instance, the script had scenes showing when Storm and Cyclops first discover their powers. It had the Blackbird Jet appearing in the beginning when they rescue Logan and Rogue, causing it to appear twice. Also some scenes from the book I liked were filmed and then cut, and appear as deleted scenes on the DVD (I'm glad they let you view the movie with the scenes intact). Actually the only cut scenes I miss that much are when Storm is teaching the class (which only snippets of this scene made it into the final cut, being interwoven with a monologue from the Professor), and subsequently when she talks to Rogue after class ends, and the scene where Cyclops asks Logan if he will follow orders in the Ready Room, and gives Logan his uniform. I thought the "Ready Room" scene was great because it gave the two characters a scene with just them where they could become friends without any distractions. But other than that, the movie rocks. It has to be the best comic book adaption since Tim Burton's first "Batman" in 1989. The DVD release is excellent, as I mentioned, as are most Fox DVD's.
