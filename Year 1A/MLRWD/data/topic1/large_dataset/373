You are either gonna love this film or hate it, it helps if you like Lars von Triers, who has always been a director to push the limits. Even though he billed this as a horror at Cannes really its a descent into psychosis and grief, and the novel idea of gynocide, which von Triers decided to do basically to mock all his critics on the subject of him advocating misogynism.
This is nearer to an arthouse production than anything else, so if your looking for a ultra shocking violent horror film this isnt for you, this film is about human emotions and the madness it creates. Defoe is good but Gainsbourg is just brilliant. I actually put her down as one of the best performances in 2009, she is wonderfully deranged as the film catapolts into a bad nightmare.
I didnt realise there was a cut version to this film, im in UK where the only version released was the uncut, i dont really see why it was cut, its not necessary - you know when you watch a von Triers film that its always going to be controversial.
One of my fav films of the last decade and certainly one of the best films of last year - von Triers doea it again!
