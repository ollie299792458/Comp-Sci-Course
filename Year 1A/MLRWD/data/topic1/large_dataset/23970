I think it's safe to say this movie is a cult classic; my friends and I have seen it countless times.
Kevin Smith's follow-up to 1994's "Clerks" was not-so-well-recieved by the critics.
The  box-office numbers didn't treat the flick too kindly, either.
See?  The  stuff cult classics are made of.
The critics were wrong and the movie  goers must have been napping in late 1995, because this film is hysterical  from start to finish.
Buy this one, folks.  You can't go wrong with a  Kevin Smith movie.  Buy it for the commentary, buy it for the deleted  scenes (over one hour's worth), buy it for the witty dialog of Jason Lee,  buy it to laugh at Jeremy London's acting skills; but most of all, buy it  for the movie itself.
While you're at it, buy "Clerks" and  "Chasing Amy," too.  And get a copy of "Dogma" (the  best of the four) when it's released on DVD on May 2.
Remember: Kevin  Smith is the best screenwriter out there, so buy it.  You won't be sorry.
