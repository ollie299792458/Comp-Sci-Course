Why is it that I always love movies the "expert" TV movie reviewers hate, and dislike the movies the "experts" like?  I'll confess up front that I'm a fanatic Parrothead, so to me anything with Jimmy Buffett in it rates a 6 on the 1-5 scale.

After the screwing Carl Hiaasen got with the production of "Skin Tight" based on his book of the same title, I'm guessing Carl is ecstatic over this perfect rendition of his book "Hoot."  Some will be critical of Hoot because they dont believe the scenes depicted in the movie could really happen. Those doubters must only know south Florida from switching planes at the Miami Airport.

The soundtrack for Hoot, masterminded by Buffett's oldest daughter, Savannah, seemed for the most part to be perfect for the south Florida setting.  I especially liked the raggae version of Jimmy's "Floridays" from his 1986 album of the same title.

For me the best part of the movie was the ending. As a practicing wildlife biologist for more than 30 years I've often fantasized about developers being dragged away in handcuffs.  In Hoot my fantasy came close to reality.  The song to go with that part of the movie "Good Guys Win" is perfect for the setting.  Too bad the ending and the song aren't commonplace in real life.

The only thing I didn't like in the movie is the playing of the voice of Great Horned Owl (the "hoot") when the voice of Burrowing Owl (the real stars of the movie) is about 179 degrees different.  Other than that I think everyone in America should see this movie.  Maybe, just maybe, it would rekindle a sense of ownership in natural resources, and also help people realize that you cant protect the earth by recycling newspapers.
