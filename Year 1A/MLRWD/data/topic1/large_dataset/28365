These guys got it right...almost. They do a great job capturing the innocence, awkwardness, and cocky assuredness of young adolescence in a "truth of moment" sort of way. The script and cinematography are the real strengths as you feel you're catching a young director at his last moment before the world takes notice. Another fitting description, "I am a student of Terrence Malick" - the visual poetry is balanced by language vs. still photos. Nature and the human element personified. The film plays out as star-crossed lovers grapple with their past transgressions, first real love, and come face-to-face with the real culprits - themselves. Very seldom is there room in a relationship for both parties to be ultra cool and hip as we soon find out. Their relationship is affected by family and friends alike as these people feel almost hillbilly close. Shot in the hills of North Carolina, the timeless look and feel serve as a private invitation to participate in their mistakes and joys. There is a tad of the unbelievable here though. Many of the lines are a bit rich for these backwoods yahoos and goofballs. We asked to accept these folk are wise beyond their years, but the whole group of them at the same time? Doubtful. It's also obvious this tight group of crew and cast have worked together before. The cohesion that takes place is subliminal, unspoken, and understood as the initial scene immediately draws you in. David Gordon Green as a director is a heartbeat away from being offered a big, blockbuster Hollywood script. As he has a gift, let's hope young Green can resist the huge temptation and continue to tell these honest, poignant, personal, and very touching tales. A rare and wonderful project brought to life should be shared with someone you love - past, present, or future.
