Sidesplitting. Recommended, with caveats.

I finally viewed this film.  I have to say that it made me laugh harder than any film I have ever seen.  I love how Sasha Cohen is able to comically highlight certain reactionary political/social attitudes that are prevalent in our society.  The best material is when he is making this social critique.  The parts that I found unfunny are when he is abusive to those of good will ... the scene at the etiquette dinner party comes to mind.  He insults one of the women at the dinner table by saying that the two women on either side of him would both be considered attractive in his nation, but not her.  Why be mean about something so personal as a woman's appearance? It seemed just like cruelty for cruelty's sake.

The bag of "poop" that he brings to the dinner table in the same vignette is likewise not funny and in doing so, he is basically expressing contempt for all social protocols. That is boringly base, something from a Tom Green show, not really creative.

I think that Cohen should have decided what type of film he wanted to make and been consistent with his larger vision of a good-willed but incisive social critique. Michael Moore has shown that you can be very funny but still have heart.

That being said, parts of the this film are uniquely brilliant.  I enjoyed the intro segment from Borat's "hometown." It was filmed in rural Romania and the authentic setting as a backdrop to the film's absurdist humor made it absolutely sidesplittingly funny.  Also very illuminating was the rodeo audience response to his comments regarding the Iraq war; the cheering from the crowd showed a bloodthirstiness that thoughtful people should abhor. The naked fight scene between him and his producer served as a humorous foil to people's homophobia.

Cohen has talent in spades, no doubt. This could have been great, but it needed a bit more tweaking so that only those deserving of volleys would have received them.
