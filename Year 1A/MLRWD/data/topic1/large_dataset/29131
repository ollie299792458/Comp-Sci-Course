When I saw this movie on TV, the opening scene was actually the last scene of the DVD version. Who was the lady (Glenn Close) in the VIP box and what has she done to provoke such a unified response from the audience of the theatre? What followed was the retelling of her story and her infamous endeavours.

Marquise (Glenn CLose) was a stunning beauty, wicked and calculating, strong-willed and manipulating. What she called as a power of struggle between the sexes boiled down to a war for her to win all at all costs. She would rather declare victory over other women who might threaten her (or rather her vanity). People around her, played by John Malkovich,Michelle Pfeiffer, Swoozie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, Keenu Reeves, were all unknowingly her puppets. The one closest to knowing the truth (John Malkovich) was also her vehicle to carry out her vicious schemes and succumbed to her plot.

This was a tragic story because it was a lose-lose-lose situation; everyone (including Marquise) was a victum in the end. True love was not rewarded. Neither vanity and happiness went to any of them. The movie offers fine performance of the star-studded cast and detailed costumes and sets. One of a kind.
