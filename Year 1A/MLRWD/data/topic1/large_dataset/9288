I dont know why these b-movies about zombies are even made.I guess alot of people like and love them but i think the movie making for zombie movies should be left to the big film makers because some of the crap that comes out should never come to dvd as a zombie movie fan and a collector i know a good zombie flick when i see one but this movie,after buying it i was so mad i broke it in half and in the trash it went if i could talk to the people who made it i would ask them one question what the hell were you thinking trying to pass this movie off to the public i mean they had to know from the jump it was not good.I FEEL RIPPED OFF and that made me so mad that i was robbed i dont care if this piece of crap was one cent it should have stayed as a idea in the makers head and thats all i think the major motion picture studios should start makeing more zombie movies and stop sitting on there hands.Alot of people love zombie movies so give us what we want i mean zombies are every where from books to video games but the crap i can do with out.For all real zombie movie fans here is a list of top notch flicks i own and recommend.HORDE,.REC,.REC2,ZOMBI,28 DAYS LATER,28 WEEKS LATER,RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 1,2,3,QURANTINE,FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD,NIGHT OF THE CREEPS,NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD,NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD REMAKE,THE MAD,SHAUN OF THE DEAD,BOY EATS GIRL,EVIL DEAD 1,2,3,THE VANGUARD,DAWN OF THE DEAD,DAWN OF THE DEAD REMAKE,DAY OF THE DEAD,DAY OF THE DEAD REMAKE,LAND OF THE DEAD,IDLE HANDS,SEVERD,DEAD MEAT,UNDEAD,DIARY OF THE DEAD,PRINCE OF DARKNESS,SLITHER,DOG HOUSE,ZOMBIELAND,DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND,ZONE OF THE DEAD,MUTANTS,PONTYPOOL,DEAD AIR,I SELL THE DEAD,AMC'S THE WALKING DEAD,RESIDENT EVIL 1,2,3,4,DEAD RIOT,FIDO.I could go on and on these are great zombie movies so if your looking to buy a great zombie movie or movies grab these.
