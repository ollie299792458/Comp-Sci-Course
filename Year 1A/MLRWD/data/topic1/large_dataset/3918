For this DVD you will need: hand weights suiting your ability (beginners can start with no weights) and perhaps a mat if you're working out on a hard floor.

Personal Training With Jackie Xtreme Timesaver Training is a single 30 minute strength workout that kicks butt. This workout utilizes compound moves to train multiple muscle groups at one time. Following a brief warm-up you will do 60 second sets of each compound move and then move into the next move, and then of course at the end there's a brief cool down. You also have the menu option to choose just the chapters of the body parts you want to focus on.

Some of the compound moves include: curtsy with sidekick (while punching with weights), Plie squats with shoulder circles, runner's lunge with rear deltoid raise, alternating frontlungeswith tricep headbangers, and glute bridge with chest fly.

I won't mince words for those that want the cut and dry of it: I loved this workout. I enjoyed it, I was challenged, and I appreciate that I can use it to get an all-over body workout in only 30 minutes. Lately I tend towards workouts that really challenge me, this absolutely fits that bill. I whole heartedly give it 5 stars. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser and it kicked my butt.

One thing I would like to point out is that you don't have to be an advanced exerciser for this DVD. The beginner modifications they show start you with no weights and doing modified versions of the harder moves. I thought the beginner option was very well done. If you are new to strength training or working out in general you can start with the modifications then work your way up from there to the more advanced versions of the moves and heavier weights. I love a DVD that you can grow with. Seems nice that you can get more life out of it.
