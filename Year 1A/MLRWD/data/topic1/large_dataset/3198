I'm a Stiller fan - his facial expressions alone make me giggle. I believe he outdid himself with Night at the Museum, not because it's a massive blockbuster of a movie, but because my five-year-old, usually such a serious boy when at the theater, could barely keep himself from falling off his chair in laughter.

Larry, an out-of-work divorced father of one, finds himself employed as night guard at The Museum of Natural History in New York City. On his first night on the job, he discovers every exhibit comes to life at sundown. Ben Stiller goes on to play fetch with a T-Rex, gets chased by Atilla the Hun, and eventually finds himself on a wild ride to retrieve the Tablet of Akmenrah. Owen Wilson, as Jed, and Robin Williams, as President Roosevelt, are irreplaceable co-stars in this highly entertaining film.

Such great family fare this makes! It does encourage curiosity, and I'm now itching to visit this very museum the next time I'm in New York. I'm definitely anticipating the release of this DVD!
