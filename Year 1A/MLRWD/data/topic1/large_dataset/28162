I've looked over a few of the reviews of this movie on this site, and was appalled
at the misinformation given by some of these reviewers. I just watched this movie
yesterday, and I have to say that this movie was excellent. The poor reviews I
saw on this site is what compelled me to write this review, as it appaears that
these folks didn't even watch the show. Unlike most action type movies of today;
which have very little credible story line, at times poor acting, and usually
what story line it has wriiten around senseless violence with very little purpose
except to get you to fork over your money for a useless unentertaining feature;
this movie has a good story line, a good cast, violence where needed for story
line but not over done, and it moves along quickly, not boring the viewer waiting
for the action and/or story line to move on. The only real thing I can imagine
that other reviewers may not like with this movie, is the lack of gore, which
is another thing that makes this movie so good. It's well worth the aasking price
for the DVD, and I'm buying one right away. Liam Neeson did not disappoint. I've
seen him in good movies, and bad ones. This was most definitely a good one. I
highly reccommend this DVD.
