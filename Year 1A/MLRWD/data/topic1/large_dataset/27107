I loved this show.  Always looked forward to watching it back then.  I only remember a handful of episodes I got to watch, surely less than half of all that aired in its 6-year run.  I'd watch it whenever I could, but admittedly I'd moved on to something else by the time it went off in 1983.  The episodes in Season 1, I don't remember seeing any at all (ditto for Season 6 sans Larry Wilcox), but I finally got to see all except the last 3 and enjoyed them all.  Will finish this season soon and I believe I'll like the rest too as well.  One episode I particularly remember featured, if I remember right, a group of kids running around haphazardly without adult supervision in a big stationwagon, even on the freeway at one point, and this one had Robbie Rist in it (Cousin Oliver on the last season of the Brady Bunch).  However, I just learned that he must've appeared in CHiPs before because he was in one episode in this season, about something else.  He seemed as short as he was on TBB, but seemed taller in the aforementioned episode.

I forgot how funny the halting closing credits were, but hated this part cuz it meant it's over and I'd have to wait another week for the next episode, even if it's a rerun I'd already seen.  Yeah, I still hate them even on DVD, cuz they're so much fun to watch!!!  Ahh well, at least I can simply move on to the next episode til I get them all on the DVD I got in the player!  Oh, the funniest closings?  That'd be the one in episode 4 titled Moving Violation.  Seeing poor Ponch's frightened face really cracked me up.  Priceless!!!

Hopefully the rest of the series will come out, too.  Will get them all if I can!
