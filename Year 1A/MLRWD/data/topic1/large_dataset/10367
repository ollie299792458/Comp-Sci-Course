Ok, from what I have heard, the main gripe about this film, is that it could have been a TV episode.  But when it comes to being a film, I think that this movie hits it right on the mark.
The humor in it adds some bubbly fun to a film that could have been all syrup and saddness.  And unlike some sci-fi films, the humor isn't contrived and it actually makes sense.  Who doesn't get a kick out of Worf's wart or Data's ability to be a flotation device?
Another thing that made this Star Trek film great, was that it didn't center on Captain Picard, like many of the other films (and TV episodes) have a tendency to do.  You get to hear about how other people are reacting to and experiencing this latest adventure.  Yes, this film does give Patrick Stewart an ample amount of screen time, but it also allows the viewers to enjoy little quirks about the rest of the characters we have grown to love over the years.
Complaints about plot holes and such I think are reading too much into the film.  This is sci-fi, ok?  Give the writers, directors, and producers a little leg room!
Overall, I believe this to be an excellent addition to the Star Trek family of movies.  A little bit of fun, adventure, intensity, and the well placed moral at the end.  So grab some popcorn, a pillow, and your phaser shaped remote control, as Insurrection takes you boldly into a different style for this crew, and has a bunch of fun doing it.
