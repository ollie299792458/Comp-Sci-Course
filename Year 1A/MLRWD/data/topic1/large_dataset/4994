I don't think I'll say much about the movie... it's a terrific, strong drama with a memorable performance by Gregory Peck. You can read many other customer reviews which really cover the movie. Since the DVD was released today (see date of review), I'll just write a few words about it.
The movie's presentation is excellent. Contrast is good and the image is clean and crisp. Menus are anamorphic even though the movie itself is presented properly in its original full-frame aspect (1.33:1) ratio. (The opening titles are generously windowboxed to show the whole frame.) Sound is very good, with options for stereo or mono English, or mono French. Subtitles are thankfully provided, in English or Spanish. Sounds terrific so far, doesn't it? It is! But...
Where the disc falters is in its extras. Put simply, there really aren't any, at least not related to the movie. The ONLY extras are a selection of original trailers from other war films: THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, THE THIN RED LINE, TORA! TORA! TORA! and THE SAND PEBBLES. There isn't even a trailer for TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, the very movie presented on the disc! I suppose Fox didn't have anything and included those other trailers (a) to make up for it, and (b) as free promotion for their other DVDs. Well, okay, I guess I don't have a problem with that... but why is the list price ... the SAME as that of TORA! TORA! TORA! which includes a new 20-minute documentary and commentary, and THE SAND PEBBLES which also includes a commentary and some audio features? For such a bare-bones disc (and one that fewer consumers are likely to impulse-buy) I think it's a bit of a mistake to price TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH so high.
Do I think it's worth it? With the [discountedprice] certainly.  Even at list price, it's still a terrific movie that makes a nice addition to your collection. It's just a pity there couldn't be more bang for the buck.
