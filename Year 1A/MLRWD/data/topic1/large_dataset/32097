OK, I am an 18 year old who loves Disney and most things that Disney does... but for once..I HATE THIS MOVIE!!

OK! I got the first Pocahontas many years ago and I absolutely love it! It is just my favourite Disney movie "Two different worlds, one true love" And I think we must all agree that John Smith is gorgeous!

So..Pocahontas 1 has a fantastic storyline , beautifully drawn, lovely music "colours of the wind" is like my favourite Disney song. Yes and it has many unforgettable characters like Thomas. And like I said before...it was beautifully drawn, all little details of Grandmother Willow...it was just beautfiul!!

After I watched the first one..I was like "when will the second one come out?? I want to see Pocahontas and John SMITH getting back together! Because the ending is just so sad!"

Then FINALLY the second one came out and I was reading about it and JOHN ROLFE??????????? WHAT?????????????

So I was disappointed with the first 5 min of it..I am an Industrial Design Student and I have always wanted to work for Disney and just look at the pictures!! Everythings like 2D!!! It was 3D in the first one!! Badly drawn...best example - Grandma Willow..her skin is like smooth! She's an old tree!!!! And look at John Smith..he doesn't even look handsome anymore..which is disappointing. And when did he have orange hair??

No real good music like "colours of the wind" The movie wasn't funny...like everyone have said...they all changed their personality..John Smith wasn't like that!!!!!!!! They were in love! GRRR I am so angry!!! Smith and Poca. were meant to be together forever and ever!

So yes, I wish I have never watched this so I keep on thinking that they are still together in spirit like how the first one ended.

I really can't wait to finish university and apply for a job at Disney and maybe suggest a creation of Pocahontas 3!!LOL
