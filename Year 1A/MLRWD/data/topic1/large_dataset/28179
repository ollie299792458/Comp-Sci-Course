Director Emmerich of ID4 infamy has again given us an action movie that insults one's intelligence.  My fear is that younger viewers will view the British largely as proto-Nazis, the same British who sacrified a generation in WWI before we finally closed it out at the end, who virtually saved western civilization in WWII through their RAF, and are our staunchest allies today.  Here we see an incredibly vicious British officer (played convincingly actually by Isaacs) upon whom Gibson, so capable of subtler, touching acting, yet whose acting here leaps over the top, wreaks predictable vengeance.  Yes, there are shocking scenes worthy of good action adventures, but when the film depicts the burning of a church full of innocents, which never happened, the viewer must realize he has been had.  And this by a director who clearly seeks nothing but commercial cache.  And I'm certain Emmerich has earned it by now.  Richardson and most of the cast are fine.  The cinematography is almost magical, capturing the time, place, and feel of 1776 Charleston.  If only we could have seen the truth, which was horrible enough and yet at once noble, this might have been a historical epic.  As it is, it degrades our freedom winners and foes alike, and, dangerously, may be taken as the truth of the Revolutionary War.
