This is no doubt a decent workout, especially if you have had to take a LOOOOONG break from working out (in my case 5 years due to complicated pregnancy, labor, delivery, and then ankle injury).  I definitely worked up a sweat.  I had done extensive cardio dance in the past, lots of aerobics and step classes, and instructors and gym management used to try to convince me to get certified to teach.  So, even though I've had a long break, I'm certainly no stranger to aerobic dance type of workouts.  That being said, I had a difficult time following a lot of the moves.  The directions were inconsistent with sometimes being called ahead too far in advance and other times too late.  They also were not very descriptive of what was actually going to be occurring.  However, I could easily have gotten over that if the camera angles didn't keep switching.  They would show the move once, then switch to a head shot, or spin the camera around to from the instructor to others or show a shot from above.  They should have kept the camera angle consistent on the instructor until the move had been repeated several times on both sides of the body.  Also annoying was the repetitive music.  The same exact music for 5+ minutes before switching to the next style of the music, which still had the same underlying beat and was barely different at all from the previous track.

I will probably use this DVD again because it is a decent workout, but I will definitely be on the lookout ones with better instruction, camera angles, and music that isn't so repetitive.

Pro:  Decent Workout
Cons:  Inconsistent and poor instruction, repetitive music, too many changes with camera angles
