I realize that I am woefully behind in the phenomenon that was and is "Latter Days." Another rave at this point is probably pointless...but I can't help but gush over this delightful treasure! I watched the DVD three times in a row, and three days later, I'm still euphoric. I had already given up on the GL film festivals just before the film's distribution. Gay cinema had become too bleak in both quality and subject matter. I live in a part of the country where, for the remnants of our camouflaged gay community, bleak is vigorously enforced, so I don't want to pay for the privilege of watching ninety+ minutes of someone else's vision of bleak. An early review, written just after the theatrical release, made me believe that this movie was more of the same. "Latter Days" is the gift, the miracle, that I have desperately craved. Who could resist falling in love with Aaron and Christian? How could C. Jay Cox summon so much sexual chemistry, emotional power and radiant beauty on such a tight budget and break-neck shooting schedule? I want to go door-to-door, like the missionaries in the story, asking every stranger that I encounter, "Have you experienced the joy of 'Latter Days?'" I only wish I could have had an opportunity to express my gratitude to the cast and crew when the film was initially screened at the festivals. This review will have to suffice.
