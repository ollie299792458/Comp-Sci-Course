I have not seen the Blu-ray but watched the season when it aired on TV.  After the first episode, I was very worried.  Like most others, I knew it would be worse or even much worse without Michael, but Episode 1 was just plain bad, even worse than I imagined.  However, I hung in there, and after that things do pick up, as the plot really starts to develop.  Season 8 has a very good plot, just as good if not better than all the other seasons in my opinion.  It certainly is not nearly as funny as the first seven seasons (and not as good either), however, it is not nearly as bad as some people have made it out to be.  Sure, there are not any awkward Michael moments that make you cringe and close your eyes, but in their place, there is a really good plot.  There is a love story and some bonding between Jim and Dwight as the season progresses, and an overall enjoyable season.  Again, comparisons to the previous 7 seasons with Michael are inevitable, and yes, this season is not as good, but if you enjoyed the first 7, I see no reason why you should not enjoy the 8th.
