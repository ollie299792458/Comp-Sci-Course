Last year I purchased all  the DVDs in the BBC Natural History collection. When I watched them for the first time, they all performed perfectly. Today I was going to watch Wild China again; I was dismayed to discover that it would no longer load. Instead, I received a message to 'check disc'. I was dismayed even more to discover that none of the other DVDs titlles in the Natural History Collection would no longer load either. Altough none of them were dirty or damaged, I cleaned them, but it made no difference. Can anyone tell why this happened? I also have The Human Planet, and Civilization, both from BBC, and they continue to work fine, but I'm now concerned that they will stop working. I decided to stop buying BBC Blu ray DvDs until I learn what is happening here.

I would appreciate any comments about this problem. I am using a LG BD390 blu-ray player and have had no problem playing other blu- ray DVDs, only those from BBC. I realize this is an old model, but I had no problem playing them a year ago when I first purchased them.
