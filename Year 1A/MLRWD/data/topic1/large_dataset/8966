I listen to lots of music. But I rarely write reviews on music that I have listened. That's because I don't think good music can be described by words. There are two types of music I most often listen to, extremely masculine music such as heavy metal and thrash metal, and extremely feminine music with angelic female voice such as Celtic Woman. Before I bought this CD, I had watched Celtic Woman's concert titled "Believe" on PBS. It was an absolutely ravishing performance. I think they really should make a blu-ray version in addition to the DVD version. While all four performers have beautiful stage presence and incredible charisma, Chloe seems the leading type. Compared to their first concert, which was more purely singing, their recent concerts including the "Believe" concert have more performing elements, which brings more viewing pleasure. While I like all the songs in this album, I have been particularly enthralled by "A Woman's Heart". I was completely carried away by the performance of that song. I look forward to their live concert in Houston on April 16. I noticed some complaint regarding the video quality of the DVD. I feel so fortunate to have recorded every Celtic Woman concert except the first one from PBS through my Tivo device. I have burned them into disks. They have 1080p video quality.
