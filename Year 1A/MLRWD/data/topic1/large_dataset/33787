This movie is an excellent adaptation of the world-famous book. In fact, I would say it's even better, as the book was a bit long-winded in the beginning while this movie puts you into the action from the start.

Although it's in Swedish with English subtitles, it won't deter you from the story which is incredible.  Parts of the story are very violent, but the original title of the book in Sweden is "Men who Hate Women."  The protaganists - a veteren reporter and an amazing young computer hacker are two of the most unusual heroes to ever be seen on screen.

This is a thinking-man's thriller with a social commentary bite. Intelligent, well-read people are going to love it. Younger audiences who want car crashes, well . . . they'll get that here too.  The action and story are riveting.

I highly recommend this DVD. Also, there's a bonus of being able to download it immediately after purchase to watch on your computer.

Bottom line, if you've read the books, you'll love the movie. If you haven't read the books, you'll still enjoy this intelligent film.
