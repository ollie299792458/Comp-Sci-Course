One would think that comic books would be extremely easy to adapt, if the visual effects technology is up to the task.  However, the vast majority of films made from comic book sources are terrible.  It is not the fault of the comic book creators.  Many of their stories from the past 25 years (or so) have great dialouge, complex characters and memorable plots.  The comics themselves are very like movie story-boards.

And yet, film-makers all too often choose to remove the best elements of the source material and replace it with very weak content.

The first two "Batman" films are near the top of a very short list of exceptions. While the finished film was a step down from its own utterly brilliant trailer, Batman is still very watchable today.  Michael Keaton actually plays Bruce Wayne as a human being.  He is depressed, distracted and clearly troubled.  Jack Nicholson is clearly great as the Joker. He does not play the pre-accident version of the character any differently, but that is a quibble after several viewings.  The supporting cast is mostly excellent, except pointless Robert Wuhl.

Tim Burton creates a total world that enables these extreme characters to make dramatic sense.  He doesn't even nod at 'realism'.  Rather, he borrows from German Expressionism and its cousin Film Noir to create a fake world that has its own rules.  Anton Furst brings a brilliant production design to the film that has influenced every design of a comic book film since.

Even the script is pretty good.  The story is fairly faithful to the source material and the one-liners are mostly funny.  That is about all you can ask from a big summer movie.
