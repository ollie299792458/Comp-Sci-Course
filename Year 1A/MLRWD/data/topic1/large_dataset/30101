And that is all it is.  You get the Taylor and Burton being their big star selves.  You get very good supporting performances.  You get a signature big plush production from Franco Zeffirelli.  You also get a very skimpy serving of Shakespeare to go with the heaping plate of stars and stuff.  I would be surprised if I did an actual count and found half the text in the movie script.  Large sections of the primary story line and even key speeches, such as Kate's final speech about duty to husbands are hacked up or omitted.  I am not a purist or completist, still I was amazed at how much star pandering and  material production value tromped all over the play.  It does manage to be funny from time to time.  But taken as a whole this movie is for fans of Taylor, Burton, and good looking movies for their own sake.

Fortunately, one can do better, much better.

If you want to see Taming of the Shrew with great acting, great direction, broad humor, and most of what Shakespeare wrote, I recommend the Broadway Archive DVD of William Ball's San Francisco ACT production with Marc Singer.  This is the best and funniest production I have ever seen.  (Yes, it is actually funny.)  I urge you to get it while you can, there is no better.  I plug it here because I do not think it is well known and it should be.  I was overjoyed to find that this production that I saw on PBS(do not let any politicians kill PBS) before there were VCR's was not lost to the public forever.
