...I actually liked this movie. There are changes. Changes in comic book story from the original material to movies happen way too much in Hollywood for my tastes but they happen. Why movie execs can't trust the decisions made by writers in other mediums is beyond me...

Still, V shines through. I liked the beefed-up character of Evey. Natalie did a great job. Her acting was spot-on! Sometimes the visuals were amazing. Sometimes they were too Matrix for my taste. The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask. Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea. John Hurt was truly frightening as the Chancellor.

There were some things I would like to have seen from Graphic Novel. I would like to have seen the train scene in the beginning and I think it would have been better if they had kept in that a computer was basically running the government. Also, I wish they had gone into Finch's transformation at Larkhill a little more. There was more character development in the graphic novel.

Things I'd wish they'd not had in the movie: too much of a love story between V and Evey. The end seen with the Fingermen and V was too Matrix and too Crow! And too gory. Blood was on a minimum through the whole movie (and I'm complaining here because I'm squeamish - far from it) and then you get to the fight between the Fingermen and V and there's blood flying out in great splashes. It was uneven with the rest of the movie.

Overall, I liked the movie. It was solid, entertaining, and well executed. It didn't make me think as much as Allan Moore's graphic novel did. But then the day that Hollywood realizes that comic books can be great source material for more than just action/adventure movies... well, that will be a revolution!
