I had heard that this movie was pretty good prior to seeing it but never really managed to actually rent the friggin' thing.  My brother rented it the other night and I figured I'd watch it with him.

I was quite pleased with what I saw when it was over.  It is definitely a movie to be remembered.  I, myself, am a Christian and I agree completely with most of the ideas and messages in this movie.  Mainly because I know that there are people out there every day like this.  Mandy Moore's character is a perfect example of your modern Christian hypocrite.  Though I've never known anyone to be quite as drastic as hers, I still have known many who resemble her.  As far as religions are concerned this movie shouldn't be feared as apathetic or anything of that nature; if someone is offended by it, they are probably guilty of some of the same things (I myself do not really like 'religions' cuz as the 13th Apostle in Dogma stated, "people fight for it, people kill for it... its better just to have a 'good idea'.")

The movie really is a great flick.  Jena Malone (who I loved in Donnie Darko) was great; Mandy Moore was as well (there are times when it may seem she is over acting but think about it, she didn't write the lines so it is easily forgiven).  My favorite quote in this movie (and I may not get it word for word) would have to be, "Why would God create us all to be so different if he just wanted us to be the same?"

Again, a great movie.  I don't know if I would buy it (not yet at least) but if somebody bought it for me I defiantly would never be ashamed of owning it! One way or another I'm sure I'll eventually come to own it!
