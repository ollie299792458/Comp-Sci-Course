Herzog's superb direction and Kinsky's haunting performance combine to create one of the most breathtraking films I have ever seen.  The 'Wrath of God' deals not only with the tangible results of Aguirre's treacherous  insanity but also with the philosophical implications about the human  condition, and what would become of it if order was to be removed in favour  of pursuit of capital.  Kinsky plays madness like a man who knows his  subject too well and produces an excellent performance of a man driven to  self destruction by his own exaggerated sense of destiny.  The film  explores what would happen should man be removed from morality and social  constraint and Herzog nicely concludes that essentially life becomes a  struggle against nature and each other, treachery being a constant tool of  the psychotic Aguirre.  The final shots - Kinsky on his raft, alone but for  the monkeys are some of the best in cinematic history; as Aguirre rambles  on about commiting the ultimate treachery by taking Mexico from Cortes,  marrying his daughter ( deceased by this point ) and creating a 'purest  dynasty', Herzog pans the camera around him leaving the viewer with a  definate sense that he is alone but for the ambivalence of the jungle.  This film is simply a masterpiece.
