Common language philosophers talk about "operant definitions" in that something is as it operates. While on the outset I never thought of North by Northwest earth-shattering by any means, it must be one of my favorites as I have seen it more often than any other movie I can think of, barring my known favorite - Being There.

Since the movie really snuck up on me as one of my all time favorites it is hard to say just what I like about it. It is a fast paced thriller, sure, but so are many other movies that don't qualify. It is alternatively funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and has good acting and, of course, excellent directing and artful cinematography.

Maybe it's all in a nutshell. The period of Hitchcock from Rope to N by NW all have worlds I'd like to live in, despite whatever "bad" thing is going on. I would just love to be in any one of the worlds created, the coloring, the pacing, the people - I'd love to be ROT, subtracting the spies. I'd love to live in the house on the cliff side, I'd love to "ride the train" with Eva Marie Saint. Similarly I'd love to be independently wealthy and living in the penthouse in Rope, or the curious tableau created for Rear Window, or on the Riviera in To Catch a Thief.

So I get drawn in every time. To be witty and urbane and bag hot babes is paid for with some spies and more spies. Hmmmmmm....maybe it is an even trade....
