I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  Unfortunately, other viewers of this movie haven't kept a very open-mind about what they actually went to watch: a DARK COMEDY.  In order to enjoy these types of movies, a person has to find humor in satire.  This movie is a classic in my mind.  I felt like it was well put together and has terrific cinematography.  It's definately a lot of fun to watch and has a lot of memorable lines.  Edward Norton is right on with his prissy naive character and Robin Williams in brilliant in his fowl-mouthed, dark, and as usual, his insane role.  However, Katherine Keener's role was not impressive.  She seemed to drift in and out of her character and gave little to nothing to this movie. But she didn't ruin it.  It still succeeded to entertain!  With a great cast of minor roles as well: particularly Michael Rispoli as the dim-witted ex-boxer!  He was more memorable to me than Williams or Norton.  I laughed until I nearly cried.  Keep an open mind and if you enjoy satire--this film is for you!
