Okay, first, a brief synopsis: There's a woman FBI agent (Jolie) who is asked by Canadian cops to help catch a murderer who strangles his victims, bashes their faces in with a rock, then takes their identity.

While immensely predictable and underdeveloped, Taking Lives is a good sit-down-with-friends-and-popcorn thriller. It's a party flick during which your one friend, who is usually slow on the uptake, can catch on quickly and excitedly tell you, from about ten minutes in, who the killer is. Taking Lives is an excellent flick to B.S. through because you won't be lost at the end if you don't pay attention and it has a sexy, hot~n~steamy sex scene.

However, this is not a movie to watch if you want to be messed with psychologically (If you're looking for that, I'd recommend Seven, Identity, or The Butterfly Effect). Jolie's character is grossly underdeveloped (what makes her tape the pictures of bodies over her bed?) and the plotline has potential but is a little... uh, BLAH.

I gave Taking Lives 3 stars because it is not a must-see, nor should it be completely disregarded. If you're having a get-together, rent it, kick back with some munchies, and just have a good time watching it. However, don't try to take it as a serious thriller or you'll probably be greatly disappointed.
