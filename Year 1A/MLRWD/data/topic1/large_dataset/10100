This is an upgrade to 2010 humor on buddy cop film. The Mr Cool guy with endless problems doing the good or bad thing. This laid back humor is pretty much daily fare spread over more intense events in a fun script. Cops get in trouble, are laid off. Has to pay for daughters wedding. Get $. Is robbed trying to sell the perfect baseball card. Its just one set up for laughs after another. Bruce Willis can do a very powerful subtle humor and keeps it there. Tracey plays the full house of mock emotions  ingratiating - aggravated. This is real humor. Everyone is in good character form. Guillermo Diaz & de la Raguera are really perfect. Willis & Morgan have the most intensity of humor and crisp characters as do the villains. Luckily there are only 2 boring typical behaviour guys the other cop-types Pollack & Brody. They are used as straightmen. Sean Scott is sort of thrown in as extra plot and is really memorable easiest take away character from the film. Every one else does get to shine. This is not Jim Carey humor. So expect typical everyday humor and enjoy it. Very funny. Reminds me of old New York humor being unrelenting biting inside-churning humor. It looks like it made good for the studios too.
