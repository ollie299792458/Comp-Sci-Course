It seems to be a great combination of the two!

I don't think I ever saw this show on TV but since reading some of the reviews on this particular edition and the impressive cast list, I was curious to see what the fuss was about. That and the fact that I am a fan of Billy Zane and now William Sadler. I never realized that the latter actor was in so many things, such as "The Green Mile" and the "Roswell" series. I also don't think that I've ever seen Jada Pinkett Smith in anything before. I'm glad that she had a good strong character to sink her teeth into.

What WAS interesting was the way the story developed by way of verbal explanations and flashbacks. At the beginning you weren't quite sure who was the good guy or who was the bad guy but Billy Zane played his role extremely well as the wickedly, funny Collector!

Since watching this movie I was interested to see how many other "Tales from the Crypt" were available to buy on DVD. Especially with the !number of famous people which you can always find in the querky stories. Unfortunately there are only 2 that I could find. Hopefully, there will be more of them in the near future.

A great way to spend 1Â½ hours!
