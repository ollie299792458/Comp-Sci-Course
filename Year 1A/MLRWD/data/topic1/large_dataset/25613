I thought that the V was so phenomenal when it aired as my family and I watched it relentlessly in the ... 80s, was it?

Well, seeing it recently just let me know how far we've come in technology! Remember the Atari? The Nintendo ORIGINAL console? It was nostalgic to say the least.

The reason I said that the series was just `OK' was because it started off with a pasty, unrealistic special effects fight between Diana and Mike - the leader of the V and the leader of the Resistance. I had not seen the first and second miniseries in over 20 years and so I was thrown off by the shoddy special effects that were unprecedented during the time they aired. I was only thrown off because I had not seen what led up to the beginning of the series. I have watched the original series on the SciFi channel since and have become more excited about finishing the TV series once I have completed the miniseries. In short, I have not yet seen the entire TV series - I stopped the DVD after about 2 minutes of watching it. Once I have, I'll re-write this review.

For now, I'll just tell you don't buy this set unless you have watched both V - The Original TV Miniseries, and V - The Final Battle. If you do, it will be a complete and total turn off.
