I don't know why the people at Widescreen Review rated this DVD so poorly, because as far as I'm concerned this transfer is marvellous. Details and colours are extremely rich, the cinematography is astounding, the soundtrack is clear in dialogue and atmospheric in musical score. Herzog's vision is a complete masterpiece - serving as both an homage to Murnau's still-astonishing original and as a reinterpretation and reassessment of the Nosferatu myth. Kinski's performance as the Count is both terrifying and achingly sad. He gives us more insight into the barren, haunted soul of the vampyre than I have ever seen in a film of this type. Adjani, as Lucy, is a beautiful doomed heroine. Adjani is an actress who never gives less than the most powerful performance, she inhabits every character she plays, and her Lucy is a passionate, sensual woman, acutely vulnerable and intensely courageous, whose disturbing psychosexual bond with the Count serves as the undoing of both of them. She illuminates the screen. Finally, Ganz's Jonathan Harker is a revelation. For once, it is a pleasure to see a completely three dimensional interpretation of Harker's character when, in most other movies, he is relegated to little more than glorified extra status after his initial foray into Castle Dracula. 'Nosferatu The Vampyre' is a perfect example of a director and actors coming together at the top of their craft, and what they have created here is nothing less than spectacular.
