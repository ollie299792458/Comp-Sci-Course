Wow. I try not to believe reviewers, or read much before making my own decisions by viewing the movie myself. Was I ever disappointed in this one. I like movies that require a suspension of disbelief as much as I like movies evoking realism. This, however, was so sadly pedestrian that comparing M. Night Shymalan's worst (what was that ridiculous Mark Wahlberg one?) was doing Mr. Shymalan a disservice.  I had high hopes at the start - good production values, interesting first scenes, but from very early in the movie it was painfully easy to guess all the little "gotcha" moments, making Sigourney Weaver's character not so much brilliant as someone with merely average attentiveness capabilities. As we progress through the film, DeNiro's portrayal of cryptic sinisterness is decent, but nearly gives away the whole thing with one stupid line - which leads us to the first half of the big TWIST ending? The ONE question that surely would have been answered, proved or disproved some thirty years ago was evidently never even asked. The second half of the twist was predictable, but didn't have to be. The premise suggested by that little bit of last-minute-info could have made for an entirely different movie. I'd like to think DeNiro, Weaver, et al signed up expecting an entirely different caliber of film, but who's to say? Even now, as I write this, I wonder what a writer/director/producer with a bit more time and/or imagination could have done with this idea and cast. 3.99 isn't much, but too much for this.
