I grew up watching this film. It was my dad that bought it from America, and it is one of the best films that I've ever watched!! Robin reminds me of my dad in the sense that he would do exactly what he did just to be with us and much more. He was so funny!! He was also a great cook, among other things. I see that Robin's character is their father, mother, hero, ideal man, and best friend, which reminds me of my dad. He's so incredible!! Unfortunately, he doesn't end up being with his wife, but these things happen sometimes. I love how his gay brother and his lover try to find him the perfect mask for the job. The songs they sing are amazing, and they fit the occasion. It's a film with some ups and down like life itself. It's family-oriented, too. I don't know how Robin managed to switch from being a man to being a woman so easily. His voice matched both occasions nicely. They really do remind me of my wonderful family. Great story, great actors, and great acting so I highly recommend this film to everyone!!
