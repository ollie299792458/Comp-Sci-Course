synopsis  of - dances with wolves -  (and then comparison with - the last samurai-starring tom cruise)

costner plays a military officer
encounters  another race (indians)
a little friction at first...
then he learns their language and culture
comes to prefer it over his own.
falls in love with a white woman
who was raised from childhood as
as indian.  (her white family being
slaughtered by indians)
eventually, costner fights against
his own people,  who are portrayed as
stupid and evil.
in the end  he and his wife  (the white
woman)  ride off  to spend their lives
together living as  (white)indians.

now,  for --the last samurai--

mr cruise  plays a military officer
encounters  a different race, (japanese)
a little friction at first...
then learns their language and culture
comes to prefer it over his own
eventually  fights against his own people.

hmmm, could these 2 films  be anti-white?
decide for yourself,  but do expect more
of the same formula in the future!!
