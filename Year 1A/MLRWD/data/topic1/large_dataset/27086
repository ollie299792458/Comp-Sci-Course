David Bowie at the height of his popularity and some may argue beyond the peak of his creativity, musically had begun to turn his attention to other projects.

 In order to understand the metaphor represented here , one must understand Bowie's state of well being. Burned out after Ziggy , Introspective and retrospective become inter-twined. The resultant psychosis is manifest here in The Man Who Fell To Earth.

 Imagine a rock star having both opportunity and the means to explore his own projects and so highly thought of that no-one dare say no to you , but all you really craved through your exploration was to be understood.

 People's misgivings and misunderstandings about this movie are a reflection of the criticism that Bowie in his drug fuelled career had endured to this point. Its surely no suprise then that this movie confuses, suprises , amazes and revulses us. I think the director and Bowie convey this perfectly.The compulsive obsessive behaviour , the need to repeat a formula of success and the reliance upon a substance that will keep him sane and give him perspective. All conveyed admirably here.

  Bowie is not the worlds best actor , this is maybe not the best picture ever made , but what we see are a glimpse into the mind of a Musical Genius exploring a side of him that could not be conveyed within the medium of audio alone.

 This movie is of its time and those that are aware know what DB writes of "Time" , unfortunately I cannot convey those lyrics here , but would suggest you consult Mr Bowies excellent CD back catalogue if you need a reference to them.

 The only other criticism that I can make is that it could have been done with a little less self indugence. The pace may not be to everyones taste either , but is certainly no different to that of Lucas' THX-1138 in that regard.
