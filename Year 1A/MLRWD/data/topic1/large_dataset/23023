These video's are truly excellent. There is NOT one bad clip. My favourite ones are:

 'Human Behaviour'

which is by far the weirdest and funniest clip I've ever seen

'Army of Me'

Bjork plays a terrorist in this clpi and blows up a museam with a bomb. She also goes to the dentist, and a gorilla is the dentist there which is quite odd.

'It's Oh So Quiet'

This is simply a playful clip which has won numerous awards. It is full of energy when it is time for a chorus!

'Possibly Maybe'

Even though I don't like the song very much, this clip is very girly and filled with bright colours and 'pretty' Bjork.

'Bachelorette'

This is about a time where Bjork finds a book buried in the ground which strats writeing itself. It is very fascinating and you will have to watch it to find out why (sorry, I can't explain)

'Pagan Poetry'

Another odd clip, where Bjork exposes her breasts.

But, as I said before, all of the clips are quite good, and this DVD prooves that Bjork really is a video artist.
