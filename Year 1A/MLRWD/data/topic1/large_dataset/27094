I love Lucky Star and I'm glad to see the series finally available for a reasonable price, but this set, like many other anime box sets, falls victim to the problem of cheap packing and poor quality control. The 6 discs are placed in the case in a stacking format, so 2 dvds are positioned on top of each other. This method leaves the discs very loosely fitted in the case, which practically GUARANTEES one or more of your discs will end up loose by the time you get ahold of it, and thus, the discs WILL be scratched and won't work. As a result, my disc 2 was scratched and doesn't play episode 8 at all.

So here's a suggestion. if you buy this in a store, open it when you get to your car and make damn sure none of the discs are loose, and if you order it through amazon, well, then you just will have to accept that you're going to get scratched discs, because UPS deliverymen don't give a damn about the packages they are transporting.

But you know what? This could all be avoided if the company would do the right thing, and spend a few extra dollars to make a box set that is worth the price you pay for. I'm not asking for some limited edition fancy thing, I'm just asking for, you know, the case to do what it's SUPPOSED TO DO : keep the DVDs inside and secure.
