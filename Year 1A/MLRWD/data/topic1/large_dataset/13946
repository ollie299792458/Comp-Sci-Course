If you are a Trek fan, yeah, this is a brilliant movie, I have seen it fifty times and I never get tired of it. It has a compelling plot, first rate acting a brilliant script and it marked the triumphant directorial return of ST II: WOK's Nicholas Meyer. That however is not the reason I am writing this review. While I would certainly reccomend renting this DVD to experience the movie itself in the widescreen format with the improved picture and sound quality, I would like to warn you not to waste the money buying it. This current DVD does not have a the usual special features that are standard in the DVD versions of other movies. The studio has put out the Director's Edition DVD sets for the first three Star Trek movies, with the fourth due out in early March. These are double disc sets, with numerous tracks of audio commentary, as well as written commentary(bottom of tv screen) optional French dubbing and/or subtitles (Why no Spanish, I don't know) as well as a load of interesting special features on the other disc. The only problem is that they were released months apart from one another. Bearing that in mind, the director's edition of this won't likely be out until the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Nontheless, it will make the one available here obselete. To sum it up, rent this to enjoy the movie, but wait for the special edition before purchasing it, it will be worth the wait.
