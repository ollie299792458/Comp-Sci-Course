This minor Disney effort shamelessly bowdlerizes Greek mythology, but retains just enough pagan darkness to give the little ones serious nightmares.

_Hercules_ contains several spectacular animated set pieces, excellent comedy writing, and two remarkably engaging supporting characters.  The down-on-her-luck Megara may be the best Disney romantic heroine ever, and Hades (memorably voiced by James Woods) is a classic comic villain.  But Hercules himself is just not interesting, and his "family problems" seem more appropriate for an after-school special than a full-blown animated spectacular.

Character design tends to eschew the standard Disney roundness for flat, pointed, angular shapes.  I enjoyed the stylized approach, although it may alienate viewers looking for a more traditional style.  On the whole, not bad -- but not a masterpiece either.

By the way, if I were Megara, I'd consider staying as far away from Hercules as possible.  In the original Greek myths, Hercules marries Megara -- but when the goddess Hera drives him to madness, he promptly kills the wife and kids.  I guess some people just can't win for losing ....
