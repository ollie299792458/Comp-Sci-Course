Not a bad update of Shakespeare's classic work of jealousy and deceit.  The setting has been modernized from the Venetian army to the world of basketball at a North Carolina prep school.  When Hugo (Iago) becomes jealous of the accomplishments of Odin (Othello) he devises a trap to bring him down by having his girlfriend, Desi (Desdemona) break up with him.  Hugo weaves an all-too-intricate plan that becomes increasingly complicated as time  passes and stages of the scheme do no progress accordingly.  As this is of course a tragedy, the lives of everyone involved is either ended or horribly altered.
The acting is superb on the parts of Julia Stiles (Desi), Mekhi Phifer (Odin) and Josh Hartnett (Iago).  An appearance of Martin Sheen as the basketball coach and father of Hugo was pleasantly surprising.  The experience of this seasoned actor was evident in this production that was otherwise lacking in acting talent.  Sadly, the rest of the cast left something to be desired.  Even with the surprise appearance of Rain Phoenix, the younger sister of River, the supporting cast simply did not pull their weight.
Why 4 Stars?:  All things considered, this film is one of the few that is worth seeing in the theatre, though I would recommend a discount matinee as the full-price ticket is a little unwarranted.  The updated setting works well to have something tying these characters together (something Shakespeare was missing).  While the main cast turned out adequate performances their supporting cast needed some more work.
