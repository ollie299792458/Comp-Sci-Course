I love this movie and probably have watched it over 5 times! The story is about three girls from Riverdale who dream of becoming rock stars. And when they finally get their chance and make their way to success, they also accidentally discover some surprising facts behind it all. I think the main reason I enjoyed this movie was that it contains so many cool rock music and some great scenes, like in the film they reveal the secrets why so many rock stars die in plane accidents or end up breaking up etc, which is perfectly combined with the storyline and I think was really great! Also, they did a very good job on the songs too, all of them rock! So after the movie you might want to get yourself a soundtrack as soon as possible. Most importantly, if you like the movie, you definitely can't miss the DVD. Not only the movie itself, the DVD also includes great special features like 'Behind the Scenes', the commentary &amp; great music videos for 3 songs played in the movie. I highly recommend this one to anyone who fancy pop rock music and teen movies! You'll sure love it!
