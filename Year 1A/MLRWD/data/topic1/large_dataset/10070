This is pretty bad movie. The first scene where the spoof "The Exorcist" is admittedly extremely funny, if you enjoyed the original "Scary Movie". However it all goes downhill from there, with a weak, disjointed plot and [bad] jokes. Also the movie was extremely short, I was out of the theatre an hour and a half after the showtime, and that's including 4 or 5 trailers and a couple of ads. However, the movie's shortness is more merciful than anything.
The plot, such as it is, has the same cast from "Scary Movie" staying at a haunted house over a weekend. This is all set up by Tim Curry, playing an evil college professor whose motives are not really explained. Suffice it to say that some spooky things happen and there are parodies of The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal, The Haunting and Charlie's Angels, among others. The plot is much more disjointed than "Scary Movie", which is, in and of itself, kind of scary.

I'm writing this as someone who really enjoyed "Scary Movie" and who was very disappointed seeing "Scary Movie 2" on opening night. Don't bother seeing this in the theatre. If you enjoyed "Scary Movie", you might like renting it for a few scenes, but the laughs are few and far between. 2 stars is a fair rating, it's very weak, but there are a few good laughs.
