When I found out that a "remake/reboot" was in production, I was pissed. Colin Farrell? And why would they ruin the cult classic that starred Arnold? There are plenty of Philip K.Dick's stories that have not been put to film, (Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Paycheck, Screamers and the impossible to watch "Next" (Nicholas Cage) based on "The Golden Man", have been done) that every fan would like to see something else besides another "Total Recall"(based on Dick's short story, "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale") film. BUT...
It did not disappoint. Len Wiseman directed a good popcorn flick here, paying special attention to great chases and amazing effects in a "Blade Runner" (based on Dick's "Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?") type future. The cast did a nice job, Farrell (Minority Report) played a good Quaid, and Beckinsale (Underworld) plays the crazed wife particularly well as Lori. Wish there was more of Bryan Cranston (who plays Cohagen.)

There are a few great things in this movie, especially for those interested in DOP (Director of Photography.) The wide shot from left to right as Lori and Cole race along the rooftops, the mirrored elevator scene was well done. Cool weapons and technology; in fashion is the implanted hand phone, face holograms, and the awesome bullet cameras.
I thought the idea of the elevator "The Fall" was a pretty cool idea, an immense shaft that travels through the earth and the anti-gravity scenes were nifty and well done.

As a fan of sci-fi genre and Philip K.Dick (author) It's nice to see his works on the screen. Yet, like I said, this is the second Recall film, PKD fans want "Ubik", "Man In The High Castle" and "Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said."

All in all, I was skeptical and came out impressed.
