Finally, the wait is over.  The movie that Film Threat.com calls the "Citizen Kane of Underground movies" is coming to DVD.  No longer will you have to watch your worn-out illicit VHS copy given to you by a friend of a friend.

For the uninitiated, Forbidden Zone may be one of the most surreal and rock and roll movies ever made.  The plot involves a house inhabited by the Hercules family who discover a doorway that is a portal the Sixth Dimension.  Lording over the alternate-reality is King Fausto and his Queen , who's marital problems are worsened when Fausto sets his eye on wooing Frenchy Hercules a sexy girl who has accidentally come across the Forbidden Zone.

The aesthetics of the film are that of a Betty Boop short on acid.  Shot in black and white, all of the arty sets are made of cardboard.  The acting is cartoonishly stylized, with many of the older actors playing younger child-like characters.  Danny Elfman scores Forbidden Zone with the same frantic tenacity that he has exhibited throughout his entire career.  Also featured are musical numbers lip-synched to songs Danny has found from the bottom of the barrel of the thirties hot jazz era that is such an inspiration for the film.

I can't say that Forbidden Zone is for everyone.  It's bizarre narrative needs to be watched a few times to truly be followed.  It contains enough playfully tasteless jokes in it to offend almost everyone.  However one cannot deny its uniqueness and individuality.  For a truly creative, weird and unforgettable cinematic experience nothing surpasses Forbidden Zone.
