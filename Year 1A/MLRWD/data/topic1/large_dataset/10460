back in the day (1980's)thewre was a swamp of teeny bopper  flicks like ferris bueler,breakfast club and the rest of the brat packs bs. thus it was refreshing to  have seen a cop thriller sleeper like LA. although this movie has beeen compared to the miami vice series, it surpasses vice on the fact that it had a different plotline (no high fashioned cops chasing after your stereotypical hispanic drug dealer)regarding a counterfiet artist along with a few twists and turns and not to mention the near ending. you get to see everything that miami vice can NEVER show due to fcc's rules and regulations.  the soundtrack from wang chung easily rivaled jan hammer's stuff on VICE. as for the bonusus, you get to see the alternate ending which made sense why freidkin left it on the cutting room floor. (it was  a bit too comtemporaly, although a more "happier ending") and one deleted scene which i did not care for. but the retrospective MAKING OF feature was cool to watch. thanks  to MGM's special edition line. (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK,HOWLING,FOG,TERMINATOR and hopefully soon ROBOCOP)
