Step one. Forget Land of the Dead. Terrible movie, and it could potentially turn you away from this film.

Step two. Read the following:

  Diary of the Dead is not a film about zombies. It could've been anything, honestly. A plague of rabid weasels, giant vultures, etc etc. The zombies ARE in the movie, but they serve mostly as a catalyst for human beings to react as they typically do, which is strangely and sometimes savagely.
  The film is portrayed as a final product of a group's experiences with the "end of all things". It reflects primarily on our current oversaturation with news, and how if we didn't see the clips on youtube, didn't see it on CNN or Fox News, it simply didn't happen.
  The film approaches another aspect of modern life, and that is how we numb ourselves to tragedy. We want to see it, but we aren't moved by it. This is especially true for many in light of what's going on in Iraq and even Myanmar.
  It also deals with how a personal quest for documenting everything can result ina  detachment from reality. It wasn't until after watching the movie that I realized the cameraman did what he did because it was a coping mechanism. There's also a very good scene near the end where it truly becomes apparent that the lines between reality and film have been blurred a bit.

Step three: Prepare to be frightened.

  This is still a horror movie, folks, and there are plenty of scary and particularly bloody sequences that occur. The anticipation is far more frightening than the actual events, and Romero does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat.

I highly recommend this movie to horror fans, and those who like to be forced to think while watching. You can't avoid it. Something will be said in the movie, or done, that will make you reflect on how things really are. It's a Romero trademark.

Thank you, George Romero. I can now forgive you for your past transgressions.
