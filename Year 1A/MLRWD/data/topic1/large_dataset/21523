The movie is a classic, just a bad one. It's been a while since I've seen it, but the other reviews really helped jog my memory. The movie was  shallow and contrived. The main character of a movie should be liked by the audience, but Holly failed to catch my attention or respect. Her unhappiness and lack of self confidence is no excuse for her selfishness. I might have given this move a 3 star if not for the hype. The over the top praise this movie has recieved is unbelievable! I can't help being disappointed in the people who gave it a 5 star. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but still. I agree with a reviewer who wrote that Breakfast at Tiffany's is so beloved because Audrey Hepburn is in it and because the movie is in color. It's pretty irritating that some people would judge a movie by it's actors and CGI, color, cinematography, etc. Shouldn't the story have some kind of plot or lesson? I guess that I'm just the type of person who likes a movie with a purpose. I don't need symbolism, just some kind of goal in mind. Maybe I need to learn how to enjoy a movie for what it is instead of analyzing everything. Actually, I'm not even sure why I watched it in the first place. Curiosity, I guess, and I felt that I should since I like watching classics. It really wasn't a terrible movie, just disappointing. And also, like another reviewer said, it felt like the beginning of Hollywood's apathetic or "whatever-floats-your-boat" phase.
