Hostel Part II is an incredibly courageous - almost ballsy - sequel to an already intrepid genre film, Eli Roth's Hostel. The mystery and suspense are inevitably low since the tricks of the Elite Hunting organization were revealed in the first film. Nonetheless, this does not detract from the movie's ability to captivate and entertain. Roth no longer needs to keep his audience guessing, and this might be the exact reason why the movie can go as far as it does. This time, Roth is playfully daring his viewers to keep their eyes on the screen as some serious torture and gore-shedding take place. Genre fans will be thrilled and, needless to say, glued to their seats. It has been a long time since a sequel so successfully fixed the occasional flaws of its prequel while pushing its basic themes to extreme greatness. As usual with Roth films, almost every scene in Hostel Part II is tinted with (extremely) dark, sardonic comedy. Also thrown in are some instances of social commentary, most memorably when billionaires around the world attempt to outbid each other on a highly unusual auction, illustrating the dangers of money, technology, and greed.
Hostel Part II is a great horror film, orchestrated by a filmmaker who is not afraid to go to savagely dark places. Roth's passion for the genre and encyclopedic knowledge of previous horror movies serve to take this sequel to the next level.
Required viewing for genre enthusiasts - and don't purchase anything but the unrated director's cut.
