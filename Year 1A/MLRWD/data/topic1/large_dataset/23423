When I first saw "Hur" at a movie theater when I was a young, rambunctious college student the flick was cut down by an hour and I was, ahm, under the influence of a controlled plant.  I recall not liking the film very much: the acting seemed hammy and the hiarcuts to 1950s.

Since then, however, I have grown older, and laughing tobacco is a distant memory.  I've also seen "Ben Hur" in its complete glory, and must say I like it a lot better.  The haircuts seem fine, the acting is excellent throughout.  And the production values, well, they haven't aged a bit.

The Collector's Edition has the '59 widescreen version in pristine condition, the '25 version, clips from the '07 version, two lengthy documentaries about the making of the '59 version and the whole history of "Hur" from the Lew Wallcace novel -- written in the 1880s -- through the monumental stage production and the monumental '25 film. There are newsreels, clips from the 1960 Acadmy Ward ceremony, trailers, and screen tests.

* Interesting points:  The MGM version from the '20s cost $4 million (although this seems high to me), and the '59 incarnation cost $15 million.  Both of these figures would make the productions record-breakers in terms of costs for their time periods. *

The chariot race is the action high point in both films (duh), but what I find interesting is that filming accidents during both races end up on screen and serve to heighten the race.  In '59, it was Joe Canuck flipping out of Heston's chariot when it jumps over the wreckage; in '25, it was a massive crash of chariots on a turn.  The pile up of horses and vehicles goes on and on, you can see an A.D. trying to wave drivers off (to no avail) but in both accidents the footage was just to good NOT to use.

All in all a good package, if you're in the mood.
