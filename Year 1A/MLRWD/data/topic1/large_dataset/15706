I have read all the books and enjoyed them very much.  I was anxious to see the movie.  It wasn't horrible, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Here is a list of some of the things I didn't care for:

- Percy was older than he was in the book, so where does that leave him to go as the series continues?
- Barely any mention of Kronos, who is the actual antagonist of the series
- The whole St. Louis scene was left out, moved to Nashville.  Having Percy control the Mississippi River rather than water out of drinking fountains would have been so much better.
- Medusa was so UGLY she turned people to stone when they looked at her.  In the movie she was awfully pretty with the exception of her hair.
- The movie lacked the banter, insults and sarcasm that made the book so much fun. The movie was almost too serious.
- Aries, Aphrodite and Hermes were left out altogether.  \
- Percy's sword was just a sword where as in the book it was almost a living entity with a name.  It was explained that no matter what happened to it, the sword would reappear in his pocket when he needed it.
- There was no connection between Annabeth and Luke as there was in the book.  This connection also plays an important part in the rest of the series.

But I said the movie wasn't horrible and here is what I liked:

- The guy playing Percy, although too old, did a good job.
- Grover was great.
- Most of the mythical creatures were very well done and the explanations for them were also good.
- Most of the fight scenes were very exciting
- The gods were portrayed well and of course they have the obligatory British accents.

My son, who has not read the books, enjoyed it and had no trouble following the story line.  My daughter, who is 6, enjoyed it as well and wasn't scared of any of the creatures or monsters.  The soundtrack was good.
