I received this movie as part of the Amazon Vine Program.

Let me say first ...... if you LOVED the movie Pulp Fiction, you will love this movie.  If you didn't, don't bother here.  This is a very dark, quirky, "make you think movie".... it is extremely unique and very intense.  The darker material will be lost on many people, but for those of you who want dark and thought provoking stories, this is for you.  What makes this movie work is that it goes places that few filmmakers will go and it addresses honest material that to some may be too uncomfortable.  This is definitely worth seeing if you want something outside a traditional film format.

I am amazed that so many really great Actors signed up for this movie, which is a sign that it is more for an Artist, not the moralist.  The situations in the film are deeply psychological in their format, and if you do not have a framework to understand that, then don't get this movie.

Why did I give it 5 stars?  Well, I could not turn my eyes away from it.  The acting is great, the direction was well done.  There are basically 5 different stories in this movie.  Yes, some of the stories were better than others, but overall the acting and direction in each of them was very well done.

I will say again, this is a dark movie.  Not for everyone.  It is a movie for an Artist.  Not a moralist.
