This is a WONDERFUL movie...!! I remember this movie from my childhood. The watching of this movie was as much a part of our family traditions as was trimming the tree or waiting in our jammies (anxiously in bed), for Santa.
Ms. Rock has given us a tender (and sometimes bitter), look into a "yester-year" Christmas..one that was real, alive, simple and without all of the high-tech trappings of today.
It was a wish of mine that someday I would be able to watch this wonderful movie again and was THRILLED when I was able to purchase it...by the way, two other movies were released as well 1. The Holiday Treasure (purchased from Critic's Choice Video) 2. The Easter Promise (Look For Used Copies At Auction Sites Or You Can Try Critic's Choice Videos. The Holiday Treasure was originally named The Thanksgiving Treasure when it aired on television..this was Ms. Rock's title for the Thanksgiving offering. Another wonderful addition to the life of Addie (Gail Rock), Mills is a sweet offering titled Addie Mills And The King Of Hearts...This has never been released for consumer purchase....I wish it was!!
These stories are so warm and real....I am collecting the videos, the first-issue hardcovers and paperbacks of as many of the titles as I can find...I suggest that you do the same!!
Wonderful material for the entire family!! THANK YOU GAIL ROCK! WE LOVE YOU...AND ADDIE!!
