I wonder how David Lynch's mother felt when she saw this story pour out of her darling son's mind.  If she's anything like David himself, I'm sure she was extremely proud.  Lynch made one of the best films of the 1980s when he completed Blue Velvet.  This is one of those movies that is so powerful and visually stunning that you can't help but involve yourself with it's sick and strangely motivated characters.  When watching this you will cringe, you will grind your teeth, and you will find yourself with a disturbed look on your face...and Lynch wouldn't want it any other way.
  This film is a fusion of neo-noir style, art-house poetry, heart-stopping suspense, and sadistic erotica.  It's not for all tastes, but should be viewed by anyone who's willing to give up two hours and think for a little while.  What does Lynch have to say about society today?  Not much that is positive, let me tell you.  But he doesn't shove it in your face, he lets the viewer determine how he feels through examining the actions of the characters caught in the web of criminal activity and violent sexuality that the film offers.  You may not be smiling after watching this movie, but I do promise you two things: 1) You will NEVER forget the movie  2) You will have nightmares in which Dennis Hopper stars as an antagonist.  His role is so startling and demanding that you may find yourself staring at him in awe.  To prepare yourself for Blue Velvet, try viewing the gentler Lynch opus The Elephant Man, or the original cult classic, Eraserhead.  Small town America was never so terrifying...
