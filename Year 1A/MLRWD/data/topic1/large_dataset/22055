I don't know why there are so many negative or mixed reviews about this movie. I can only assume that fans of Jim Carrey expected him to be over the top (like he was in the Mask and Ace Venture), and those that didn't like those movies (this is the category that I fall into), assumed that he would be over the top so they dismissed this movie sight unseen. Jim Carrey fans STAY AWAY as you will probubly be disappointed in this movie. Non-Jim Carrey fans "Please, Please, Please" go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. Forget Jim Carrey, think of a young Tom Hanks, or dare I suggest a young Jimmy Stewart. If you do not know anything about this movie think "It's a Wonderful Life" or any other Frank Capra film. This is an excellent gem of a movie that was (and I fear will continue to be) missed by so many, simply because people hear the name "Jim Carrey" and make of their mind (good or bad) without even seeing the movie. This movie was great, by far the best picture I saw in 2001. Jim Carrey as a serious actor was excellent (who knew), Martin Landau..excellent...and the girl who played the love interest (sorry I forgot her name) was outstanding. This is a movie expierence that you can share with your wife, your girlfriend, your Mom and Dad, your favorite Aunt and Uncle, and never be embarrassed by anything of the screen (now how many Jim Carrey movies can you say that about). Go now, Buy, Rent, Borrow, set your DVR, but get a copy of this movie and set aside an evening for a movie pleasure that you have not had in an extremely long time. I cannot reccommend it enough (I would give it 10 stars if I could, and believe me I am very criticle of movies in general).
