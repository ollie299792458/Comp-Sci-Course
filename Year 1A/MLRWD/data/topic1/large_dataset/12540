I despise those movies that make their jokes in such a way that it seems as though the director is sitting right next to you, elbowing you and shouting "Get it?  It was a joke!" every few seconds.  (I am thinking of such nonsense as Ace Ventura or Austin Powers.)  "Without a Clue" is NOT one of those movies.
Crafted with loving care and dedication to detail, it is a hypothetical examination of a literary legend: What we, Doyle's readers, have not known for years is that Dr. Watson is the brilliant crime-fighter.  But for reasons of reputation and ethics, he hides behind the great brain of Sherlock Holmes.  The problem was that Holmes was a name he made up, and when the public wanted to meet this great man, Watson quickly found an un-employed drunken sod to stand in as Holmes.  Now he's stuck with the lout as his partner (nay, LEADER) in crime-solving.
The beauty in this movie lies in the fact that its humor is so superbly subtle, and runs consistent throughout the movie.  Hilarious zingers are being thrown at the audience right and left, most of which will never be caught by those whose tastes run in more mundane circles.
Never over-the-top, never too bizarre to be believable (Hi, Mr. Carrey), Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine form a beautiful odd-couple combination.  Their "it-should-have-won-awards" acting is deftly directed by Thom Eberhardt based on a beautiful script by Garry Murphy and Larry Strawther.  Supported by Peter Cook ("Mawwige!"), Jeffrey Jones (the sadistic principal of "Ferris Beuller"), and featuring Paul Freeman (Belloq of "Raiders of the Lost Ark") as the evil Moriarty, the whole film plays not as a satire of the Doyle stories; rather, one gets the feeling the cast and crew are secretly in love with the Holmes legacy, and this is their way of paying a humorous homage to it.
With the exception of one scantily clad leg, it's appropriate for the entire family.
