The movie tells the story of typical, 1980's, Hollywood stylized version of high school--there are the jocks and the nerds and the quintessential queen bees that are running the show.

Veronica (Winona Ryder) and her friends, all named Heather, are the most popular of the popular, but Veronica feels she is different from her friends.  She is deeper and more introspective (probably because she wears a monocle).  In any case, when the new rebel (Christian Slater) enrolls in school and threatens to turn the traditional hierarchy on its head, Veronica immediately signs up for the ride.  Unfortunately, she doesn't fully understand his means and methods to social reordering.

The movie was made prior to Columbine and other high-profile school tragedies.  This movie is clearly an over-the-top satire, but I doubt any movie company would be willing to touch the subject matter today.  It is part of the American cinemagraphic lexicon.  Everyone has to see it.  Plus you get great lines like, "What is your damage, Heather?" and "Well, f*** me gently with a chainsaw."
