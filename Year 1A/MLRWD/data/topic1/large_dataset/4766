The story is simple as was noted by another viewer, but this movie doesn't  need anything more. It is the chance to see some of history's famous  sideshow "freaks", though I would just call them physically  different. Featured are the beautiful sisters who are joined at the hip  ("siamese twins"); the amazing and arresting Johnny Eck--who has  no legs but who gracefully runs around on his hands and is outgoing and  quite handsome; the trio of "pinheads," who were displayed as  "sisters" although they were boys in dresses--they were mentally  disabled and not actually related; the "human torso" who had no  arms or legs but was quite happy enough and could move around by inching  himself along on a surface; a bearded lady, a giant, a super skinny guy, a  fat lady, and "miniature" folks as well. (I may have missed a  couple!) Such a group of people could never be seen today and it wasn't  long after this movie was made that sideshows (specifically: showing off  physically different people for a profit) were made illegal. The sad thing  is these people were able to make a decent living from sideshows and the  people in it were all a tight-knit family--taking away the sideshow meant  the loss of any ability to make money for the majority of these folks, and  it desolved the sideshow families. Most people don't realize that the  majority of the stars of side shows worked there by their own  CHOICE!
"Freaks" is a very special film and shows many very  special people. I only hope that viewers will appreciate how unique and  individually wonderful each of these people were. I don't think we will  ever see such a group of people like this in one setting ever again. The  director didn't make fun of any of the people and showed them for what they  were: folks just like you and me, except for being physically different.  (Excluding the very happy, but truthfully mentally disabled  "pinheads.")
It's a great movie!  END
