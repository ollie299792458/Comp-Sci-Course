It's hard to believe that some people who see this film don't get the point (this is another way of saying that this brand of comedy is not for a generation weaned on The Beaver and the Brady's).  If you thought that the  laugh track on The Brady Bunch was real, you should stay away from the  films of Preston Sturges, whose cerebral wit in "The Lady Eve"  and other films is strictly for true cynics who secretly wish they could be  idealists.  The cast is terrific, and Charles Coburn steals scenes so  subtley you wonder why he didn't appear in more films (maybe that's why).  The weakest part of the movie is Miss Stanwyck's wooden face and her habit  of either over- or under-acting -- but for some of Mr. Sturges' dry-witted  lines, this works quite well.  The Sturges comedies were the nearest  american equivalent to the dry British social satires of the 20's and 30's.  Certainly, Hollywood wouldn't have the nerve to make such a film today.  Critics are in error, though, when they class this strictly as a  "screwball comedy".  Sturges, as a writer and director, went past  screwball and toward the sublime, where at least a modicum of worldly (and  world-weary) awareness is involved.  Not only was this movie ahead of its  time, it may still be too advanced for the current generation.  The  honeymoon scene in the Pullman car is hysterical, and so is Mr. Coburn's  line when someone suggests that Eve should open one of the train's windows.
