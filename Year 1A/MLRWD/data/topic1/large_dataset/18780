Here is a movie that was made way ahead of it's time. Call it a musical, call it a rock opera. The movie is filled with music from beginning to end with every song enhancing the mediocre story. I compare the excitement and music in Phantom of the Paradise to a toned down version of the 2001 adaptation of Moulin Rouge. Something most critics do not mention is that most of the songs have a common bond with the premise of the selling of one's soul to the devil. This is tastefully done and can be seen even in the first song "Goodbye Eddie, Goodbye" where the lead singer offers to kill himself in order to become a musical legend and use the money for a life saving operation for his sister. Ok, it sounds a little corny, but is well done and sets the stage for Faust. Faust is the song written with Johan Faustus in mind. Although not mentioned with detail in the movie, Johan Faustus was a German who existed in the 16th century. He is best known for selling his soul to the devil in return for pleasure and power during his remaining mortal life. In order for the contract to be valid, he had to sign it with his blood. The movie farcely shows what musicians and performers really have to do for the recording industry in order to have a chance at being famous. I loved the music in the movie enough to immediately go out and buy the soundtrack. For being virtually unknown, this is a great movie.
