Most people (Wade Davis included) whine about how unrealistic and bigoted the portrayal of the Vodun religon is.

There's one detail they leave out. ITS JUST A MOVIE. Not a documentary. It was made by Wes Craven for god's sake. It's supposed to be a horror movie, and that it is. And a damn good one I might add. It's really rehash of western urban myths of the voodoo religion, sprinkled with bits of the actual beliefs, but not a full scope.

Though the movie doesn't come close to the truth. It's not supposed to. It has a stable and provacative story, And derserves a watch for anyone who has an interest in the occult. Just remember yeah, none of it's real. But look at it this way. To the Hatians this stuff is VERY real. I've even spoken with hatians who praise the movie close to their beliefs, but were off on (many) things.

Anyone who is up for a scare, or a good story concerning poltical unrest, and black magic? Watch th movie.

Want the pure scientific facts? Read the book or go to Hati and find a Houngan, (but avoid Bokor)
