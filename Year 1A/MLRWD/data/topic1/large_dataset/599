I have taken it upon myself to see many of the movies that I enjoyed as a young adult in the 60's and 70's.  Some of them I remember as being great, but when I see them again, they're not so great.  One of the truly great  ones is "Harold and Maude" (1972). The movie has lost nothing for me, and  if anything, is actually better now.  
It is the story of a young man  (Harold - Played by Bud Cort) obsessed with death, and his relationship  with an older woman, (Maude- Played by Ruth Gordon)who is a complete free  spirit.  Maude is fond of funerals, but is more fascinated with the circle  of life, not just death.  Their relationship takes Harold on a journey to  maturity that is full of humor and heartache. I was quite pleasantly  surprised recently while I was watching "Something about Mary" that  "Harold and Maude" was mentioned a few times as Mary's favorite all time  love story.  
This film is the ultimate black comedy. The music is one of  the highlights of this great work.  All of the music is by Cat Stevens. The  music of Cat Stevens also plays through a larger portion of this film that  most of today's soundtracks which may be made more to sell CDs than to  provide mood for the story.  Cat Stevens is also an artist that we can  forget how much we enjoyed.  
I showed this video to my sons (12 and 14),  they even appreciated it.  If you want to see a video that gives you a  glimpse of a how we felt about life and death in the 1970's (and how many  of us feel today) see Harold and Maude.  You won't be disappointed.
