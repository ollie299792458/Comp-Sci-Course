I read this book following the movie, which I watched numerous times. I found the characters to be utterly charming and found myself wishing to be part of that life and times, no matter how turbulent they were. In reading the book, I wanted to find out more about the characters portrayed in the movie, what brought them to this point in which they were being exposed. Why was Ada so pampered? Why was Inman so damn appealing? Why was Ruby so strong? You're able to taste the food and feel the weather and feel the rough craftsmanship of the everyday living. If something needed to be done, you had to do it or you would starve, or be dirty or be thirsty, etc... To have to know about where you live and how that land lives so you can live with it in harmony. It sort of skips those detailed-details in the movie. The book is a bit slower, but because it happened so long ago, I feel it would be necessary to describe things in this meticulous manner. I find it easy to compare the war stories with everyday living in middle class life today. At least then, there was chivalry and polite society. Today is nothing but money, unproffesionalism and rudeness.If this book were about just the civil war it would be in another class, but by adding this personal touch, it screams need, commitment and survival in its rawest form. PS. Cooking a ham then is totally different than cooking a ham today! If it's cooking you're looking for you may want to try another section of the bookstore; you've missed the point of this story
