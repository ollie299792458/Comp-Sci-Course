"Camp" is a delighful movie, which there are not too many of these days!

 The story is mainly about hot Vlad, who is the only straight guy at camp. He rooms with 3 other guys (all gay) and they are Shaun, Spitzer and Michael. I personally loved Spitzer because he is like the girlfriend you never had!

But anyways, this movie is trying to have them "accept each other how they are". But then there are always people who dont wanna. Like the camp's snot, Jill and her shadow, follower Fritzi

Vlad is sorta a man-hoe is this movie, though. Because he hooked up with Jill at the beginning, and then went out with Ellen, and then he was kissing another girl, and then his girlfriend showed up! But, everything sorts out in the end!

And the best part in the entire movie is- Vlad after he goes swimming in the lake!!!!!! Cause he gets out of the water, with no shirt on, and it pans over his HOT muscular, wet chest, and then to his face. OMG- hott!!!!

But, this movie is really funny, and just....great!!
