First, Adam Sandler gives a terrific performance as a man who lost his wife and three daughters on 9/11. He effectively portrays a man who is not just mourning, but is literally crippled by his loss. It's a moving performance, especially the scene in which he finally discusses the tragedy.

While I strongly recommend this film, there are some faults. The subplot involving an attractive dental patient is unnecessary and distracting. BJ Novak, of The Office fame, is completely miscast as an aggressive state agent who wants Charlie (Sandler) committed.  He's just not believable, but it's a minor role (thankfully).

But the positives far outweigh the negatives.  Sandler, Cheadle, Pinkett-Smith, and even Liv Tyler give great performances.  The music fits the film perfectly.  9/11, the reason for Sandler's grief, is treated respectfully and not given a cringe-worthy Hollywood dramatization. This movie simply tells the story of one man, of many, who lost it all on that day.

At it's core, Reign Over Me is a testimony to the strength of friendship.  It's a very good film.
