I had never heard of this film while searching for an interesting film to see to kill 2 hours. When I noticed the advertisement poster saying: "He has been trained to kill, until he learned about his enemy", was what initially sold me on purchasing the tickets.

I was most intrigued by the main character Eyal(Ashkenazi), the Mossad assasin. He possessed a quiet, tough exterior with a humorous personality at times, struggling with his own mission of hunting down a former Nazi to bring closure to a job that eventually drives his own wife to commit suicide.

While watching the two main characters, Eyal and Axel, the film presented a constrasting yet enlightening view between a hetero-sexual(Eyal) and gay men and how both viewed the world as a Jew and a German, while dealing with their past demons.

For the most part, Walk on Water raises interesting questions about cultural & historical grudges as seen through the eyes of Eyal and everyone he comes in contact with. Dramatically different, Walk on Water had me on the edge to find out how Eyal planned on completing his mission. A must see!!
