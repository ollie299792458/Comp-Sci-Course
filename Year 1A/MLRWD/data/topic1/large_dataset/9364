I am a fan of the oringal Smokin Aces which this is a prequel too. Now I know the original did not get the best reviews but compared to this one it might as well be Citizen Kane. The basic plot is that once again a bunch of assasins are trying to kill someone who is protected by the FBI. In this movie the guy who has a price on his head is a FBI Analyst named Weed played by Tom Berenger. I didn't even realize it was Tom Bergenger until I saw the credits. And I am sorry to say he has fallen on hard times this is really a low point for him. The only other people in the movie I actually heard of are Vinnie Jones one of the few people to have some charisma in this. And they manage to have Ernie Hudson in  the end for two minutes which is a waste of a good actor. None of the other actors have any charisma and are not interesting to watch. I realize in this kind of movie the plot is not expected to be brilliant but still it was still ridiculous and stupid. The twist in the movie was also predictable. I am not sure who this movie is trying to appeal to. If you are a fan of the first Smokin Aces this one is no where near as good. And if you have not seen the first one just watch that instead of this mess. There is a reason this came out straight to video.
