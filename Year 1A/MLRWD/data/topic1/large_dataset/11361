There are numerous arguments concerning the artistic/entertainment status of Kong 76. Pretty much everything has been said. I enjoy this movie every time I watch it. Great? No, but thoroughly entertaining when taken for what it is. My issue is with the notion that this version is somehow not on par with the other versions. Having seen all three American films, each has it's problems. The '33 classic suffers from two dimensional characters, over acting, leaps in narrative, inconsistencies in the special effects, a cringe inducing final line, and Fay Wray does little more than scream then pass out for much of this movie. Jackson's 2005 effort, while visually spectacular, has its own share of problems, gaps in narrative, leaps in logic, and miscasting among other things. By and large, most of what Kong 76 is maligned for occurs in the others. However, this movie shores up some of the narrative weaknesses, while adding a little contemporary social commentary. And there's no beating that John Barry score!
