I agree with the die hard "Dead like Me" fans' reviews on here.  When I saw there was a "movie finale" for the show, I was SO excited!  It was like a dream come true!  As I was watching the dvd, it didn't take long for my dream to turn into a nightmare.  I didn't feel it captured the true essence of the series AT ALL.  It was almost like the people who made this movie were just casual fans of the show.  I think the die hard fans could have written a way better movie, without even trying hard!  First, the obvious, NO DAISY.  She was one of my favorite characters ... to replace her with the "wannabe" version of daisy was just pathetic.  Honestly, I feel if Laura Harris was unavailable, they should have left Daisy out of the movie all together.  That would have helped the movie a little.  And not having Rube was another huge disappointment, as he was like the father of the group.  The head guy who replaced him in the movie was completely ridiculous.  I was glad when George told Reggie the truth, but the whole storyline with Reggie was so depressing and pointless in my opinion.  I think a better closure/ending for the movie would have been George seeing her "heaven" and walking off into it, like all the people whose souls she took in the past.  Now that would have been a satisfying ending.  Whoever made this movie, for future reference, you really should have die hard fans review your movie before its set in stone.  Otherwise, you get this... a million disappointed bitter Dead like Me fans!  If I had known it was this bad, I wouldn't have purchased the dvd.  So for fans, rent it, don't waste your money on buying it.  Stick to watching reruns on the prior seasons dvds.  Now those are quality entertainment.
