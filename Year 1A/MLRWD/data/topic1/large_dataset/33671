I was a big fan of these movies growing up watching the friday night creature feature on tv. The first film is without a doubt the best. Some scientists hire a boat to take them down the Amazon River to follow up on native rumors that a prehistoric creature still lives. They find the "gill-man" and start fighting for their lives. The Creature has a simple plan. Kill the men and keep the woman. To their credit, when the crew figures this out, they try to get away as quickly as possible. In the second and third films, you start to wonder why people don't just leave this beast alone. The sequel, The Revenge of the Creature has a lot of action. This time some folks have a great idea to capture the Creature and put him on display in a Florida aquarium. He of course escapes, grabs a girl and terrorizes the eastern seaboard. The third movie is the most bizzare. In The Creature Walks Among Us, some folks have an even greater idea of capturing him, removing his gills, and making him into a land animal. Don't ask why they put him through all of this. Anyway, the DVD set is very high quality and well worth it.
