Basically, this is a good story, with some good acting.  But any chance of it being a great movie was destroyed by, least of all, directing and editing flaws and numerous storyline implausibilities, but most of all, an unprecedented level of product placement.  In fact, I would say that the commerciality of this film is a real blow to the work of the actors, as well as a slap in the audience's face.  But what is more shocking to me, is that none of the posting reviewers seems to think this is important.  Why are people so kind about a movie so absolutely OVERWHELMED with product placement???  I have never seen a movie filled with this much advertising.  If I were any of the actors in this film, I would be sure to get my next role in a real film, rather than a big commercial that blatantly utilizes our emotional responsiveness to repeatedly slam products into our heads.  For godsakes, they put Sam's daughter Lucy in front of a 7-11 each and every time she goes to see him at night...  I truly wish there were more commentary on this, for we are ensuring that this goes on by saying nothing.  Honestly, if I had known I'd be watching a two-hour commercial, I NEVER would have watched this film.  Why are we PAYING to be advertised to?  If this continues, they should be pay us at the cinema door.  Let me repeat, this was an okay movie ... but I could barely see it through the commercials.
