The movie starts out like some kind of "Heavenly Creatures," with two girls taking interest in each other and living out their girly fantasies.  They then run around crazy-like, jumping over little boys and fire hydrants.  The director must've really liked this effect, because he shows it in slow-motion with this weird music in the background.  I didn't get that part at all.
One of the reasons I was watching this was that I heard Peter Sellers was in it.  Well, he is, but not really.  It's more about these girls who are always talking about girly things.  The movie made me uncomftorable, knowing a guy director made this movie.  Was he like obsessed with filming girls talking about their life or something?
You know, I can't say this review is fair because I turned the film off half-way through.  It's like, when you see something that's already going nowhere and you have no interest in it, you really don't want to waste your time on the rest of it.  I mean, I had already wasted one hour of my life; didn't want to waste that last one.  No oh oh ohhhhhh.  Didn't wanna waste that last one.  No oh oh ohhhh.  Thank you very much.
