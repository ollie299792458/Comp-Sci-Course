This was one of my favorites of 1999. Terence Stamp is incredible, a rather sinister good guy; like Dirty Harry with a conscience.
What really makes this film so amazing, is the theme of time. Time has been taken from  his life, leaving him with regret about the past and a what should have  been. I don't want to say much because I would hate to give away  anything.
There aren't really any "bad guys" in this film. It's  beyond that. Terence's character is perhaps his own worst enemy.
It's a  powerful, stylish, thrilling film. It reinvents a genre in a much less  forced way than, say, Pulp Fiction. There may be cinematographic tricks,  but they serve a purpose, the stream of consciousness in the mind of a  confused, angry, sad man.
As for The Who's song, "The Seeker";  well, that is the opening theme and fits in so well and explains so much.  Kind of like "Sounds of Silence" at the beginning of The  Graduate.
So you gotta see this film. It's sooo worth it. Oh, and by the  way, it's also really funny.
