I was on a plane to Japan with several business associates when I saw the movie, Clueless.  It had just been released for showing on the airlines at that time.  After the flight, we were all asking if anyone had watched the movie, and we all had done so as a way to pass the time on a long flight.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, we all had the same reaction to the movie.  We all agreed that it was the worst movie any of us had ever seen--bar none!

It is a nauseating tale of a spoiled brat in a total unbelievable plot, with abominable acting.  I prefer movies that don't pretend life is anything but the hard, cold struggle for survival that it really is for most of us.  If you're not held captive on a plane with no alternative to watch, you would probably turn Clueless off or change channels after 15 minutes.  Fortunately, most airlines now offer multiple movies on different channels, so you would not get stuck with only Clueless today.  If you have never seen Clueless yet, don't waste precious time that could be put to better use.  Life is too short and precious to waste any of it on this bomb movie.

Clueless is for the clueless!
