David Arneson Previous Reviewer stated: "Good movie to show to the kids to let them see how crappy the 60s were for entertainment.  ...kind of sparse on the special features."

I pity this poor man, apparently he wants nothing but special effects, computer-generated FX, explosions, etc.  However, great actors and acting apparently don't fit his "style'.

He doesn't realize that some of the best movies of the 20th Century were made in the '60s, such as:
To Kill A Mockingbird,  Dr. Stangelove,  Fail Safe,  The Longest Day,  In Cold Blood,  Psycho,  2001 - A Space Odyssey,  Alfie,  Bonnie & Clyde,  The Good,  The Bad & The Ugly,  Once Upon A Time In The West,  The Manchurian Candidate,  The Miracle Worker,  In The Heat of The Night,  The Great Escape,  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,  The Pink Panther, and so many more.  Many of these movies have far betting acting and actors that what is available today.

I strongly suggest that people reading his review treat it with a grain of salt.
" The Sand Pebbles" is a great movie, one which garnered over EIGHT Academy Award Nominations!
