I defiantly would say that this is a must have for your home collection. It is too hilarious to just rent and watch once. I am sure that many people can relate to the lack of enthusiasm about their job or the many office obstacles that may get in the way of them effectively doing their job.
The movie starts off with Peter on his way to work. He is in slow moving traffic, which in turn causes him to be late. While he is in traffic the camera goes to the right of him and shows an elderly gentleman with a walker walking faster than the vehicles are moving. This is one of the many funny things that stand out. Make sure to keep an eye out for Milton. He plays sort of a hero to the main character Peter and the rest of his co-workers. Milton's incoherent mumbling about his red Swingline stapler, lack of receiving his paycheck, not receiving his piece of cake and the location of his desk show the inconsistent policies that Initech portray.
Again I recommend this movie to everyone because it will keep you laughing the entire time.
