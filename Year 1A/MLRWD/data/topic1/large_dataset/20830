I waited and waited and waited before I purchased the full set of VHS tapes of this incredible TV show. After all, 80 bucks is a lot of money, for anything. But I finally took the plunge.
Watching this series for the first time in over 10 years brought back wonderful memories. And it also gave me more insight into the show, being that I only saw a few of the episodes the first time around. If you have an open mind and enjoy something creative and different, TP is for you.
In my original review which I am now editing, the next paragraph described how awful the sound was, and mentioned that the music seemed like it had gone through a Quisenhart several times and was then spat out.
Well, I have since bought a new VCR and TV, and found that the music sounds just fine!  So chalk up my original rant to 15-year-old equipment that had started to show its age.  
The picture still isn't that great--those browns and reds still tend to bleed a lot.  But if you can ignore this fault, TP is still a thing of beauty. But I've heard a lot of good things about DVD quality, so when I stop waiting and finally buy a DVD player, I'm going to get those discs and enjoy a crystal-clear picture, at last.
