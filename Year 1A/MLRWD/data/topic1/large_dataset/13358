Ok guys, i think the negative reviews are from those expecting more than what it is. It is simply a low bidget, simple classic Zombie movie, don't expect "Ben Herr", "Cleopatra", "12 Angry men", "Guns of Navarone"...Fulci is a master at what he does, and that create an Italian version of George A. Romero film. He does a fantastic job at that.

As far as people thinking they received the wrong film, I think this might straightne the confussion, or not.

---FULCI Came out with the Italian film (1980) "Paura nella citta dei morti viventi" which was press release in the US as "twilight of the dead" and then upon US theatrical release as "The Gates of Hell" and then finally as "city of the living dead" on DVD.
---Bruno MATTEI (another italian film maker) released an Italian film released in the US theatres as (1983) "night of the zombies" and then released on DVD in the US as "Hell of the living dead".

See the confussion? But wait it gets worse! the cover of each has simlar cover art. Fulci film us an artist who painted the zombie head 1980. Well, in 1983 Mattei also used an artist to create his cover, guess who he used, the same artist. This artist simply added a torso to the head and edited a phote and Boom! we have two very simplar covers which have the same zombia head, 1 sans torso. They also are similar in that they are Zombie film, Italian directors, early 80's, but watch both, the plots are quite different. Matteis film is more Romero like than Fulci's in my opinion.

But overall the films are different and both are fantastic. If you are still confussed, check out Horror Hound issue 23 May/June 2010, there is a hole retrospective and the article is dedicated to the mastery of Fulci and "city of the living dead".
