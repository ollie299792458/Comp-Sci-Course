I loved this movie, but was really disappointed to find out that the "digital copy" isn't in fact a digital copy.  Instead, you have to sign up to stream the movie from UltraViolet or download an app to be able to play the movie.  Why bother competing against Apple?  They have a much less confusing, less time-intensive system already in place.  I don't want to register with another company and give my private information away to yet another company.  I don't want to have to access a different service to play different movies - I just want to be able to access them all on I-tunes.  Now I have to remember which movies I have in which system?  Plus, what guarantee do I have that this service will even be around in a couple of years.  Every other company that has gone up against Apple in this way has failed, and with how awkward and user-unfriendly UltraViolet is I don't see it being the exception.  The movie gets 5 stars.  The combo pack gets 2 stars because of the "digital copy," since I now have to pay an additional $17.99 if I want to buy the I-Tunes digital copy I can actually use.
