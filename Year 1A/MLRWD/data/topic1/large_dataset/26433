I watched this movie last night as a "time killer".  I was intrigued by the premise and give it a chance. The plot is a "by the numbers" 1950s "B" movie updated to 2010 sensibilities.

Sarah Polley; (who has always reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster)and Adrien Brody try their best to make the characters believable and the actress who played "Dren" is the real star of the movie.

But the plot gets muddled half way though the movie as Dren has sex with Brody's character and then has sex with Polley's character as "Dren" has a sex change which is explained earlier in the movie by two blob-like creations who eventually kill each other.

I wanted to like the movie but the premise in the second half of the movie just didn't work for me and left me somewhat flat because it seemed to get more and more silly.  The ending which I'll spare you, didn't work for me either.

In any case, there are enough good aspects to make the movie watchable, but don't take it too seriously.  You'll be in for a big letdown.
