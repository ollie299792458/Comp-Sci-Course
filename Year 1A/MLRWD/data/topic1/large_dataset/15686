Make no mistake: this is a workout video with bellydance moves, not a bellydance video.  It will teach you some bellydance moves, but it will not make you into a bellydancer; you'll need another video (or a real-life instructor) for that!

First off, Neena and Veena are both pleasant instructors, with nice attitudes in their introductions.  Their choice of outfits is also good, as both are wearing simple sports bras and leggings with a small hip scarf; this makes it easy to follow their movements without distracting costumes getting in the way.  (Amusingly, they're not identical dancers.  One is smoother with her hips, the other with her arms.  It's interesting to see how they vary in their styles.)  Their smiles look a bit forced after a while, but one can hardly blame them for having tired cheeks.

The moves are simple and easy to follow, though the faceless narrator isn't the best at giving cues, so you really have to watch the twins to see what they're doing.  You do definitely need some coordination, especially when first getting the hang of the moves, as a lot of time is not spent on each one before moving on to the next and they're not broken down well in the instruction.  Some positions are also named but not explained, such as the Cleopatra positions.  This won't matter after the first go-through, but it makes it more difficult initially.

The production values are mediocre.  It doesn't much matter in the exercise portion, but I find that the bonus dance segments and their intricate costumes suffer from some blurring and pixelization.

Overall, despite my complaints, I rather like this video.  It doesn't make you sweat, but you'll be feeling the muscles you use.  Experienced dancers or people looking for a more hard-core workout probably won't find much here, but most other people should find it more than satisfactory.
