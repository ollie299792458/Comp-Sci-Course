There is a myth that all black people are "brothers" or "sistas",that blacks are united and that the white man is his' oppressor. This movie will show that this kind of thinking is only racist propaganda against white people. This movie shows a historic reality that the black Hutu tribe unleashed a genocide against the black Tutsi tribe,which included the hacking up of tutsi children and babies.Just as Germans killed the French and the French killed the Russians ETC , warfare and genocide have occured within all of the races.They were all white but that did not stop them from slaughtering one another.This film should be watched by all,especially by those who think that when such events happen that they can be neutral and be okay.It must be watched by those black people who champion racial conflict between blacks and whites.Not all black people are their friends and not all white people are their enemies.When we all realize that we are all just human and we all have been guilty of persecuting others at some time in history,maybe we can begin to grasp for brotherhood and peace.Maybe we will reject the demagogues.This movie will help the viewer to see that even a poor Rwandan Hutu will mutilate his' neighbor,that he does not have to be a white SS trooper.Enjoy the movie.
