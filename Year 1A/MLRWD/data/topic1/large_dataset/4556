I pretty much agree with the other reviewers that have posted here already. It was a B+ or A- film. I think it did an A+ job of breathing some new life into a relatively tired genre.

I am really writing this just to ask, "Did anyone else get bothered by the music anachronisms?" This might seem like a minor point, but I was irritated by this for the first 30 min of the film. The music played in the beginning of the film (the disco & partying scenes) was Blondie's "Heart Of Glass", Blondie's "Rapture", "Magnificent Seven" by The Clash, and "Let's Dance" by David Bowie. Well, the first three of those songs came out in 1978-1980, and the last one was 1983. However, the first scene of the film dates the film with a title at 1988. I was wondering for the 1st 30 min of the film if I had misread that title. Were there really big discos playing 10-year old hits - exclusively - for their customers in 1988? The cop radios are too old for '88. No one uses cordless phones inside. There's no neon stuff, but there are punks walking around. I just couldn't place the film in my mind as being 1988.

So, that's pretty picky. Otherwise, good flick.
