I read all 55 reviews of this movie and I noticed that some felt that the movie fell far short of the Peter Straub book.

I beg to differ.

The book was excellent, up until he went into this "shape shifter - changeling" diatribe to explain the origins of Eva Galley. Up to that point in the book it was rivetting, scary, really excellent as the reviewers said. But the shape shifting nonsense ruined the book, in my opinion.

The movie dispensed with the shape shifer "explanation" of the ghost - it was left completely out, and you had no idea what the origin of Eva Galley was. In fact, from the movie you dont know who she was in the first place when the boys first met her - she was as mysterious then as she ended up being as a ghost. No explanations were offered and none were needed.

Alice Krige was indeed the star of the show and her performance was perfect. She is at once an extrememly erotic, beautiful but SCARY woman who cant help but enchant every man who beholds her charms. She is the quintessential black widow spider in this movie, and the movie was brilliant.
