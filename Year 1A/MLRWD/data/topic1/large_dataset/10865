Review number 111. I remember seeing this 1968 Christmas holiday classic in a theater the day after it came out. Story takes place around, I'll say 1850 England. When a kid sees this movie for the first time (especially back then, before cable, video games, ipods, etc), it really does make a lasting impression on you. Too many memorable scenes to mention. I thought the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) did an exceptional good job in this film, as so did Oliver Twist (Mark Lester), Nancy-the hot redheaded bar maid (Shani Wallis), bad guy Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) and who could forget good 'ol half-hearted pick pocket master mind Fagin (Ron Moody)? Is it just me or could he have possibly modeled for Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' lp? I usually can't stand show tunes, but out of the movie's fourteen songs, I liked "Food, Glorious Food", "I'd Do Anything", "It's A Fine Life" and the swinging "Oom-Pah-Pah". Only character in 'Oliver!' I could NOT stand is that pirate reject / Napoleon wanna-be Mr. Bumble (Harry Secombe). Recommended.
