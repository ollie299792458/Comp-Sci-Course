I adore this movie in a completely irrational, fan girl way.  I know it's corny, I know that some people will hate it, and think it's stooopid.  It fits the comic book style of punchy, fast action.  Lori Petty quite effectively becomes the punk-girl she ought to be. 
But like other reviewers, I am quite, quite disappointed in the DVD version of this film.  From the trenches you hear grumblings that there was a lot of edited stuff that COULD HAVE been put on the DVD.  Why don't DVD makers do more than reprint what we already have on video for us to (silly consumers we sometimes are) just rush out to buy anyway?  The picture quality of the DVD is not significantly higher than that of the video-- the only real bonus is that you can do still pauses and get some cool screen shots for that conference paper presentation you're doing... There is nothing more than the video on this DVD.  Not even any nifty "Making of Tank Girl" footage, or sketches of other rejected cartoon scenes, or whatever!  Even an oldie/goodie Cherry 2000 has more than this one, and surely the DVD makers could have done better.  
I'll just hope that Men In Black is correct, and someday, when we get the next alien form of media (I guess I'll have to buy the White album again) the next makers of whatever futuristic thing we'll all have to rush out and buy will heed this advice-- put more on your big media!  There's no real reason for me to excercise my insane consumerism if you don't fill up my big old plate!
