I have been eating a vegan diet for several months now. I feel absolutely fantastic. My blood work is perfect, and I have lost weight. In the process, I have been reading and watching everything I can get my hands on about veganism. I am hooked and can't imagine ever eating animal products again. I visited Farm Sanctuary this past summer, and plan to attend some vegetarian summerfests next summer. I am an attorney and have taken several animal law conferences also. I wish I had discovered this lifestyle many years ago.

Now I want to get on a loudspeaker and tell everyone I know to try a plant-based diet. I watched this movie this morning at 5am, because I didn't want to be interrupted. I was glued to the movie. It is the best movie about veganism I have seen, because it takes regular meat-eating people through the process of learning about a plant-based diet using a lighthearted approach. I am now going to purchase my own copy and several more copies of this to use as gifts.

Every person on this planet should see this movie!!
