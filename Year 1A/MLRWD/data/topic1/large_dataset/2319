This film/BD deserves 5 stars, period!

I am running a PS3 [great BD player & features] as my main BD player & had no problams with this disc, or any other of the 400 + BD's in my library.

I think some of the negativity of this film comes from people wanting the so called typical U.S of A "Hollywood crap" that we quite often get spoon fed.

This movie is not only a Sci-Fi geeks wet dream come true, it also had a great story with real race issues, was very funny & action packed as well. I still cannot believe how good it looks & sounds on Blu-ray & still cannot believe how good the special effects were. The alien, [prawn... lol] technology was IMO the best from any sci-fi thus far. Just blew me away!

The film has an amazing contrast between high tech and the garbage ridden shanty town that the "prawns" are forced to live in, which is very gritty, filthy and desolate. What better place to film a movie about race issues than the ever dangerous Johannesburg... Just brillient!

Highly recommended.
