I will never see why this garbage is so highly rated. It was a total disappointment as far as I am concerned. It is just another film glorifying adultery. What a superb model for society to follow. The story was long, boring and did not get anywhere. I was thoroughly miserable watching this long, drawn-out indulgence on the part of some director or other. When people make a movie with a definite historical setting, they should aim to be true to the social attitudes and actions of the day - read my review of "Titanic" to see more about what I mean. I don't believe for one moment that the Sikh soldier and the Canadian women would have fallen so easily into a relationship in that era. It may be "beautiful" to some people, but you cannot impose present social conventions and attitudes on a different era and expect it to be believable. This is a sad testement to what the Academy Awards have become. Don't be fooled by the hype - you are in for a really boring film if you watch this.
