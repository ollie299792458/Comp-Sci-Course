I'm a dog owner myself, not that I show my dogs.  I couldn't they're Mutts.  However, I do enjoy watching the occasional Dog Show.  I was a little skeptical about this movie, because I just didn't think the material lent itself to a feature film.
The movie chronicles four different groups of dog owners and their adventures and misadventures on the way to the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  The story continues with the actual competition.  The commentators for the show are actually the best part of the movie.
Given this, I would say that this is a pretty good movie.  Its not hysterical by any means, but it is enjoyable.  The movie is slow going for the first 30 minutes or so, but by the time the actual Dog Show starts, it has developed into a funny tale in which you realize its not the dog's fault, it's just that humans are insane to put this much crazy effort into showing a dog.  With this movie, as with any dog show, don't get your expectations too high, and you should enjoy it.
