The great thing about a movie like "Taken" is that it knows exactly what kind of movie it is.  There is no awkwardness, no "message," no random and unfulfilling subplot--just a good set-up followed by a relentless pursuit.

Liam Neeson plays ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills, a haggard retiree who lives alone and wants only to have a good relationship with his semi-estranged daughter.  Bryan's buddies needle him about a life with nothing to do, and convince him to protect a famous singer for a one-time job--which allows for the obligatory "you don't want to mess with this guy" scene early in the movie.  He then very reluctantly allows his daughter to go to Paris, where she is kidnapped by a high-end prostitution ring.

That's the first act, and although it takes a little while to unfold, all the elements are necessary for an understanding of what happens later in the movie.  Once Bryan Mills is off and running, your eyes will never leave the screen.

Neeson is perfectly cast here, using his athletic, intimidating physique (he was once a boxer) to great effect in many confrontations.  "Taken" is a white-knuckle pursuit, and both the chases around Europe and the fight scenes recall the James Bond and Jason Bourne movies, and the rather underrated "Ronin."  In fact, it occurred to me while watching "Taken" that Neeson might have made a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan.  Neeson is a bit too old for it now, and Daniel Craig has shown himself more than capable as everyone's favorite spy.  But Neeson's brutal physicality, combined with his emotive physiognomy, makes Bryan Mills a character everyone roots for.

If you're looking for complex character development, Bryan Mills is no Oskar Schindler--but that's hardly the point of "Taken."  It's a quick and gratifying ninety-four minutes when you're looking for a well crafted, suspenseful thriller.
