The first thing I think will strike anyone viewing this film is how absolutely terrifyingly real every situation seems to be and how dire and serious the consequences on hand feel.  I havent seen a film in a while where everything going on translates in such a meaningful way, and I give credit here to the filmmakers, but especially the acting.

In many films I ve seen that are subtitled it takes me a couple of viewings to really get a strong concept of the story and the characters since much of the time is spent reading text and not concentrating fully on every little nuance.  Film being a powerful visually as it is, much of the great acting out there can be accomplished with subtlties and the great actors will have as much going on in their reactions as they do in they dialogue.  This is certainly no exception, and the acting in this film is tip top.  But, after one viewing, I had a great feeling as to what the film wanted to convey.  And thats with a brief nap in the middle of the film (one I take full responsibility for, due to a full stomache and a short night of sleep)!

In sum, it is an amazingly powerful film that demonstrates the hardships and struggles of a postwar country and really makes you feel each and every hiccup in these peoples lives.  Great stuff.
