I've never quite understood the negativity thrown at this movie and the other later Hellraiser films.  I've seen all of them and this one is my third favorite Hellraiser film behind the first two.  I think the main source of criticism comes from the idea that it is not a true Hellraiser film.  Well, the Hellraiser series is now about variety.  Seriously, who gets excited when a new just-like-the-others "Friday the 13th" movie comes out?

Well, not pure variety.  If you've seen both films, it's easy to see the similarities between this film and its predecessor, "Inferno".  This is little more than a remake of "Inferno", but this one is much better done.  This film emphasizes psychological horror and personal torment over gore and most of the scenes are very creative and memorable.  The creepiest scene for me was the one involving the video camera.  The images from that scene are forever burned in my mind and many of the other scenes are close to matching its effectiveness.  The entire film is genuinely scary and they even mix some nice eroticism into the mix (though little nudity).  The costumes and special effects are also well-done (except for the gunshot).

Complaints?  Well, some mention that the movie is kind of confusing.  It can seem so at first, but all is cleared up at the end.  It's not really a movie you have to rewatch to fully understand, although the movie is good enough to inspire you to rewatch it.  Also, some complain about Ashley's character (the heroine from the first two films) being turned into a villian.  Yeah, I was a little disappointed too, but it's nothing that killed the movie for me.

Check this one out if you're interested in a heady, scary, and unique (ignoring "Inferno") horror movie.
