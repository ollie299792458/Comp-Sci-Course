I usually receive the Blu-Ray versions of anime but somehow ended up with ordering the DVD version. The DVD version still comes with the postcards which are nice and two discs (which the Blu-Ray comes with two discs too).  Really the only difference I noticed between the DVD version as compared to my previous FMA Brotherhood Blu-Ray versions is a slight difference in the sharpness of the font on the credits screen at the end of the set, and maybe in sound quality, but otherwise, the anime itself still looked great.

That being said, this set of episodes was excellent.  The first episode (27) was what most anime fans call a clip show, that is to say, it recounts the events of the previous 26 episodes, as if it is the first episode of a new season or so.  This was great as we finally get more information the family of the Elric brothers but it also flows right into the cliffhanger that the previous episode that ended the part 3, and the plot continues from there.  The revelations were as excellent as the previous volume and the action flow was excellent.  I must admit, this volume has definitely hooked me onto the show and the final episode left me begging for more. There was never a dull moment in this set.  A few more interesting characters are also introduced in this set of episodes and are excellent.  They have great convincing English voice actors and are a blast to listen too, especially the character that is on the cover of this set.

The opening and ending are excellent and grew on me. By the time the opening 3 changed, I was really digging it and missed.  The set closes with the introduction of a fourth opening and ending song, which I think have great clips and are decent.

As usual the show is offered subtitled and with a choice of Japanese or English dubbing.  There is also extra content such as commentary for two of the episodes.
