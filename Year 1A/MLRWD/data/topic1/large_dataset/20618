Before you dive into this review, I must point out a few details about the others:  those who gave this film a "bad" review (which it certainly does not deserve) are either one, two, or all three of the following: (1): They either did not understand it, (2):  They need inexplicable raunchy and bathroom humor for a movie to be "funny", or (3):  They are very depressed.
Who said that Stockard Channing would be great as Jacqueline?  Just so you know, they also said that Miss Channing would look the role?  Honestly, did they watch the same movie?
This movie is hillarious.  A true gem in the motion picture category.  Bette Midler is absolutely hillarious as the awesomely witty, edgey, and modern autor of the all time pop culture novel, "Valley of the Dolls.  Nathan Lane makes a beautiful man out of Irving Mansfiled, Jackie's loving husband, and Stockard Channing makes a mad cap and georgeussly funny role out of Florence Maybell, true life personality of film, TV, and radio.  The 60's are brought out devinely, glamour, and juiciness make this movie what it is.  It is awesomely triumphant in explainging Jackie's want for fame and her self made climb to the delicious top.
Hillarious, sad, beautiful, well acted, and with a considerable amount of fabulous comedic acting, Isn't She Great is not one to miss.
