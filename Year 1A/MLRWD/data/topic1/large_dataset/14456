To explain my review title the people who gave this movie a poor rating, have.  This is much more than a comment on the actions of children under pressure, it's a side-swipe at the growing gap between generations (ironic seeing as the Fukasaku fairly old himself)in modern japan.  Even more than that, it's bloody entertaining too.
The characters are developed just enough to care about but the more important aspects of it is that children are both the problem with the society and the ones who are punished.  The survivor is not lauded as the winner but apparently held-up as a lesson to those who have reactionary thoughts.  I say apparently as none of the current 'players' have ever heard of the lesson as Kitano calls it.  Is this because the whole thing is in fact for the personal enjoyment of the adults who are at the forefront of the teenager's revolution?
In post-Columbine America (and I come from a town which lost a generation of children in similar fashion), those who could watch this film and grasp just some of what the film is trying to say then it has a very positive,and actually uplifting, message.
