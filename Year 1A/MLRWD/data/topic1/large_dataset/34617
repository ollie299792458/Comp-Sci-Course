I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. It made me think of a religious version of one of the many slightly comedic mob movies like "Snatch". Two young Irish Catholic brothers decide that evil is rampant. When the Catholic priest tells his church about a elderly woman that was killed with people standing around doing nothing, the men decide things have gone to far. They still don't do anything until some Russian mobsters try to kick them out of a pub that belongs to a friend. Even then they just beat up the mobsters, but when the mobster break into their apartment and try to kill them they start to change. The change at first is minor but as they are supported by the City of Boston they become more bold in removing evil from the streets. Brilliant directing, good production values, and plenty of action make this well worth checking out. Willem Defoe as the gay FBI agent and Sean PAtrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the brothers are outstanding, and the rest the cast are good. The story never takes itself to seriously and the introduction of a hitman that even the mob fears adds just another layer of icing. Well worth renting and I bought a copy myself. The DVD is great quality and has good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Layer Cake"
