When I finally sat down to see this controversial Scorsese film, I was expecting to see something perhaps somewhat offensive and yet well directed.  Now I understand why even some Scorsese fans were disappointed when the film was first released, for this is clearly one of his least-effective films.  The direction is substandard, the script pedestrian, and the acting tediously overdone.  It is amazing to think Scorsese was actually nominated for the Best Director Oscar for this silly venture and Mel Gibson was not for his far superior "The Passion of the Christ."

Once again so many have confused heresy with artistic profundity.  Just because a film pushes the envelope doesn't mean it has artistic merit.  There is no depth here, only wishful thinking on the part of those who feel more comfortable with a Jesus cut down to size.  And this is a silly Jesus -- a nervous, self-doubting carpenter who makes crosses for Roman crucifixions and spends much of the film whining about how much he hates himself.

Mel Gibson did it better.  So did Franco Zeffirelli.  Buy "The Passion of the Christ" or "Jesus of Nazareth," and skip Scorsese's amusing mess of a movie.
