First of all I must say that Uzumaki is not for everyone. It is for the people who liked to read &#34;Omni&#34; in their childhood or gaze at Dali's picture and think &#34;how the hell did he come up with this idea&#34;. Why I call it a piece of art is because this is not a real movie in the true sense of the word movie. All the actors and actresses are quite symbolic figure just to carry the frames. The beauty is in the composition of each frame. If you get a chance please pause frequently and look at the composition of the frames. They are all like the pictures from the surrealist's era.

A small town Kurouzu is cursed by spirals.  Spiral geometrically can be both asymptotic and non-asymptotic. - The start can be the end or the end can be the start. The director Higuchinsky (real name Akihiro Higuchi deals with these loosely connected oddities with are vaguely and beyond explanation.  Sometimes it is loving and sunny the next moment it is gruesome. The only thing close to this is Lovecraft's novels. This is not like Ringu or even anything close to it. This is not a horror movie just bizarre images, weird deaths and transformations, even a centipede&#62; it is like Higuchinsky throws an idea at you and then retracts it quickly to through another one.

Look closely into every frame and surrounding every character you will see the signs of spiral or uzumaki whose influence or visibility slowly increases over time. You will definitely enjoy this movie.
