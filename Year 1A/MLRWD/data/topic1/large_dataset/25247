Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time, bar none, THE STING is one of those classics you pray no one ever decides to remake. How could they make it better? Paul Newman and Robert Redford at their very best - Robert Shaw in a wonderfully realized performance - a supporting cast including Ray Walston, Harold Gould, Eileen Brennan and Charles Durning - perfect production design and memorable music. As a writer, though, I'm always focused on the script, and this one is set up beautifully and plays out to everyone's satisfaction. It's funny, unexpected, full of rich characters and gives us a window into a wildly interesting world.

I have an extra (personal) reason to love this film. A friend of mine had a bit part in it. He died (way too young) in 1984, and I sometimes watch THE STING just to see him again. (Yeah, we all have our reasons ...)

I've never met anyone who didn't love THE STING. It's on almost everyone's top 10 favorite list - and with good reasons. A multiple Oscar winner (and did it ever deserve to be!), it's simply aces in all areas.

Enjoy this and make sure everyone you know sees it. Truly, THE STING is the movie they invented movie popcorn for.
