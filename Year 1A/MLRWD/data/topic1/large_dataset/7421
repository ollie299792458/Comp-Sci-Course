A brilliantly told parable - a one of a kind film. The aspect ratio listed for the film (IMDB) is 1.66:1, which is the Criterion ratio. The film is sometimes listed as 1.37:1 which has to do with the optical sound track. It appears a shade larger on TV than on the previously released disk.
  I am not a fan of the overpriced Criterion transfers although their extras are sometimes worth the additional money. Their Tunes of Glory release, for example, has a remarkable green line which appears in the middle of a crucial scene and dances around for quite some time before vanishing. Criterion never saw fit to mention this anywhere and even dealers initially thought it was a fault in the disk rather than in the transfer. As a result I am leery of the Criterion releases (and their "no tell" policy). The extras on this film may alone be worth the steep price Criterion is known for.
  Some people have held that older films may look worse on Blu Ray because imperfections become more obvious, but with this film it will be hard to tell until we see it.
