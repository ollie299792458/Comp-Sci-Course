Movie:
 I must admit this movie is the least of the Mad Max trilogy. Anyways, several years after the events of "The Road Warrior", "Mad" Max is still wandering the wastlands of the post-apocalyptic Australia. He shows up at a "semi-civilization" called, Bartertown. Where through events that would take to long to describe, he ends up being forced to fight in a arena called, Thunderdome. Where he soon escapes (creating alot of havoc for Bartertown) and escapes in to the desert. Where he is found bya bunch of Goonie-like kids. etc etc. The way I'm describing it must not seem to make alot of sence, but see it. Actully see it twice. The first time you see it, it really is not that good. But see it a second time, and POW! you like it! (POW ?) The worst thing about this movie is, the lack of highways, and roads, and Tina Turner as the leader of Bartertown, very bizarre. But Mad Max is Mad Max, so it can't be BAD, right? Lets pray Fury Road is as good as The Road Warrior. Movie-4 out of 5
DVD: The DVD is pretty [weak], a Theatrical trailer well what can you expect.
DVD-2 out of 5
