I got Excel Saga 1-3 for Christmas, and I love it! While I didn't laugh as hard as I could have, I was laughing a lot. Whether it was Ilpalazzo blowing Excel away when she wouldn't shut up (twice in fact, once with a bazooka!) or Hyatt's constant dying and fainting (I'm not sure whether she actually died all those times or not). There are lots of jokes that an American viewer wouldn't understand (hence the vid-notes, which are very helpful) and some that anime fans might recognize. Keep an eye out for one of Excel's neighbors who only speaks in subtitles!
Now, for the English version. This is the only one I've seen so far (I just got the DVD for Christmas yesterday) but the dubbing is very good. Excel's voice sounds perfect for her character (She talks so fast that all the words blend together in my brain!) and Hyatt's voice couldn't be any more perfect for her!
It is a little unsettling, but the sheer insanity of the show keeps it from getting too disturbing. Even Hyatt's constant dying/fainting spells and how often she coughs up blood are not as disgusting as they sound.
In short, if you like anime that has no real plot and is full of insanity, check this out! You're not likely to regret it!
