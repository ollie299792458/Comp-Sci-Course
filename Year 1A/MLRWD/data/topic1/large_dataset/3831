I saw this movie the other night, in the dark, with very low expectations.  Somehow, this movie failed to live up to the expectation that it would be aweful.

It should be noted that the trailer to this movie is many, many times better than any moment of the acutal film.  Julianne Moore's acting, and I love Julianne Moore, is histarical and bizarre.  Many times during this movie I laughed and smiled at what was going on, and the actors responses to it.  For example, in one scene someone falls out of a high building through a glass window and dissappears.  What's funny is that there is still glass where the man was, and yet, nobody walking down the street seems to notice that glass and wood just rained down upon their heads.

Furthermore, the storyline goes from sporadic and slightly interesting to totally goofy and hilarious.  There's some sort of vaccum in this movie also which seems to have a fun time eliminating people left and right (if you've seen the original trailer you might follow me here).  *Don't worry, I'm not giving things away...this was revealed in the trailer.*

Bottom line, the film has an intreguing storyline, upon reading, but once the film starts, the storyline is bogged by poor writing, poor editing, poor directing, and even poor acting.  This leads to poor sequences, a lack of climax ever, and virtually no suspense or interest.  The ending isn't strange, it's not a big twist, it's just stupid.  Nothing is explained, and I don't mean nothing is explained like David Lynch, I mean the storyline the movie trys to grasp is never in hand.  Not only do characters get sucked out of their houses in this movie into oblivion, but similarily so does the audiences cash and interest.  Wow, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, thank God for the unintentional humor.
