I got to read a small blurb about this release last year, and I've got a good vibe about this release. Back in the day when this movie was released, movie theatres would bid on carrying the film, and this movie in particular had a high price on it. However, this also meant that the release date was locked in. This movie went over budget in time as well as money, and the print that we all ended up seeing in the theatres was literally the first cut of the film. There just wasn't any time to do any additional editing. In many cases, the first take of a given scene was used just to get something together. The director had been asking for years to go back and recut the film, and last year, Paramount agreed. They even threw in some extra cash for some new special effect sequences, which I've seen still from for the remake of the planet Vulcan. I doubt they can help the whole story, but I'm looking forward to seeing a new vision of the story. Most of the information in this review was taken from the interview with the director in the December issue of TOTAL MOVIE, a magazine alas no longer in production.
