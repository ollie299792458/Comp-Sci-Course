I think that Le Nozze di Figaro is one of the greatest operas ever written. I own many recordings of this work. I have bought this DVD based on the recommendations of the reviewers, most of whom gave very positive feedback about this production. Perhaps I had high expectations, but after listening to this DVD I was disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this DVD, but then I have not yet seen a Figaro that I have not enjoyed. The music is superb and you can't help but revel in its beauty.

This DVD features great artists. Figaro, Susanna, the Count and the Contessa are truly great. However, Cherubino or Barbarina could be better.

It is understood that Cherubino, a 13 year old boy, is to be sung by a soprano. This is the reason why this role is played by a woman, but he should at least look like a boy or young man. This Cherubino definitely looks like a woman.  Barbarina is supposed to be about the same age as Cherubino, but looks much older in this production.

The sound quality is awful, especially when the singers move around the stage. This is especially true if you have high end equipment.

This production assumes that you either know the libretto or understand Italian. If you rely on the subtitles, you will miss most of the story line. Yes, you will get a general idea of what is going on, but you will miss many important (and humorous) lines.

Overall, it is a great DVD if you are very familiar with Mozart's work and want to enjoy another production of it. I certainly would not recommend it as your first Figaro DVD. Instead, I would strongly suggest the so called "Bohm's" edition, featuring Mirella Freni, Hermann Prey, Kire Te Kanawa, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. In my opinion, this is the best Figraro production ever.
