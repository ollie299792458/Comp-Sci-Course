I mostly went to see this movie because of all the commotion about it. I really do NOT trust film critics but I do trust the collective "taste" of many people. The movie was prety much all I heard it was: Frightful! 
Yes I found it a bit slow at times but the supsense was great! I could not decide if it was scary until the scene with the horse at the ferry boat. After that scene I took notice but nothing prepared me for the "girl coming out of the TV scene". This scene alone is worth watching the film for. The acting was great and the characters where people that I did care about.  
The only discusting thing about this or any other movie are the freaks that are too quick to down rate an otherwise great movie just because of their personal biases. Sadly most of them do not even seem to know what they are talking about missing the whole point at times but nevertheles can be prety vocal about their stupid opinions. It just anoys me when some wannaby film critic is expressing an opinion about something he hardly understood in the first place! It also seems that they are prety much the same people over and over again...a bunch of idiots that seem to hate prety much everything in their lives! 
Now, I know I sound a bit (a lot!) like the people I am bashing  but in all seriousness if someone has a different opinion and expresses together with some good reasons of why the feel this way (not the one sentence stupidities these morons are writting...) I absolutely respect them. everyone is entitled to an opinion as long as they KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT! 
For all of you horror movie fans out there: Do yourselves a favor and watch this movie. It is scary and inteligent and this is more I can say for a some other movies out there.
I hope you found this helpful. Enjoy!
