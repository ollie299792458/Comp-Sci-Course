This is the fourth installment of the legendary animated show from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, well maybe it's not legendary exactly but it is for fans of the show like me.  Anyway, a show like this is hard to describe but suffice it to say a whole lot of hilarity ensues.

  The show is based on the adventures of Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad, a talking Milkshake, Box of French fries with laser eyes and, well, a lump of meat.  The show opens with a dramatic intro featuring rap music and explosive theatrics.  But the show itslef is rather humdrum, in terms of action.  That is, there is little grandiose plots.  Rather its like Seinfeld, the characters find chaos and carnage in everyday situations like working at the mall or getting the power fixed.  Of course, not everything is so humdrum.  Occasionally they are visited by space Aliens called the Mooninites.  But usually the aliens just hang out and smoke weed and steal pornography.

  Anyway, this show is very hilarious and worth purchasing, however I would dare say that most of the people reading this review already know that.
