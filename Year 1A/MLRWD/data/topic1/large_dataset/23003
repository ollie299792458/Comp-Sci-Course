John Steinback's classic, Of Mice and Men, is an amazing book. The characters speak to you and you actually care about what happens to them. I think that's one of the hardest things to get readers to feel-- to have them care.

This wonderful film simply gives you a clearer image of what generally truly happened. When I first saw this film right after reading the book, I was quite surprised at how well suited the actors were for certain characters. I could imagine it, feel it, care about what happened next. Even though I had read the book, I was anxious and full of suspense to see what was next.

As many have said, there are some scenes in the movie that didn't happen in the book. Such as the scene with Curly's wife and George. She flirts with him and George doesn't really know how to back away. However, in the book, it states that George clearly wants nothing to do with her. There are some scenes in the movie, probably two at the most, that never happen in the book. But, I guess, if you picture it and think the way the characters would react, you could see it happening at one point or another.

All and all, I loved this movie. I rented it at first and had to buy it right after I returned it. Also, Gary Sinise fits George's part suprisingly very well. The two actors of Lennie and George were also the actors for the broadway version in Of Mice and Men, too! So they really know what they're doing, eh?

Believe me, you'll be satisfied with this movie. It'll capture the hearts of both the young and old.
