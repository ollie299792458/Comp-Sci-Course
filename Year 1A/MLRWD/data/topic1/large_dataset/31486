I own the movie on VHS and I can remember vividly the first time I saw it: It was during spring break in 1995. I visited my Dad here in Hammond (can it really be ten years?) when I rented it from Blockbuster Video. I watched it on a Saturday during the NCAA Basketball tournament and I can tell you that out of all of the movies that I've seen in my life "Mildred Pierce" is the most shocking movie I ever saw. The movie is filled with one stunning revelation after another, but none was no more bigger than the scene in which Mildred confronts her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) and as Crawford's character tears up the paper into pieces (was it really money?) Veda slaps her mother so hard she falls down on the stairs (you may recall earlier in the movie Mildred slapped Veda by accident; now Veda was getting her revenge). That was the most shocking scene I ever saw in a film; no movie that I have seen, past or present, comes close to that lightning bolt between Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth. As that weren't enough the film has TWO different perspecives on how Pierce's second husband got killed! For those who haven't seen it, they have to. It is a twisted movie and did I mention that Joan Crawford deserve the Oscar for Best Actress? (Memo to Hilary Swank: You are jack compared to the former Lucille Lusur!)
