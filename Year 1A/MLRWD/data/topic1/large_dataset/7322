"Bart Got a Room" pulls off a feat that we rarely see in movies anymore -- it's downright hilarious AND has terrific insight into teen life.

The acting is universally inspired with special mention going to Steven Kaplan, who beautifully underplays his role, and, of course, the ever-brilliant William H. Macy. Macy knocks it out of the park every time he's onscreen. Macy's performance, like the rest of the film, earns its laughs not with overblown zaniness, but with amazing subtlety. Watch this movie closely and you'll be rewarded.

The screenplay is solidly entertaining and funny throughout and simultaneously manages to stir genuine emotion without seeming to try. By the end of this comedy, you'll actually CARE about these people. How often does that happen in movies?

The film is directed with great visual flair and comic timing. It was shot in South Florida and, through masterful cinematography and attention to detail, the place just comes to life. The whole thing just has the feel of a labor of love.

Quite simply, this movie great fun to watch. You'll enjoy every minute.
