One of the greatest comedies of all time, A Night at the Opera is one of those films that just doesn't get stale. It's a movie that perfectly follows the Marx Brothers' recipe for their trademark mayhem: take a pompus, uptight institution--such as academia, medicine or politics--and trash it. In this case, it's the wild and wacky world of opera.

When opera singers Riccardo and Rosa are separated by the wicked Lassparri, it's up to Otis B. Driftwood, Fiorello and Tomasso to get them back together again, and help them become stars of the New York Opera Company. They do this by shredding a contract, stuffing fifteen people into a stateroom, shuffling beds around a hotel room, stealing the beards of three aviators, and turning an orchestra pit into a baseball diamond--among other inspired acts of lunacy. Does any of that really help? Maybe a little bit. But all you'll care about is that it's fun to watch!

There's a reason that, after seventy years, this film is still as popular as it is. All it takes is one screening to figure out what it is. Grab yourself some hard-boiled eggs and enjoy.

Highly Recommended!
