The Dancer Upstairs is an engaging movie simply for filming, production, and acting.  But it is the plot that distinguishes this movie most. It completely parts with the typical left-wing view of Latin America where the terrorists are enobolized and everyone else is either corrupt or stupid.  For anyone who has spent time studying terrorism around the world and in particular in Latin America this movie comes very close to describing reality.  First, the United States and Europe aren't the only places where there are thinking, professional police detectives.  Commit a crime in many Latin countries and they will hunt you down.  Secondly, terrorists are in the end the ultimate in corruption and evil.  Blind followers of Castro, the Sandanistas, Che Gueverra, etc will get a glimpse at their cowardly arrogance and murderous ways. All this captured in an intriguing story of an honest cop, a man with responsibilities, and desires.  Really good movie.  There are some loose ends, but not enough to rate less than 4 stars.
