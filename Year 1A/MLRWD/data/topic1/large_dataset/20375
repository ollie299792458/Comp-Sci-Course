The three stars are solely the arithmetic mean of a five-star show and a one-star DVD. I was excited before watching this DVD because it is the first DVD release of The Shield series released in the U.S in wide-screen format. I am not sure whether this transer is real-wide screen or simply 4:3 ratio cropped, and don't want to speculate about it. But I simply found the transfer not as good as the previous five seasons released by Fox. The transfers contain a significantly more amount of grain than the Fox releases which were consistently very high in quality. As a side gripe, the optional subtitles for the hearing impaired now have thicker fonts (and are yellow as opposed to white in previous seasons) and take up more screen space--a minor annoyance. By the way, Scene Selections and Play the Episode without Episode Recap options are also gone. That's right, no scene selections! It is likely that Sony doesn't see these DVDs as a cash cow like some other TV shows and therefore most likely produced this set on a much tighter budget than Fox did--probably same reason Fox sold the DVD rights to Sony in the first place. As a big Shield fan though, I find this kind of move unfortunate. Let's hope that Sony will do a better job for the Season 7 release.
