Before you invest in this DVD you should read all of the reviews, especially as it is getting harder to find, and more expensive. It has any number of characteristics - I won't say flaws - that may or may not put you off, and they are described in full elsewhere so I won't bother. I will say that this performance gets closer to my ideal of Hamlet then any other I've seen on stage or screen. Both the Olivier and Mel Gibson versions, for all their virtues, are too highly cut - too much of Shakespeare's poetry is sacrificed (even too much of the drama!) for cinematic brevity. Branagh's movie, on the other hand, is too long and in the end becomes something of an endurance test. I suspect (I haven't tested this theory) that in the interest of completeness his version conflates the Folio and Quarto versions of Hamlet, including lines from the Quarto that the Folio leaves out and vice versa. Modern scholars suspect that these two versions are deliberately different - possibly dating from two different periods of Shakespeare's life - and that to mix the two results in muddied motivation and dramatic incoherence. (For much more information on the various versions of this play, I recommend the introduction to the new Arden paperback edition, edited by Thompson and Taylor. They choose to present the Second Quarto intact.) At any rate, this performance with Burton et. al. seems to strike the perfect theatrical balance in regards to length and completeness - Shakespeare's plays were probably rarely performed uncut even in his day - and it communicates effectively what a stunning work of genius this play is. This is my desert island disc of Hamlet. If I get to keep two, my second choice is "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."
