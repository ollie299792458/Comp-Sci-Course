Great cast, led by Paul Newman, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon and of course Strother Martin. Great score. 
Surprisingly for a prison film, there is lots of humor, at the beginning some found in the notion that one could go to an oppressive road gang for just cutting the tops off of parking meters. Or, the woman washing her car with suds all over her breasts and DragLine's (G. Kennedy) great quote: "Anyone with a face so sweet... and a body like that MUST be named Lucille"! Unlike another reviewer, I was pleased to see a film about life in prison that did not include a rape scene.
The notion of a rebel against authority (remember, though, that Luke was not too much of a rebel, because he won a Silver Star in the war) is one that resonates with lots of folks (and not just yuppies or baby boomers). How can one not identify with Newman, who is less than enthused about a "lot of guys, spouting off a bunch of rules and regulations". ANYONE who ever wanted to say to a boss "just because its your job don't make it right" ought to be able to identify with Luke on some level.
But like many great films (among which I count this one), its a simple film. One guy who won't submit among a band of others who have decided that it was easier for them to submit. Another reviewer says its like a slow lazy day. Nothing wrong with that, and like a slow lazy day, this film it can be enjoyed over and over again, and comes around far too infrequently. To those who suggest this film is much ado about nothing, I commend the wisdom of Luke himself, who had the best line of the film: Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
