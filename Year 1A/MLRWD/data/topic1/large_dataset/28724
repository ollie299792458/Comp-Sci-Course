I recently saw Mulholland Drive and found it to be a bit too contrived from Lost Highway. This film is Lynch's best since Blue Velvet. The cinematography alone is enough to keep you watching. But the sheer weirdness of the film, the disjointed plotting and great performances make it a doubly rich treat for the mind and senses. Once again, Lynch plays with themes such as innocence, good, evil, the corruption of innocence, transformation, paranoia, dreams and nightmares. Glimpses of secret worlds that hide just behind the mundane. 
I'll leave the finer plot points to other reviewers. Here's what stands out. The film sticks with you for days. Like any good Lynch movie we find yourself asking "what did that scene mean?" for days after you've seen the movie. You walk away with one interpretation of the film by find yourself with a different one later, after you've though about it some more. You've felt compelled to tell other about this movie. You may have even gone on the Internet to get other people's opinion of what the film is supposed to be about. You want to buy the soundtrack. Lost Highway had the best soundtrack of any of the Lynch movies. Mulholland drive didn't live up to the standard set here. Robert Blake was sincerely scary - more so than the Cowboy of Mulholland Drive - although I found him interesting too.  Noir! Nobody does is better today than Lynch! Surreal Film Noir! Lynch practically invented it!
