Cate Blanchett is a chameleon actress.  She has played queens, yuppies, harlots, and gamblers, and she takes another stretch in THE GIFT.  She plays a psychic named Annie, tormented by visions of a local girl's death and by the death of her husband, who she was not able to save.  Her performance is the driving force behind this movie, which, without her, would have been somewhat mediocre.
Director Sam Raimi does a good job at creating a Hitchcockian suspense, and there are several opportunities in the movie for goosebumps to form on the back of your neck, but there are few true thrills.  The movie works much like THE OTHERS and THE SIXTH SENSE by employing several tricks, like a subtle twist at the end or the use of color to denote mood and tone.
The movie becomes a little hokey sometimes, especially when Hilary Swank is on the screen.  Her performance, while still good, was my least favorite.  The only scene where she truly delivers is when her husband, played to the hilt by Keanu Reeves, discovers her at Annie's house getting a reading.  Her face truly conveys the character's fear and "Oh no, here we go again" quality.  Giovanni Ribisi is effective as a mentally retarded boy who frighteningly confronts his father about his childhood abuse, but he also seems to just be playing an unstable version of his character in THE OTHER SISTER.  Other smaller characters, played by Gary Cole, Katie Holmes, and Rosemary Harris, are also effective.  Greg Kinnear is also good, but he seems a little out of joint, a little slippery when wet.
The movie delivers atmosphere and mood in maximum proportions, complete with all the eccentricities of a small Southern town, and apart from its slight wanderings into redneck territory, it entertains and keeps you guessing until the very end, well, almost until the very end.
