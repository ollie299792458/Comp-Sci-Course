There are some movies that are designed to intellectually challenge the viewer. This wasn't one of them. 
This movie is a tongue-in-cheek look at the old formula.... Aliens come to take over Earth. Mankind is on the verge  of being wiped out. Mankind uses its ingenuity and indominable spirit and  band together to defeat the aliens against incredible odds.
This is a  movie that may very well have set out to poke fun at its own genre, which  is something it must be commended for, intended or not. Don't you think  they knew that the audience would find it ridiculous that the scientist's  laptop would easily interface with the alien computer? Don't you think they  knew they were presenting us with characters who are the stereotypes of the  "unlikely heroes"? Don't you think that they knew how unlikely it  would be that an alien craft would use a flight stick so similar to one  used in a fighter plane and would be easily usable by humans? Of course  they did.
Fact is that this is a visually incredible movie with a plot  that holds the viewer at the edge of thier seat. I've watched the video  many times and feel that this is a movie to buy and put in your archive.  It's a spectacular piece of eye candy and you can't help but root for the  good guys.
So grab your popcorn, sit back, put your brain to sleep, and  enjoy the ride. You won't be sorry.
