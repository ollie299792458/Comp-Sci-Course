Of all the Horrorfest films for 2007, this one caught my eye from the trailer so it was the first I watched on DVD.  Others have reviewed the basic plot but to make a long story short... Ian Stone keeps getting killed in bizarre situations and wakes up in another life.  One day he's a hockey player, then an office worker, then a taxi driver.  But every time he wakes up, he brings elements of that former life with him.  Mostly his girlfriend and the demonic creatures that are murdering him.  Ian must figure out why these things keep killing him to save himself and the girl. (There.  Basic story with little spoilers)  This movie works because you know as little as Ian does and the fun comes in the solving of the mystery.  I don't think this should have been included in a "Horror" set because it is more sci-fi fantasy than classic horror.  (Although, if you would classify the tv version of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as horror, then this qualifies)  I would put this right up there with tv's "Buffy" because it has a lot of the same elements.  In fact, I wish this were a backdoor pilot because the end leaves it open for more storytelling and I would definitely watch.  So, don't go into this expecting "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  Go in with an open mind and you will find a little gem that is worth multiple viewings.
