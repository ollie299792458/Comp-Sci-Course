For some reason it just is. It's kinda for the 80-ish people. Well, I've never watched Big Daddy but it also sounds good. It has great characters on this, and I'm not really a Drew Barrymore guy. In that case I'm the minority again. For some it's fun to watch again and again. Anyways, it's pretty cool.
First, Julia (Drew Barrymore) likes this one guy named Glen. He's real rich and has almost everything. Especially for that time. Late in the movie she decides she doesn't like him, and it was just for the money. But I skipped a lot so it would be more fun for you to watch and my review would become dead. That's what I try doing with most of my reviews. Just getting sections, but later they see what REALLY happens.
Well, Adam Sandler's character is pretty funny on it too. He says this one song he made up was half in the breakup and half when they were together. You should REALLY watch it around that part. And he was also talking to Glen how it was funny that he (Glen) had the last name Gulia. And how if they married her name would be Julia Gulia. Glen didn't get it. 
This is overall essential no matter what them reviewers said. Also look at their reviews though so you can find out some more about this movie if you aren't sure right now.
