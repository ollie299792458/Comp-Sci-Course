American Wedding is vulgar and is definitely not as good as the first two Pie movies, but it's not really as bad as these elementary schoolers below say it is. With every girl from American Pie and American Pie 2 gone except Michelle but every guy returning except Oz, nearly half the important and most interesting characters have disappeared: Vicky, Heather, Nadia, Sherman, Oz, Matt Stifler. Even Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas from Halloween Resurrection) is barely in 'Wedding'. There's an added young character, though, Cadence, Michelle's sister. I say young because this is the first movie where we see Michelle's parents, and they're not really one of the top 10 main characters. There's also Bear, who's hilarious.

Stifler (Seann Scott) is really the star of the show, even though Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan have the top billing almost every time I see a 'Wedding' poster or fansite. Stifler acts like a really annoying child in this flick - more so than Pie 2. All he really thinks about is sex and insults people for no reason.

I recommend renting the film, but not buying. The rated and unrated versions are both on the unrated edition. The unrated cut contains an introduction by the writer. DVD extras include 4 featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes w/ intros, DVD-Rom and Cast/Filmmaker bios. Pay no attention to whatever you hear from children who are basically ten through twelve years old who shouldn't even be watching American Wedding in the first place. If you hear the same smack from a kid over thirteen, bashing the film, they behave like they're 11 anyways. As Stifler said, "F*** those f**k*rs."
