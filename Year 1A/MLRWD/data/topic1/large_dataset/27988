This series surpasses the Emily books. I've read all the L.M.Montgomery books, articles and letters. The acting is superb and the characters are better than I ever imagined. The first disk begins slowly with a younger girl acting as young Emily and it tells what happens to place Emily at New Moon. Then the next actress takes over as the continued Emily, and she becomes the real character of Emily. This isn't a child's series, though looking at the cover you'd think it was just for children. Emily's inherited "second sight" isn't hokey and very believable. The depiction of that era in history was like being there and witnessing the good and the ugly of real life. It's not candied and predictable.
It was all I could do to stop the disk and go on to work. I'll keep the whole series and look forward to anything that this production company makes of top quality and timeless viewing. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be absorbed in such an unusual and gripping series.
