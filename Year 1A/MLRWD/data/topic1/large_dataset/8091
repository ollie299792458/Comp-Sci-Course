I'm glad I missed this in the theatre. I spent 153 minutes squinting and craning my neck at the screen trying to see what was happening: the film is so dark it looks like they filmed it by candlelight. Absolutely horrid. Whereas the previous films in this series did a reasonably successful job of encapsulating the stories and filling in the back story, this film left out so much important detail that Snape's key pronouncement at the end, that he is the titular 'half-blood prince,' is a whopping 'So what?' moment that seems almost trivial. Great characters and major thematic elements are entirely marginalised or pushed so far to the periphery that the film feels lifeless and void.
Based on this clumsy adaptation, the fact that David Yates is going to be directing the final instalments does not bode well for the finale, unless he can learn to properly light scenes and not gut the story of its impact. Writer Steve Kloves and Editor Mark Day are to blame as well for robbing this film of all the magic viewers have come to expect from this series.
Read the book and forget this film exists. Besides, Hollywood will remake this series in a few years anyway...
