There are some Hollywood movies that are so over-done with the advertising and promoting you just want to dig yourself a hole and throw yourself in it. Then when you actually see the film you wonder why there aren't time-machines so you can go back and get the few hours you just wasted on seeing it. Then there are movies like The Iron Giant; movies that slip under the radar and are pure diamonds in the ruff. This is a family movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children.

The plot takes place in the 1950's during the height of the cold war when everyone is paranoid over nuclear attacks.

Hogarth is an imaginative little boy being raised by his single mother. Left home alone while his mother works a late shift at her waitress job, Hogarth ventures off into the woods near his house and discovers and saves the life of the Iron Giant. The Iron Giant crash landed on earth from his war ridden planet. Hogarth develops a friendship with the metal giant but soon realizes he has a dangerous side. The Iron Giant reacts (in a big way) defensively against attacks. So in other words, if he feels threatened, he goes into a sort of auto pilot mode and will attack the threat no matter whom or what that threat is. The giant realizes that it almost attacked his best friend and promises to be like Super man; good and non violent.

Naturally, it becomes rather difficult to conceal this large giant and a nosy government agent becomes suspicious thusly starts investigating the strange happenings that surrounds the giant. I don't want to tell too much about the plot because it's really a movie that you should see yourself. But it has such a beautiful message at the end. The animation is just superbly done. The emotion is captured so well in the characters and I love the 1950's feel.

You will not be disappointed in this movie regardless of your age.
