It's a Greek comedy! It's a Greek tragedy! It depends on your protagonist: Billy or Dr. Horrible. Can a super villain vanquish his nemesis and rule the world? Can a young man win the heart of the girl of his dreams? A man's got to do what a man's got to do.

If you don't know Dr. Horrible, stop reading about it immediately and pick up this DVD set. You won't be disappointed. The production quality is great! The music is sing-in-the-shower-tastic! It is short and leaves you wanting more, but it is priced appropriately, and more quality work is sure to come.

If you do know Dr. Horrible, then you will be pleased with this DVD set. Get off the laptop monitor and dance and sing in your living room to beautiful widescreen 480 lines of awesome! The picture looks great, it really does! There are handfuls of extras, including commentary and behind the scenes, which make you just want to hit play again and again to see what you missed the first time.

It's a brand new day!
