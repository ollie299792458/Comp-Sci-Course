This movie gets four stars, because it's so terribly cheesetastic.  The first two are among my favorite "serious" horror movies of all time, but this one gets a good review because it's so freaking funny and bad.  Disappointing (thus four rather than five stars), because it takes the franchise in this direction when it was doing so good as a seriously scary and good franchise for the first two installments, but you WILL laugh when Pinhead possesses a cocktail and skewers some club chick's head with it.  And it's got some great one liners, which are only made funnier because the first two weren't like that.  Seeing Pinhead deliver hilarious lines, and not to mention some of the Cenobites themselves that he creates, honestly had me laughing.  The camera head guy with his zoom lens of death and the chick with the cigarette sticking out of the bloody hole in her throat in particular.  If you've been living in a hole for the last 20 years and have only seen Hellraiser 1 and 2, don't buy this thinking you're going to get a seriously good, scary movie (props to 6 and 7 for getting back to the dark side of the franchise).  Buy it because you want to watch a movie to laugh at with a group of friends.  Honestly, though, I think anyone viewing this page already knows what they're getting into.
