At first, I must mention that I'm not reviewing the movie here, only the 2-disc edition of it.

At first I was a bit dissapointed because there's no commentary. But well, the rest of the features actually makes up for it.

What really suprised me is that all the extra features are subtitled. I know that many people don't care about subtitles but we must remember that there are hearing imapired people and it's sad that on most dvds only the movie is subtitled.

But let's get to the features:
The first disc includes of course, the movie and deleted scenes. There's something like 1,5 hour of deleted material! It includes scenes that simply weren't used in the movie, extended scenes and scenes with alternate lines as parts of the dialogues were improvised in this movie.
The second disc includes as follows:
- "Popcorn Porn: The Making of Zack and Miri"- it's almost 1,5 hour "making of" documentary, while most releases have only half on our of this kind of material, so big plus for this.
- "Money Shot Webisodes" - a series of webisodes, again, there's a lot of material here, it's pretty funny to watch
- "Comic-Con 2008" - a recording of Q&A session at comic-con
- "Outtakes, Ad-libs and Bloopers" - I guess it's a standard, but again, a very funny material
- "Seth vs Justin: Battle For Improvisional Supremacy" - it includes many alternative line from the conversation beetween Zack and that gay porn dude as this scene was improvised.

All in all I give this release a 5 star review as there's a lot of extra material that's funny and makes you enjoy the movie a lot longer than just its 1,5 hour length.
