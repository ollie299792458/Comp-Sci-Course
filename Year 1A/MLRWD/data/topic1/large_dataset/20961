To start off, i thought this movie was halarious the first time i saw it, even though i did notice a lot of deragatory things to say about it.  For one, Heather Graham does a completly horrible acting job in it.  She has  this blank look on her face through the whole movie, like she's trying to  figure out exactly what she's supposed to do.  Another thing is that this  is the most commercialized movie i have ever seen, about every 10 minutes  of the movie some sort of youth oriented product was advertised, like a  brand new vw bug time machine, numerous "hot pocket" references,  starbucks, hieniken, and many others.  It was almost like watching tv, and  every so often you get a commercial break.  I'll mention that the stupid  scene where austin accidentally drinks a cup of Fat Bastards dung is pretty  gross and didnt really seem to belong in the movie, I'm sure the big  hollywood producers forced it into the movie because of course, any movie  in june or july just has to have a few gross-out scenes (when did that  start?).  But if you liked Dr. Evil like i do, you'll love this movie.  Because he simply carries the movie, austin seems more like a supporting  character campared to Dr. Evil.  Austin seems to be a completly different  person than he was in the first film, even his accent sounds different.  I  think its because austin pretty much shagged himself out in the first one  and they can't really find anything else for him to do.  But dr.evil is a  pretty timeless character, i dont think i could ever get tired of his  humor.  So if you like austin, dont buy it.  But if you like Dr. Evil, grab  this thing right now!
