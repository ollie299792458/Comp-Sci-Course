Set in 2259, the story centers around Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a New York cabby and former space Marine, unwittingly drawn into a race to save the world from (in a very literal sense) Ultimate Evil. Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is a beautiful alien, his strangest fare ever, who ultimately holds the key to defending Earth (and who knows how to kick butt and take names). In a twitchy, scene-chewing performance, Gary Oldman plays Zork, Evil's henchman-on-Earth. In the space of a couple of days, these three characters race to find four alien stones, bring them to Egypt, and assemble a weapon to repel Evil. Along the way they meet a space DJ, an alien diva on a secret mission, shape-changing alien agents, and giant alien soldiers.
"The Fifth Element" is a visual feast; the look and feel of the movie are truly the stars. Throughout the adventure, viewers are treated to a kaliedoscopic vision of the future unlike anything portrayed before on the screen. Brightly colored, weirdly and wonderfully designed: multiple viewings are *required* to catch every detail of the set decoration and fabulous costumes. The soundtrack is infectious.
My choice to call the flick "sci-fi" is deliberate. It features aliens, space ships, a beautiful leggy redhead who kicks major butt, and a zippy adventure, but no science whatsoever...and that's just fine. The Fifth Element is a pyrotechnic, psychedelic, chase flick from one end of the universe to the other and back again. It's a Saturday afternoon serial with capital-A attitude and loads of style. Highly recommended.
