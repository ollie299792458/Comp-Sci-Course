(This DVD+CD was bought at Amazon.com)  I bought this Tull DVD + CD from Amazon.com because I wanted to make sure I got it new.  Over the years I've seen Tull in concert 12 times, with 8 of them being at Madison Square Garden.  I've read where some people have complained about the sound.  But what I liked about the DVD WAS the sound.  They seem to have eliminated a lot of fan noise which made it sound better.  When you purchase a ticket to a Tull concert, it says Jethro Tull in Concert.  It doesn't say "plus lots of annoying fans screaming and yelling."  So that was a big plus for me.
 Overall, I liked the DVD but don't ever remember seeing that bassist as Ian said:  "Filling in on short notice for John Glascock.  On short notice."  Glascock had heart problems and died a short while later, unfortunately.  It bothered his friend, Barrimore Barlow so much, that he didn't want to play anymore.
 I was looking for one thing on that DVD that Tull must have done a few years earlier.  Perhaps it was in '75 or '76, they played at the Garden and right at the start of "Cross Eyed Mary" they used an oscilloscope on Ian Anderson while he played the opening flute solo.  It was perhaps the best thing I ever saw him do, his arms moving, his legs moving as they focused that white blinking light on him.  Then once the flute solo was over, the stage lights went back on and Ian started the vocal.  Seeing that left me stunned.  The crowd applauded.  I don't know why they haven't put that on film?
 Anyway, if you've never seen Tull in concert, this is the DVD for you.  And if you have, there are still things you'll see on the DVD that you might have missed before.  Enjoy!
