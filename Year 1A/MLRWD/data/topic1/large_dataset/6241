The best part about the DVD version--apart from finally seeing the film in letterbox--was how it maintains that it's nonfiction docudrama instead of pulp sci-fi action comedy.  The "Pinky Carruthers' Unknown Facts" subtitle overlay track pops up some hilarious pseudotrivia and commentary on how Rawhide isn't dead but comatose, that the Lectroids' holoprojector formed the basis for the DVD player, that the violent acts perpetrated by the Red Lectroids had to be toned down from what "really" happened, that Buckaroo took Einstein's preserved brain with him in the Jet Car at the beginning, and quotes like "Comfort the afflicted, afflict the comfortable."  In addition to the deleted footage (Penny's lament included an unemployment agent telling her to be a hooker, the John Emdall holo reacted to Perfect Tommy's commentary on Soviet jumpiness), it allows you reintegrate the original "home movie" opening sequence featuring the death of Buck's parents.  It even includes the Hong Kong Cavalier discography, Jet Car specifications (it has VTOL capabilities!), a Buckaroo interview by Reno, and the preliminary CGI trailer to the rumored follow-up TV series "Ancient Secrets &amp; New Mysteries."
