Don Juan isn't just a great romantic comedy; it is THE romantic comedy for anyone looking for just as much romance as laughs. 
The movie deals with a mental patient (Johnny Depp)who believes he is the legendary Don Juan, greatest lover in all the world. Marlon Brando plays Dr. Jack Mickler, the retiring pshychatrist who tries to cure him. 
After Don Juan tries to kill himself and winds up in a mental hospital, Jack listens to him tell his life story and decides how to interpret it. 
The cast is excellent. Johnny Depp is as soulful as he is sexy. Faye Dunaway is perfect as Jack's loving, devoted and somewhat neglected wife. And you can't help falling in love with Dr. Mickler.

This movie is quirky, heartwarming, funny, romantic, sexy and beautiful. It will make you want to fall in love if you're single, and make you want to rediscover your partner if you're not.
I highly recommend you buy this movie and watching it with your boyfriend/girlfriend, fiance, or husband/wife immediately.
