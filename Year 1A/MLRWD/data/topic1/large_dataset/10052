This is a Great old Invisible Man collection and was well worth the price. The box was a little wider but no taller than an ordinary dvd case. These films are a great series of the black and white Invisible man movies. Its great watching the old special effects and style. They are a little old but fast moving movies, if you wanted more modern color try Memoirs of an Invisible Man with Chevy Chase. If you like old monster movies you should have this set.

Watching WW2 films I was most interested in The Invisible Agent in this box set. It seemed to have a good budget and was filmed well for its time. As with other films of its era it makes the nazis look foolish but not as bad as 'Hitler, Dead or Alive'. The gestapo hunt for the Invisible Man along with interference of their allies the Japanese for the secret of invisibility while the invisible man runs to escape the nazi country with information about a nazi attack against the US. There are aircraft, explosions, uniforms and most of the film is behind enemy lines spy action. A very cool addition to any WW2 collection.
