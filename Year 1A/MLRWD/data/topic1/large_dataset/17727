After trying for months to schedule a childbirth class that would fit into both my husband's and my own schedule, this turned out to be a great alternative!  With only 3 weeks to go we found ourselves in quite the predicament when it came to knowledge of childbirth!  This was a great way to experience childbirth classes in the privacy of your own home while lounging around!  We did not feel constrained for time and could watch the classes when they were convenient for us.  My sister just had a baby and watched some of the classes with us. She had endured the long, boring, and inconvenient classes at the hospital and wishes now that she would have known of this video!  The information was so helpful and I feel like I have so much more control over my pregnancy and labor and delivery.  I will not, however, lie and tell you the classes were all roses to sit through.  As most people have stated, Sheri's humor (if that's what you want to call it) can be somewhat annoying at times.  If you can just ignore her goofiness and absorb the information she is giving, this is the perfect childbirth class experience.  (oh yeah, the classroom paricipants have to be the dullest people I have ever seen!  Where do they find these people!)
