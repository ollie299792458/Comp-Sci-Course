If you think you're gonna get a lot of "NYUKS" in this movie you're wrong. This movie was made with Curly JOE, not the late
Curly Howard, who invented the nyuck,nyuck,nyuck, who was dead at the time. I guess that numbskull of his couldn't save him.
Curly Joe was a replacement who's very similar to the original Curly. Just doesn't say NYUK! anymore. Well, about Snow White.
This is actually, stooges aside, a very good version of the fairy tale, minus the Seven Dwarfs,replaced by....you guessed it........the knuckleheads. Snow White actually ice skates like a pro in this version.But that doesn't impress her stepmother who is jealous of her beauty, and wants her done in.But not if Mr. Prince Charming can prevent it. Ol' Charming is-naturally-charming, no thanks to his ventriloquist doll named Quinto. He is part of the three stooges' minstrel show. The kindly clowns care for him while he suffers from amnesia.Doesn't even know he's the prince since he got kidnapped by the evil stepmother and Count Dracula-or a near relation of his-as a boy prince,bumped his head, and got rescued by The YouKnowWho's.As you can see the stepmother is quite nice, except when she can't help it, RIGHT? WRONG.RIGHT,THAT'S WRONG!Is everything all right?RIGHT! BOINKBOINK! Whatsa matter with you?! The bottom line is...Queenie Stepmom wants a double kingdom all for herself,S.White's and P.Charming's. To conclude, Moe the Mighty, Curly the Cunning, and Larry the Lucky must help Snow and Charming regain their rightful thrones,battle evil villains in swirling sword fights,find true love and
live happily ever after. BUT-can Snow White resist the POISONED
APPLE(or the Polluted Pippin)? Will the Prince lose her forever to the SLEEPING DEATH??? And finally,is this movie worth watching? SOITENLY!!!
