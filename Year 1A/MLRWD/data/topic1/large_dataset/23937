I&#65533;m a total fan of this movie, though I can&#65533;t seem to come up with a satisfactory explanation why. I&#65533;ll admit the acting is amateurish, the plot is ridicilous and the effects&#65533; well&#65533;, but there&#65533;s just something about &#65533;The Evil Dead&#65533; that makes it a 5 star movie in my world. Maybe it&#65533;s that weird low-budget charm, or the fact that Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi and the rest seem like such nice guys. I dunno.
One thing&#65533;s for sure, the numerous people out there calling this the scariest movie ever, really should watch more movies. Unlike it&#65533;s sequels, this is actually meant to be scary, but fails in just about every way a movie can fail in that respect. Where it succeeds, however, is at entertaining. 
The plot goes something like this: Five teens, who for some reason find themselves in a remote cabin in the woods drinking berry drinks, accidentally play back a recording containing portions of the dreaded Book of the Dead, causing all hell to break loose. That&#65533;s basically it. Exept this movie somehow manages to pull it off, through the combination of a great location, sheer imagination, and at times wildly inventive camera work (foreshadowing the excellent Evil Dead II). 
This movie was considered quite gory for it&#65533;s time (1982 or thereabout), but the low-budget effects have lost most of their impact over the years. Or maybe I&#65533;m just being insensitive... 
This DVD has some nifty extras, including a huge still gallery, trailer, and 20 mins of hilarious alternate footage (plenty of demon-posessed growling here). The second commentary track, by Bruce Campbell, is a textbook example of how commentary tracks should be done. Informative, witty, and in some ways more entertaining than the movie itself, it&#65533;s worth the price of the disc alone.
