well - what can you say about this one? Even if you're a fan of cheap, crappy, low budget movies, you probably still know to steer clear of anything that comes out of the Asylum, right? I mean - who is actually buying "transmorphers" right? They had their, to date, best movie with last year's "Zombie Apocalypse" and, lets face it, that movie still left a lot to be desired. So needless to say, I went into this one with really low expectations and high hopes.

But guess what? This movie was SOOOO much better than it had ANY business being!!! I mean, yes, it had some of the standard "asylum" issues of unimaginative and static cinematography throughout about 80% of the movie, cheap fake beards, too-clean and cheap costumes, and some campy acting in a lot of the supporting cast. But outside of that you get a really fun romp! The writer really nestled this plot into the confines of actual history - meaning that if this "actually" happened, history would have played out the way that it did in real life. I mean  the ENDING was AWESOME. Seriously, I was left stunned with its depth and impact. I even feel that if the Asylum knew what kind of a gem they had on their hands, they would have found some kind of way to mess it up on purpose because this movie is a blast.

There are lots of cameos from historical figures (the best of which is another future president), Abe killing lots of zombies, and a plot that does a minimum amount of meandering. If you like zombies, and you like history, you will like this silly romp. If asylum keeps putting stuff like this out (which i doubt) they might end up getting some respect.
