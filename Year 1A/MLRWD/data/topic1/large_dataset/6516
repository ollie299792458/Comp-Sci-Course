True, the story is more predictable them most, but it's still a cute movie. The script is well written and this shows through in the performances by Cusack, Lane, and Plummer. This is not an academy award winner, and shouldn't be criticized as one that could have been. It's a story about two people who lost, by divorce, what they perceived as their 'one true love', only to find that dating today is more of a miss then a hit.

As far as character development, I found little flaw in them because I could relate to both characters after my own divorce. Many a time did I find myself eating over the kitchen sink or watching a totally love-struck movie and feeling the twinge of loneliness. We all go to family and friends in times of need (even if they perceive it more then we do), and the secondary characters in this film are rife with help, humor, and warmth. Although the plot is predictable, the characters seem more real then most on-screen performances (I believe this is why the actors/actresses may be more heavily criticized then in prior projects).

You may not watch this one 10 times in your life, but it's still worthy of a place in your collection. I've owned this for a few years and I still smile when I watch it.
