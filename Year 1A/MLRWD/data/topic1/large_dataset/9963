For accuracy, this film ought to have a couple dozen stars. The only scenes which are included in the movie but not written originally in the book are quite strongly implied in the book and need elucidation in the screenplay version. I have never seen a movie that stuck so amazingly close to the book from which it was taken, and so beautifully followed the descriptions within the book, making it a rich experience for those with vivid imaginations. When I first saw Mr. Sir, I was taken aback -- he looked EXACTLY like I had imagined. The rest of the characters were just the same.

For general quality, it deserves the highest rating one could give. The acting is superb, especially when you consider it was done by a group of teenaged boys, the script is delightful, much of it taken word-for-word from the book, and there is very little objectionable material: a perfect family movie. There's a great balance of mystery, suspense, and humor (in particular, the thread of Elya and Madame Zeroni is comically hyperbolic, reflecting the comically hyperbolice way that "Caveman's" grandfather looked at life), with the book's intricate play of symbolism.

I read the book about two years ago, and the appearance of a movie didn't excite me much, but now having watched it twice in a row this week, I can say nothing but that I was extremely impressed.
