Although there are already close to 200 reviews for this movie here, I love this movie so much that I have to add my own two cents.
Everything about this film is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue (the main drawing  point), the cast selection (which is flawless), the scene shooting... One  fascinating aspect of this movie is that the humour goes from being subtle  to over the top in the same scene and they're both equally effective. The  dialogue is fast-paced, but after you watch it a few times, you begin to  pick up the subtleties within the film. 
Another thing, many people  complain about the plot being too weak, but this is more than just another  kidnapping plot. The actual plot itself is quite complex, and only after I  watched the film many times did I have a cohesive idea of what happened.  
This is most likely THE funniest movie I have ever seen. A lot of the  humour is subtle, but totally hilarious. The funniest main character (in my  own humble opinion) would have to be Walter. Maybe because the character  reminds me of some aquaintences of mine, but he is just so bizarre yet  believable at the same time. 
As for my favorite supporting character, I  think I'd have to go with the popular opinion and choose Jesus. This  character is the funniest thing I've ever seen. His whole demeanor is just  classic. Cocky and perverted. 
There are so many sub-plots in TBL that  it's neccesary to watch it over and over again to fully absorb it. And  after you do that, you'll still watch it over and over just for sheer  enjoyment.  This is the only movie that my entire cirle of friends has  embraced. 
One more thought....notice how most of the reviews here for  TBL are either five stars or one? I guess this just seperates those who  "get it" from those who don't.
