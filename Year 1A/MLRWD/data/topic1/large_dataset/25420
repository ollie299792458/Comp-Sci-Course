'Fess up, everyone, Robin Williams is one of the best actors in the world today.  Remember 'Good Morning Vietnam'?  'Life According to Garp'?  'Dead Poet's Society'?  'Awakenings'?  'The Fisher King'?  'Insomnia'???  Ok, maybe not 'Insomnia' so much, but c'mon~ Williams ROCKS!  Well, guess where it all started?  Yeah, yeah, he was on Laugh In and Mork and Mindy and SNL and 'Can I do it Til I need Glasses?', but that's all small stuff compared to the greatest movie Robin Williams made in all of 1980 ~ "POPEYE"!!!  This movie has absolutely everything necessary to make a great movie - Popeye beating the heck out of a room full of thugs, songs about food, Bluto punching stuff and knocking down large portions of a town, a cute baby, Bluto singing about how mean he is, and a guy getting kicked so hard in the butt that he flies off into the ocean!  Plus Shelly Duvall!  WoW!
And it has some of the funniest moments in the world, like when Popeye is trying to convince Poopdeck Pappy that he's the father that Popeye has been searching his whole life for:
Popeye: We got the same bulgy arms.
Poopdeck Pappy: No resemblence.
Popeye: We got the same squinky eye.
Poopdeck Pappy: What squinky eye?
Popeye: We even got the same pipe, Pap.
Poopdeck Pappy: You ijit, you can't inherit a pipe! 
The movie has 'Blockbuster' written all over it, so why is it not out on DvD yet?  I can only assume that Paramount pictures is producing the DvD right now and stuffing it with so much behind-the-scenes goodness and alternative endings that it has taken 24 years for the DvD to finally reach our hands.  But when it does, I will be SO ready.  And so will you if ya knows whak's good for ya's!
