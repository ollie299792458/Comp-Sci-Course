When I first saw this movie on DVD, I couldn't believe that it did poorly at the box office. That's because, in my opinion, it's a lot better than "Arachnophobia"! I like the cast members, especially David Arquette, Kari Wuhrer, Doug E. Doug & Scott Terra. I also like the city's name in which the movie is based: Prosperity. What's also neat is that various types of spiders, although most of 'em are CGI, which is also done perfectly, are used: Trapdoor spiders, jumping spiders, a tarantula, etc. Also, everybody in the crew that worked on this film, from producers and directors to composers and screenwriters, did a fantastic job. Regarding the spiders, I love the high-pitched noises that they make when they get hit or killed. There's also lots of funny scenes like when the jumping spiders go after the motocross racers. I also like the many bonus features, from the short film, "Larger Than Life", to the "Creepy, Crawly Giants" essay. The last thing that I love about the movie is it's title "Eight Legged Freaks", great name! So, I recommend this movie to anyone that isn't afraid of, and loves, spiders, or loves action-filled sci-fi/comedy movies because, believe me, it is TERRIFIC!
