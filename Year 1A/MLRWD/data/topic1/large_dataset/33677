What struck me most about this movie from the start was it's wonderful simplicity. I'm not referring to a laziness in plot or cinematography - I found nothing wanting on either front. Rather, Prime was a welcomed release from the big budget, unrealistic romantic comedies that do more to market candy-pop imagery of what adult relationships should resemble than to provoke thought, emotion and laughter in the right proportions. It was a relief that neither comedic nor emotional scenes were exaggerated to the point of taking the viewer on a tangential trip away from the story.

Something else worth noting is that writer and director Ben Younger did well in integrating the characters and their environment. Though Prime took place in New York, it wasn't excessively and shamelessly about New York. You could tell it was written and directed by a native who was able to focus on the elements of the city that mattered to the story without insertion of the expected cliches.

Overall, my wife and I enjoyed the film and we would both recommend it.
