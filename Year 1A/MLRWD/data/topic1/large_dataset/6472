I bought this simply because I am a horror fan and thought this might be the different movie that not too many people know about, that has something special to offer.A nice cover, a fairytale like name.Oh my poor fifteen dollars, how i wish I had kept you.

The pace of this movie is what really nails me.It goes on about the daily life of this family, slowly revealing tidbits to keep you hanging on for that great moment.When you start to say"hey when is something going to happen?", soon something small happens.Something just enough to make you want to watch and hope like hell that the next "thing" is actually worth watching, because the last "thing" sucked.Finally, at the end of the movie, is the twist.Instead of going off on a rave about how great the build up was, I was left saying to myself"thats it? I waited...for THAT?!" The twist takes away from other small elements introduced throughout to suggest a haunting, and is used to throw you off balance.Oh thats the plot, you should say.If the house is haunted, I cant say for sure.Either way its dissapointing to know that nothing is really done or came about of the haunting.Instead, a twist.I was going to complain about a key moment here, but I am avoiding spoilers at all costs.

I didnt ruin the movie for you if you want to actually watch it-my opinion is not everyones, and im sure someone liked this movie or is still willing to watch it even after my review.But I do warn that the praise for this movie is truly lost upon me,and the same may happen to you.
