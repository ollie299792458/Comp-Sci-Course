(...) "...Pluto Nash" has lots of action, great special effects, an all star cast and it's got its funny moments, too. What more should people expect? Perhaps it's because they're expecting a gut-buster of a comedy like many of Eddie Murphy's other movies. If you are expecting this to be a knee-slapper, then you won't like it either. But why should all of Eddie Murphy's movies have to be gut-busters? Many reviewers disliked his movie "Showtime", I admit it wasn't a knee-slapper, but it was a pretty good movie. "...Pluto Nash" has lots of action, great special effects, an all star cast and it's got its funny moments. What more should people expect? My only complaint is that the curse words and sexual content in it blown it for me. Why does Eddie Murphy still think it's cool to curse? I believe cursing shows stupidity and I know he's not stupid. Anyhow, He doesn't curse all that much in it but it only hurts a movie that could have been so much more enjoyable. If you only collect Oscar Award winning movies then this movie should never grace your very thin collection of movies. If you just like to watch movies then this one is a must rental, at least. If you're a die hard DVD collector then "THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH" is a must have. In my opinion...it's a very neat and nicely done action-packed sci-fi and a honor to have in my DVD collection!
