I believe the phrase "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" was probably  first used in 1993 when this movie was remade with Don Johnson, Melanie Griffith and John Goodman.  While good actors starred in the remake, Judy Holliday really is Billie Dawn! Her chemistry with William Holden and Broderick Crawford is off the charts, and their comedic timing is phenomenal. A supposed dumb blonde, this ex-showgirl is anything but dumb.  She starts out believing that as long as she knows how to get the "things" she wants she has all the knowledge she needs.  But when a handsome reporter (Holden) arrives to get the story on Billie's crooked and abusive boyfriend (Crawford), he hires the reporter to "smarten her up".  Billie learns a lot during this process about herself and the "things" she really wants.  While Billie and the reporter are naturally and predictably falling in the love, they also discover that Billie has had control of the boyfriend's money and companies all along.  Since the boyfriend uses his money to illegally "persuade" government officials, Billie and the reporter use this new information to "persuade" her now ex-boyfriend to do the right thing before Billie and the reporter leave together and, we assume, live happily ever after.  Since All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard are 2 of my favorite movies, it would have been impossible for me to vote for the Best Actress Academy Award in 1950, but Judy Holliday deservedly won it for her portrayal of Billie Dawn beating out Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson. This is not a deep, complicated movie.  It's fun and funny with some serious situations, and the young William Holden is not bad to look at either.
