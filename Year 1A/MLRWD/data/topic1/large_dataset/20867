Bruce Campbell is a gifted actor, and he gives his best performance to date in Bubba Ho-Tep. He plays Elvis Presley who is now living in an East Texas retirement home where no one believes he is really The King. In a flashback told by the bed-ridden Elvis, we see that he got tired of all the fame, fans, and money. So he switched places with the best Elvis impersonator. Now that he is an old man in a retirement home, no one believes he is the real Elvis. That is expect for his fellow retiree and friend, a black JFK (Ossie Davis). Throw in a soul-sucking, cowboy hat-wearing, 3000-year-old mummy named Bubba Ho-Tep and you have this bizarre comedy/drama/horror/faux biopic film that believe it or not, is an emotional movie that deals with how iconic celebrities and the elderly are looked upon.
Even though the plot of this film is unlike any other film, the characters have such an oddly emotional appeal that you go along with the story all the way. You really believe that Elvis is Elvis. The characters are played with sincerity.
Most people will recognize Bruce Campbell as the star of the Evil Dead films and from his small roles in the Spider-Man series. Campbell looks, talks, and acts just like an elderly Elvis might. He is really wonderful as an aging Elvis.
This is a great film.
