I loved Ocean's Eleven--the clever screenplay, the atmosphere of fun and hijinks, and the Hollywood glamour meets Vegas glitz feel of the whole affair combined to make an entertaining movie. It wasn't an Oscar-caliber film, but it wasn't an embarassment to Steven Soderbergh, either.

The sequel may cause Steven to cringe when he looks back on it. Featuring all manner of experimental camera work, for which the director has become known after Traffic, it also features a storyline so convoluted that you'll spend most of the movie going, "Huh?" By assuming that our bond with the characters from the first film will carry over to the second, Soderbergh grants himself the freedom to pack four hours of plot into a two-hour window with little explication and even less character development.

The resulting mess is somewhat redeemed by the sheer star power, but even the sudden appearance of Bruce Willis cannot quite save a pivotal scene that plays on the fame of one of the stars. Surely there were better uses to which a cast and director of this magnitude could have been put. Pray that Soderbergh doesn't tempt fate and make "Ocean's Thirteen."
