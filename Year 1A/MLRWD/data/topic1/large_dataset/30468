While it's very exciting to receive 50 movies at once (even though these horror films and gory exploitationers would hardly qualify as "must-sees"), I hesitate to recommend this set due to the bargain-basement quality. Yeah, sure, I expected to be somewhat disappointed by the video-transfer picture level, but on some of these movies the picture is so dark and murky (not to mention in the wrong aspect ratio) that it really ruins the film-watching experience. "Deep Red" by Dario Argento is considered a classic of the genre, but on this set Argento's inventive style is damaged by a print that makes his visual clues impossible to understand: If you can't read what a dying character scrawls in the dust with her finger because the film's transfer is so fuzzy, that's a real problem that will affect anyone's enjoyment of the movie. "Horror Express" is another favorite I've seen many times, but on this set the picture is murkier than it was when we were watching it back in the '70s, when our family TV used a single antenna, long before we had cable! Buy this, as well as the "Drive-In Classics 50-pak," at your own risk, I suppose.
