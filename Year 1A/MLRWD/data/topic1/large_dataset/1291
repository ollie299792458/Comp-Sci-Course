Well, to start, the soundtrack for this movie is great! It really takes you back to the 80s. Mickey Rourke's character was very mysterious and Kim Bassinger's character was that of a woman of the 80s when sex was on the cusp of change, on the cusp of an era where you would begin to see it and hear it more. I like Rourke's character because of the experimental nature of it. Maybe I'm into these things, maybe I'm not, but his facial expressions and demeanor were on point! Bassinger often does well in films and she did not spare this one, even at her young age. She had all the vulnerabilities of a woman and her acting was believable. Worth watching. Very intimate sex scenes. They were not porn for me, just parts of a good movie. I actually noticed the cats in the movie. I'm sure they were on purpose, but there was a cat at Bassinger's house that was sort of profound and one in the alley with a rat in his mouth when they were running from the men. There was actually a 3rd but I can't remember where. I wonder why the cats? I liked the cats, though. I liked the reggae music infused in and the song by Eurythmics blew my mind! A great 80s flick with all the elements- music, love, love-making, art, food, flea market shopping, dancing, running through the streets laughing (not so much necessary), friends, Billie Holiday. What more can you ask for? I'm sad it was only 9 1/2 weeks! They should have just gone 10! Furthermore, I always notice editing mistakes in movies and at 19:46 there is one! They are in the art gallery and in one scene she has on a white glove and then a second later no glove! Funny.
