Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely lifeless performance as the interpreter of the title in this curiously flat Sidney Pollack film. THE INTERPRETER is unique as it is the only film ever shot on location inside the United Nations building in New York.

Kidman plays Sylvia Broome, a minority White expatriate from a politically torn racially-mixed African nation. Members of her family have died due to the violence in her native land, and other friends and relatives who have remained behind are backing one or another contender for the Presidency of the fictional country. Kidman becomes the centerpiece of a massive international investigation after she ovehears discussion of an assassination plot against the despotic President, who is scheduled to address the United Nations. Sean Penn plays the govenment agent who is assigned to simultaneously protect Kidman, foil the plot, and find out what she really knows and where she really stands.

THE INTERPRETER has all the elements to make up a grand espionage drama, but Pollack and the all-star cast fail to ignite this film. THE INTERPRETER should have worked but it doesn't, leaving it the sort of film that cries out for a remake the day shooting wraps. The story plods along at an elephantine pace; the willowy Kidman is too morally ambiguous to gain the audience's sympathy; Sean Penn is convincing but cranky. No one seems to speak over a murmur even at the most dramatic moments. The contrivance of a fictional country is far too quaint for the world-is-the-size-of-a-grape 21st century. In the end, the requisite suspense simply never builds, leaving THE INTERPRETER an intelligent, well-made, well-acted, and supremely boring film.
