Update to this review (March 2009) Sony has re-released this title on DVD so it is now available for purchase again.

Plenty of other reviews have summarized the plot and voiced concerns about the acting so I won't add to that.  The acting isn't perfect, there are some "loose ends" and the dialogue takes some getting used to.  But it's a brilliant film in many ways and very entertaining.

This is a fascinating film, despite its flaws. It's a must-see for Hitchcock fans (just like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305882525">Dead Again</a> with Kenneth Branaugh) for all the wonderful Hitchcockian touches Mamet inserts.  The music, the camera work, all resemble Hitchcock's style. Hitchcock liked to include what he called "refrigerator scenes"-- that is, scenes that can't be easily explained.  He said that people would go home and stand  around the fridge talking about them and trying to figure them out.  (The most famous is in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a>  when the Kim Novak character is seen in a window but when the apartment is searched, it's empty and no explanation is offered.)  Several scenes in this film qualify for that- how does the certificate transform? How did they pull off the restaurant/club thing?  Also, Hitchcock was famous for his "MacGuffins"-- items which moved the plot along but really were nothing. (Again, a famous one would be the money that's stolen in "Psycho"- by the end of the movie no one cares about the money.) The "formula" appears to be a MacGuffin-- just something to get the story going- it really doesn't matter whether the formula exists, is a fake, or whatever.  The discussion about the plane in the islands is another MacGuffin.
