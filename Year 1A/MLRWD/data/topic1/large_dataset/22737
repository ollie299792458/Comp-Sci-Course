I was looking forward to seeing this when I found out that the main character (Gwynplaine) was the basis for the design of the Joker character in Batman.

The movie itself was very good. I felt the editing was a little choppy in a couple of areas, but not enough to lose track of the story as a whole.

The music was interesting. Since this movie was made about the time that "talkie" movies were emerging, it was nice to have the original score to listen to while watching.

I did find the sound effects a bit distracting at some times, but just right at others.

Having never read the book, I can't say how I thought it compared to it. However the ending seemed a bit abrupt and typical of the "Hollywood ending" we're all used to seeing.

Conrad Veidt plays an excellent role. His facial expressions portay a range of emotions, even with the makeup he had to wear.

Mary Philbin (his love interest) is wonderful. Her part as the blind orphan is done very well, and not over-acted.

Olga Baclanova. WOW! What a vamp! Watch her in this movie, and then think back to Madonna from the early 90's. You could hardly tell they are totally different people. They look that much alike!

Overall, I really like this film, but not as much as I had expected.

It's worth watching for film history buffs, or if you're in the mood for an unconventional love story.
