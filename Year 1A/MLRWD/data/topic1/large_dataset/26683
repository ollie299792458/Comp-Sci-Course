This is a film that you watch and at the end you ask yourself "what did I just see?" and you want to know more. You want to know why it played so strongly on your emotions and you want to hear the message it just gave you more clearly.
This is a film about the director's own family and the pain of the loss of his own brother and eventually the triumph over the past. For as well made and acted as this film is - and it is superb - it is also cloaked in mystery that is never wholly answered. As Sheridan states in his commentary, he didn't control the whole, he let much just happen - the 6 year old actress, Emma, literally casts the older role with her sister and helps direct the film. And the director's own children help write the screenplay. So the film ends up being more intimate and the commentary more revealing. There is a beautiful contrast between the innocence and belief of the young against the pain and confusion of the father. The film presents a picture of fatherhood, of love and escape from grief.
Buy this film to escape from the thin thrills and shallow plots of typical Hollywood fare. We all enjoy that stuff at times, but sometimes you want some reality which isn't contrived.
