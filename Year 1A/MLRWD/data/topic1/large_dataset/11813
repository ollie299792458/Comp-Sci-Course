DVD`s has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an Commentary Track by the Director, Behind the Scenes featurette, Blooper Reel and Trailers. There's memorable performances by the lead, including Hawn at her best in years. Some of the film subplots seems out of place, involving Rush in the film (still he's quite funny), the film is a bit cold hearted at times and falls a little flat around the end. Still, it's a funny, touching, one of a kind movie, that it should not be missed. Panavision. Grade:A-.
