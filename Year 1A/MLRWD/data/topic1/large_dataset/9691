I had intentionally not read this book because I wanted to be able to watch the movie without spoiling it and to avoid the inevitable disappointment with the way a movie mangles a book.  I was excited to finally be able to watch this.  I very much wanted to be pleased and overwhelmed by this movie because I was led to believe it was WONDERFUL!!  I WAS overwhelmed, but I was not pleased.
The cast was definitely star studded - it seemed that every star available was in this.  The setting / props were gorgeous.  So why 1 star?  Albert Finney as Poirot was horrible - you could not understand a single word he said - we constantly rewound but were still unable to understand his garbled mockery of a foreign accent.  Some of the other characters had the same problem though not nearly as bad.  What is the point of spending all that money on a movie the audience can not understand or follow?  I'm not comparing Albert Finney to David Suchet, I don't think that is fair or appropriate (different times, different budgets, etc) to do this.
I was excited to watch this movie and I had great expectations, but within 15 minutes, I was disgusted and the only reason I continued to the end was because I forced mysself to - "I looked forward to this so much, I'm going to finish it even if it stinks" idea.
I'm sorry, but I don't see how any one could give this movie anything but a bad rating if they are being honest.  Agatha Christie, Poirot, and a wonderful cast and set do not automatically equate to a great movie.
