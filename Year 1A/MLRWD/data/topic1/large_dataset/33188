If you're a rock n' roll fan and want to know what the Who is all about, or if you are a Who fan and want a DVD of live and TV performances, this film is where you start.  I'm 37 years old, and I first saw this movie on cable when I was in the sixth grade---I instantly became a fan of the Who, and have been one ever since.

This film is essentially a montage of performance footage from the band's beginning to about 1978, interspliced with interview segments and some voice-overs.  It's not a documentary in the usual sense insofar as it doesn't attempt to track the personal histories of the band members or the band itself in a studied or chronological fashion.  Rather, it's more of an attempt to capture the raucous and explosive energy of the Who on film, and it totally succeeds in doing so.

Among its many excellent performance clips, it contains definitive and complete live performances of the "mini-opera" "A Quick One While He's Away", "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again".  It also includes the band's literally explosive (and infamous) performance on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the mid to late 60's, wacked appearances by Ringo Starr, and even a sketch comedy segment featuring Steve Martin with the late Keith Moon.  It's a total hodgepodge, and its all brilliant, all Who, in all their ragged glory.  If you buy only one Who DVD, or even only one rock n' roll DVD, this is it right here.
