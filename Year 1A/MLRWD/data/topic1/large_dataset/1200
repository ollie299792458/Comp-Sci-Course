It's funny how time can warp memory, permitting the plot of a brilliant film to mold the thoughts of a 12 year old boy in 1969, slack-jawed as he witnesses apes transform to saddled up gunslingers, who speak English as it was spoken in the 1870's, who confront a truth seeking, shoot-from-the-hip astronaut who finds that the local smartees are merely following the path of their leaders into a delusional Salem, where men are the witches and apes are the authors of their own enlightenment. It had become a film locked into the eyes of this 12 year old, and the 49-year-old buys a DVD to view the film once again, gleaning a new perspective the 12 year old could never have.

Charlton Heston's Taylor is stranded on a planet in the very late 40th Century where the ape is king of the jungle and smokes Cohibas. His adventure turns ugly as he and his crew discover a planet of apes hording humans into nets so they don't eat their guavas, performing medical experiments as we might with mice, or in the context of a time not too far past, as Nazis did with Jews. He finds comfort in the company of a heretical pair of apes with doctorates played by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell and they aid Taylor in finding the ultimate truth about his past, and theirs.

The recent viewing enhances the old memory and rejiggers the brain cells into recognizing parallels of truth that escape sci-fi loving pre-teens looking for an escapist adventure. We all dodged a bullet back in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis and came an ape's breath away from plating the planet, and the film's fables line up for attention reaching a climax when the planet does a "To Tell the Truth" with Taylor who pounds the sandy beach, cursing man, not ape.
