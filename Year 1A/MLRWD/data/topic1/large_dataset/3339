I learned of this film after hearing about the Broadway show of the same name, which garnered a lot of attention at this year's Tony awards. Reading the various reviews posted here on Amazon is like reliving the iPhone-vs.-Android battle: people seem to be fiercely loyal to the music from either this film or the Broadway cast.  Personally, I think they're both great. The film is romantic and simple. Two people are falling in love, and the music not only seasons the story; it advances it. The songs are deceptively simple but work under your skin, and the entire soundtrack is beautiful and heartfelt. The story is one we've perhaps heard before, but told well. The two stars of the film also wrote and perform the music. The male lead was involved with and gave his blessing to the Broadway show...if he is happy with it, that's good enough for me. I'll likely never get the opportunity to see this show on Broadway, but I'm thrilled to have seen the film, which I'll doubtless watch again and again.

By the way, what a cool feature with Amazon...when I purchased this DVD I got a free 'ticket' to watch the film immediately on Amazon Prime streaming!  I watched the film on my computer the same night I ordered the DVD, so when it came in the mail I already knew how much I loved it.
