First, I have to say that I've watched Seasons 1-5 of The Office at least three times, plus commentaries, plus deleted scenes, plus bloopers, plus googled all the actors--so I'm a big fan. But after some of the awful reviews here on Amazon, I almost didn't buy Season 6. I was afraid I wouldn't recognize Jim, Pam, Michael, Dwight...but I shouldn't have worried.

Yes, Dunder Mifflin has changed. Yes, the characters have evolved (some devolved). But I love the show so much that I just went with those changes...and enjoyed them. Even Ryan, who seems like a different character every season, is fun to watch. Season 6 has some brilliant moments, some so-so episodes, and some real depth and beauty, so overall, as long as your expectations are reasonable, I think you'll like this set.

Since others have already written about the episodes, what I'd like to offer is that very few long-running shows can sustain the kind of high-caliber excellence we've come to expect from shows like The Office. Writers are human; sometimes they have an off-episode or even an off-season. (Season 3, with Jim at the other branch, was a lot more disjointed for me than Season 6. Even the writers in one of the commentaries admitted it was a misstep to separate the cast. Oh well...it happens. It's just the creative process. I still loved Season 3.)

So to those of you on the fence like I was...if you love The Office, you'll probably love Season 6, too. (The last five minutes of the blooper reel alone is worth the price of the entire set.)
