While surpised to find this DVD at a local electronics shop, viewing it was a big disappointment. The 1974 lineup has to be one of the most talented ensembles ever assembled, but instead of being treated to a healthy dose of uninterrupted musicianship, we get bits and pieces of songs and waaaay too much claymation. Inca Roads in particular is pretty much ruined by the overdubbing of "studio effects" to match the utterly uninteresting claymation scenes that fade in just after George finishes the opening vocal section. The claymation/overdubbing continues through the balance of the song, thereby rendering it unlistenable. This band is FANTASTICALLY musical and "tight", but we miss most of their efforts due to the editing. For what we are allowed to see, Ruth and Napoleon put on a heck of a show.

Also, the nose picking guy is a complete waste of skin and adds NOTHING to this. Not funny, not the least bit interesting...what the heck is this drivel included for??

Unless you are a fanatic/completist, I would skip this DVD and wait for a complete uninterrupted release of the 1974 show. As far as the 1981 material goes, skip it and get "Does Humor Belong in Music" instead.
