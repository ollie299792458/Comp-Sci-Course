This really is a beautifully created video. Pop it in, mute the sound and enjoy. The intelligent design mantra however is a disaster. Just looking through the reviews here confirms my fear: people are gullible, probably on purpose, always trying to believe what they want to believe, not what the evidence really says to us. Recognizing the inherent human need to seek out and relate to patterns, it is easy to see how people either knowingly or unknowingly get duped.
It may be uncomfortable for people to accept that perhaps we are not special in the scheme of the universe, that the Earth is not particularly important outside of our own understanding but discomfort is never a criteria for doubt. You may not like reality, but that doesn't mean you should ignore it and replace it with comforting concepts to get a nice, fat, warm cozy working.
The biggest issue with this and any intelligent design material is the insidious subversion it so innocently claims to deny. Anyone supporting the intelligent design "movement" that claims there is not a creationist agenda is either lying or stupid. Maybe both.
