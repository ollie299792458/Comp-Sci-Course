If I was ever going to be marooned on a deserted isle (with electical power, of course) there are three comedy movies I would want with me: The Odd Couple, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and Three O'Clock High. For the longest time I was going to have to make due with just the first two since Three O'Clock High went out of print years ago. I almost forked over an insane amount of money when I saw a 5th generation copy of a rental store video selling on a popular auction site, but it just wasn't worth it to me. I am glad I waited, because someone with more than two brain cells to rub together took the initiative and released this hilarious and fast-paced comedy for both older fans and a whole new audience. Not as teen-sophisticated as "Sixteen Candles" or "Pretty in Pink", and not as gnarly and racy as "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", this high school comedy film has a lot going for it in its own right. It even has an early appearance of Mitch Pileggi (X-Files' "Skinner") as "The Duke-ster" - playing a HILARIOUS truant officer. The only downfall is the very heavily soaked '80's musical soundtrack, but this is it. If you can still stomach the likes of Tangerine Dream with their 'keytars' drum machines, and synth samplers, then you are in for a really fun 90 minutes. The transfer to DVD is bright and clear, and the cover still has the original theatrical artwork.
