At the recommendation of a friend I rented this movie. If I had fast forwarded to 2 or 3 enjoyable scenes and then returned it I would have enjoyed it. Instead I actually watched the whole thing. The movie attempts to be a satire of US involvement in Iraq, Halliburton and the whole Military Industrial Complex. As a satire it will not give Jonathan Swift any competition. Its so broadly overdone as to be a satire of itself. It portrays a completely privitized military, reporters whose stories are based upon virtual reality rides, an inane and completely pointless subplot involving John Cusack, his boss and one of the other stars, what appear to be mental patients wandering through a free fire zone and similar bizaare scenes. If you are of the left wing persuasion (actually the more extreme left wing) you'll enjoy it. Otherwise you'll likely find it an utter waste of time. Oh btw the enjoyable scenes?? The truly excellent hand to hand combat scene in the mansion, Hillary Duff (referred to by another Amazon quite accurately as looking like a pre-meltdown Brittney Spears) strutting around a sound stage and one or two others I can't recall.
