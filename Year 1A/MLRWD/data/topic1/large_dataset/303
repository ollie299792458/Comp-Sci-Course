First of all, if you have a very weak stomach, grab a garbage can, and then grab another one in case you fill the first one up.

I bought this movie used for twelve dollars and it definately delivers. I am a big gorehound, I go looking for a gory movie every friday. I've seen probably every gory movie, (Zombie, Dawn of the Dead, Bad Taste) and this is definately the goriest i've seen. You have to wait just a few minutes for the gore to start, but once ol' mum gets bit by the rat monkey, get a rain coat and an umbrella because its raining blood! After she's bit, there's a rather hilarious zombie baby, a nice rib cage rip-out, and a truly amazing must-see lawnmower scene, (very original.) There are also other cool parts that involve blenders, pudding, and even living intestines. This is a movie that you are either disgusted by and don't like, or you laugh at, rewind a whole lot and love. If you can handle this movie and not get the slightest stomach-ache, consider yourself a gorehound.
