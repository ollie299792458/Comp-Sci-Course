RUN don't walk to see Blade Runner and The Notebook. Both are classics similiar to and better than this film. First I'm a guy and haven't and will not read the book. The opening scene between the fear and anxiety of a mother and her son tells the emotional tone for the entire movie. It's one long rendition of those emotions over and over. 20 minutes before the end I could feel how it was going to end. Every scene could have been more emotional, varied, more expressively acted in every instance - THIS IS WHAT MOVIE VIEWING IS ABOUT, Period. The emotional cues were missing almost completely. No fear for the mother and son. No hand holding, grasping anywhere... Lacked passions. Poor camera angles. Many alternate ends would have added to the emotional fulfillingness. 3 stars - only for 1. good lighting 2. Flashbacks to Blade Runner and The Notebook 3. Uniqueness of the Timeless Time Travel Concept.  This is one of only 4 movies I rated out of 31,296 that is worthy of a remake. Would recommend watching once if you like Troy and The Notebook.
