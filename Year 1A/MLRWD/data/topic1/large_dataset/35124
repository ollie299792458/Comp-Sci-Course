... if you like the new Philip Glass/Kronos Quartet music that is!  I do, and recently purchased the DVD for it's wonderful option of the Spanish version, the 'standard' version, but also for the promise of the "CD-quality sound".  In the latter only was I disappointed.  The VHS sounds better.  I verified this to myself through back &amp; forth switching between the two versions through varying scenes in the early part of the film -- a VHS is less useful for forwarding to a precise place in the film for comparisons.  Specifically the VHS appears to have the music louder &amp; more 'forward' resulting in an appreciably more beautiful string tone.  It also seems as if when mastering the VHS the film's audio track was muted at times when there was no spoken dialogue, again resulting in increased clarity.  This does not seem to be the case with the DVD, which appears to add the Glass music on top the original noisy audio track.  Does anyone else share this perception/observation?  My next step is to check with someone at Universal Studios.  If I'm correct it is the only 'flaw' in the otherwise outstanding DVD production -- but a not insignificant one, when you consider that a VHS analogue tape in a Hi-FI VCR should NOT sound better than a modern DVD -- but it does!
