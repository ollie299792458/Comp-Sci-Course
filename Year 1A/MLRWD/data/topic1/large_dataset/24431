This video normalizes childbirth and shows couples and pregnant women how completely natural and normal childbirth can be for healthy, low-risk women (I am obviously NOT talking about those who truly need medical help). It brings childbirth back to where it should be. The film backs up the idea that when given a chance, childbirth can and most often WILL prove itself to be a normal process, one which many women find they can absolutely control and stand the pain by using natural techniques.

This important film addresses the issue of fear, and that childbirth should not be a fear-driven process and absolutely can be trusted and welcomed. The women presented in this film are not just those who happen to experience "easy" labor and childbirth, they are all kinds who do experience pain also. Natural childbirth and home birth are not only for those who have "easy" labors. This film encompasses all of the above and shows couples that childbirth is not always a "medical procedure."

Every woman who has had a child or plans to have a child should watch this film.
