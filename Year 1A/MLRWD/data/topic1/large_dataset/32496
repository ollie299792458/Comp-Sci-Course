The gist of the story is Affleck collides with Jackson but is in such a hurry to get to court he leaves the scene of the accident. Because of this Jackson misses a custody hearing and loses custody of his children. Affleck accidentally left an important file at the scene and will go to jail if he can't produce it in court. As a result, both men set about destroying each other but in the end become friends. 
The movie had great potential (and a great plot idea) but missed the mark too many times. For example, the revenge portion of the movie works quite well to begin with but becomes ridiculous when Jackson tries to kill Affleck. And then we are supposed to accept that they make up soon after. The happy ending simply does not work. 
The inner soul searching of Affleck is what I liked best. The prospect of going to jail prompts the successful lawyer, partner in his law firm at only 29, to reevaluate his life. He becomes concerned about the ethical and moral aspects of his chosen career. His father-in-law and his wife try to justify unethical behavior, with his father-in-law stating that all that matters is doing less harm than good everyday. 
However, Affleck's new understanding of right and wrong loses much of its effectiveness because his newfound enlightenment occurs at the same time he is carrying out terrible revenge and doing other not so good things. For example, he sets off a fire alarm, forcing people to flee a tall office building in panic, so he can get a glimpse at a file. Its things like this that destroy the film's potential. If I had written this script I would have had Affleck carry out his revenge first and begin his redemption out of guilt later. I would have had Jackson's wife move to Oregon because I don't think it was necessary for both characters to be redeemed.  
Worth renting for both the great performances and some great dialogue (be prepared to suspend belief a lot). You might want to rent this first before you make a final decision to buy.
