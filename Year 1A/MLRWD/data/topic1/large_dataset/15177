It is difficult for an unusual movie to catch a break these days, especially when it's brand of peculiarity does not capture the hearts of the "artistic" film community.  We have become so used to somewhat crisp storylines and a combination of characters and situations that fit into a neat Americanized package that it's no wonder a movie like this suffers from mixed reviews.
I think you have to love the French to love this movie, and I am quite fond of both.  Most Americans don't like the French because they consider them to be rude, but what they perceive to be "rudeness" is, in my experience, a difference in communication style.  There are several voice intonations in French that are completely normal in that language, but in English they are perceived as negative.  In much the same way, this movie's tone creates similar misunderstandings.
But let's talk about the movie in more specifics.  The storyline was admittedly somewhat weak and incongruous in some respects, and it does vary from the book on which it is based, but none of that really matters.  The acting was delightful, especially from Kate Hudson, whose charm I never tire of (much like her delightful mother, Goldie Hawn).  The characters were fascinating and added great interest to the picture.  The setting was enriching for a fan of Paris, such as I am.  And the generous amount of dialogue in French (with sub-titles) really helps to create the experience of being in France.  Indeed, it is a unique experience that can only be appreciated by a unique group.  Count me in.
Le Divorce is definitely on my buy list for when it hits DVD.
