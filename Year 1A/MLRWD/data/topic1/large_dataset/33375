this movie is an awful movie.  the acting is horrible and the actors try to hard to try and be funny which just makes the movie painful.  the main character, played by john cena, seems to have animal like reflexes and instincts, seeming to be able to track the bad guys down by stupid things like sniffing the air and following non-existent clues.  Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie, but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic.  its so bad, i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena "can" do.  for example, hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground.  he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it, yet somehow he still is alive.  also, i might be crazy, but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds, you wouldnt live.  also, not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt.  speaking of not being hurt, there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building, john cena is hit by falling, burning wood and is unaffected.  this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie, to look somewhere else.  i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.
