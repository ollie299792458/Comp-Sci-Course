To quote Butthead, "This sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before."

Imagine the 1960's series on steroids and with modern visual effects.  That's Batman & Robin in a nutshell.  George Clooney is entirely unconvincing as Batman & Chris O'Donnell is too old to be Robin.  Ah-nuld does a pretty nice Mr. Freeze but has way too many bad puns.  Uma?  Hmmm.  Over the top but at least she looks good in the Poison Ivy outfit.  Alicia Silverstone tried to make the best of a ridiculous screenplay, I suppose, but I didn't buy into her either.

That's just the acting problems.  Now I'm really getting warmed up.  I don't mind some revisions to the Batman History in order to make a good movie but this one made major revisions in order to make a movie I disliked so much I felt I'd been ripped off on the rental fee.  1.) Bane was comepletely messed up.  In the comics he was a huge monster with a frightfully high IQ.  He deduced Batman's true identity, then wore him down systematically before breaking his back.  I don't know who that was in the Bane suit in the move but it sure wasn't Bane.  2.) Batgirl is not and never has been Alfred's niece.  She's Commissioner Gordon's daughter.  Also, she wore a more traditional bat-mask/cowl rather than a Robin-Style domino mask.  3.) Robin's costume in this movie is actually the Nightwing outfit from the comics.  Nightwing is what Robin became when he grew up.

The moment Batman and Robin appeared at a public event in this movie I knew it wasn't going to get any better and I was right.  Don't waste your time on this piece of celluloid garbage.
