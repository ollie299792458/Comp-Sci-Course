As a child of the 80's and a martial artist, this movie rings true to me on more than one level. Some people may grade this movie low because of the feel good tone of the movie, but that was the tone of the 80's - everything seemed to have so much promise.

This is a film with very few flaws. The acting is top notch, from the main characters of Daniel and Miyagi, to supporting roles of Mrs. LaRussa and John Kreese, there isn't a weak charcter in the cast and all are acted superbly. The plot is farely simple, yet one that many people can identify with - Single mom moves away with son away for a job, son gets picked on, finds and friend and mentor in the apartment handyman, who happens to be an Okinawan Karate master.

Where the film really succeeds is in the portrayal the martial arts spirit. I had a discussion with someone who insited the movie was flawed because Johnny would have beaten Daniel in real life. All I said to him was the movie was more about the spirit of Karate, not who would beat who. Daniel learns not only how to defend himself against those who would do him harm, but earns their respect as well. As the trilogy goes on, each film focuses on a different aspect of the martial spirit, whether it be respect, honor, or training for war to attain peace. These are the true messages of the Karate Kid, and this is why I guess some people don't get it.

As a final note, I was deeply saddened by the recent passing of Pat Morita. Even though he didn't know a lick of karate, his portrayal of the Karate Master did more for martial arts than any other film role could. Those of us who saw this film in the theatre were always searching for our Mr. Miyagi, to teach us not only karate, but life. Some of us were lucky enough to find him....
