As a male, this movie helped me understand the life experiences of women who have gone through the struggle of learning to love themselves and learning to get control of their lives so that they make good relationship decisions. The play of this movie has been performed in many countries all over the world with actresses of various/different races. No matter what the race or culture of the women, there are women who need to learn to love themselves and when they do this, they will make good life decisions and relationship decisions. When women have a healthy love and esteem for themselves they will not put up with certain things or allow unhealthy men to enter into their lives.

The end of the movie was also uplifting as the women realized who they really are and how God has created them beautiful. We get to see them realize that they are better than the circumstances they allowed themselves to be drawn into. You know that they will triumph.

The acting was superb and the poetic verse was very creatively done. It was good to see so many great and talented actresses and actors in this movie as we don't see many of them as often as I would like to see them in more Hollywood starring roles.

Tyler Perry did an excellent job with his adaption of the book to film. Love the movie!
