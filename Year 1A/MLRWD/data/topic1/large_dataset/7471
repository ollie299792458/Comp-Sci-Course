I usually do not like mysteries or detective stories that are not logical, or believeable. I don't think Laura is the best film if you look at it as simply a murder mystery.  However, there is something special about the film that takes some explaining that only a professional critic could manage. However, I will try. First of all, I liked all the actors, some of whom are particular favorites. Its unusual for me to view a film that doesn't have one actor with whom I have a problem. Even Vincent Price, whom I associate with his later gore films, plays a quite different role. On the other hand, I have never seen a Gene Tierney or Dana Andrews film I did not like.  I know that Andrews is not a favorite with most critics. They seem to find him "wooden".  In this film, that fault is perfect for this role as the detective who starts out as the quintesential dective, whose falling in love with Tierney, as potential victim and murderess, a perfect match to the pace of this film.  Clifton Webb plays his customary character.  This time as the jealous lover. Judith Anderson plays a victim of her love for Price.  She doesn't seem to mind how Price's character walks all over  her.  I loved the line where she tells Price that they are both terrible people and deserve each other.

And there is suspence.  When the alledged dead victim, Tierney, walks into her apartment where Andrews, without knowing that by reading her diary and looking at her picture, is falling in love.

A great classic, for lovers of  1940's flics that can be watched with the whole family.  No swearing, sex, violence or gore.  Oh, there is a shot out at the end, but no blood or gore.
