This movie is a sad reminder of the decline of America. This film shows the United States at its very best.

Man's journey to the moon seriously got underway when President Kennedy said:

"We choose to go to the moon.. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win."

NASA was implementing plans to return to the moon until President Obama canceled the Constellation program and America's return to the moon.

Obama's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy's liberalism and Obama's.

Kennedy's was an expansive, bold, outward-looking summons. Obama's is a constricted, inward-looking call to retreat.
Fifty years ago, Kennedy opened the New Frontier. Obama has shut it.
