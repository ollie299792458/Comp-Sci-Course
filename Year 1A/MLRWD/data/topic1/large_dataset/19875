"Wag the Dog" is, at the very least, the best political satire of the decade. I don't know what all the other reviewers were smoking when they said that it wasn't believable. In fact, for someone who has been following news for the past years (and I mean real news, not the Reader's-Digest-grade fodder that unquestioning Americans are being served on their Foxified "news" outlets), the events in this movie are not only frighteningly believable, but strikingly prophetic as well. It is a mark of true greatness when political satire doesn't lose its relevance with passing years, and looking at world events between 1997, when the movie was made, and today, I can unequivocally say that this movie has achieved this greatness. As a matter of fact, when I first saw it on TV, I could scarcely believe that it was made before Bush, before Iraq, and before Jessica Lynch.
The tragic thing is, that even being flawless and portentious, this movie is at best destined for the role of a cinematic Cassandra - its makers said everything that could possibly be said on the topic of spin control and mass manipulation, and yet, Americans still fall for it every goddamn time.
