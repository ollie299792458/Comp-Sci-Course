A friend of mine is Japanese and she really wanted me to see this, but Japanese is a language of which I only know one word, "arigato". It means thank you and I'd like to say "arigato" to the makers of this film about how a group of girls overcome strong odds to make something of themselves and to save their town.

The movie takes place in 1966 and the local coal mine is doomed, oil is the wave of the future. The mining company comes up with looks like a hair-brained scheme to save the town, by building a Hawaiian Center where tourist in this cold northern place can sample some fun in the sun and see genuine Hula Girls.

Well, the girls are not exactly genuine. They are coal miners daughters who have to be trained in the art of hula by a reluctant teacher and even though you can see the ending from miles away, it is outstanding. And as for the fact that the film was in Japanese, not five minutes into it and I was reading those subtitles, but hearing the girls voices in my head. I can't believe what a seamless experience it was. I highly recommend this movie. It's a keeper, it really is.
