As a fan of the original Miami Vice, and having grown up in Miami, I was somewhat leary of the "movie".  After watching it for the first time, I found myself disappointed.  I believe it was that it was nothing like the original show, and that was what I had come to expect, as most fans of a TV series would like.

But, as a true lover of all movies, I watched the movie again, and then again and again.  I can now say after months and months and about 10-15 viewings, I have thoroughly grown to love this movie.  It stands on its own, as if the show had never existed - a 'different' version if you will.  The story line is fairly good, the cinematography excellent, I feel the acting was respectable, and the music is incredibly perfect and in the end makes the movie (great soundtrack).

If you didn't like this movie, I'd suggest giving it another view and you may find to enjoy it as I did.  It now resides in my permanent HD-DVD collection, and how great it is to watch in 1080p.
