'Stranger than Fiction' is a cracking movie and I thoroughly recommend it.

Like a good book, it draws you in and is a movie you won't want to put down. You get the feeling that (just like a good book) every scene is essential to the plot. There are no throwaway, knockabout or unessential scenes in this movie. Everything is important and worthy of your attention.

Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are, as always, excellent, while Maggie Gyllenhaal is efforvescent and totally believable as the baker who falls for Will Ferrell's character the IRS agent. But it is Ferrell who is the most outstanding, giving a superb performance. We are big Will Ferrell fans in our family, but I for one wasn't sure that he could pull this one off. But his performance is maganificent. His deadpan delivery is outstanding and his transformation absolutely believable in this great movie.

The message of the film 'live for today' may be familiar, but the method of delivery in 'Stranger Than Fiction' is clever, original and very entertaining.

Although it's a comedy, it's not laugh out loud, but it will make you smile alot and you'll leave the cinema thinking 'that was a good movie'.

It's often easy to try to read too much into movies and over-intellectualise. Just enjoy this as a good story, well told and superbly acted. I'll be looking to add the DVD to my collection as soon as it's released.
