Just wait, stop and think for one minute... Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short... put them together, in a film, with funny little costumes, horses, a great comic-script, some stunning catchphases and incredible characters... and my friend you have yourself a film.
I have always loved this film but lost touch with it until its latest release on DVD.  The actors' achievements before and since say enough, but their comic timing and performances in the film are absolutely outstanding to watch and have me in fits of uncontrolled laughter each time... no matter what I do, it happens everytime, I even know what gags are coming up, that doesn't help!  I give in to the tears and surrender to the comedy giants popping up on the screen in front of me.
The story tells of three actors who, for reasons they explain, feel they should be getting a bit more... it doesn't turn out the way they planned, and when offered to take up their screen legend personnas 'The Three Amigos' to fight injustice for real, the decision has to be made whether to fight and die like men, or run like pigs.  Which one do you think they pick?
Scenes to watch out for: My Little Buttercup / Piarie Lullaby / The Singing Bush / The Final Defeat of the baddies.
