I must ask readers to disregard much of Alan Hummel's (below is his review) review of this DVD. I think the mini-series (the DVD) and the show on sci-fi (even more so) is excellent. It's dark, it's realistic (well as realistic as sci-fi can get), and it's plots are great. Now I have issue with many of the reasons that Mr. Hummel didn't care for the show. Many of his reasons are just not logical.

1. The show is no more predictable than any other show today.

2. The character Petty Officer Dualla is a black female!

3. ST:TNG was sterile as hell and too cliched (and talk about predictable). I did like ST:TNG, but come on!

4.The character conflict does have a point.

5. You weren't paying attention were you? There are 12 cylon MODELS...of which there is an unknown amount of each model. When one "dies" their consciousness is  "beamed" to a new replica.

6. The scene with the baby's death was disturbing, how ever I don't beleive Six intended to kill the child. She just didn't know her own strength. Also, she is a BAD GUY!

7. Why is it that future, space costumes have to look ridiculious to be "right"?

8.It may have been she was cast as a "talking point", I don't know. She is, however, excellent in the role and if you watched the actual series on sci-fi, you'd know they call her Starbuck all the freaking time.
