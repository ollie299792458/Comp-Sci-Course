I have been a Howard Stern fan for years now, watching his show as often as I can.  I have also wanted to know the story behind him and his colleagues' rise to power.  This movie showed plenty of it, but not all of it.  It basically summarizes his childhood and early years and shows us some of his influences to become a radio personality.  Most of the movie is a flashback panning his lifetime as he moves from small town disc-jockey to well-known local personality to huge radio star.  He meets many of his sidekicks and good friends throughout the movie, such as Robin Quivers, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling.  Unfortunately, the flashback cuts off in the mid-80's and doesn't touch at the next ten years of his career.  Either way, the movie was able to make us feel sorry and compassionate for who much of society calls the Antichrist.  It has its funny moments and some sad moments, but in the end it's a decent comedy.  Private Parts has some gross-out humor and a fair share of nudity.  I would definitely not like this movie as much if I weren't a Stern fan, but I am, so I love it.
Score: 7.5/10
