I don't understand the negative reviews this film is getting from some people.  I watched this with my four year old daugeter and was amazed at how entertained she was by it and surprised that I actually enjoyed it as much as I did.

I never got into the books but was thirteen when The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries was on TV and watched every show.  I wanted to Be Joe Hardy singing "Da Doo Ron Ron" to Nancy Drew.  I was really dissapointed when they dropped Nancy's stories and continued with just the Hardy Boys.

Anyway, I really hope they make more of these movies with Emma Roberts who did a really outstanding job keeping my daughter's attention for the entire film (a first for a live action film).  I'm also hopeful that Pamela Sue Martin makes an appearence since she is "my" Nancy Drew.

Give this movie a chance then move on to the novels and other film/tv versions of the character.  I look at like I do "Batman", no matter how bad it is or who plays the role I'm just happy they keep making more.
