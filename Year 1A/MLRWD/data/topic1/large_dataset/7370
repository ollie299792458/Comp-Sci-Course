Not a review, just a word about aspect ratios.

A lot of movies in the 80's were shot in a "soft" or "open matte" format, which means they were shot full frame (1.33:1) and later matted by cinema projectionists to fit the screen (remember that cinema screens used to be much more disparate in size and ratio than they are today). This practice also facilitated transfer to home video, since the negative was already in a full-frame format. It is a huge falacy that all films were shot in a "fixed" or "closed matte" format and then later panned and scanned for home video. You'd be surprized how many movies were actually shot full frame and soft matted in the theater (Schindler's List and Top Gun to name but two). The thing to remember when regarding movies shot in the seventies, eighties, and early nineties (or every Stanley Kubrick movie ever made) is that "widescreen format" or "theatrical aspect ratio" is not always synonymous with "original aspect ratio."

The original aspect ratio for FMJ is 1.33:1.  The 1.85:1 version presented here will fill the entire screen of your 16:9 television, but it will do so by cropping out the top and bottom of the original frame.
