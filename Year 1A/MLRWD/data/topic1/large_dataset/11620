After reading all of the other reviews of "The House Without a Christmas Tree" video on Amazon I just had to write. I too waited practically two decades for this video to come out. I think I was 6 when it was shown on TV in the 70's. I was frustrated for years while trying to find the video in stores. I described the TV special to many aloof store clerks who only gave me blank stares when I inquired about it.
The only other person I knew who had seen "Addie's story" was my Mom. You can imagine how ecstatic we were when I finally got the video. This is what Chrismas and other holiday specials should be about. Just a heartwarming yet bittersweet story that isn't trying to sell a soundtrack or a popular toy. The Amazon reviews have inspired me to look for the other specials featuring the same cast. Maybe they will be released on DVD. I fear they will never be shown on network TV again because there are some religious themes that underly the storyline. Still, I think everyone should watch this video if given the chance. Happy Holidays...
Have a great holiday
