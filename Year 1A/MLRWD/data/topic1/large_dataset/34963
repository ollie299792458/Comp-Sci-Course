Written, scored and directed by special effects master Robert Hall, Laid to Rest tells the tale of a nameless girl who wakes up inside a coffin in a remote funeral home with no memory of who she is or how she got there. To make matters worse, she is being stalked by an unstoppable killer who hides his disfigured face behind a creepy chrome skull mask and murders anyone who gets in his way. The movie pays homage to early slasher-era films, adding elements of mystery and dark humor to the story. The entire cast and crew do a great job making a stylish and moody independent film that rivals some of today's big budget horror flicks and the graphic grisly death scenes are guaranteed to satisfy the most hardcore splatter fans. The film delivers an captivating tale of terror with a great mixture of entertaining elements. The characters are quirky, the killer is menacing and inventive, the sets are terrific and the music builds tension at the appropriate places. As an added bonus, the behind the scenes extras on the DVD are filled with some great tips for young aspiring filmmakers. A true dark gem among independent horror films, Laid to Rest is a nasty and entertaining offering from a creative team to keep an eye on.
