A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints is a bullseye 1980's inner-city drama that gets right inside the dysfunctional household of a family paralyzed by the lifestyle of living paycheck to paycheck in a neighborhood whose mean streets are harmless behind a good door that's got a good lock. In reality these types of neighborhoods of the 80's that were dominated by tough-skinned teen-agers whose summers left them wandering the streets aimlessly reverting to violence to fill the lonely, depressing hours. Everyone of the actors and actresses in this film deserve acolades for their performances. Everyone of them, and most of them are young but they're skill of dramatizing this era was almost perfect. Robert Downey Jr., did a very good portraying a depressed adult product of a teen-ager who just barely escaped the dangers of his hood, and having to do so at the guilt of a co-dependant dad and mom without say had to be hardest things to take on simultaneously but the one reason I didn't rate this film a personal 5 was because Robert Downey Jr.'s personal life has had so much tumultuity in it that he's almost typecast into this movie. My personal advice for Robert Downey jr. is to stay away from depressive roles on TV or the big screen.  I think it would be cool for RDJ to play a guy who builds motorcycles and ends up winning a biker build-off.. that would be a gritty role, motorcycles are cool and loveable, and a positive ending would fit nicely now for Robert. Think about it Robert, and cast Paul Tuetul Sr. oh, and me!! Sign me up.  3 solid Stars... A good movie to see, but be prepared to be depressed throughout the entire watch!
