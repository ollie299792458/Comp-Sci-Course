Stan Marsh, Kyle Brovlovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick have always been known to have potty mouths. But when The Terrance and Phillip Movie--a movie from Canada--comes in theaters, the foul language causes the boys to start cursing and swearing much more than before. The mothers of South Park are outraged. They're so outraged that they start a protest against Canada, and plan to have Terrance and Phillip killed.

The kids are crushed--there's no way they could let their favorite actors be killed. Especially when they discover that if Terrance and Phillip die, Satin and Sadam Hussein (who has recently died and gone to Hell) will rise onto Earth and the apocalypse will begin. It's up to the kids of South Park to save their favorite actors--and the world.

SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT may be one of the world's funniest movies. Sure, it has tons of curse words. But without them, the movie wouldn't be funny and it really wouldn't have a plot. One thing I really liked about this movie was that beneath all the swear words and sex scenes, there's an important message--you don't need to be big to do big things. The only problem I had was that the DVD should've had more special features. This is a must see for all South Park fans, and if a fan hasn't seen this movie, they're not truly a fan.
