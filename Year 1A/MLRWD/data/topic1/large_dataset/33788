Lara Croft: Tomb Raider was a great movie. I was excited when I went to see it. Heck, when I first saw the trailer for it I almost inhaled my straw.
The story went well with the game, even though the relationship between her and her father was a little cheesy, and her fighting a whole society instead of one person and their henchmen was a little weird. But hey, whatever.
Now everyone that's complaining that she travels too much in the movie can explain Tomb Raider II to me right?
Even if Angelina had a padded bra, (which I doubt, I mean, haven't you guys seen her other movies??) she still knows how to look and act the part, so leave her alone.
Anyway, referring back to her travels in this awseome movie, she travels to: India, Cambodia, and Siberia, and all three of those locations also coencide with her exotic travel locations in the games too.
Oh yeah, and about that giant stone Brahman everybody's complaining about? Well, in Tomb Raider III: the adventures of Lara Croft, she had to battle many six-sword weilding stone Shivas, so, I don't want to hear about the movie not being like videogame. Ok?
Angelina also does the amazing hops, flips, and jumps that I thought only a certain videogame heroine could do.
Lara Croft: Tomb Raider has it all: action/adventure, comedy, romance, drama, and travel. Hey, after seeing this, I want to go to Cambodia. Why? I don't know.
But yeah, its a really cool movie, and you should go buy it.
