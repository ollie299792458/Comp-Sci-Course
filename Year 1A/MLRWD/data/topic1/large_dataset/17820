Woody Allen can never make Manhattan or Annie Hall again. Simply put, the world isn't smart enough for that brand of movie being made. people don't get that way of communicating, studios don't get why anyone would make a movie for the art and so on. Woody himself isn't that person anymore. he is a man in his 70s, and he can't keep stooping these young women. That being said, it could be nice to see him as an old man, married to a woman his own age, in some sort of adventure, not unlike Manhattan Murder Mysteries again, but, what with the US studios not fronting him the cash, I guess he won't make movies where he ties up parts of Manahattan again?

All that being said, Woody Allen is timeless, yet he keeps fresh, and keeps up with current actors and so on. His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them. He is an actors director, trusting that they know their craft. That shows, also in this movie.

Should you preffer humour and cringe at drama with people behaving in a... sexually embarrassing way,w ell then this is probably not the movie for you.

If you love watching movies where the relationship between human beings, with all their beauty, all their faults, desires, cruelty, egotism and horny behaviour out there for all to see, well, then this is the movie for you.

Sure, Woody doesn't have a real grasp of Europe anno 2008, or for that matter, New York, but I love him for it. The fact that he ignores what people think he should do, and ignores the bland movie making going on these days, and just does his thing. He is my hero, and I am not ashamed to say so.

I loved this movie, it was a real shot in the arm for his body of work (I couldn't stand Cassandra's Dream), and I reccomend it warmly.

However, my top 3 Woody Allen movies of all time, are still Manhattan, Stardust Memories and Broadway Danny Rose.
