I don't know the Director, I judge the film merely on my experience with Horror movie viewing. This film is full of surprises and keeps you on the edge through out. People are going crazy when infected and others are just behaving like that normally! You know the symptons and when someone starts displaying sexual promiscuity you don't know if they are infected or normal. It's fun finding out! And if someone is attacked, you don't know if they escaped or were infected! A great suspense drama!

Most Erotic Strip Ever!!: I would like to thank the writer/Director for including the Most Erotic Strip Scene I have ever seen in a movie! The scene where the Nurse changes from her uniform into her plain clothes in front of her boyfriend must be the most erotic film scene I have ever seen! She is obviously parading for the Doctor (her boyfriend ) in front of him, while he is talking on his phone! First she undresses and then dresses again in front of him! He is trying to talk science on his phone, while watching his girlfriend undress! Also, at that point, you are wondering if the Nurse has been infected by the disease which makes people develop a strong sexual urge! Anyway, Director, a great strip scene! Thank you! And Thanks for scaring me throughout the movie!
