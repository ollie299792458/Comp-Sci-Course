I'm often a bit behind the curve. It's no different with this movie having just seen it this weekend on HD DVD no less.

I would have to say that Goodfellas has always been a great favorite of mine. Then I saw Casino which again I would describe as horribly fantastic.

Suffice it to say, I can't exactly explain my fascination with Scorsese's movies other than to say that they capture human depravity in a unique and striking way. I don't know if Scorsese's insights into our horrendously flawed fleshly existence come to him by accident, or if he is somehow uniquely able to see into the baseness of the human psyche. But, regardless, this is cinema genius at work rivaling Shakespeare's greatest tragedies in starkness, and complexity.

With all that said, Departed is yet another great movie. Great acting by a host of great actors, excellent photography and environment, and smooth pacing. High tension and hold your breath action all the way through. An absolute classic. Highly recommended.
