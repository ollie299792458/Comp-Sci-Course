You know how it is with anthologies - they're always hit and/or miss, even when you get top directors.  This one really has good names.  I was wary of this film when I learned two of the three directors were Park Chan-wook and Takashi Miike.  I saw their previous movies and they freaked me out.  Miike, especially, really traumatised me with "Ichi the Killer". All three mini-movies are beautifully shot and there are hints the directors really are trying to be extreme but trying doesn't mean that they are. It was really surprising that non-horror director, Fruit Chan, is the one who comes closest. His "Dumplings" - a tale of abortion, cannibalism, dumplings and beauty supplements - is the only one truly worthy of the price of admission.  It's uncomfortable, disturbing and macabre, all the more by relying on suggestion and being relatively gore-free. Ironically, Park's and Miike's segments are the weaker ones. Park's entry, "Cut" is silly psychobabble nonsense while Miike's "Box" is too bizarre and incoherent to be horrifying. There's a lot of fluids,body parts and mad people but that only makes it icky, not extreme.
