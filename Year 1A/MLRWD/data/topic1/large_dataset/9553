This film is a true classic. It has meanings on many levels which allows it to appeal to many people, but with a bum numbbing running time of over three hours, many people may have chosen to give this film a miss. And miss they certainly did.
Unbelievable performances from a huge cast, delivering emotionally potent performances in the most difficult of circumstances, allows Magnolia to win through rewarding the viewer with one of those rare movies which can touch the soul. 
This DVD also rewards the viewer with a myriad of quality special features. A diary of the making of Magnolia at 1 hour 15 minutes long, theatrical teaser / trailer, TV spots (which aren't great in truth) and TJ Mackey deleted scenes. Another feature which is hidden from the user is outtakes which I found very funny. To see them, click on the TV lines option and sit there for about 20 seconds and the outtakes will begin.
Again, I can't emphasise enough how much I enjoyed this DVD and the features contained within. Buy now and you won't be disappointed!
