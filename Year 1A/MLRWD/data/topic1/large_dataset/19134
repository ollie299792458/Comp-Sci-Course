I think part of the critical honeymoon this film has enjoyed has to do with Almod&oacute;var's oeuvre, which has been consistently provocative, challenging, and interesting. He has made some very good films, such as the hilarious "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and the intriguing "Law of Desire" (La Ley del deseo), and some very disappointing films, such as "Matador" and "Tie me up, Tie me Down." I would place this film in the middle of the spectrum, despite all the hype about it being Almod&oacute;var's most accessible film. My objections to the film are primarily artistic, but I happen to find it morally reprehensible as well. Had the story been done with greater depth and sensitivity, I would undoubtedly find little in the way of a "moral" objection. In fact, I find that the director "uses" the women in this film in the same way as the male characters use them, as vessels for their hopes, dreams, and desires, not as automomous individuals with their own hopes, dreams, and desires. I find that objectionable on many levels. Dario Grandinetti as Marco is effective, if somewhat one-note, and Javier Camara as the childlike Benigno is adequately convincing in a complex role. The female roles are lacking in the depth and richness with which Almod&oacute;var usually infuses his women, which is unfortunate given the title of the film. Caetano Veloso does a lovely version of "Cucurucucu Paloma," but the tenderness of his version of the standard is out of place, even wasted, in a film which often descends into tawdry melodrama and very pat characterizations. I know we'll see better work out of Pedro Almod&oacute;var, and I hope he doesn't believe all the publicity about this particular film (as Simone Signoret famously said: "My performance is finished, and publicity will not make it better").
