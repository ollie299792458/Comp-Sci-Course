This is arguably the best comedy ever made.  Zero Mostel is a comic genius and it is evident from the opening credits. As Zero's alter ego, Max Bialystock, a Broadway producer who has fallen on hard times and in order to live, cons elderly women, in a truly charming and hysterical manner, into supporting him.  At the same time, he fulfills some of their fantasies and there is a certain value these women recieve for their investment.  It is all clean and quite funny and side-splittingly funny.
A young Gene Wilder is priceless as the naive milquetoast, accountant Leo Bloom, who is brought out of his shell by Zero Mostel's charachter.
Upon encountering an accounting error, Bloom informs Bialystock that a producer could make more money from a flop than a hit.  
The two begin a journey of non-stop hilarity in their pursuit of, as Max puts it, "wine, women and song -- and women!"  
The cast is brilliant.  Estelle Winwood as one of Max's investors is absolutely priceless.  Lee Meredith is absolutely sensual, yet very funny, as the partners new receptionist.  Christopher Hewitt and Andreas Voutsinas, respectively, as director, Roger and his assistant, Carmengia will provide side-splitting laughs.  Kenneth Mars' charachter as the author of the play, "Springtime for Hitler; A Gay Romp of Adolph and Eva in Berchtesgaden," Bialystock and Bloom produce on Broadway is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Dick Shawn as flower child, L.S.D. is wonderful.  We also see a young William Hickey in a small role as a good-natured inebriate celebrating with Max and Leo.
I cannot recommend this film enough to you.  There is a reason this is now the hottest play on Broadway -- it's absolutely wonderful; the laughs are non-stop and just when you think the film has reached a comic zenith, you will become pleasantly surprised.  On behalf of any fan of this film, I'd like to thank Mel Brooks for sharing his gift.
