I recently received this DVD as a birthday gift.  I was a little hesitant, at first, because I was unfamiliar with the voice actors but after watching it, I'm very impressed with this production.  Bruce Greenwood was excellent as Batman and the rest of the cast was also great.

The animation was really amazing.  Some of the scenes of Gotham City looked pretty realistic.  This movie was much darker than any of the Batman movies to date.  I definitely noticed that there was much more violence than what I'm used to seeing in W.B.'s animation.  Most of the really "bad" things were done off camera but there was a lot of gunfire, beatings, blood, and killing.  Not to say that those things are not appropriate, because they certainly are, but parents may want to preview this film before allowing younger children to watch it.

Given the storyline of Jason Todd's Robin/Red Hood, the violence is not surprising.  There are appearances by Nightwing, Alfred, Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, the Black Mask, and various other Gotham criminals.

I was disappointed in the special features.  There is a really interesting featurette on Robin/Dick Grayson, which I enjoyed.  There are also two episodes from Batman: TAS featuring Robin.  On the main disc, there is a sneak peak of the upcoming Superman/Batman Apocolypse movie, which looks good.
