When I first saw Ocean's Eleven I though it was ok. When I watched it a second time I warmed to it a little bit more. When I watched it the a third time I genuinely liked. Ocean's 11 really has it all, Clever writing, great direction, and an all star cast headed up by Matt Daemon, Brad Pitt, and George Clooney, but also including Elliot J. Gould and Don Cheadle.

The acting in this movie is high caliber. George Clooney as Dan Ocean is a great choice. While not Sinatraesque Clooney's performance is more then adequate. He comes off cool, Not Sinatra cool, but Clooney cool. Thus George Clooney makes the roll his own. Both Brad Pitt and Matt Damon shine in there respective roles. Matt Damons portrayal of Linus is of particular note. Watching Linus's over eager journey on the screne was extremely enjoyable.

The story is fast and moves forward in stylish grace. The only flaw with the film is that its not deep. There is no I Ching Wisdom in Ocean's Eleven, only I-Pod Style. If your looking for deep cinema this movies not for you. If you don't mind having some fun, then Ocean's Eleven is worth your hard earned money.
