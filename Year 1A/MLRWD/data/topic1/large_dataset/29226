Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time and Cameron Crowe is my all time favorite writer/director. This movie is by far one of his best films yet.

Set in 1973, Almost Famous tells the story of 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who's dream is to become a great rock journalist while his overprotective mother strives for her son to go to law school. After writing some pieces for local magazines, the editor of Rolling Stone magazine contacts William (not knowing that he is only 15) and sets him up to go on tour with the up and coming band Stillwater. While on tour, William falls for a "Band-Aid" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He becomes torn between wanting to belong with his new rock star friends and his wanting to be a "honest and unmerciful" rock journalist.

Almost Famous is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's real life. He was William Miller. Cameron Crowe actually did write for Rolling stone when he was in high school and really did tour with all kinds of rock stars (i.e.- Led Zepplin and the Allman Brothers). He even reveals in the commentary (which unfortunately is only located on the directors special two-disc edition) that there was a girl he knew while on tour who went by the name Penny Lane. The character of Penny Lane was derived from many girls who went on tour with the bands simply because they loved their music.

Amazing movie, amazing performances by the actors, amazing music. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie!

I also recommend Say Anything, my second favorite movie (also written/directed by Cameron Crowe).
