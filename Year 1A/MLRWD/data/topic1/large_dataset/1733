Ahem. This movie would have made a pretty good summer flick except for one thing: the title.

If you're going to make a movie based on a book, at least do the decent thing and make sure it has at least more than one or two things in common with each other.

As soon as I walked out of the theater, I was immediately deafened by the outrageously loud noise that I later identified to be the sound of Isaac Asimov spinning in his grave. I was horrified to see that a movie based on a classic novel would turn out to be nothing more than a two hour long commercial for Converse, Audi, FedEx, Prudential, Mercedes, and Dos Equis.

This travesty has more product tie-ins than all three films in the Matrix trilogy. It was nothing more than an underhanded attempt to cash in on whatever's hip in modern pop culture by slapping a popular novel's title onto an amalgamation of everything that is cliched and overdone in today's film industry.

An awesome plot is ruined by unnecessary explosions, moan-inducing one-liners (I mean, 'Converse, vintage 2004?!?!' What the hell is that?), cliched characters, and the ever-present and inane face of Will Smith, who apparently feels that it is necessary to produce a monolopy on all summer movies.

Yes, Will, Independence Day was a great movie, but I still haven't forgiven you for Wild, Wild, West and Willennium.

It's still a decent flick to rent on a Friday night. Explosions, killer robots, and a hot female lead certainly make for a fun time, but I just wish that they removed all references to Asimov and had instead titled it something like, 'When Robots Attack'

I'm still wondering how Alex Proyas could have gone from directing 'The Crow' to directing this piece of ass-embly line trash.
