This Cenerentola have everything to be the perfect recipe: La Scala, Claudio Abbado conducting, Jean Pierre Ponelle directing (vero factotum), a glorious cast, and the superb music of the master of opera buffa, Gioacchino Rossini. Who could ask for anything more?
Truly a landmark among filmed operas, this production is a must not only for opera lovers, but also for everyone who wants to begin to know and love the genre.
The cast, flawless: Frederica von Stade, marvelous voice and beautiful presence; the buffo trio of Paolo Montarsolo (the best of the group), Margherita Guglielmi and Laura Zannini; the funny impersonation of Claudio Desideri; the fresh performance of Francisco Araiza, and the secure Paul Plishka as the supportive Alidoro.
Scene after scene, this is first class opera: look at the "shadow-theatre" ensemble at second act and you will be convinced of the genius of Ponnelle.
In front of La Scala orchestra Abbado remains what he is, one of the leading italian conductors of all times.
There is no way to be disappointed with this DVD.
