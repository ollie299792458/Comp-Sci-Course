Initially I hated this movie with a passion. I was a big fan of the original and crushed when I witnessed this abomination. But after watching since I've grown to like it (for all the wrong reasons). This film could be  picked to pieces: Immortals are aliens, the deteriorated o-zone covered by  an electro-sheild (no sun = no food = death for the entire planet, HELLO!)  and countless others. One just has to wonder what the cookey screenwriters  were thinking when they came up with this I mean HOW COULD THEY HAVE  POSSIBLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK? Who knows maybe they didn't, maybe  they just thought they could come up with any old crap to appease all those  fans out there and cash in ($$$$$$$$). And how could Russell Mulcahy agree  to direct this (after all this is the same guy who turned down Rambo III  because he declared it an awful sequel after reading the screenplay--Rambo  III's not great but its The Godfather compared to this). 
After  recovering from the shock of the awfull "aliens" explanation I  also noticed that this movie is quite funny just about all of Micheal  Ironside's scenes (esp. when he 1st enters the Sheild corp) and Sean  Connery's scenes (the Hamlet scene is halarious) are great, but that still  can't save this, but it still renders it more watchable than H3 (with nary  an original moment in sight).
Bottom line: you may HATE this at 1st (and  really do mean HATE) but give it a chance and you'll see it does have some  cool moments (the morgue scene is the best). It's just to bad that they  couldn't've been in a coherent Highlander sequel.
