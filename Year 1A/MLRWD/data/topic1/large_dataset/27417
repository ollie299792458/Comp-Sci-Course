This is not my 1# favorite, but I liked it because of the metaphoric symbolism in this season. I loved the fact that everyone was trying to save Jack and help him to get his life back together. Love Renee Walker, Larry moss, and president taylor second best president on the show next to David Palmer(he will always be first).
Me & my mom also loved her husband(even though he wasn't in the whole season. Of course, Aaron pierce came back as well as Bill Buchannan & chloe o'brian. The saddest things about this season was Tony's betrayal. I know he was only trying to get back at the man Alan wilson for killing his wife, Michelle and his unborn son.  But he also killed larry moss.(whoa!) Renee the rest of the way kind a turned into a Jack Bauer almost. Olivia Taylor was okay. I also liked tim woods as well. Colonial Dubaku was the antagonist of the show, did he's part good, But we felt sympathy for his girlfriend who really liked him(even when she found out who he really was. But also the other main antogonist Benjamin Juma was just terrible. Jon voight was also in it, But olivia takes care of him. At the end she's sent to jail, Jack who was exposed to the pathogen he stop from releasing into the city gets cured thanks to his daughter.
