This movie is definate proof that the author of any book should whenever possible write the screenplay for the movie.  This adaption of the first three written books in the Hornblower series is a triumph on every level.  Very well acted, (Peck underplaying style was made for Hornblower), a visual feast, and a historical one as well.  Due to the author's touch little things about the way life actually was got accents (my favorite line in the picture is Quist's amazement at Hornblower knowing his name.) The fact that a ton of time during battle is spent clearing away wreckage etc.  The constraints of time forced the dropping of several fine scenes from the three books but that is understandable when crowding three books into one movie.  A &amp; E has more flexabliity and may eventually improve on this picture but I doubt it.  Firstly they have  3 1/4 books worth of movies to crowd through before ever reaching the first volume and 2ndly the don't have the author to write the screenplay.  This movie is worth your money
