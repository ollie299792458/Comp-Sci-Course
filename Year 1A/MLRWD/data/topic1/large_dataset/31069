"Do you not know that those who run in a race, all indeed run, but one receives the prize?  So run as to obtain it."  (1 Corinthians 9:24)

This movie came out when I was too young to attend a theatre, but I was able to see it recently....what a fabulous movie!  Enriched with athleticism, challenges, goal-setting, self-denial, and faith, this movie is excellent for providing historical role models for budding young athletes, or anyone who is experiencing the difficulties of meeting challenges -- be they academic, physical or spiritual.

Unencumbered by the sordid trash that permeates the movies of today, it is free to explore deeply the REAL issues that people must confront daily.  It is an excellent film for homeschoolers who would like to provide some reinforcement for their physical education curriculum.

Howerver, by far the most important example found in this movie is in the character of Eric Liddell.  He shows how worthy it is to set an athletic goal, yet a warning to always keep in mind the correct priorities.  In today's society, we neglect our souls while practically worshipping our bodies.  His refusal to run on Sunday is a shining example to our youth to keep our priorities straight.  He keeps in mind not only the beginning of the Biblical verse given above, but its ending:

"For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized in Moses, in the cloud and in the sea.  And all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink (for they drank from the spiritual rock which followed them and the rock was Christ). Yet with most of them God was not well pleased." (1 Corinthians 10: 1-5)
