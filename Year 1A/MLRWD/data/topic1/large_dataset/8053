These cartoons of Kevin Smith's critically acclaimed "Clerks" are hilariously funny. Dante and Randall play off of each other's words and thoughts brilliantly, much like the movie. The characters in the film are very animated to begin with, so making a cartoon series from it's basis makes sense, along with a lot of laughs. They tackle much of the same type of topics as they do in "Clerks", pushing the jokes much further in comparison, creating original and unique ideas untouched by your basic adult cartoons.

Fans of "Clerks" will find these 6 cartoons very entertaining. The same actors are used as voices, and they did an excellent job of matching up the animations with each characters personality. These cartoons move very fast, rattling jokes off, one after another, much like other comparable adult cartoons.

It's just too bad they stopped after 6 episodes. If they continued making them, "Simpsons", "South Park", and "Family Guy" would have some stiff competition on their hands. If they would have kept making them, they would have only gotten better with time, much like many cartoon series.
