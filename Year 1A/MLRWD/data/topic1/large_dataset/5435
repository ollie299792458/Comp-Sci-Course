This version of 'Il Travatore' reminds me of the Joan Sutherland/Opera Australia version of the 1970's in its tone, costume and setting. Despite not having Sutherland, I enjoyed this one immensely.

Jose Cura, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Yvonne Naef are excellent in this version. The weakest link, unfortunately, is the Leonora played by Veronica Villarroel. She sings beautifully but not enough to quite sweep you away the rest of the singers do. Act IV, Scene I is just such an example. Manrico in the tower, Leonara singing against the steely white church window background. The music pulses, Manrico tugs at our heart strings but Leonora doesn't bring us up further.

Hvorostovsky is excellent in this production. As a baritone, he comes forward, he plays the Count with passion and rage and his performance is strong. Cura is great, strong but my favourite, Yvonne Naef is the real heart of this performance. Her Azucena is passionate, frightening, and sympathetic. The ending is a triumph, perhaps outdoing previous interpretations.

If you have seen the Joan Sutherland version I can highly recommend this. The costumes and the use of Schlager Dueling to add realism to the setting, lending depth and darkness to the Count's army gives this production further dimension. Superb, almost excellent but worthy of a purchase.
