I was afraid that this will be in the spirit of the American Pie legacy or Judd Apatow's bad taste comedies. But I was pleasently surprised, this is a well written and well acted movie which is not only very funny but also rewarding. While a lot of what's happening in the plot is totally absurd (on purpose), the main characters are believable and even likeable. The true subject of the movie is the camaraderie between the 3 buddies(eventually accepting the 4th one as well)and how they overcome together ridiculously tough (and hillariously funny) situations. I read that the actors playing Doug, Phil and Stu are actually buddies in real life and it shows in the way they talk and care for each other. As many have noticed the plot has a lot in common with 'Dude, where's my car?' but I think The Hangover is even better since the heroes are (more or less) mature individuals who are able to digest the absurdity of their situation, and not just stoners who most of the time are not even aware to wjhat's really happening.
