While this is a fine movie in English, it definitely gives a different (lesser) experience because of the cat's voice.  In English, he sounds like a loud American cartoon character, even goofy sometimes.  In Japanese, he sounds like what an actual cat might talk like -- if it could talk.  That gives him an enchanting, charming feel that is lost in Disney's translation.  With the English version, you are VIEWING an entertaining story with a cat that sounds like a man, trying to be funny.  With the Japanese, you ARE IN a strange, fantastic world that intersects our own, where you listen in on a small, delightful creature chatting with his human companion.

One other criticism of the English version:  at the key moment where the artist is encouraging Kiki, the artist says our special abilities mysteriously come from God (as I am told by Japanese friends).  That is changed in English to "inspiration." "God" is removed.  That is a significant change of an author's writing.  What is a suggestive, reflective literary layer in Japanese becomes an almost trite "find your own inspiration" (like "follow your dream").  It is a rare story that can talk about God without sounding preachy or overbearing.  Sadly, we lost that distinctive quality in the English version.

I urge others to set the DVD for Japanese language, give the sub-titles a chance, and allow yourself to enter into a foreign experience -- which is the better for being foreign.  That is a large part of Miyazaki's charm, a charm that is diminished when we try to make the characters sound like they are Americans.  While the Japanese is not always essential in Miyazaki's films, I have found it so in this case (and in the case of Castle in the Sky, where in Japanese the two kids sound more like real kids, a girl and a boy who sound MUCH more intense at crucial, powerful moments in the film, vulnerable kids we care about).
