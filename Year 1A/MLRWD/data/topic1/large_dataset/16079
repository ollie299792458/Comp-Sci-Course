This DVD is the ideal way to see Adrian Lyne's "Lolita".  Any tecnical quality lost in not seeing it in a theater is more than made up for by the collection of supplemantal material.  It includes a nice  informal director's running commentary, a "casting session"  between the two stars, and an excellent collection of scenes that mostly  had to be left out for reasons of time. My favorites of these are a fantasy  drowning and a scene where a face on a wanted poster transforms into that  of the narrator's character.  The latter was actually at the direction of  the original author.  In the novel, he says something like, "if you  make a film out of this book, do this..."  It's unusual that a great  novel gets made into two great films.  Stanley Kubrick's 1962  "Lolita" was the box office hit it deserved to be, but is often  underrated by critics now. On the other hand, Lyne's version was not the  hit it deserved to be be, but I can picture that it will age well. It's a  great period piece, and well acted by Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, Frank  Langella, and above all by Dominique Swain.  Hers must be one of the best  debut performances on film. I enjoyed Sue Lyon in the Kubrick film, but  with Swain, I felt as if I was watching Nabokov's Lolita.
