I bought this movie for $1.00 at a local flea market.  I want my dollar back!  This movie was very disappointing.  I loved the first Highlander movie and the television series, Endgame is does not even come close to either of those.  The villain was prissy and way too manic.  He certainly did not seem like the bad ass killing machine he was supposed to be in this movie.  Duncan's love interest is not at all interesting.  Connor sleepwalks his way through the film.  The flashbacks of Connor are terrible, he looks old and worn out.  I know actors age but, couldn't they come up with some botox or at least better make-up for Christopher Lambert?  The plot has more holes than a fishing net.  Duncan kills his wife to activate her "immortality", no way!  A bunch of rogue immortals forming a gang? Ridiculous. Why didn't this gang of idiots figure out that their power mad leader would kill them all to gain their quickening?  There was way too much fighting and not enough decent dialogue.  At the end, it was painfully obvious that Adrian Paul was standing in front of a computerized image of the highlands at Connor's grave.  What cheap crap was that?  The cameos of Joe and Methos (two of my favorite supporting characters in the tv series)were uninspired and unnecessary.  This movie was a waste of my dollar, my time, and the efforts of the entire cast and crew.
