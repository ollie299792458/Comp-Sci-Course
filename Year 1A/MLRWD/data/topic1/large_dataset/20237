Whereas Seasons 2 and 3 of The X-Files slim set are seriously deficient in picture quality, Season 4 takes a surprising turn. Owing to a much better film-to-video transfer, the images are impressive, particularly in exterior shots. Although grain is sometimes evident in indoor scenes, it isn't distracting, and jitter, commonplace in the previous seasons, is rare. Outdoor shots look the way they should in a high-quality production--clear, sharp, and vivid. Worth noting are the scenes in the episode "Gethsemane" wherein several scientists--and later in the show, Mulder and a forensic anthropologist--trek in the snowy St. Elias Mountains on a mission to retrieve an alien corpse encased in ice. Here the visuals are flawless. The men's colorful parkas and backpacks brilliantly contrast with the pristine snow; stray snowflakes are clearly noticeable on their hats and boots. Viewed on an HDTV, this is as crisp as full frame (1.33:1) gets. As for sound, it has been consistently good since the first season: clean, robust Dolby Digital 2.0.

Just be sure to inspect your discs after you open the package. It's evident that the studio has cut corners on all fronts with this slim-set edition, including the way the discs are handled at the manufacturing plant. If your brand-new DVDs look like rental discs--with smudges, scratches, and dirt--send them back. Fewer extras are acceptable with a lower price, but disc abuse is not.
