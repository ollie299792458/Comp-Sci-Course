Oh dear - she should have seen it coming - but alas when ageing sex siren Mae West made this debacle , she was one very ill advised lady (!) which is a pity,as,had she made the movie eight years earlier,at the time of  "Myra Breckenridge",she would probably have pulled it off,or at  least made a better stab at it . It would still have been a  "camp-fest" , but not the "night of the living dead"  which resulted , when an admittedly legendary , but nevertheless  octagenarian lady was teamed up with countless hordes of "lustful  admirers" decades younger than she ! Despite this , there are one or  two glimpses of our darling old Mae , For example ;Dom De Luise catches Mae  coming out of the Gym "Hiya Marlo (Manners) what've you been doin  ?" "Oh ,woikin out with the  boys !" counters Mae with a  customary twinkle in her voice - momentarily  recapturing "my old  flame" The songs , however , are dire in the extreme , and that is  even for a diehard Mae West fan like myself . If you're feeling brave -  watch "Sextette" - but don't say you haven't been warned !!
