When I was a kid I can't recall how many times I watched this film on the television, but it was always among my favorites. It still is.
What's great about getting older is how your experiences can actually improve on something that's already among your favorites. Sadly, it also diminishes some of the things you thought you liked.
Everything about this film now has the weight of emotional maturity working for it. Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world, even for what he thought was a brief trip, holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then. That's especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event. This film opens with a restless man stuck in an age, his age, where he despises man's futility but accepts that life amicably enough.
It ends in a similar manner but now that man holds a sense of purpose, a goal he has set and will fulfill to the best of his ability. He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive.
The FX of this film are dated. They have to be. But the story itself is timeless. Forgive the pun.
The one disappointment is the battle towards the end. The Morlocks are not as scary as before. They're just as vile, but pathetic. I also wish George Pal had insisted on a scene from the book where the time traveller sees the future after the Morlock time when the sun is dimming.
Anyway, this has worn very well with age.
