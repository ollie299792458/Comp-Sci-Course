You know those movies that are even better the second time you see them? This is one of them. The first half of the movie seemed gratuitous and shallow, but as the story progresses, it gets deeper and more meaningful. So by the end, you are deeply immersed and moved. The second time you watch it, you are immersed from the start and notice small things that were shallow and gratuitous the first time round that now have deep meaning. The inclusion of humor (however racist and sometimes hurtful) makes this movie well balanced. I was rotflmao at the barber shop scene. The fact that it looked ad-libbed made it more real for me. Another reviewer said Walt hated everybody. That is right ... not so much a biased racist as a hater of everyone ... even the white kid who was trying to emulate the hommies. He respects hard work, no matter what your race, and I suspect many "racists" are this way and fall for believing in only the stereotypes. I know a few myself. Eastwood is a master film maker and this is one of his best.
