Swirling shots of immersive jungles, a greasy Apollo Creed, and almost intelligable lines like, "You never did know when to quit, did you?" make this the High Chieftan of Arnold flicks.  And the Guy Movie among Guy Movies as well; the 2 minute sequence of huge guns spraying masses of lead into nothingness is sheer testosterone.
And no one smokes cigars like Ah-nold.
"Payback Time!"  "Ain't got time to bleed!"  "Buncha slack-jawed ... around here, this stuff'll make ya into a .... sexual tyrannosaurus!  Just like me."  I mean, really, who WOULDN'T want Jesse Venture as their state's governor?
Sure this is generic action whatnot from McTiernan, but it's awesome at what it does.  And don't deny the great performance of what's-his-name, the guy who plays Ventura's best friend.  The "any time" guy.  That guy was awesome.  His freakouts are genuinely believable.
And seriously, every single line Arnold utters is immense entertainment.  He should play every part in every movie for the rest of time.
The reason I gave this DVD three stars is the unforgivable lack of extras, which is inexcusable in this day and age.  We want to see Stan Winston making the Predator's crab-claw mouth!  We want to see extra closeups of Arnie taking meaty drags from his phallic stogie!  And what about the famous behind-the-scenes thirteen-minute brawl between Ahhnold and Weathers, the one that gave Weathers the busted eye socket?  Rumor has it McTiernan caught the whole thing on film, including the smack that actually popped Weathers' eye out of the socket momentarily.  That stuff would be nice to see.
Criterion has done DVDs of The Rock and Armaggedon, so they shouldn't feel like it would be "low" of them to commit an extensive effort to McTiernan's "crass" bit of masculinity.
