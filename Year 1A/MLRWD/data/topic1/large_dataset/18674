It really is not too soon for this film, as some have suggested. People are still trying to find meaning for 9-11, and though this film does not answer many questions, it does, in its final moments, find focus and release for the pent-up emotions of the past five years regarding this event.

The genius of "United 93" is in the choice to go with a cinema-verite style, instead of a pathetically romantic hero-action flick style, as is "World Trade Center", which came across to me as "9-11 For Dummies". In "United 93" there is truth. There are no action-flick cliches; no heroic fanfares; no character introductions. The relatively unknown actors do not stand around reciting cleverly written dialogue -- most of the talking overlaps as in a Robert Altman film. Indeed, the government-plundered line "Let's roll" is almost whispered as an aside, along "C'mon already...let's do it," which is probably more like how it really happened. The line is not used to sell a point, (or a war, for that matter).

As many others have said, this film will have your stomach in knots from the get-go. The viewer is forced to sit and watch, helpless, knowing what's to come while the cast appear as deer in headlights. The emotions of the passengers is often hard to take; I was literally moved to sobs by the goodbye phonecall made by the head stewardess, even though half of what she says is unintelligible; this film works that well on such a raw emotional level. The men do not posture themselves as cliched heros. Most are near-speechless, and all have tears in their eyes.

Then there is the final violence, which provides the only moment of release in the film. Plans are made; there is a brief pause, then the passengers suddenly rise with a barbaric "yawp" that is exhilarating, despite its ultimate futility.

This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.
