I absolutely loved this version of The Phantom of the Opera. I am a huge fan of old movies. This version resembles the original story by Gaston Leroux the closest. The Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite books of all time and I have been disapointed many times by the many attempts film makers have made at bringing this story to the screen. They need to just tell the story the way it was written, because it is flawless the way it is. It does not need Hollywood changing it, trying to make the story more interesting. This film is the closest thing to the real story and Lon Chaney prortrays the Phantom as he really is, A disfigured monster and madman. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the stage version by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the new movie version of it, but nothing compares to the original story. The fact that this is a silent film only adds to the beauty of it. I guess you have to have a thing for movies like this to appreciate it, but I guess I'm one of those people. If you like old movies and are interested in the real story, you'll enjoy this movie.
