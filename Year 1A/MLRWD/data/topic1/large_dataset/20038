You ever seen American Beauty? Well how about Road to Perdition? Just imagine that style of filmmaking in Jarhead and you should know its going to be one of the best war movies in a long time and of all time. Sam Mendes is behind the helm in this huge film and he brings a nice unique feel to it. You know its going to be good if this guys first film was American Beauty. Road to Perdition was his second film, not as mind-blowing as American Beauty, but I'm telling you Jarhead is a great turn for him. It's a film the movie world really needs, a good unique war triumph like Jarhead. Even the trailer should grab you already. So go and watch this movie, and then own it, because it's a great freakin' flick. Best war movie in years, I'm telling you. Academy Award winning director of American Beauty, an Outstanding film, brings you a movie you will want to watch and own for years to come, Jarhead!! But, beware there actually is no fighting, doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.

Based on Anthony Swofford's best selling book in 2003.

A true story of his experiences before Desert Storm.

The look of the movie is very impressive.

Watch it, Buy it, Breath it, Remember it!
