While this film may not portray the hacker life accurately (it would be boring if it did) it does bring a flashy presentation to the lifestyle. It uses Cyberpunk elements in it and stunning visuals to make it an interesting film. This film does not take itself seriously and because of it It is a fun and memorable film and a cult classic! Angelina Jolie actually looks normal and portrays a naughty cyberpunk chick  (She looks amazing in this film (the best I think of her entire screen-life!) and Mathew Lillard plays a crazy hippie dude who is goofy and lovable. Those are the two main stars that are recognizable. It may be a cheesy film but it a fun film. They do use some internet terms like "Leet" and "Handle" and a version of the Hacker's Manifesto (there are many out there.) Don't expect an accurate portrayal of Hacker life but a cool film that brings it to a mainstream eye. I highly recommend this film if you like just fun movies and are interested in a Cyber-punk lifestyle type film. I give hackers a 10/10 only thing is that there are no extras (besides the movie trailer) but it is worth it.
