A VISION!  There is no film as alien-feeling as Dune.  You are suddenly not on Earth, or watching a movie created by Earthlings.  You are immersed in an alien culture, and as such, you feel, at times: lost, intrigued,  confused, fascinated, challenged, mystified, agape, and profoundly  affected.  
Revel in its perplexity - that's Dune. There's sure no  babysitter to hold your hand, but the puzzles are more rewarding when you  solve them yourself.  It's OK if you don't "get" everything.  Repeated viewings are highly recommended and richly rewarding to those who  like to think and don't pick their movies based on box office.
A  clarification to another review point: The longer TV version is NOT the  "Director's Cut"!  David Lynch would not allow the long hacked-up  version to carry his name (rightly so!), and so the name "Allen  Smythee" was tacked on, as is done in these instances.  I don't  recommend the long cut.  Editing out the sweet, elegantly precise Princess  Irulan narative, and replacing her with a cliche reveals the stultifying  heavy hand of the long cut's handlers. I recommend the Lynch original.
I  love Dune! Enjoy!
