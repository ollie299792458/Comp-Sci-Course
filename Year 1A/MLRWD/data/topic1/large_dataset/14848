Based on a true the Schindler `s List is a story about  Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazi's now ruling Germany. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils and then uses bribes to win military contract. He also hires an accountant Itzhak Stern  to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a very dependable labor force. For Stern, who is also a Jew this job could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. Then  n 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goet who is a raging alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony for fun. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. He then begins to demands more workers in effort to keep more Jews alive and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from death at a concentration camp.
This movie is very inspiring and relates greatly to World Religion in this time period Hitler was out to make an Aryan race which included blonde hair and blue eyes which left many Jews out of that category. To better accomplish this goal he isolated them and sent them to concentration camps to be killed. Judaism was not accepted because of Hitler's belief but the events of the Holocaust made the Jewish people stronger and made sure that their children and the rest of the world know what they went through so that it would never be forgotten or happen again.
