As a film critic says in one of the interviews on this splendid special edition, Billy Wilder not only had the craft, style and elegance we associate with classic Hollywood, he also had a biting wit that appeals to the sensibilities of today.  This film has aged much better than it's central villian, the demented starlet portrayed to perfection by real-life demented starlet Gloria Swanson.  William Holden's (literally) dead-pan narration as a two-bit screenwriter of B-movies is as sad and funny as it ever was.
The documentary on the disc does a good job of demonstrating just how unique the tone of this story is, how it perfectly navigates between funny and sad.  Not everyone in Hollywood saw the funny side when it was released, and it lost to ALL ABOUT EVE at that year's Oscars.  So what?  With this disc, SUNSET BOULEVARD is finally getting it's due.
Besides the documentary, you can read two screenplay drafts of an excised opening sequence, explore 1950's Hollywood with an interactive map and watch the film with audio commentary by a critic and historian.  All these features are secondary, of course, to the movie.  It looks gorgeous.  The black and white picture is rich and crisp, the sound is re-mastered and the story is as compelling as ever.  The special features only do what all good special features should do on a DVD.  They add to the richness of the film.  You may already know that Eric von Stroheim (who plays a character who directed Gloria Swanson's character in silent films) directed Gloria Swanson in silent films.  But did you know that the drugstore where all the screenwriter's hang out in the movie is the drug store where F. Scott Fitzgerald had a heart attack in 1940?  One of the reasons I love this movie is because it is so rich with Hollywood history.
I can't recommend this disc highly enough.  Kudos to Columbia for doing right by a classic, a real film lover's film.  I love this movie and I love this disc!  5/5 stars.
