I watch a lot of movies but really have no business reviewing them. I make the exception for GOON because it indeed is exceptional. I assure you (any reader still with me this far) that I wouldn't hand out 5 star ratings if I were a professional critic. I am actually a Professional Chef de Cuisine. So more to the point...

Rarely does one see the sublime skill-sets of so many so well synchronized in any composition. You might experience it during a 12 course meal at NOMA in Copenhagen, or witness it during a Superbowl's final moments brought to you LIVE via satellite, or any other experience a person may have that leaves one with a deep appreciation for the concerted effort and truly magical success of the endeavor finally realized.

The Direction? unnoticeable, seriously unnoticeable. And that's Good! I witnessed actors dancing to a predetermined song, seemingly un-choreographed yet graceful; Graceful in its approach to the story (the screenplay), its performance of every single actor and techie and athlete/stunt-person, the Maestro that conducted, and ultimately edited this ass-kicking symphony of Good Guy Brute makes small-town proud, meets girls and kicks ass!!!

And the hockey was pretty awesome also.  =OD

BRAVO!!!!
