Yes, you can see trouble brewing within the fragile lives of the widow and her children, and perhaps the townspeople are stereotyped, as is the lonely hunter. Yet what would the human brain be without distinct patterns to remember by? Stereotypes such as those in the movie are based on a truthful experience, and one can easily imagine how pissed off the loggers would be without work. That type of struggle does go on, at least here in New Mexico where one effing spotted owl can shut down an entire industry. Back to the movie: great acting, lovely suspense, and a nice respite from recent blockbusters I saw. The reviews are right: this movie would have been phenomenal on the big screen.

I just had a fab movie weekend; a trilogy consisting of Hunter, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0080CL0HM">Bel Ami</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TJ7EFG">Melancholia</a>. All three were different yet alike in portraying the fragility of life, the solitariness of one's existence and yet, the endurance and longing for another human being. Cliche? Perhaps, but all great stories have these pillars as a basis, and in the end, know that the hero has weaknesses too. William Defoe was brilliant.
