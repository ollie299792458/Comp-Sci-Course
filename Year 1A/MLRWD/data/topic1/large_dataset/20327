When I saw the Scorpion King I was completely convinced that The Rock was nothing more than another muscle bound hunk looking for hollywood action to ad to his wrestling career.  He was impressive physically of course, but his acting was nothing more than a drawl.
So when the Rundown first came out I was convinced it would have no more substance and I opted to not see it in theaters.  It's a decision I regret.
This movie has changed my entire view of the Rock as an actor.  His performance is actually quite impresive for an action star, his character is not only memorable, but likeable.  The action is top notch, showing some of the most incredible camera shots and stunt work i've seen in a while.  It's got to be the most original action movie this year.
If the movie has one failing, it is its plot.  I know that sounds like it might actually ruin the entire movie but it doesn't.  The plot is just very cliche, which is ironic because the characters, particularly Beck(The Rock), are all so original.  Trust me, this movie is very good, at times you might go "ah common" at its plot twists, but there is very little to criticisze about the action, the directing, and even better, the acting!
