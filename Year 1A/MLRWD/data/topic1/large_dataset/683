Those of us that grew up watching this show in the mid to late 80's remember it fondly.  The undeniable chemisty that existed between the characters of Maddie (Cybill Sheppard) and David (a young Bruce Willis with actual hair) kept us coming back again and again, and remains one of the best TV matchups of all time.  The humor and creativity behind this series is so superior that it holds up still 20 years after its initial airing.  From the breaking of the fourth wall to acknowledge the watching audiences' existence to the almost slapstick comedy that happened in nearly every episode, this series set the bar extremely high for all series that followed.  For all that have waited patiently through all the false promises of this series being released on DVD, your patience is finally being rewarded.  A heartfelt "Thank You" to Lions Gate studios for finally allowing this show to finally see the light of day again on DVD.  Now they just need to hasten the release of the remainder of the seasons to DVD.  I look forward to once again seeing arguably the best episode of the series, "Atomic Shakespeare" ("I HATE IAMBIC PENTAMETER!") from season 3, in all its hilarious glory on DVD.
