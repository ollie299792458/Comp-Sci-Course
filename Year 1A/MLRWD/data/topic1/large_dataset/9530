I was actually expecting some kind of documentary about the prevalence of surveillance cameras in our modern world and daily lives and possibly its effects on all of us; this kind of content was the reason why I decided to get this DVD. It turned out to be a drama performed by actors shot in a simulated security camera kind of view. Although its various scenes weren't real, it still sends a clear message, that everything we do can possibly be recorded without our knowledge and later used to harm or benefit us, depending on the circumstances. It also points out many dangers that we can learn to avoid. These cameras are in fact electronic eye witnesses. Their absence do not mean that things don't  happen, but their presence will to some degree deter improper behavior and also record events so that they can later be viewed to determine what, why, where, and how things happen.  I like this DVD because it educates people so that they can adapt to our modern world more easily. The presence of plain view security cameras does modify our behavior in public settings. But the use of hidden pin-hole security cameras made many thought-to-be private settings insecure. Many people will feel nervous for the increasingly lack of privacy no matter where they go and whatever they do. But this is a fact of life these days, and if one acts and behaves properly, there is really nothing to be afraid of. The security cameras are a deterrent for not acting properly. In this respect, I don't think that is so bad. This is a real world education DVD.
