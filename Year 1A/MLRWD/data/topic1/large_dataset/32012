Whale Rider was a great movie. It really captures the feeling of never giving up. From the beginning the movie grabs your attention with the hardship of the family facing a terrible lose and gaining a true blessing in disguise. The first born little boy of the new generation, the profit who they expected would take them out of the darkness and make everything better again, and instead his twin sister survived, Paikea.
The family in this movie captured a lot of traditional values that had been handed down from generation to generation. Traditions that were hard to allow change but it happened and taught the family that change is not always a bad thing to accept. This little girl was looked upon by her grandfather as being a curse.  He loved her in a way that the only thing she lived for was to please him. But his traditional values were too strong to let her in that he pushed her away to venture things on her own. The teachings to the younger boys about the old ways were stick and enduring. These were to test their strength, fighting skills, learning and leadership ability, to produce future warriors and future chiefs. Through it all the one that was looked at as being a curse the one that broke the line back to the ancestors was the one who lead them all back together through to a new beginning.
Overall, this movie had memorable moments and relatable moments were it teaches you about strength, endurance, the ability to allow things to change, and to never give up. Family played a big part in this film along with family traditional values that they all valued and held high, but we all learn that things change over generation and in some situations it only takes one to make a difference and to help start a new tradition.
