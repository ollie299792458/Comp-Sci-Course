This anime delivers everything Neon Genesis Evangelion failed to.  If you are looking for action, romance, cerebral content, and an ultimately moving series, this anime is for you.  If you are looking for absurdly esoteric symbolism, heaps of angst, and a snobbish fan base, you have stumbled onto the wrong series.

While Rahxephon does have a fair share of symbolism, foreshadowing, and brain teasers, it is NOT needlessly convoluted, unlike Evangelion.  As to comparisons between the two, Rahxephon and Evangelion are similar only so far as they both involve humanoid mechs, a male main character, and an epic story.  Other than that, Rahxephon is its own series.  If you enjoy character-focused action/romance/drama/comedy anime with minimal angst, this series will not disappoint.  Please do note that the focus of the series is actually not on combat for combat's sake.  While this anime has plenty of action, such encounters act merely as a portion of the orchestra that makes up the symphony that is Rahxephon.

Technical Note: This set contains the complete 26 episode long series and (at least mine) does come with the Rahxephon movie, located at the end of the series.

Important Note: If you receive the same set I did, the movie starts after the credits of the 26th episode, the last episode of the series.  A lot of people seem to have accidentally mistaken the movie as the series restarting.  Don't do that!  The movie focuses on explaining certain aspects of the series.  While it does use a lot of footage from the series, it alters it a good deal and adds on it.  Pay close attention to the dialogue in the first five minutes.  The movie does appear to start the same as the series but the dialogue is actually different.
