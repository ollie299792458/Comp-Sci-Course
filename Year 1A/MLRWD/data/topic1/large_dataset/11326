I'll join the chorus of howls now.

The Seagal checklist: tight black jeans (check), billowy dark colored top with tank top (check), pony tail (check), cheesy Italian accent (check), cheesy Italian lingo (check), classic Seagal swagger (check), squinting for the effect + calm whisper-like speech = serious bad*ss (check), lack of legit plot allowing for ball-busting humorous violence (check), great opening title freeze w/Seagal caught in hole of windshield he just threw a pimp through (check), over the top disgusting amoral horrible villain (here nailed by William Forsythe and his scary moustache) (check), small parts for John Leguizamo, Julianna Margulies, Raymond Cruz, Gina Gershon, Dominic Chianese, Jerry Orbach (what was he doing here?) and New York based actors schooled in proper goon characterizations (check), sensitivity for lone suffering child + abandoned cute dog (check), hilarious and successful tough guy square-offs in butcher shop, large and maze-like yet decrepit apartment and (especially) dive pool hall (check), Seagal written and produced song called "Don't Stand in My Way" performed by Gregg Allman(!) over the closing credits (check), beret(!) (check), overt reference to On the Waterfront with a character (though a large busted cocktail waitress here) named Terry Malloy (check).

Did I forget anything? (There's a comment link if you want to tell me.)

Maybe the best of the early, pre-Under Seige low-budget Seagal pics.
