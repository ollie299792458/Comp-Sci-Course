Just received this DVD and it looks terrific. However, the case says "matted" 1:85 aspect ratio. This is incorrect as it has a 2:35 ratio(to my delight). I recently recorded it when AMC showed it in full screen.What a difference. The part that really showed full screen in all its horror was when Elliot Gould and Karen Black are riding in the 280Z and the camera shows a front view of them. In full screen you only see one of them at a time as the camera pans back and forth to whoever is talking. On my new DVD you get to see both actors at the same time.And of course thre are many, many other scenes that are like that also. Some reviewers said the transfer was not good but I disagree. This DVD looks great and what a story, even if far-fetched and a little slow in the middle. Telly Savales as a crusty old crop duster is a real hoot. Gould says, "I'm Cauldfield". Savales says , "I can't help that". Gould says, "I thought you said $100 to rent your plane?" Savales says , "$125 because you said OK to $100 too quick, smart a#%". The dialogue in the air between them is hilarious. I recommend this to anyone who likes 70's thrillers with just the right amount of humor thrown in.
