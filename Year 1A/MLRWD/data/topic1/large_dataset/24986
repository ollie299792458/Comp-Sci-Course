This is a typical French movie, which means that it lives up to the expectation that all major protagonists will die as story unfolds, with all fruits of their short cinematographic existence being lost while in the process of said dying.

This is hardly surprising as French contributed a great deal to existentialism with Jean-Paul Sartre declaring that "All human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure" back in 1940's. How true. Of course later on Sartre developed this further with "L'enfer, c'est les autres" which is often translated as "Hell is other peoples pretentious movies", which is also very true.

"Rififi" is one of the better French movies and the single reason for that is the absolutely amazing scene of a jewelry store heist. It is quite long, shot in a documentary style and completely lacks any audio accommodations. Towards the end of it one feels as being part of the crew that just pulled it off.

I don't believe the director intended to, but the movie is quite educational in potentially penitentiary aspects - I didn't expect to learn how to crack open a bank safe when I set out watching this story, but now I feel I could do that if needed, not that I ever intent to.

A minor technical point is that audio seems to be may be 1 sec or so behind, this could be a DVD transfer issue.

Rated 4/5, as a must have classic that will be watched once and promptly forgotten afterwards.
