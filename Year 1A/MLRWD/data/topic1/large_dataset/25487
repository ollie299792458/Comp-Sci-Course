I love the actors in this movie!  Hands down, you couldn't have picked a better cast.  The "glass house" used in the film adds a lot of interesting mood throughout the film but what about all the rain?  Does it really rain that much in Malibu?  It seemed like it only rains at night strangely enough and then it's bright and sunny the next day like it never rained the night before?  Hmmm.  I guess I am nitpicking on this one but it simply doesn't hold one genuine candle of suspense throughout the whole film!  To start off, Leelee does not even look remotely 16 years old, (she's actually 23), Diane Lane (I can't believe how she has literally never aged!) is a brilliant actress but she's left scraping for crumbs here since her talent is far wasted against Stellan's character.  Unfortunately, this movie plays like an afterschool special that ABC decided to air at night-LOL.  It's got the dark atmosphere, the creepy incestial sensibilities, the weird familial episodes of drug use and the odd brother sleeping with sister thing, but it just doesn't tie together well.  Too many plot holes, too many scenes that don't gel together properly and not enough "realism" to keep the audience interested.  Wait for video on this one folks!
