The trouble with reviewing films like this is that there is the pretentious crowd that think if you don't like it, then you don't understand it. I liken this group to soccer fans. Even though their "sport" is boring, overlong, dull, and structurally unsound, the fans look down on anyone who doesn't like it.

  This film, like most in the Dogme 95 style, is a lot like the previously stated view of soccer. The arthouse crowd will be all over it because it uses no artificial lighting, costumes, etc. and they are smarter than you and I because they like it. In reality, however, it seems after viewing this film that a 14-year-old got a bunch of his buddies together and pieced together different incoherent scenes with a couple of digital cameras and hidden video.

  I have to give this crowd credit, because it seems that they can slap anything on film, give it a pretentious name like "Dogme 95" and get away with it because if you don't like it, then you just aren't smart enough to "get it".

  I think I will make a Dogme 95 movie. The next time I need to have a bowel movement, I will take along the old Sony Handycam. I won't use any artificial light, except for the bathroom 60-watt halogen, and film it from beginning to end. I will film lots of close-ups and hold the camera at weird angles to really call myself a "filmmaker". If you don't like my movie, then you just don't understand it. Please pass the green tea and the organic cucumber slices, I have a tree hugging meeting at 4:30.
