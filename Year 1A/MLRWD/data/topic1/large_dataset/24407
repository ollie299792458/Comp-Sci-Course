This series will take you inside  sea shepherd`s 2007-2008 anti-whaling campaign. Now the sea shepherds aren`t like most environmentalists  these guys  are really special because they use tactics that are not commonly used.
Maybe that`s why some people call them "radicals" or "eco-terrorists" but don`t be fooled ,all the tactics that they use are in most cases absolutely harmless. Well these are the good guys . The bad guys  are the japanese. Every year they intend to kill about 1000 whales for "research" purposes but we all know that`s a humongous lie. In reality all that whale meat goes to asian markets and restaurants , they even have a factory ship  to process and pack  the meat in site.
This series take you inside the Steve Irwin where you`ll meet CPTN. Watson and his crew of volunteers. you`ll see how they live , how they prepare for battle and most importantly you`ll see how they try to sabotage  the whaling ships in order to disable them and prevent them from killing whales  which is  absolutely exciting (the sabotaging).
I find this series very exciting and also extremely inspiring. It made me  want to be there , I wish there were more pople like the sea shepherds.I agree with  all the things they do  but I think they do need more training , organization and safety assesment because in some cases they did take stupid risks.
I think some pople will find sea shepherds modus operandi extreme and maybe radical  but let`s remember  that our environment is in extreme crisis and we need to act now.
What our planet and its species needs is for all of us to just wake up and  take action now! so join the sea shepherd`s army now!
