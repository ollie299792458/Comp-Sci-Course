Camp Crystal Lake, 1957. A mysterious figure hacks up two love-bonding teenagers, kicking off a great, entertaining credits sequence with Harry Manfredini's great score!
Opening to 1980, a teenager is on her way to Camp Crystal Lake,
to meet up with other camp counselors who are putting the camp back up for the summer. She is warned by the town's people, but ignores their warnings. Ofcourse, being the original film in the Friday The 13th horror movie series, she makes a deadly mistake, picking up a ride from a mysterious figure in a jeep. 
Meanwhile back at camp, the head, Steve Christy, leaves the young counselors to clean up as he goes to town. As night comes, a storm comes and so does Mrs. Voorhees hacking her way threw this horror venture, featuring special effects by Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead). 
This original flick in the great franchise has so far, spawned nine sequels, including the groovily fun Jason X! Ofcourse all these horror greats are fun! Some good gore abound in this flick, including a slit throat, arrow threw the neck, axe to the face and more! The sequels got even better, more death scenes and ofcourse, Jason would take the axe over in Part 2! 
HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH!
