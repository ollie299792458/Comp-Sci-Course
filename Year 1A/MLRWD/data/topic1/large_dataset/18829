I usually don't bother writing reviews but i just couldn't help it after seeing this horrible, where is hollywod's money going movie....Worst movie i seen in years, makes no sense, fake and unreal, cheesy, unfunny piece of crap....I don't know what the director and writer of this were thinking when they made this more than B movie but they sure showed us that making movies can be done by a 5 year old...being a director myself, i can honestly say to you avoid this fairy tale crap by any means..the acting is o.k to be honest but the writing, the dialogue, the directing, the music, and what i find most important in movies the meaning and realism is not there. It's a movie that has as a target audience the stupid people...I may be a little harsh but its the truth...Even as a women's flick this has absolutely nooooo dignity or originality to be even called a movie. It is true. To director and the writer of this : Find another job and stop wasting money and time of the film industry ! A lot more talented people are out there without jobs !
