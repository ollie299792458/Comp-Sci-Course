We've all seen that film - the one with hazy memory sequences and overexposed scenes with a presence that tells you that what you're seeing is important.

Blue Valentine is full of this sort of cinematography and dramatic film editing - so much so that I think it's trying to compensate for a lack of substantive weight.  I did find the cinematography and editing to be interesting.  So that's a plus.

Plot:
In interspersed scenes, you see the couple's courtship in the past and their distance in the present.  It's no secret that this is a story about a couple breaking up, so that's what you see.  How they got together, and now that they are different people.  There's nothing else to the story.  Their courtship was nothing special - I didn't find it extremely charming or passionate. And their breakup - I'm still not sure why things ended.  I mean, aside from the fact that it wasn't all that believable why they got together, and the guy was immature from start to end.

I really wanted to like this film - and I see that so many people did.  But for me this film didn't do it.  It seemed too much about trying to be artistic and leaves the plot empty.
