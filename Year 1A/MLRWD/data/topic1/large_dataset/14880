To be clear from the start: "Hide and Seek" is not a good movie. It's not even close to good. It's schlock. The plot makes no sense, it's predictable, etc. But, having said that, I really liked it.

Negatives:

1) Robert DeNiro's talent is wasted in this movie. They could have gotten any generic actor to do that role and nothing would have been lost.

2) The 'surprise twists' are painfully obvious. Unless this is the first movie you've ever seen, you'll probably be able to anticipate all the surprises within the first few minutes of the movie.

3) It isn't scary.

4) There's no real logic to this movie. Once it's over, if you stop and think about what just happened, you'll realize there's no way it makes any sense at all. I can't elaborate without giving away the 'surprise' twists, but trust me on this one.

5) This is a somewhat minor point, but in the alternative endings, there's no continuity. Example: A woman opens a door. It's a normal door. Then, when she closes it, it's got a window in it, which is the payoff to another 'surprise twist.' But that window wasn't there 2 minutes ago when she opened the door. They switched doors, in other words. So, that's not really playing fair, is it?

Positives:

Dakota Fanning.

That girl is fun to watch. She's actually pretty hilarious most of the time, though I don't think that was the intention, because she's such a little brat! Example: Her dad has a new ladyfriend over for dinner and Dakota tells her in this morose, monotone, while looking up at her with those big, weary eyes, "My mommy killed herself. Hope the same thing doesn't happen to you."

Ooh!!! Give that girl a time out!!!

Anyway, really, if you have incredibly low expectations, you may enjoy this movie. Just think of it as a "War of the Roses" between DeNiro and Fanning rather than a thriller, and you'll have a good time!
