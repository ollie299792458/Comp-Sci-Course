The only value of Van Sant's film is pedagogical. It demonstrates how Hitchcock's 'touch' demands the most rigorous/scrupulous attention to cinematic form: the careful placement of the actor within the frame, the rhythmic potential of montage, the expressive power of camera movement, etc. None of this is found in Van Sant's 'shot-by-shot' remake. (Either he was lying when he called it that or he is blind.) I use the film when I teach Hitchcock and it is extremely useful: students get to see with their own eyes how the slightest changes in detail -- due to whim or a simple lack of attention -- alter the power and meaning of an entire sequence. (When the actors rattle off their lines there doesn't seem to be any human agency behind the camera directing them.)
The only way to argue for the film would be to claim that its awfulness is deliberate -- that Van Sant's version is post-horror, a portrait of a world drained of eroticism, beauty, sadness (i.e., human feeling). But even if this were true, it still doesn't make it any less painful to watch. This is a lousy film.
