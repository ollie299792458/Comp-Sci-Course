Called trashy melodrama by some critics, "Leave Her to Heaven," the story of a demented woman and the husband who becomes trapped in her web of possession, insanity, and murder, is trash at its zenith, a prime example of 1940s studio opulence. This film noir, told in extended flashback as the husband returns home from an unjust prison term, is unusual in that it is in vibrant Technicolor rather than the genre's usual black-and-white. But the contrast between visual brilliance and psychosis enhances the horror. In her autobiography, Gene Tierney wrote that she had wanted to play Ellen Berent ever since she read Ben Ames Williams's novel. She worked well with John Stahl, and "blossomed under his direction." Besides the sets at Twentieth Century-Fox, filming was done on location in Arizona, northern California, and Georgia. The real star of the film may be Leon Shamroy's Technicolor cinematography, which earned the picture its only Academy Award and is still beautiful more than sixty years later.

The recent Fox Studio Classics DVD release of "Leave Her to Heaven" contains an excellent transfer of the restored film, relevant contemporary newsreels, a restoration comparison, and commentary by supporting actor Darryl Hickman and critic Richard Schickel. Both Hickman and Schickel offer interesting insights, but each is sometimes condescending toward the acting talents of Tierney, Cornel Wilde, and particularly Jeanne Crain. Inexplicably and inexcusably, Schickel repeatedly pronounces director Stahl's name "Sphal."
