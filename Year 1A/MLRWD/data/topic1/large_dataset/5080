Every girl at some point wants to be a princess, right? Well, for starters, it's a classic tale, the kind that you tell to your kids. They start wanting dreams to come true and find true love, which is mostly the base of Disney. Also, there's the traditional music numbers (mostly the "woe is me" or describing a character), chores with animals, and a happy ending.

The problems I have with this are:

1. Cinderella. She never complains or even scowls at Stepmother. Think about it: your parents died and you're stuck with mean stepsisters and a stepmother (not ALL stepmothers and stepsisters are mean). Then they make you do all the housework, where your new family doesn't lift a finger to help you. Cinderella just never stands up for herself. If I were in her place, I'd protest, glare, and even try to leave. All she does is prance around singing, doing chores with animals, and wishing for a new life without doing anything. This is why I like the book Just Ella based off of this fairy tale. Ella actually has a backbone and is pretty sarcastic with her stepfamily and her snotty main instructor.

2. The Godmother. Why didn't the old lady show up before? Why now when Cindrella wants to go to the ball? Why didn't she appear when Cinderella lost her parents and do something? Her wand could turn back time in the third movie, so why couldn't she have prevented Cinderella's parents from dying or even helping Cinderella leave the house?

3. Some characters were flat. I wish I knew why Stepmother and her daughters were so mean. You can't just hate someone because they're there. Did Stepmother just marry Cindrella's father for power and just dislike his daughter because she could get more inheritance? Were the Stepsisters jealous? Why? The animals were okay. They were really sweet.

Overall, it's a good movie.
