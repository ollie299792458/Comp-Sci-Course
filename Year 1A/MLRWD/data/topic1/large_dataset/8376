One of the few movies that matches the quality of the book.

Shute's chilling novel of the aftermath of nuclear war is brought to life with great acting and screenwriting. It's refreshing to see movie makers take the opportunity to use their skills to bring more drama to a story rather than inject new storylines and plot simplification.

Shute wrote a gripping story of those who fate assembled to face the end of civilization as the path of nuclear fallout finally reaches the last bastion of humans, Australia.  It is a story with strong undercurrents of character. Man's best and worst. Love and sacrifice. Dealing with the unthinkable prospect of offering one's children a painless death or more days of suffering.

The movie brought to life the racing scenes from the book as a group of racers held what they knew would be the last road race on earth. Produced in an age when car collecting was not an obsession the movie probably consumed cars which in today's world would bring $50+ million at auction.

The postwar visit to San Francisco is especially chilling.

Decades later and beyond the terror of the Cold War this movie still evokes strong emotions. Highly recommended.
