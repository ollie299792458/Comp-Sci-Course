I had not even heard of this movie until learning of Jacki Weaver's Oscar nomination.  Liking great performances in interesting looking films, I purchased the dvd and was pleasantly surprised.  This is one terrific crime drama with equally terrific peformances.  Jacki Weaver not only deserved her Oscar nom but in my opinion should have taken home the Academy Award, she was that good.  The rest of the cast was impressive as well, but it was Ben Mendelsohn whom I thought was the real standout.  From the moment he appears on screen he catches your attention, and I for one was mesmerized by his performance as "Pope," one of the more intriguing screen criminals in recent memory.  There's one particular favorite scene of mine, with an Air Supply music video playing over it, wherein Mendelsohn doesn't utter a word, and barely moves, yet terrifies with his mere presence and stare.  He is chilling here and throughout.  Aside from the performances I liked the fact that this was a crime drama that focused more upon the criminal family than the deeds they perpetrated which led to their reputation.  With one notable exception that sets off a violent chain of events, those deeds are not shown and I think the movie is the better for it.  It's a much different take on the subject matter, making for a much more interesting film, although I must admit I would love to see a prequel that shows how the notorious Cody clan got started on their life of crime.  Hopefully David Michod (great directorial debut here) will consider it.
