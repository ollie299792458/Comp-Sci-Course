ok so maybe slightly cliche ridden and sort of james bond esque, but dont you think that this is definately an improvement on bond, i am not saying it's better but definately a step away from the womanising alcoholic that is james bond, i mean XXX doesnt drink, smoke, bed every girl, and generally be a bit srrogant, but he is a bit of a crook?!
but as for the film, i think that vin diesel was the only man to play this role, as he is the only one big enough to fill the shoes, lol, aprt from that he has a presence that exudes confidence on screen.
the storyline as far as i know is original and the way he is brought into that lifestyle of the 'spy' is quite good, and i am shocked and in awe that samuel l jackson is playing a supporting role in this movie that i think he does very well.
as for the the other actors i think they all do a bang up job, as for the directing top notch and the effects and stunts, well i am putting a hat on to take it off to them as they kick some serious ass
