I did not rent "Babylon A.D." expecting it to rock my world, quite the contrary, I only anticipated a halfway decent 80 minutes of sci-fi escapism somewhere along the lines of the "Riddick" movies (which I love BTW). Unfortunately, my expectations were not low enough...

I felt no connection to it's characters, all of which are supremely annoying, one dimensional, cookie cutter stereotypes, devoid of compelling qualities (like bad cartoon heroes). I've enjoyed Diesel & Yeoh's other films (they're talented actors), but they literally have nothing to work with in Babylon A.D.'s insipid script.

The nonsensical plot is mentally insulting, even anger inducing at points. It would pain me to describe it, but fortunately it has already been dissected and ridiculed by legions of unhappy viewers.

Action in Babylon A.D. is infrequent, hideously choreographed and very, very boring. The FX may even hurt your eyes, it's all so distractingly cringe inducing.

I strongly recommend that you do not watch this, as it could very well ruin your evening, and compel you to write a review of warning, when all you desperately want is to drown your memory of it in a sea of alcohol!
