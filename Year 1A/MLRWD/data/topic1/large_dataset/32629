Besides the fact that with one DVD you can get all the released videos for album singles, this cd contains a very innovative approach to showing off video extras. Each song has video for the released version, as well as a reel of extra footage, most of which was not on the video origionally. To go with the video, each song has the cd version of the song to accompany the music video, and at least 1 track of commentary. Together this gives you at least 4 combinations for each song, and in some songs with extra audio there are 6 or 8 variations. This means that even when you have sat down for an hour and watched all the music videos, there are still countless combinations left. Besides this, there are some extras such as a short film based off of the song "try try try", and live versions of "an ode to no one" from the last show in chicago, as well as a live version of cherub rock with a humorous preview.
All in all, this DVD is an absolute must for any pumpkins fanatic, and even a great but for a casual pumpkin fan. It combines an incredable mix of music videos with one of the best dvd setups out there. I have watched hours upon hours and I still go back to watch it every few weeks.
