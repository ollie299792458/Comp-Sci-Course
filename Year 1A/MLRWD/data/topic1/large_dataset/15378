..... OR, even BETTER, how about NEGATIVE star ratings??

I grew up watching the original GET SMART ..... I LOVED the show.
When I heard that this movie was being made, I was excited.
When I heard that Steve Carell had been chosen to play Maxwell Smart, I thought that he was a good choice.
He's NOT my favorite comedic actor, but I thought he'd do a pretty good job!!
I was really looking forward to this movie.

BOY, WAS I WRONG ..... AND DISAPPOINTED!!!

As I sat in the theater, I was almost in tears.
The ONLY amusing scene in the ENTIRE movie was when "THE ROCK" stapled a piece of paper to someone's head.
(I've had thoughts of doing that to some "DESERVING" folks myself from time to time)

Anne Hathaway is a DYNAMITE looking woman, and again I thought she'd do a great job as agent 99.
BZZZZZZZZZZT ---- WRONG ANSWER!!!
Apparently, no one can replace Barbara Feldon either.

How ANYONE could rate this movie with 5 STARS .... (Shrug)
How ANYONE could even think that this was actually a FUNNY movie, is totally beyond me.
I personally rate it NEGATIVE 20!!!

Except for that one scene with "The Rock," I found NOTHING even mildly amusing.  In fact, I had trouble NOT dozing off,
BUT I stuck with it and watched EVERY SECOND!!!  I will ALWAYS regret that decision.

OBVIOUSLY, I shan't be purchasing this item.
In fact, the studio would have to PAY ME to include it in my collection, and they could NOT pay me enough to own this P.O.S.!!!

Can you tell how disappointed I am???
