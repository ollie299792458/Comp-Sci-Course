The movie begins with Nicholas Cage as a successful Wall St. executive who is driven by work.  His life is changed (temporarily) when he stops in a store and offers to buy a
lottery ticket for $200.00 worth $238.00 to the owner who is
threatening the store owner with a gun if he will not make good on the ticket.  The ticket owner accepts Cage's offer and gives him a gift - a glimpse of what his life would have been like if he had not left his girlfriend 13 years before to take a job in London.  A confused Cage wakes up the next day to find he is in that life that would have been his, married to his sweetheart for 13 years with 2 children.  At first he is overwhelmed, then learns the value of true love.  Since he was only allowed a "glimpse" he has to return back to his real life, but the surprise ending reflects the fact that true love can win out if you give it a chance.  Great family movie and great food for thought!  Let's all examine the blessings in our lives.
Please rent this or buy because it should be watched at least once a year so we don't forget the lesson Cage learned with his chance at a "glimpse."
