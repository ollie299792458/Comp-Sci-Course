Just watched this dvd after not seeing the movie since around 1978 on television. What I remembered seeing when I was young was a couple of guys riding around in a Dodge Charger causing trouble and being mean to this girl, along with the shocking ending. Seeing the movie once again, I realize it is much more than that. There is some great humor and a lot of spectacular stunts that you will not see these days. But I want to emphasize this: the movie is more character based than one might think. Larry is pretty much the white trash who treats Mary like trash. Deke is not friendly with her in the beginning either; however, later there is a sense of something that might have continued in a relationship between Deke and Mary. This is what makes the ending very sad, along with the fact that Larry and Deke had big dreams of making it big in racing. I did not catch on to this when younger, and figured they all got what was coming to them in the end for causing so much trouble. I now see the movie in a completely different light than before - and you will too.

This dvd is highly recommended - buy it while you still can and preserve this movie in your dvd collection.
