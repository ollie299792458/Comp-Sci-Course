This is a sweet story about a young peasant with dreams of escaping poverty and achieving self-determination as a knight.  He travels with friends -- two fellow squires, a woman blacksmith, and "Chaucer".  He falls in love with a noble young woman and has a nasty adversary who wants to skewer him.  The choice of music [rock and roll] is a bit jarring when first encountered and some of the costumes etc are definitely out of period, but you'll get over that.  Listening to the commentary will help you understand why various choices were made to use modern vs old, if you find it troublesome.

The story itself is a classic, definitely medieval, but the hero's troubles are fully comprehensible and relevant to modern audiences.  The tournament sequences are great.  Unlike so many films in which knights wear "armor" that is obviously for decoration only, the knights in this film race actual horses at each other across a field and get whacked with actual lances.  So the armor does take a real thump.  It and the jousting technique are pretty much accurate to period.  The jousting is very well filmed and totally believable - a great combination of scary and wonderful.  The dialogue is generally well written and well acted, the characters are all well developed and multi-dimensional.  This film has under-appreciated early performances by Heath Ledger, Paul Bettany, and good work by everyone else.  There are some great funny lines, plus moments of tenderness, anxiety, despair and triumph.  Who could ask for more?
