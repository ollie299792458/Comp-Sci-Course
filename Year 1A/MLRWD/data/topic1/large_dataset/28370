I dragged my friends to see Treasure Planet with me the day it came out, because I love anything that has to do with pirates and had been anticipating the realease of Treasure Planet since I saw the first previews (plus, we were on Thanksgiving break, and my friends had nothing else to do). All three of us fourteen-year-old girls loved it to death! We left the theater, raving about how good it was.
The animation, a combination of traditional drawn animation and computer effects, was awesome. The music was beautiful, both the score and the two songs that were sung. The story, based closely on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, was intriguing. I could relate to Jim Hawkins's teenage rebel attitude. Captain Amelia, too, was extremely likeable, and a strong female character. B.E.N., the Bio-Electronic Navigator robot, got on my nerves after a while, but he was the movie's only flaw. Also included in the cast of characters is an adorable, pink, shapeshifting blob called "Morph."
There was humor, action, and emotional scenes aplenty. One scene, where Morph turns into a hand in order to poke a bad guy in the eye, made me shriek with laughter, when just minutes before an especially heart-rending scene left me on the verge of tears.
All in all, an excellent family film for all ages. Treasure Planet has won a special place in my heart among other disney favorites, right next to Beauty and the Beast and Tuck Everlasting.
