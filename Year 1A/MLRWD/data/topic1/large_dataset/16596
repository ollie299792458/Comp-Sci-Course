Sound like a Charlie's Angels film to you? Well, that's pretty much the formula Cory Yuen followed with this.

Heard my gaming colleagues joking about how lame this movie is, and, so, I had to see it, just to see how lame it was.

AND I ENJOYED IT. And got it on DVD. For $9. At Wal-Mart. And I've watched it 6 times since then!

I've never even played any of the DOA games before, much less have any vague knowledge of the plot or characters, so I can't tell you how closely it follows the games, but the direction they go with this film, I just like how upbeat, and non-serious it is.

There's plenty of characterization, plot, and action. Mostly on the female characters, and the characters related to them, have any back story, but at least they have back story, and it's done well.

They go CRAZY with some of the action scenes; while the choreography doesn't really seem all that complex, they do a lot of switching between different fights; one minute, you'll see Bayman Vs. Brad Wong, and then SWITCH! Christie Vs. Jann Lee, then back-and-forth between a number of other fighting scenes. Another case would be, switching between the volleyball scene, and one of the heroes infiltrating the villain's HQ.

But where this movie really goes is with the tongue-in-cheek humor, and the fanservice. Lingerie girl in the elevator. Two girl fighters sharing a bed...lesbian suggestions ensue. Wrestling girl facing off with her wrestling father.

I laughed.
