Kate Beckinsale stars as a US Marshal at an international research station in Antarctica while Tom Skerritt plays the friendly doctor. The Marshal's about to leave the station as the Winter season sets in when she's forced to investigate a questionable death that becomes a murder investigation.

Although the trailer hints of a supernatural film a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CHK1S">The Thing (Collector's Edition)</a>, this is actually a mystery thriller with an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006B2A42">Ice Station Zebra</a> flair.

Some of the plot turns are predictable and there's not enough character development, but the spectacular arctic locations and the effective filmmaking compel me to give this 4 stars. Maybe a weak 4 stars, but 4 stars nevertheless.

I said "arctic locations" because the film was shot in Manitoba, not Antarctica.

Pay no mind do those who say this is a crappy film. If you're in the mood for a modern Ice stataion Zerbra film with SOME elements of The Thing then Whiteout should fill the bill. It won't blow you away or anything (except maybe an early shot of Kate, lol) but it's a solid arctic mystery-thriller.
