The above is one of my favorite lines in the movie said by Jeremy Irons (Aramus) as the naked and depressed Porthos (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) is trying to hang himself from the main beam of a barn which collapses.

  I own this movie on VHS and really enjoy it, so much that I'll probably get in on DVD.

 Once again, if one is a purist of a novel they may be disappointed, but in general I try to enjoy movies for what they are not as literal interpretations of books. For example, I love the movie Amadeus but it's not even close to being an accurate portrayal of the life of Mozart, still it's an enjoyable film. Just don't use it as a "Biography".

 Anyway, I thought "The Man In The Iron Mask" was very well done, that the actors did an great job. Certainly Leonardo Dicaprio was certainly out of his league compared to the likes of Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, G&eacute;rard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne and the others but he was passable enough not to hurt the overall movie and the others performances are simply incredible in my opinion!

 The story is great, the cinematography outstanding and the action scenes are rivetting.

  Highly recommended!
