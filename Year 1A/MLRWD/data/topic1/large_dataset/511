The subject matter is that two groupies who slept with pretty much every musician in the world during the 70's are now much older.  The Sarandon character has suppressed all of that, is married with two kids, and has had her personality disappear.  The Hawn character is still a free spirit and revels in her past.  However, she is now wise.  Of course, the Hawn character seeks out the Sarandon character and reinvigorates her life, and her family is grateful that their wife and mother was once a world class groupie.

I believe that there is a certain consensus about this film.  The script is pretty weak regardless of its subject matter.  Goldie Hawn is fantastic in it.

As my own comment, it is actually hard to tell if this is a movie about women achieving something or some kind of odd male fantasy.  If Hawn had not saved this movie, it would be a real rotten tomato.  Incidently, the title of this film is taken from one of the most famous/infamous porno flicks of all time.
