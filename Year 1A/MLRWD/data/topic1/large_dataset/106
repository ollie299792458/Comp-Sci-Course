This anime is one of my guilty pleasures. It is so close to being considered hentai but is still ecchi. It is really perverted but as perverted it may be it is also really good to watch. Main key factors to this anime that makes people love it/like it is the fan service (for some) and the comedy. I never saw an anime that was really funny in a perverted way it is just wow. I ordered this hoping it would have my favorite opening because I watched it on Crunchyroll. I was wrong! The one I watched on Crunchyroll was the 2nd season! So I was happy to know that this will be all new stuff to me! I would tell every anime fan to give this a shot. I personally am not a fan of animes with tons of fan service but this one makes up for it with its brand of comedy. It came to me so fast (i ordered one day shipping btw) and it was very well packed. The box of the blu-ray/dvd was a little dent in one corner but nothing really bad.(it was just the cardboard box for it after all...) I will for sure get the season 2 blu-ray/dvd combo pack on Amazon when it "hopefully" comes out. I give this product 5/5 and the anime 4/5.
