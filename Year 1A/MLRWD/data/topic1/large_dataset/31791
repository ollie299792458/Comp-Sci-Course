I do not purchase anime all the time, my own library being rather small in comparison to the amount I've seen. I rented up Gunslinger Girls after seeing some artwork done by my one of my favorite amature artists, Sandara. Sandara, having always had wonderful taste in anime, surely did not disappoint me this time around.

At first, I was a bit skeptical- I mean, c'mon, killer girls, guns, and government support. How cliche! But my initial inclination was rather wrong. Each girl has their merits and flaws, a unique relationship with their handlers, and indepth stories behind not just the girls, but the various men who train them. Their is a tension of shorter lives, living it to the fullest within restrictions, and the pressures of their strange situation.

I'm now considering purchasing this series for my own collection as I want to rewatch episodes and share them with my friends. Anyone who perhaps enjoyed Ghost in the Shell or Elfen Lied would probably enjoy this as the actual missions and actions are at most parallel or, as another put it, the backdrop to a more indepth and intriguing story.
