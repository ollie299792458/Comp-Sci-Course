Mystery of the Batwoman, the latest Batman Animated effort, is a good story with the mystery not really being revealed until almost the end. Advice for those who buy the DVD, DO NOT go to the special features section first or there will be no "mystery" to the identity of Batwoman. The actual story itself is a five star effort, if only to see Batman back in action. Although more screen time with Robin (Tim Drake), Commissioner Gordon, and Barbara Gordon would have made this a real treat. The lack of quality extras are the reason for the score. No director's voice over, and the "Chase Me" extra is not an actual story. (I won't spoil it for you.)
I would not put the story line on the same level as "Return of the Joker" from Batman Beyond, but it is better than 99% of the animation out today.
Watching this DVD allowed me to long for the long awaited DVD release (someday!!) of the entire Batman Animated catalog, as well as hoping that someone will have the desire to pick this up again for another run at a regular television series.
