zombie holocaust is one of the stupidest films you'll ever watch. the plot dosnt make sense, the acting is mediocre and over the top gore is so bizzare, its almost laughable. but, with all that said, this is also one of the coolest, most fun films you'll ever watch. the story has something to do with some lady going into the jungle in search of answers to bizzare cannibalistic acts occuring in new york. the rest of the film consists of the cast being torn to peices by cannibals or opperated on by an insane doctor. right about now your probably asking yourself were the zombies enter the mix, and that is zombie holocausts biggest letdown. although the title promises zombies, the audience is graced with only about 7 minutes of zombie action. well, action might not be the right word because all the zombies do is emerge fom the jungle and look funny in their strange clay makeup. one hopeless zombie almost steals the show when he nearly sneaks up on a couple of humans, but they notice him and evicerate his head with a boat motor. the movie may not deliver much zombie, but it definately delivers on the holocuast factor. the movie is jam packed with dismemberment, intestine ripping, eye gouging, neck slicing, blood spurting gore. this film should apeal to many audiences of the euro sleaze genre including cannibal, zombie and mad scientist enthusiasts. the main thing you have to remember while watching zombie holocuast is not to take it seriously which shouldnt be to hard since the movies so absurd. great movie to watch if youve had a bad day.
