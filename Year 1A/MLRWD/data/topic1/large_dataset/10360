I love this movie. I don't care about the Japanese version. It's almost like an urban legend to me because I have heard some many different things that happens in this movie. First of all I do not care about the dubbing. It is what it is. The last thing I want to do while trying to watch a movie is read for an hour and a half to two hours. Of course the special effects and costumes are not that great. But this was the early 1960's, what do you expect ?

I have had this copy for a few years now and never had a problem with it. I was checking back here to see if it was actually released on Blueray. It's wishful thinkng on my part because even some of today's popular movies are not released on Blueray.

My wish for years now is this movie be remade. My only hope is it would not be made as the cheesey Godzilla movie from the 90's where "Godzilla" looked like an iguana, not even close to the Godzilla we all know. As for the last "King Kong" that was made, that was bad too. The 1976 version is way better. I also like King Kong in a larger version.

Maybe one day this movie can be remade. I would love to see an American made version but done in a serious way. Not like the Matthew Broderick version of "Oh no, Gozilla is coming...hee heee hee (insert bad joke here)".
