This film reminds intelligent moviegoers of just what movies CAN be when  film makers decide to give us a rest from chase scenes, car crashes,  ill-educated and vapid characters, and sophomoric plot lines.  It's a  pleasure to spend 3 hours with literate, polished, well-dressed, beautiful  actors who portray characters who value themselves and others. Granted, the  film could easily have had 20 minutes snipped from it, thus sparing the  audience the long minutes where the actors merely stare at each other  endlessly; certainly those long moments do little to advance the plot. But  so much more is good about the movie that this can be tolerated.  Pitt is  superb as Death learning, and understanding, how beautiful life is.  And  it's extremely refreshing to have a respite from moviedom's perpetual  bashing of big business and instead, to see a successful buinessman  portrayed as a hero of integrity.  Sir Anthony Hopkins could not have been  better, or more at home, in this role.  The movie deserves better than it  received at the hands of the critics, and shame on the Academy of Motion  Picture Arts &amp; Sciences for ignoring this beautiful film, its story,  cast, and production values.
