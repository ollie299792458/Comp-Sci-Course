I was a little skeptical at first when I read the previews of this movie, but after watching it found it captivating.  Christian believers are described in the Bible as "pilgrims", passing through this world to the next. This emphasizes that in an unusual way.

  The main character is a Bible professor from 1890 and with a time machine is able to view our modern time. The film not only amuses us with the typical shock of him experiencing modern appliances and automobiles, but also shows the shock of him dealing with the casual way in which our generation views sin. Because modern believers are constantly confronted with blatant sin, we have grown calloused to it.  A believer from 1890 would not have had that experience, so you could imagine how shocked he would be seeing and hearing the blasphemy and immorality that surrounds us today.

  The main lesson is brought out quite clearly - that our failure to be precise in what appears to be a small issue today may have grave consequences in the future. I highly recommend this film.
