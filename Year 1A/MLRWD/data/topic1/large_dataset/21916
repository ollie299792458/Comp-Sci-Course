~SPOILERS INCLUDED~

Dead Again is, in my opinion, a classic case of a book quality movie. What does this mean? It means I find this representation to be all that a book would be but in movie realism. Every time I've watched this movie, I find something new and unique to this story, something that connects the past characters, Margret and Grace or Roman and Mike, together. Some are obvious after only one or two viewings. The slight stutter of our friendly "Laughing Duke" antiquity dealer, the spilling of the Champaign glass  by Margret in the first regression scene. Other's, the `To Margret' toast of the same scene where Roman declares his date to have more charm then Grace, the way Gray Baker holds on to Mike's hand just a smidge too long while looking at it almost, dare I say, lovingly, are subtler examples that make this movie hands down one of thee most interesting, intricate love stories of all time. The relationships are real, not just fluffy prose. The action is believable, the devastation palpable and the score truly embodies, I believe, what this love story is all about. Hardships, loyalty, love, connection, Karma. I gained my first real look into the Karmic world via Dead Again and have believed whole heartedly in it every since. As a writer I thoroughly enjoyed the not one, but two daring plot twists. They are both, what I consider to be, the very definition of shock value. If your looking for an unlikely, non average romance then this is the movie for you. The action is as fulfilling as the story and  the climax will not leave you with that `really I just wasted two hours watching that?' feeling by any means.
