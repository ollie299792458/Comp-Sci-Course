While this compilation is not as consistently funny as the Will Farrell ones, it definitely has its moments.  Thought he did a great imitation of Donahue (banging the mike on his head, while waiting for an answer was a good touch).  The funniest bit (I thought) was the 'Robot Presents' skit.  Every time it came back with another title for the show, and the robot explaining that the title doesn't reflect what the shows about, I laughed harder and harder.  When he came back with 'Let's Fix, Robots', I literally fell off the couch, because I was laughing so hard!  And the Anne Boleyn skit was very well written....especially when she keeps asking what will happen to her head after she is killed (Phil: your body will then be folded up and shot out of a canon....Candice: will my head then be shot at my body?).  I also throughly enjoyed the nice sendoff at the end, with him and Jan Hooks imitating an elderly couple, thinking back to their younger days.  And knowing he never made it to old age makes it especially touching.  I'm not sure, but I think that's Bing Crosby's voice he's singing to.

Some sketches I thought dragged was Clinton in McDonalds.  The Barbara Bush skit didn't work, and the Sinatra skit was so-so.  The worst one was the opening with Adm. Stockdale....ugh, that couldn't get over fast enough.

So, all in all, a definite keeper.  It's nice that you can just fast forward thru the bad stuff, and watch the funny bits.
