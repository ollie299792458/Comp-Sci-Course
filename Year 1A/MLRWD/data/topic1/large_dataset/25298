Well all that needs to be said has already been said about the saddest Doctor Who episode ever.
Beautiful writing from Russell T Davies and amazing acting from David Tennant.
The Tenth Doctor didnt want to go and I didnt want him to either.
From the radiation scene to visiting his past companions to regenerating, David conveyed the Doctor's emotion and sadness, making it a turning point in Doctor Who history.
I was one of those people in tears at the "I dont want to go" line, which is the most distressing single line dialogue ever spoken.
Then afterwards watching the confidential of the alternative takes, and the golden wrap where David was so clearly holding back the tears.
After the end of series 5 I stuck to my original decision from the first episode, I cant get to grips with the Eleventh Doctor, but love Amy Pond. Karen Gillan is fantastic aond one of the reasons why I will continue watching, the other reason is that Doctor Who is the only TV show around now that was on while I was growing up.

David Tennant is and always will be the best Doctor ever and Doctor Who history and future owes him alot.
He may not have rejuvenated the new series but he extended it and took it to a level that no one thought possible, because of him, its more popular now than it was back then, and has even been accepted over in America.

And all the while there is a Duplicate Doctor in the parallel world with Rose, David Tennant and his Tenth Doctor will be my Doctor until the end of time itself.
