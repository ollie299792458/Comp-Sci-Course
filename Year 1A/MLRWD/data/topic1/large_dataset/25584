Dexter is a show like no other.  This is a cop who goes around killing the bad guys in the most gruesome of ways and yet you can't really hate him for it; actually he's most likely cheered on. Those he kills are the bad guys; the filth of the earth; the killers, the rapists and the like.  He got married last season and has two step-kids.  Now this is not the best example of a good dad but somehow he makes it work.

It is awe-inspiring to watch him weave his tales (have to work late; etc etc) and nobody has caught him yet.  I have all the episodes except the latest one (what the hell is wrong with these distributors -- come on--let's get these prices down down down!).  Last season he floored his audience by killing someone (as far as I can remember) who wasn't suspect--well maybe a little.

 There are a few known stars that trickle in and out of the show  but the bottom line is.........good bye and good riddance to the bad asses of the earth. Dexter is a sort of superman, batman, and superchick (I just made that one up) all in one--however, he can't fly.....to bad....that would be even more interesting.

This is not a show for kids - too gory and may give them ideas but for the adults (don't be a prude) it is a ride you'll not soon forget.
 I'm waiting for the last series to come down to a decent price and can't wait to get my hands on it.

Dexter is delicious!!
