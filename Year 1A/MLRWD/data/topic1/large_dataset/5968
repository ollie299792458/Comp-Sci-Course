FF: ROTSS is a very mild action/adventure movie. It takes the story line a little higher in quality that the previous installment, but fails to do really beyond that. Once again the Marvel Universe is changed by poor story telling by making Galactus nothing more that galactic indigestion. Also gives no real mystery and wonder to the question, would the Silver Surfer change to the good guys, so easily. The graphics were o.k. but I think that was mostly due to the fact that they didnt really rely on Reed Richards as the F/X savy character, rather they expanded on the Human Torch being the main focus. Once again Sue Storm falls short of being any reason why a man like Reed Richards would want to be with her. The one thing they did try to change in this film from the last is by testing adults intellegence by adding in more swear words and lines like "I'm hot for you right now", so that it could appeal to the adults more. They felt by doing this that adults would enjoy the movie even further. Overall it's a satisfied movie. I didnt feel jipped, but I think FOX needs to redirect it's focus on the future of this franchise.
