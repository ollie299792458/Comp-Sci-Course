The filmic space of Man With a Movie Camera creates manifold dimensions of perception.  By framing the film as not only a production of film itself but the viewing of it Vertov establishes a context of moving barriers  between what is real and what is portrayed.  His passion for the modernized  world of mechanization and city construction is seen in the city symphony  sort of document, the way he edited  manipulating time and multiple-spaces,  as well as the portrayal of the camera itself as a figure having an  ontological role.  Throughout the film there is the explicit scenes of  the cinema, posters to screenings, people in theatres, projections of the  footage scene at that secondary level.  Along with scenes of  the editing  process these "cross-sections" of flimmaking reveal some of the constructs  to film's illusion.  At the same time, it also obscures the lines defining  reality and representation.  Vertov's seeming infatuation with  technology and industrialization is more of a celebration than that found  in October, Eisenstein seems to have premonition of modernization's terror  or dominance.  His shots of city are echoed by energetic, fluid music.  His  edits that sometime incorporate divided images lauds the flux of urban  activity.  Machines are scene to improve the physique of humans.  And the  wonder/wander of the camera is there to capture it all.
