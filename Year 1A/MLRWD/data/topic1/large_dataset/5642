Somehow I missed this movie when it came out. I recently had the opportunity to view the movie and I was very impressed. I have a couple of famous storytellers in my family tree, so I always enjoy a good story. This movie is exactly that, it is the big-screen version of a good story.

Part of the wonder of the story is in the mystery. I think the less said about the plot the better, because the characters in the movie learn about the story as the plot unfolds. The story is told briefly in the beginning of the movie, so you have to pay close attention so the rest of the plot will make sense. It can be very easy to get lost and not know what is going on if you don't pay close attention throughout the movie.

The only reason I knock off a star is because there is a point where I think one of the director's signature plot twists is attempted. I say attempted because up until that point I was staying with the story closely. I got completely lost about the time the twist was executed, because I felt the pace picked up a bit and the telling of the story seemed a bit rushed. By the time I figured out what was happening again, the magic of the plot twist was lost on me.

I think this is a very interesting movie overall. It definitely requires viewing more than once to really take it all in.

I think the main problem where people have trouble with these movies is the material for the trailers advertising them is very misleading. I originally thought from the ads that this was supposed to be a horror movie of some kind. While there are moments of intense action and frightening scenes, they are few and far between.

Watching this movie made me feel like a kid again and brought to my rememberence the times when my mom would tell me stories at bedtime. If you haven't seen this one yet, give it a chance. If you have seen it before and didn't like it, give it another try.
