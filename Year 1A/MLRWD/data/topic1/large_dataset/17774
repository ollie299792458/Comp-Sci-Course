Well, I can't really add much more to the praise heaped on this magnificent film. I first saw it in Camberley at a school screening when I was 7 and adored it. To be honest although I remember being a little scared I think a lot of it went over my head. I would say to any parent, show it to your child from 5 upwards, just be with them in case they find it disturbing.
It was only a couple of years later that it had the most profound effect on me, even going so far as forcing my parents to take me to the downs to look for fiver et al, it's one of the most brilliant movies of all time and knocks socks off any 'Moral message' Disney tries to deliver every time. I've got this film on video but have only been able to watch it a couple of times since, to the guy that said anyone with a pulse would always cry at Bright Eyes and the ending...Word!  Just to read these reviews has brought tears to my eyes!  Am so glad it's finally coming out on DVD and I'll be in the  US to buy it! Wonderful wonderful wonderful!
