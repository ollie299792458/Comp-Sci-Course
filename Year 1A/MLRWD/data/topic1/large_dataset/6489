Alfred Molina controls and squeezes his tiny French village with a tight net built on his repressed frustrations and disappointments.  What makes this film so endearing and simultaneously tense is that Molina's motives seem so irrational until the aforementioned is revealed to the viewer. Unfortunately for him, and as a disguised blessing to the inhabitants, Juliette Binoche breezes into this little place and brings "paganism" in the form of spirit, beauty, compassion, and delicious food that warms the senses and the citizens.  This simple act slowly loosens Mayor Molina's religious and puritanical grip on this town, to his absolute fury. The final "showdown" occurs when he realizes that his own closeted will is slowly draining away his life and the joy that he has allowed to elude him. The power of chocolate..who would have thought that a little taste would have been his undoing?  This is a lovely film.  Movies do not have to be Oscar material, or drowning in special effects to be sublime or memorable.  Chocolat is both.
