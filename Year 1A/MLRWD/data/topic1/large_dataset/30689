This single disc includes 5 previously released episodes. The big addition: the few seconds of Osama bin Ladin (sic) that was opted not for inclusion on the episode "Road To Rhode Island". Apparently all the reasons not to release it in tact the first time around no longer apply. Does anyone hear a CA-CHING? This disc will include some commentary, blah blah blah. Die hard fans will purchase it, but just buy the multidisc sets. It's hard to justify a $12 price for a few seconds of newly included cartoon footage. It seems like it has become standard now. Look at the so called "uncut" Ren & Stimpy. How long will it be before a "completely uncut" set occurs--only to ask fans for more money. MacFarlane & Fox should take a lesson from the Tom & Jerry Premiere DVD set. It was noticed that Disc 1 was censored, and an exchange is being set up so that fans who buy the set can exchange the censored disc for an uncut one. If people continue to buy these products, the companies will continue to play these games.
