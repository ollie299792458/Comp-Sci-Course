If you are looking for comedy, maybe a little bit of revenge, or just something to reflect back on when you think you were the only odd one out, you definitely need to pick up this movie.

Chris Brander (Ryan Reynolds) was fat when he left his hometown in New Jersey 10 years before after being teased badly at a graduation party when he confessed his love for Jamie Pallamino (Amy Smart) in her year book, only to have it mixed up with her ex-boyfriends yearbook and read to the whole graduating class. Jamie apologizes to him to only tell him she loves him like a brother. So he leaves and only returns 10 years later because Samantha James (Anna Faris), a pop star that Chris is supposed to get signed, burns down the plane they are traveling in to Paris. After this fiasco, everything starts unraveling.

Personally, I felt bad to Chris because he went through alot in high school to only come 10 years later looking hot and making alot of money, also being very famous, only to have the same people who played him to want to be his friend now. Jamie wanted for Chris to be himself not realizing that he suffers from low self esteem and that the reason why he acts like a jerk is because that was the impression she gave of the only guys she dated. Samantha James is just hilarious in this movie and also explains much of his confusion most of the time.

I think the movie could have been a little better because I think there could have been more talking through the movie between Jamie and Chris, so that she could see his true feelings as to why he was not returning the same signals she was (at least not to her.) However it was a very well put together movie and it will definitely make you laugh a more than a few time. Just dont overanalyze the movie like some of these other low star movie reviewers. The movie is best seen when it is watched the way it was made. The movie, in the end, lets you know he did the right things. Hope this helps.
