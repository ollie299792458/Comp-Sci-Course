Kevin Kostner does a remarkable job in directing and portraying a Yankee soldier (Lt. John Dunbar) who's in search of the last frontier before it's gone.  Lt. Dunbar is assigned to an outpost in the Dakotas during the 1870's.  Along the way he meets some interesting characters, but its after he sets up his post that the story begins.
Lt. Dunbar meets members of Sioux Tribe and tries to develop a friendship with them.  They struggle with communication until Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell) is asked to interpret for them.  With her help Lt. Dunbar is able to learn about the indian ways from Kicking Bird (Graham Green II) and in return tell him about the coming of the white man.  Lt. Dunbar comes to respect Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) who teaches him about friendship.
As Lt. Dunbar struggles between his duty to the army and to his new friends he falls in love with Stands With a Fist.  As the story unfolds Lt. Dunbar becomes a trusted member of the Sioux Tribe and must decide whether his loyalties lie with the Sioux or the army.
If you want to see how the west really was then you must see this movie.  The cinematography is excellent and enables Kostner to capture the realism of the time.  I can see why Dances with Wolves won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture.  That's why I gave it five stars!
