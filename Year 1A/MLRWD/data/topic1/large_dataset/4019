This is not a movie I would have chosen to see on my own, but my 16 year old senior picked it out for our night out, and who was I to object. Afterwards he declared it was one of his top ten, and that we had to get the DVD when it came out. I was a little less blown away, but can see why he would like it.

Accepted is the story of Bartleby and friends, and the transformation of a scam created to placate Bartleby's parents into an enterprise more meaningful than anyone intended. The lead characters are the not-quite-successful enough, the people who got passed over due to fate, lack of fortune, or simply not being able to work within "the system". Associated supporting cast members are as often the cast offs whose value to the world is judged quickly and completely, which had prevented their talents and dreams from being unearthed (as they can be in such an unconventional learning institution as is formed at South Harmon Institute of Technology).

Complete with motivational speech about the purpose of education, passion, and creativity, Accepted is an enjoyable story about less than conventional success.

As far as a social critique, the movie might pack more punch if it didn't rely on the boy-gets-largely-2-dimensional-girl theme, easy money received for the college, etc. But what did I really expect?
