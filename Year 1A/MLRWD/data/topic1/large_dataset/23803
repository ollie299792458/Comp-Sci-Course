This is one of those films that would probably cater to those who are able to see beauty in anything that is SUPPOSED TO BE beautiful, whether actual beauty exists or not.  It reminds me of the story of the emperor who has no clothes.  Some of you may know this story.  It's the story about an emperor who wants a great garment-worker to make him a garment for a great event.  The garment-worker has trouble coming up with a truly original design that will impress the emperor, so he chooses to tell the emperor that the garment is so unique and exquisite that it's invisible.  The emperor puts on the "invisible" garment and goes to the event naked.  Because the public is talking to, and about, the emperor, everyone comments on how beautiful his clothes are.  Only a child points out the obvious by saying, "But Mommy, the emperor has no clothes".  This film and films like it, fall into this category for me.  If you show enough people something that is completely senseless, and chaotic, some will find it to be beautiful because it was made by a great name (In this case Anthony Hopkins).  Or maybe they want to believe that it is designed to stimulate their intellect, so they make something out of nothing and call it genius.  It may be possible that this film, and films like it such as "The Fountain", are simply over-my-head.  But to me they're just chaos and confusion on the screen that is then passed of as being genius.  My guess is that more than 99% of the population will find this movie to be crap.  The other 1% is able to look at crap and convince themselves that something transcendent is taking place.  So if you're like most people, you probably won't like this movie.  If you choose to see it, you certainly shouldn't get your hopes up.  I realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it's still true that most people wouldn't choose the word "cute" to describe a spider.
