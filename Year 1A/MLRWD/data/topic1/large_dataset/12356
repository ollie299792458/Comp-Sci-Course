No 3d then no purchase, So it seems we are to spend our hard earned cash on a wonderful film on Blu-ray but are being denied a 3D version, I dont hold with reviews that say there not bothered as 3D gives them a headache, try watching Journey to the Centre of the Earth in the Green/Magenta 3D anaglyph system, it works superbly, The film just needs to be encoded correctly, Polor Express was the old Red/Cyan system and that did give me a headache in parts, so I say give us the option of how the director intended the film to be seen and offer both 2D and 3D versions on the disk, space is not an issue here as there are many disks that have upto 3 disks in the package, Some come on Disney and all other film companies, lets have the 3D versions NOW. Also all you 3D fans go to YouTube and type in the Searth YT3D, you will then see another option of displaying 3D with great quality on the net, just choose the 3D glases that you have option at the bottom the screen and enjoy. Type in media55 for some of my own examples.
