Jessica Stein, a young, New Yorker, Jewish journalist, is going through a rough time. She hasn't dated for a year and is being nagged by her mother to hurry up and start dating more so that she could get married! So, she went on multiple dates with guys... all turning out for the worst. Her best friend then started reading the personal ad section out loud to her one-day during work hoping to help Jessica find `Mr. Right'. Reading an ad out loud to Jessica, Jessica was immidiatly drawn in to only find out one problem... the ad was in the women seeking women section. Since nothing else had seemed to work for herself though, she decided to try the immposible for her... going on a date with another woman.
 This is when Jessica met Helen, another girl who had thought she was perfectly straight, but decided to take a daring road herself. Jessica was very relunctant at first and almost walked out with out even saying a word to Helen. But after siting down to have a drink with her, she found Helen to be everything she was looking for in a man, except for the fact she was a woman.
 Kissing Jessica Stien is a hilarious, modern, romantic movie about a girl tring to find `Mr. Right' then tring to recoganize the diffrence in the end between real love or just being best friends.
