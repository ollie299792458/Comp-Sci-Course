I saw "Paradise Lost" and I immediately started looking for more information on Damien, Jessie, and Jason, a.k.a. The West Memphis Three.  I found this movie "Paradise Lost 2: Revelations" at my local library.  I watched it.  This movie is just as riveting as the first one.  I am floored at the complete lack of justice for three young boys who were brutally murdered.  Why look for the real killers when you can rush to judgement on three outsiders who look different and listen to heavy metal?  They must be satan worshippers and therefore are guilty of the crime!  Let's string em up!

This film brings more information a few years after the first one.  I have really liked these films.  They tell a sad tale of three murdered boys who will never have justice and three other young boys who were locked up for a crime they had nothing to do with.  Haunting, gripping, and downright Creepy, this movie is for anyone who is interested in the justice system, true crime, forensics, or people in general.

GREAT FILM.
