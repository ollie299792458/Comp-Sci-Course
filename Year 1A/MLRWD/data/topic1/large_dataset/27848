One of the most pleasant surprises in my DVD collection is this DVD.  It contains not only the theatrically released version, but the pre-release 1945 version.  Several scenes in the film were reshot to give Lauren Bacall more exposure, but when this was done some key scenes explaining the plot were deleted.  I have always enjoyed the movie but finally had to read the book to figure out the plot because the theatrically released version just didn't make any sense.  The pre-release version pretty well stands on its own from a storytelling standpoint and is more faithful to the book.  Both versions are fun to watch, but having the pre-release version, I finally learned how Marlowe got the house keys he had when he goes back to A. G. Geiger's house (the scene where he finds them, which is in the pre-release version, is deleted in the theatrically released version).  There is also a commentary comparing the changes made between the two versions.  Having both versions to watch makes a great movie better!.
