This is an outstanding Chaplin film and like it there's no other. He plays two role; one as a dictator to beat Napolean to invading Ostervich and then taking over the world, and one is a barber in the Ghetto, where he meets a girl he likes (as usual). No matter how serious it gets, there's at least 3 funny things every minute. But it'll probably take you a good 5 or 7 times watching to actually understand the entire subject of the film. After the barber Chaplin becomes a soldier and helps Commander Schultz escape in his plane, they crash and the war has long been over, Chaplin's side losing. When he is fully recovered from his mental disorder, he returns home to his barber but starts fighting storm troopers. Soon they try to hang him when he meets with Commander Schultz. Meanwhile, the dictator is trying every which way to invade Ostervich with his two helpers, Garbage and Herring. When they find out that Napolean wants to take over Ostervich, too, the dictator invites him to Tomania to talk things out. And as soon as they do, the dictator takes over Ostervich. But the storm troopers got hold of the wrong Chaplin so the barber is the one that has to make the speech. I'm sure Chaplin fans will love this. You will see that there are funny parts everywhere, like Chaplin tripping, holding the dirty baby, slapping Herring, modeling for a statue and painting, ripping up papers in anger, the German speech in the beginning, and many, many more. So no matter who you are (well, actually it does matter), you will love this funny but dramatic  classic film.
