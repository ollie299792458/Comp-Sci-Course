"The Milpitas Monster" is a fun film for the casual viewer. Produced in the mid 1970's. Although it's obviously not a Hollywood creation (it was made by high school students in the (then) small town of Milpitas, California), it is definitely a classic.  You'll want to view this with your kids if they are currently learning about recycling, the environment, etc. since it's plot is about a garbage-eating monster that terrorizes the good citizens of Milpitas when they start overfilling the local landfill.  The monster is obviously a guy dressed up in a suit; although a very cool suit. (I recommend it for ages 8 and up...won't scare them, and may make them laugh!).  Overall, keep your sense of humor and don't expect exceptional sound and cinematography of "The Milpitas Monster", but do expect a real neat family movie experience with a moral about trash, clean air...
P.S.  Milpitas is a real place located just North of San Jose along freeway 680.  If you ever get the chance to visit, expect to recognise very little of the town from what you saw in "The Milpitas Monster".  Since the computer boom of the 1980's, Milpitas has grown in leaps and bounds.  And, I'm happy to say, has managed to keep the monster from re-appearing!
