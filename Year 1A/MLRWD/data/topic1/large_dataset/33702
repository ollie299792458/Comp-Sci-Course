F-22's, Abrams tanks, Hellfire missiles, big slimy octopi like aliens, it's all there! Not like Godzilla 1950's style, but lower key subtler drama with modern day updates. Many might think this is slow, but I like the personal interacts, the actors are fine, the effects are great, and suspense is all there. Sci Fi has evolved from Rodan and Star Wars, it's real Earth now and more believable and not so far fetched. Like many DVD movies there is more to appreciate every time you watch it, I didn't catch that the beginning is really the end. I'm now into my third time watching, and my regret is that I couldn't purchase this! I'd have paid $20 for this, I really like it!

It may not win any Oscars, but  this is better than waiting on NetFlix and wondering for months what this movie is all about. If it rents cheaper later, I may be up for another rental. Not so classic maybe for some but great entertainment. No gory and gross out scenes to keep out the younger kiddies, no gratuitous anything, I'd recommend this for all.

It's notable that one person, Gareth Edwards, is credited as director, writer, director of both cinematography and special effects, even production designer! He did have a lot of help, but I'd say a stellar job of filmmaking.
