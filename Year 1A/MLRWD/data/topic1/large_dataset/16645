The "psychological thriller" has always been my favorite genre of film making.  Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days - even weeks - after having seen the film.  Though heavy on the suspense (naturally), most (if not all) of the "scary stuff" is implied, which I feel has a much stronger effect on the audience than the average run-of-the-mill fright flick.  "The Silence of the Lambs" is one of only two films that I have seen in my lifetime that pulls this off successfully ("The Sixth Sense" being most recently the second).
Jodie Foster perfectly embodies a young female FBI agent-in-training with a twofold mission: trying to prove herself as a capable agent in taking on the life-and-death task before her while battling her own inner demons at the same time.  To save the life of the next would-be victim of one heinous killer, Clarice has to enlist the assistance of another heinous killer.  With time slowly running out, she has no other choice but to do what her supervisor explicitly warned against - allow Lechter to "get inside your head."  How cool is that!
To say that Sir Anthony Hopkins simply "portrayed" Hannibal Lechter would be like saying that Michael Jordan is simply a basketball player.  Hopkins BECAME Lechter, evil genius personified!  Hopkins devoured every scene he was in with a combination of creepy brilliance and deliberate, near-surgical precision.  
"Silence" won the top five Academy Awards of 1991 (Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor and Actress), and deservedly so.  This is arguably one of the best suspense films ever made.  Period!
