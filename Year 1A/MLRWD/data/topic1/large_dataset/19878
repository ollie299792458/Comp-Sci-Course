I'm giving this 5 stars simply because of the movie. Logan's Run is one of the all-time Sci-Fi classics in my opinion. It tells the story of a civilization where there are no wants or needs, no disease, no jealousy, no anger, no sadness whatsoever. It is upotia. The catch is, and you knew there was one, that you have to die when you're 30. Just about all functions are controlled my a central machine (George Orwell would be proud) with discipline carried out by a police force called Sandmen, which are just the cream of the crop humans. Why does the perfect society need a police force? As you might have guess, some people don't want to die when they're 30, so the run and try to escape the city to a place called sanctuary. And that is the basic premise of the movie.

The story examines many concepts of how people react and behave in such a world. There of course is the Orwellian concept of central control. What is the price of pure, uninterrupted happiness? What will people risk to keep on living? Especially when they literally have nothing to lose. But the main thrust is what happens to a person when they find out that everything that they have ever been taught, everything they have ever believed turns out to be a lie. Can they accept it? Will they keep their beliefs when the truth is staring them straight in the face?

As for the blu-ray, it is a straight copy of the DVD, so there's no other goodies to go along with it. The problem is that there weren't that many goodies on the DVD. The only special feature is a commentary by Michael York (who place the title character), the director and producer. It was very interesting, don't get me wrong, but you could tell that the three had recoreded their commentary separately so there was no interaction between them, which is always nice.
