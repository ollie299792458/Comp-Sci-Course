Seeing a review of someone that was in a test audience for this show makes me understand why FOX set this show up to die.  {Did the same thing to another favorite of mine, "The Tick", too.}

I guess that people just have different senses of humor.

Greg definatly hits mine.

Now, I have to be honest.  I did not contribute to this show's sucess.  I never even watched it on T.V.

(FOX executives whom might be wanting to sue me do not read further.)

I downloaded a couple of episodes on a lark and couldn't stop laughing.  The first few episodes certainly had growing pains, but afterwards, the show just got wonderful.

Tardy's hilarious comments really could make the show.  Whilst playing the drums, saying "Drumsticks can also be chicken." and another time, "Noone's supposed to touch me... where my baithing suit covers."

Come on, that's great!

Oh and by the way, for those executives I was talking about before.  I will definatly buy this set as soon as I can.  Many people in my situation will.  Stop worrying about the downloading, sheesh.  If it hadn't been for that, I never would have know what Greg the Bunny is.  Due to my showing of the show to others, not only I, but at least five other people are big Greg fans.
