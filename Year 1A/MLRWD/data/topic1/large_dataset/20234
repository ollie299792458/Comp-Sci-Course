First off, I just wanna remind everyone that 50's first major record label debut cd 'get rich or die tryin,' was HUGE.  That cd revived gangsta rap for the first time since biggie and 2pac.  That being said, this cd, the massacre, had very big shoes to fill.  So, when listening to this one, don't try to compare the two, b/c the first one was probably one of the best hip hop recordings ever.

For everyone out there who listened to this cd once and reviewed it, your opinions don't count.  You can't listen to any cd once and think you know how good it is, it takes time to let it grow on you.  On first listen, I heard some tracks I liked.  Second time through, I liked a lot of them.  After just a few days of having it, I'm already addicted.  This cd is 50 at his best.  He switches up flows like whoa on nearly every track, and has several producers so each track is different from the next.  50's slow flow is one of a kind.  Several tracks remind me of 50 on his unreleased 'Power of the Dollar.'

So, overall I'd say this cd is like an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  It's not his best, but it's still very good.  And it's still much better than most of the other crap (i.e. fat joe, ja rule, etc.) being put out these days.
