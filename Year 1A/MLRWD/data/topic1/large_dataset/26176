While sitting around waiting for things to happen

today (and trust me, there are plenty things going on)

I diverted my focus to a sc-fi film called "Decoys".

It is a Canadian flick about alien "lust-filled"

blondes that are searching for DNA specimens in Canada

to maintain survival of the fittest.

Beware of beautiful blondes without belly buttons!!!

You must be a die-hard Sci-fi fan to endure this

predictable b-genre entertainer.  It attempts to scare

you...and probably will to those not accustomed to

alien-blood-sucking, creepy tentacle-snake-like

malformed degenerates from the Planet _____!  This is

a great film for those who have never really been

scared before.  I'm such a veteran to this sort of

entree, I'm probably not the expert critic.  But

that's my opinion.

I remember writing a short story in "JUNIOR HIGH

SCHOOL" similar to this...but it didn't contain the

sexual content.  If you want to see beautiful girls

(not women...there's a BIG difference)...some subtle

sexy nudity...and a tongue-cheek (cheesecake) sci-fi

thriller of the new millenium, this one is for you.

Rent it first.
