I enjoyed this movie tremendously. I got the film because I am a fan of the zombie genre. And as someone who lives in Australia, the humor of a zombie film set in Queensland is inherently funny, even before you watch the film.

The entire movie is amazingly funny. The cliched pieces stolen from hollywood-esque action films are tongue-in-cheek and very well placed by the directors. Some of the humor is very Australian, which might be lost by international viewers. And the movie does become a bit flat in places. But that is to be expected for a film that was made by a couple of brothers who scrounged the hundred thousand dollar budget off friends and family, worked with unpayed actors, and did all the special effects (including one scene with airplanes and floating bodies) on their computers at home.

So I feel I have to disagree with the other reviewer - the fact that a film with no backing can have a market in the international film festivals proves to me that the Australian film industry has a real future.

This is a very funny film, created by kids who no doubt grew up watching hollywood monster-genre films. But I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how those cliches are filtered through the humor of another culture.

And of course, for all you zombie-pic fans who want a good laugh.
