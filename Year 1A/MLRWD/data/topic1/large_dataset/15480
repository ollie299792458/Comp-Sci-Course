Well This is By far one of the Better movies Dragon ball z has had that isnt really based on the storyline everyone see's on tv.
Broly is a saiyen like goku and vegeta. broly is the same age as Goku. infact he was born on the same day. and were next to each other in their infant stages. The only difference between broly and the other sayians is that he was born with a power Level of 10,000.  In this movie.  broly who is controled by his father with a device knowing that without controlling broly he would be unstopable with the power he had. any how broly father is bent on killing vegeta because of something vegeta's father did to them i wont say what tho. so they lure vegta to a fake new vegta planet. also goku is sent by king kai to find out whats going on.  well to put this quick one of the most dominant fight scenes ever occurs. broly is unmatched. he totaly demolishes all the saiyans. he truly is the legendary super saiyan. but ofcourse goku wins but i wont say how. the battle in this movie is good. and the tone it gives you of nothing is going to stop him is nice. its good to see the saiyans goku and vegeta actually being scared to fight.
