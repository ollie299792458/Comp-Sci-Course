"Carsey-Werner has been made aware of the several complaints made
regarding the uncut vs. syndicated release.  Anchor Bay is only
permitted to distribute the syndicated version per our contract w/Carsey-Werner.  It is completely the decision of Carsey-Werner whether or not the uncut version will ever be released on DVD."

Now they say several complaints?? If that is true (not likely- i am sure there were more then that!!)- then we need to get on Carsey Werners tail on this one!!!!!!!!!!!  Do you realize if they dont hear us- every season will be edited!!! RIDICULOUS! It is in the contract!!  Do you guys recall this:

"Ted Green, CEO of Anchor Bay Entertainment, was quoted in a press release as saying "Our company will give these DVD releases the attention and care they...deserve. We are happy to be working with the amazing team at Carsey Werner Distribution and thrilled to add these outstanding titles to our stable of top television properties." Carsey Werner returned the compliment, saying ""'Roseanne' and '3RD Rock From The Sun' are two of our most cherished programs," said Robert Dubelko, Co-President/COO of Carsey-Werner., "When it came time to find a DVD distributor, we wanted an experienced company with the creative energy and enthusiasm to market these series the way we would do it ourselves. Anchor Bay Entertainment fit that need all the way."

Robert Dubelko needs a slap- so much for the "most cherished programs"  Call him up people- this needs to stop!

I just got the horrible news ! This set is going to be the edited/syndicated episodes!! We know Roseanne herself was very anxious to have her show released on DVD, and we know she likely would not approve of this set- but this is not in her control.  I LOVED this show from the start and it brings back great memories and I was completely thrilled to know the DVD set was coming out.  I will NOT be buying this now.  Why? These same episodes cut to shreds are on TV.  2-3 minutes per episode DOES add up- and it DOES effect the episodes. Some may not think so but think about a 26 minute show running 23 minutes after the cuts! They dont cut the credits! So you ARE losing actual footage. Example- LOOK AT THE I LOVE LUCY DVD'S WHERE PARAMOUNT ACTUALLY REINSERTED LOST FOOTAGE AFTER IT WAS CUT...SO YES THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE.  Technically this is NOT the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON- Rather then false advertising it should be noted as the First Season. The packaging should also reflect these are SYNDICATED versions.  Look what happened to all the COSBY fans that are in an uproar now.  I am really pissed about this....There will be fans who buy this set- and others to follow- but what happens say in a year- if they re-release the UNCUT versions! Is it all a money thing? Why cant they get the original prints? They were able to dig up BLOOPERS for crying out loud- they cant get the original episodes??? Carsey Werner need to get the act together- this is NO way to TREAT some GREAT TV SHOW!! SHAME ON THEM.  We need to contact Carsey Werner- this should be fixed.  Again, Roseanne was from the 80's..you cant tell me Carsey Werner could not supply the unedited prints- I Love Lucy was from the 50's COMPLETELY restored with the lost footage edited back in!!  Someone made a great point - so to the reviewers who think we are "whining"- would you buy say the syndicated versions of "The Wizard of Oz" , "Gone With the Wind" - think about that.............. Disgusted
UPDATE:  I THINK SINCE CARSEY WERNER SCREWED UP SO BAD- AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THEY WILL RE-RELEASE THE SET- WHAT THEY SHOULD DO- IS LET US BUY THE SEASON- SEND THE RECEIPT IN WITH OUR EDITED-MESS OF EPISODES AND THEY SHOULD SEND US NEW DISCS WITH THE FULL UNEDITED EPISODES.
