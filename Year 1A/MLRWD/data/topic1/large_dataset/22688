As a professional movie critic, I have watched dozens of movies, and never has a movie stood out like Brokeback Mountain. I remember when a Christian activist called my office, and practically yelled at the top of his lungs over the phone because I commented a "movie that promote a Gay lifestyle" as the best movie in the 21st century. After watching couple more movies produced after Brokeback Mountain, including the best picture winner, Crash, I still stand by my statement.

90% of movies today rely on actors/actresses pulling stunts on screens that distract viewers from the fact that the movie has no story line. Around 9% has directors that put dull themes into dramatic movies, as in the case of "Hulk" when the director is able to transform a simple comic book to a movie with emotion, drama, and ideas. Brokeback Mountain belongs to that unique 1% of the movies where a short story from one of the best authors the world ever witnessed is combined with the spirit of the director, and acted out by actors and actresses who, despite being pop performers and show off their athletic abilities and appearance on screen, is able to put aside all that distraction, and carry out the dram flawlessly. To me, this is what all movies should be like.

I have no idea why this amazing film did not win the Best Picture of the Year. I suspect that the Oscar board probably received the phone call I received from various Christian groups. It's sad that, even in the 21st century, people are still propaganda driven, and close minded. But whatever controversy surrounds this movie, its very existence marked the beginning of a new journey for humanity.

Thank you, Ms. Anne Proulx, Mr. Ang Lee, and the actors and actresses of Brokeback Mountain, for creating this masterpiece.
