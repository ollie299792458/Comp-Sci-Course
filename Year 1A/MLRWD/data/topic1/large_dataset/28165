Although this cinematic version of Verdi's Rigoletto would be considered by most movie-goers a "B" genre work, the music is the only somewhat decent aspect that salvages its otherwise boring and laughable attempt at truly creating a legitimate "film."

Luciano Pavarotti (one of the most famous tenors in the last few years to have sung the role of the Duke of Mantua), Ingar Wixell (as Rigoletto), and Edita Gruberova (as Gilda) join forces in what one would assume would be a tour de force cast.  Although Pavarotti sings the role well and easily hits the higher notes, they at times seem a bit dry (as he is prone to doing), without any type of animation or gusto.  Gruberova is an above average Gilda, and she and Pavarotti shine brightest when they are singing together (namely in their Act II duet and the famous quartet in Act III).  Wixell is a light Rigoletto, but he is clearly the most effulgent of the trio as a singing actor; were the viewer to close his or her eyes, almost no emotion or real role portrayal would be felt from anyone except for the baritone.

But alas, the disastre of this is undoubtedly the acting and final cut of the "movie" itself.  Some operas turned into works of cinema have worked (e.g., Tosca with Domingo and Malfitano), yet here, the acting is ridiculously overdone, or in the case of Pavarotti (which isn't too unusual for those who have seen him on stage...) is non-existent.  To top it off, the music is almost never matched with the actual movements of the actors' mouths, which results in a stereotypical effect like you would see in a dubbed foreign film.

To get to the point, this is NOT the Rigoletto to buy if you are looking for a good production.  Skip it---go with the Met production with Domingo/Cotrubas/Diaz or the Covent Garden production with Alvarez/Gavanelli/Schafer.  Either would be a much more enjoyable choice for the seasoned opera fan and the beginner alike.
