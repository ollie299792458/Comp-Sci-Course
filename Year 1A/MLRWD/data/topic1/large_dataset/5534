I'm gonna cut straight into it.

Imagine Feudal Japan with it's samurai heritage dying out where the last warriors of this era are fighting to earn a living or a meaning of existence. Two of these guys, who are complete opposites (one wild and blood thirsty; the other quiet, calm, and deep reflecting) meet up with a spunky teenage girl who is in search of the Samurai that smells of Sunflowers. She helps them out of an execution and they have little choice but to go with her to find this man, or at least she manages to outwit them into it! Then cover that up with hip hop style music and some serious to incredibly funny to wild to fast action. It does have some mild adult situations too, but nothing too graphic as it's just a part of real life of those times.

The creators managed to actually mesh all of this together into one great anime. Hidden government agendas, mysterious characters, completely unrelated side plots that actually contribute towards an engaging storyline and an ending that will leave your jaw hanging.

If you've seen Cowboy Bebop, then this should be next in line for your viewing pleasure. This will not disappoint. Look for it in Blu-Ray too.
