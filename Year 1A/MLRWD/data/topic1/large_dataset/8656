The box set itself:

1. I won't make any remarks about the Starburst sets, since I've never owned one. However, when I found out A&E had released an old Sci-fi favourite of mine from when the Sci-fi channel was a Science Fiction channel, I was excited and loved the price. It's economical, while the outer packaging isn't the best, it is what it is. The extras are numerous in quantity and the picture and sound are very good. However I'm not one to go into specifics about quality, but I'm very satisfied with the purchase. It's very economical as I said, if you're hard for cash this is one of the cheaper TV series out there.

2. The show:

I always found similarities between this show and Lexx, while there is no direct similarities. Both shows are character and story driven, Farscape has far more going on in an episode than say Star Trek or Babylon 5. It breaks molds and at times is quirky. Crichton himself is the anti-thesis of Kirk which is welcoming, we explore his and his crew-mates psyche throughout the entire series.

Unlike many other science fiction, there is a lot of grey area involved as well. Which I think is good because you'd never see an alien's side of the story in *Insert typical sci-fi show here*.

It is not always serious and when it is you bond with the characters emotionally, such as in the famed John/Aeryn arc, D'Argo's arc and Scorpious' arc. Each character has depths which are explored, while not fully in detail you understand their motives and evolution throughout the series.

If you are currently itching for something different than Star Trek, SG1 or Babylon 5 and even one my favourites: Lexx, give it a try.
