If you've ever wanted to forget something painful or wanted to never forget something precious...this movie will strike a cord in you.

I was watching this movie for pure entertainment, I admit.  I was killing time.  I knew it was different.  I had no real expectations going into it.  But the story line is compelling and thought provoking.  And suddenly entertainment becomes so much more.

I wish more movies were this way.  I love an open ended story that allows the audience to bring themselves into it.  And forget the fluff and cookie cutter approach to traditional romances today.  This movie brings in the reality of relationships and all the pain and insecurity that can come with them.  It's an honest look at people.  Jim & Kate's relationship isn't what I would call exemplary or a good model, but I still totally got into their connection with each other.

Yes, I really enjoyed this movie.  In an age where time is precious, watching this movie is a very good use of it.  Use your grey matter, people!  Watch this movie and THINK!
