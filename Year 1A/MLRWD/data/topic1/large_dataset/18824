I am very pleased that this wonderful mini-series is finally available on DVD.  I live in Colorado, and I was fascinated with Michner's story.  The actors are mostly well chosen, and you can't beat the real scenery of the area around Boulder, CO.  You might quibble with some 1970's production values, but there's no CG here!  Some of the extra's on the DVD version include interviews with surviving actors about the filming experience.  This is a very long mini-series, and I recommend viewing it one disk per night.  There is just so much to experience.  The earlier episodes are the best, and the message of land conservation and wilderness preservation are as topical today as they were 25 years ago.  My only criticism is that the packaging is rather flimsy.  Two of the disks had fallen off the plastic holders, and were somewhat scratched in the process.  This did not interfere with playing.  I must say that this series looks absolutely wonderful played on my blu-ray(upgrading to 1080p)onto my hi-def flat screen TV, than it did when it was first broadcast!  Great story for families with older students interested in western history!
