I couldn't have asked for a cheaper movie than this one with floppy script writing and cliche wonderland. Renee Zellweger was on an excellent role with her parts in White Oleander, Chicago, and Bridget Jones Diary until she mustve been drunk while signing a contract to star in this love story fairytale. Renee plays a writer who tells woman not to get married and to focus more on thier careers and Ewan disguises himself as an astronaut who would like love more than sex in order to prove she can fall 'down with love'. In a 50's setting this looks like it was made in no time, with no strenous parts to move. Although it was entertaining the acting by both Ewan and Renee was sloppy and not well done when David Hyde Pierce, as always, did an excellent job to give this dull movie a comic boost as the frustrated assistant. If you just love poorly made chick-flicks (always the bad choice) go on, see this but if you like real movies with real plots, keep away from this. 'Down with Love' stumbles its way through ever-so shocking turn arounds in the ever-so poorly made plot.
