I can't say much here that hasn't already been said. I LOVE this movie! I don't know why it doesn't get more play. Jean Arthur's explosive crying made ME laugh until I cried. I don't think I had seen Joel McCrea in anything before this, but I definitely took notice of him after seeing this movie (and by the way, according to IMDB, Katherine Hepburn thought he was one of the best actors she had ever worked with). I was surprised by the sexual tension between McCrea and Arthur, and as another post has mentioned, the not so subtle innuendo. I mean this was the 40's and married couples were still shown as having separate beds into the 50's (I Love Lucy). Charles Coburn's character frustrates me sometimes, but he is so lovable in this. There is never a dull moment and when you think it is going to have a cliche ending it surprises you and manages not to be cheesy.

The remake, Walk, Don't Run isn't as good, but it has Cary Grant in it (need I say more?) taking over Coburn's character. It's worth watching if you love The More the Merrier.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008MTYC">Walk Don't Run</a>
