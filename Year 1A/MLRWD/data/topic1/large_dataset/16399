I really tried hard to like this movie, but I could not.  The movie was set in India but it was clear that the writers had absolutely no idea of what India was, and kept writing in stuff that was completely inconsistent with the culture of the people.  Ignorance is forgivable, but it is clear that the writers made no attempt to understand the subject.  Furthermore since the movie was filmed in India, I am sure that there had to have been countless comments from the Indians involved in the production as to the implausibility of many of the situations.  It begins with the brief sexual encounter with Rita.  This was certainly possible but highly implausible.  One of the most striking was the scene with the obviously conservative Sikh (evidenced by the turban and other attributes of his religion), having a relationship with a Hindu girl (shown by the prominent  bindi with no kara - bracelet kara) smoking a cigarette.  (Tobacco is prohibited among Sikhs.)  A cinematic statement as bold as this one demanded some type of exposition, yet none came.  I could only suppose that this was the result of complete ignorance.  The move continues to move along without any clear direction and merely uses India in an incredibly awkward fashion as a backdrop for this poorly conceived tale.

But as bad as Darjeeling Limited was, it stood out as a comedic masterpiece compared with its prequel, Hotel Chevalier.  This was a plodding piece that served no function other than to waste our time.  In revealed very little about the characters and absolutely nothing which was relevant to the main film.

The whole film reminded me of an unfunny, Bob Hope Bing Crosby "Road to New Delhi", except none of the characters were funny, nor were they capable of engaging the audience in any capacity whatsoever.
