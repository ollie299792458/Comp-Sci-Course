I have never reviewed anything prior to this, but I feel as if it is my civic duty to offer a rebuttal to the unwarranted slew of negative criticism that this movie has received by what appears to be the majority of Amazon reviewers. Now, I don't presume to be a movie critic by any measure of the term, but I think that there is a good reason that Peter Jackson and countless other movie critics have endorsed this movie--it is fun and absolutely riveting in the way only a well made horror flick can be. Sure it's gory, but in a much more creative and stylish manner than your typical teenage slasher. Having watched many a horror film, my response tends to be relatively impassive when a masked villain stabs some hapless teenage victim; but seeing that infected woman in the bathtub shaving her legs and crying as she took off layers of decaying flesh had me clenching my teeth, tightening the muscles in my neck, and curling my toes. I agree with the critic who asserted that "The Ring", "Wrong Turn", and "28 Days Later" are some of the better horror movies to have come out of Hollywood in a while, but I would add this one, along with "Dawn of the Dead", to the list as well.  Bottom line-horror movies that are this fun and engaging are few and far between...and even fewer have a biting pancake ninja child.
