From time to time a film comes a long which not only causes you to believe but to feel again. Caddyshack is not one of these films. Its is a film a caliber even more superior and more captivating. The writing of Brian Doyle Murray is sublime. In fact it is so compelling that Murray was driven insane by the undeniable truth that he would never do anything better then Caddyshack. This disturbed the young Murray so much that he would room the streets night after night, booze in hand, looking for some understanding soul to share his pain. Bill, his brother, stood idle by watching his brother destroy his body and fade into obscurity. Bill knew he had to save his brother and swore to include him on every project Bill would be a part of from that movie forward.  It is this tormented duality which gives meaning and purpose to the rest of Bills comedy. Notice the slightly awkward and bulky delivery of garbled lines as Murray speaks with Chevy Chase. Notice, how behind the brutish dimwitted eyes of Murray's grounds keeper character, there is a glimmer of the tortured inner child of the artist.  An tortured artist who sacrificed a life of benevolent couch ridden obscurity for constant validation of adoring fans and the horrific burden of success.  This movies stands as more then just a comedy, it is a marker in the continuum of the universe. A showing of evidence to the Gods, that in July, 1980, the Murray brothers gave birth to the evolution of perfect absurdity.
