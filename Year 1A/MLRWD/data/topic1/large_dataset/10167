when i saw the preview of this movie on another dvd i knew i had to see it.because i felt that i would like it,and sure enough i did.i have no idea why this film slipped under the radar.its kinda like a comic book-ish type premise.where theres this driven man trying to hunt down the guy who ranned down his wife on a desert freeway.the guy is completley obsessive about it,kinda like the punisher,or batman.the guy has a suped up cuda,with multiple cb's and transister radios.trying to track down the guy responsible for his wifes death (and countless others for that matter).the guy whom killed his wife is responsible for many more hit and runs,he makes them seem like accidents,so theres no real further investigations into the murder.

it all started right after the protagonists wife was ranned down like a dog.our hero gets into a car and chaces him down till he hits him.the antagonists suffers from severe injuries as a result.the killer gets off cause he claims he didin't see the protagonists wife (but we all know thats not true.)so caveziels charachter gets 2 or 3 years for his assault against the antagonist.but of course the antagonist wants revenge now aswell considering the condition he's now in.so now his el derado is the exstention of his body now.with cranks and gears that help him drive the car sense his limbs are horribly dissfigured(you'll see it later in the movie how badly mangled his body is).so after caviziel gets out of jail he rigs up his cuda aswell and goes after the murderer.so this cat and mouse game continues for a few years while they taunt each other threw cb radios..........untill caviziel gets a edge in the situation.

caviezel basicly follows a survivor from the killers last killing spree (in wich her friend had died) to a crash survivors meetings.he tells her what he knows about the accident and tell her that if he can find her so can the killer.he insists the killer would be after her again to finish the job.he offers her a ride home she turns it down.instead she rides home with her friend when the killer in the el derado shows up but caviziel is there to save her.he hold the survivor of the antagonist hostage as a barganing tool to get close to the killer.because he knows if he doesn't get him now he would have to wait another 4 years.as the killer dissapears for several years at a time.

the hostage is exstremley against the idea (you would be too considering what she been through).she survived a fatale car crashed that killed her parents when she was younger.so as a result thats why she refuses to drive now,and add to the fact she just lost her last to friends to the highway killer.of course cavieziel tells her the WHOLE story about his long standing highway fued with the killer.it does'nt make her anymore willing to commit to his dangerous plan though.watch the movie to see how all this unfolds in the end.

all in all this is a great cat and mouse revenge movie set on the back highways of america.
