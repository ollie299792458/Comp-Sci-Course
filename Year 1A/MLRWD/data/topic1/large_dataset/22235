First, let me get out of this out of the way. If you've seen Dawn of the Dead (the newer version with Ving Rhames in it) and you're expecting Land of the Dead to be just as good, you're going to be disappointed. This film isn't nearly as action packed or as crazy fun as Dawn was.

That's not to say it's a bad film. The plot is decent, although not without a few "why the hell?" sorts of questions, and John Lequizamos' acting is spot on I think for this kind of film. Th problem I think is that given the plot and the whole world the characters are living in, there aren't many action scenes & when you do get one, it still isn't as thrilling as Dawn because the Zombies here are a lot slower. Instead of running towards someone to kill and eat, they shuffle, or at best walk at a fast pace.

So just to sum it up since I don't like long reviews, this movie is worth a rental. I'm not a big George Romero follower, so I wasn't expecting too much. If you are a George fan, you'll probably see this movie anyway, but like I said, give it a rental.
