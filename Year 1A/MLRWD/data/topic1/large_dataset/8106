I owned this title on VHS and on laser disk, and neither compared to the quality of this DVD version. The sound is typically great, but the picture sharpness and color depth surpassed my expectations. The special feature documentaries/biographies aren't the usual movie trailer drivel - they are well worth watching. That's the case for buying the DVD.
  What's the attraction with Dr. No? Watch this movie and you'll know why Casino Royalle is seldom referred to as the first Bond movie, even though it pre-dates this feature. Things to watch for? No gadgets, in fact very little high tech anything. This was the platform from which the movie 007 was launched - this is where the Bond persona was formed. He's suave, he's sophisticated, he's Bond. But there is one difference in the Bond character of Dr. No as compared to the subsequent Bond films. James is more arrogant is his manner. Watch the way he interacts with his subordinants and co-workers. Don't believe me? Just watch for the beach scene where James orders Quarrel to fetch his shoes. Of course he still can't extend such an attitude towards "M," even when being forced to trade in his beloved Beretta for his soon to be trademarked Walther PPK.
  Bottom line? If you don't have this title, you don't have a Bond film "collection." And if you're going to do it, spend the extra dollars for the DVD. Then start looking for what is arguably the best 007 film of them all - From Russia With Love.
