I saw this movie and Jeepers Creepers on my birthday (a week before the 9/11 tragedies) and thoroughly enjoyed this feature.  I thought Jeepers Creepers was the worst and the stupidest movie I'd ever seen.  Anyway "O" has the makings of a remarkable film:  great acting, great plot, original cinematography, and some pretty good music.  For the running time of this film, I temporarily forgot that it's a modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello.  Mekhi Pfifer can count this as a milestone and breakthrough film of his career.  This is Shakespeare at its finest and Mekhi carries the movie brilliantly as 'O' (the modernized Othello).  The characters are layered and, unlike many of the films that were released betwenn 2000 and 2001, you're able to understand why things happened the way they did.  You understand why Iago (Hugo - played brilliantly by Josh Hartnett) is jealous of 'O'.  Think about it.  The coach (Hugo's father) seems to favor 'O' more than his very own son.  Julia Styles is both wonderful and beautiful as Desi (an updated Desdemona).  I understand the controversy that surrounded this film.  After all, it was filmed in 1998 and was scheduled for release in 1999.  But, who would want to see the death of teenagers knowing that the real-life tragedy of Columbine High School was still fresh upon the release of the film.  But, the fact that the film still remained current even after it was filmed, edited, and ready for release two years prior to its final release date is a credit to both the cast and crew of this film.  I now own this remarkable masterpiece on DVD and I must say that I enjoy it even more everytime I play it.  
I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that is well-acted as well as well-written whether its Shakespeare or not.
