I first saw The Dark on late-night television during the 1990s and thought it was an interesting movie, even though it had no great science-fiction effects.  The movie is concerned with an alien stalking and killing one person each night in a southern California city, but the majority of the story is about the characters' interactions as they struggle in trying to stop the killings.  William Devane and Richard Jaeckel are excellent in their respective roles as the father of a murdered girl who is quietly determined to find the killer and the equally-determined but confounded police detective who cannot find a pattern in the murders.  Casey Kasem is surprisingly good as the medical examiner providing analysis of the killings and the killer.  There is a steady mental pulse in the movie that gradually and vigorously builds to the high-energy climax.  The end scene of Jaeckel's character kneeling over his fallen police partner and then looking up to see Devane's character looking with concern at him is emotionally powerful in sadness and the realization that the man whom he had viewed as hounding him about the murders understood and cared about his own loss.  A more defined alien and some science-fiction technology would make this a perfect movie.
