My husband and I saw "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" in our local theater over the summer, and we both agree that it was the best movie we saw this year. After all, with both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, how could it be anything but wonderful.

A group of cash-poor retirees looking for an affordable retirement choice head from cool and civilized London to the hot and crowded streets of India. Depending on a colorful (and somewhat imaginative brochure), they expect a luxury hotel complete with all the amenities. Instead, they find a rather run-down hotel, once a grand dame, but now a faded version of her former self. There are few amenities other than the dreams of its young and inexperienced proprietor.

Many movies use the theme of a group of individuals from disparate backgrounds being forced together, but this film handles the conflict beautifully. Both conflicts and alliances are formed, hearts and dreams are broken, and, like the Phoenix, this hotel rises from the proverbial ashes to relive her glorious past. There are touches of both love and death, hope and loss, and beginnings as well as endings. Oh, and most of this happens to people who are on the other side of fifty, just to prove that not all interesting things happen to the young.

In general, I am NOT a movie watcher (my husband will watch and love just about anything) and we don't even own a DVD/Blu-Ray player, but we just may need to buy one (along with a flat screen TV because we still have an old, small CRT) because I would really like to own this movie. It would be a wonderful replacement for Prozac. As the ads say, it really IS the "feel good movie of 2012".
