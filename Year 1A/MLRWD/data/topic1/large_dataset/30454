The blockbuster edition of Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men methodically covers the novel's brutal and homicidal pacing almost to the precision of an unabridged audio book.  The magnificent portrayal of the eerily calm killer, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem, is enough to have the audience squirming and glancing over their shoulders.  The film version of No Country for Old Men, does the book more than justice, it complements it.  The rugged and windswept landscape is portrayed beautifully in the film, accentuating the feeling of reality and presence of being, as described through McCarthy's distinct prose.
With only one personal adaption from the novels story line, a viewer could almost follow along with the book in hand while watching.  What McCarthy portrays in pages of prose, the filmmakers show in an instant, from a panoramic view of the desert, to a body crumpling to the bathtub floor riddled with buck shot.  A flawless interpretation of the characters by the filmmakers makes the film an intriguing experience for anyone who has already read the novel.  There is an attention to detail so impressive that even the smaller roles of the deputy and Uncle Ellis are just as memorable as Chigurh himself.
The violence of the book is magnified terribly when seen on the big screen.  The shocking clarity of every shot, bullet hole, and blood spitting jugular is considerably unsettling.  This film, like the novel it is based on is extremely gory.  Other films have sported more blood, more death, more violence, but the factor that makes No Country for Old Men so ferocious is the complete disrespect for human life.  The reality of this disregard for life shrinks the souls of viewers, flirting with the belief that life can continue, or end, with the result of a coin toss.
