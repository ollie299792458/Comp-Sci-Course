I first saw this movie when I was in my teens. I thought it was funny then. I was glad that a bathroom was close by. Now I'm past middle age and my life is very crazy at times. But even in my most bizarre moments, this film makes me realize how pleasantly normal and ordinary my life really is!

I especially like to watch this after my husband has returned after a weeklong trip out of town and comes home all stressed out. I put this on, we kick off our shoes and relax and laugh our selves silly at how lucky we are that our lives are not like this insanity! Although, if I were faced with the possibility of collecting $350,000 under the "big W", I would probably be just as crazy as Uncle Milty, Ethel Mermin, Eddie Adams, Phil Silvers, Jonathan Winters, Dorothy Provine, and Spencer Tracy.

I loved watching the documentary that comes with the DVD. This film was considered the comedy film of the early 60's; it almost the Who's Who of comedy. The interviews of the stars still living was well worth the price of the disc alone. I watch it over and over again every time I put it in my DVD changer.
