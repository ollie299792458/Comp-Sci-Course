It's obvious to anyone who isn't blinded with love for the Big E to understand that Parker destroyed the King's career with this Hollywood stuff. Even Elvis (although done graciously in interviews) admitted to it. And once he got back to America, Parker had him right back in Hollywood. This was the PERFECT time to fire him. But he didn't and within 4 years, the Beatles arrived and Elvis was history. But this movie, Blue Hawaii, is certainly one of his best. It probabably is his best musical comedy. While nowhere near the excellent Flaming Star and certainly not the calibre of his best performance, King Creole, Blue Hawaii is quite entertaining. My recomendation is to watch it just for the performance of Ms. Lansbury. She is an absolute comedic genius in this picture. And if you notice, while many directors would have wanted another take on Elvis losing it with Lansbury, the scenes are kept in the final edit. In one scene, Elvis tries to keep a straight face but just can't. You can't miss it. It's sad producer Hal Wallis used Elvis as a cash cow to finance other more expensive films and payroll more established and talented actors ('Becket' with Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton, for example). But nevertheless, if you can get past the childish script to Blue Hawaii, you will find it to be a very delightful film. And why Lansbury wasn't at least nominated for a supporting Oscar, who knows. She is WONDERFUL in the film.
