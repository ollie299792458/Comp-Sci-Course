Godzilla Tokyo s.o.s. is sort of a middling film. It isn't good and it isn't bad. It just kind of sits in the middle, not really drawing much attention to itself. I was very surprised at the number of people who rate it better than Godzilla against Mechagodzilla. Godzilla against Mechagodzilla was really the better movie. It had characters I cared about, a sense of humor, and an honest to god story. Tokyo s.o.s. has no plot whatsoever. At the beginning, we are introduced to two characters. The first is an older man who once encountered the Mothra fairies when he was much younger, and the other is his nephew, an engineer working on rebuilding Mechagodzilla. The movie really should have focused on the older man. Instead it follows the younger nephew, and he really got on my nerves. The monster fights are ok, although they don't have the sense of urgency that they had in Godzilla against Mechagodzilla. They try to create a sense of urgency by putting in a cliched scene where our engineer has to hurry to Mechagodzilla to repair it. It doesn't really work.
For the hardcore Godzilla fan, having this one will be a must. It just doesn't have the awesome factor of GMK or the "so bad it's good" factor of Godzilla vs. Megalon, so it probably won't be watched much.
