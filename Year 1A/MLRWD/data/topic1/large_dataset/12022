The movie had its moments but it was not as funny as MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.
The movie is about Ramu (Jimi Mistry) who has a dream of becoming a big star in America. He does not like the entertainment in India. He always enjoys the American entertainment (Grease for example) so much more. He loves to dance and wants be a star.
He tells his family that he is flying to American to become famous. So his family assumes that he will be driving a cab.
When he arrives, he moves in with his Indian friends Vijay (Emil Marwa) and Amit (Raahul Singh). There is a third roommate who does not have a single line in the whole movie and yet he is there. Ramu lands a job as a porn star along side Heather Graham (miscast). When he realizes that he is not really doing what he wants, he gets a great idea at a dinner party. The party is being hosted by Chantal (Christine Baranski) who hires a guru as a gift to Lexi (Marisa Tomei). The guru passes out and in steps in Ramu. He is a big hit and realizes what he has here. He becomes the sexual guru.
The sickest scene in the whole film is when Ramu gets to have sex with Lexi. I don't know what they, the powers that be, were thinking when they dressed Marisa up in that gross underwear.
To add more spice to the film, Sharonna (Heather Graham) is a "subsitute teacher", at least that is what she tells her fiance Rusty (played by Dash Mihok). Rusty is one of the members of New York's finest heros: a firefighter. Rusty is also religious strick when it comes to sex. Little does he know that his girl is a porn star.
Boy meets girl, girl gives out signals, boy missreads signals. Girl discovers truth about Ramu.
The funniest scene was at Sharonna and Rusty's wedding. Apparently Rusty does not love her but loves his "2nd hose man on his truck", Randy (Bobby Cannavale from Third Watch). That was a hysterically touching moment.
Overall, the movie is an interesting date movie but I did not laugh out loud, too many times.
It's worth the money.
