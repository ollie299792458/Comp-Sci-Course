Presentation = excellent, ending = basically hollow. If the importance of the subject matter were not so enormous, then it would be an easy matter to just give this film a pass as an entertaining success... which in many ways it is. Perhaps the movie title could have been 'Charlie Wilson's Unfinished War' or 'How An Amateur Texas Politician Helped Send Several Billion Dollars Of Weapons Into A Region They Really Knew Nothing About Without Regard For The Consequences'. That's where the rub lies at the end, and it's presented as if we were a mere $1 million in school investments away from success, when of course we weren't.

All of the performances are great, the dialoque is snappy, and the girls are beautiful. It's the end result and a couple of minutes of reflection that leaves the viewer a bit uneasy. In the bonus features the real life Joanne gives away the deeper motivations with her assessment of Soviet intentions, domino theory, and the risk to oil routes (as mentioned by Roberts in the film). Charlie is presented as a heroic film, but the larger aims and issues are far more complex than that. It would have been nice if the real Charlie would have gathered up all of the US donated guns, RPGs, missles and mines after 'mission accomplished' & before leaving office. Absolutely no mention is made of Bin Laden and company as beneficiaries, of course. Those serious issues deduct 2 *'s from the rating.

AFTER 2nd viewing: It appears at 2nd glance what it seemed at first = a glorification of Reagan era policy... pumping weapons into Soviet contested hot spots. The film begins and ends with Charlie at an awards ceremony on a right wing pedestal.
