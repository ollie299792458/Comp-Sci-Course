This review contains spoilers.

I wasn't aware of this movie when it was released and heard of it only recently because I got to know and like the work of actress Lindsay Crouse in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Hack."

The movie got high marks from the IMDb crowd and on Amazon.com, but I've been burned that way many times so expected to be disappointed by "House of Games," too.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie far above average. I'd put it in the top 10 percent of all the movies I've seen.

I'm so glad David Mamet decided to make this movie with his wife in the lead and his friend Joe Montegna playing Mike. Both actors are perfectly cast.

That said, I do have three minor quibbles with the movie. (Spoilers coming.) First, it seemed obvious to me that Lindsay's character was being conned when the briefcase containing $80,000 went missing and Lindsay offered to reimburse the con men. Concomitantly, it didn't make sense that Lindsay's character wouldn't catch on at that point that she was being conned.

Later in the movie, Lindsay visits the bar where the con men hang out. She enters late at night through the back door, which was all too conveniently unlocked.

Lastly, when Lindsay and Joe have their final confrontation they are in the baggage handling area of a large airport. And no one else is around. Not even close enough, apparently, to hear six gunshots.

But these are small complaints compared to the overall quality of the movie. "House of Games" is a gem.
