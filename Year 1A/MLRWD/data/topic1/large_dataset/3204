How the reviewers and some of these nuckle head movie watchers give this movie a bad review is simply rediculous.
Event Horizon has all the essential elements that make for a great sci fi thriller. This movie's plot in itself is intriguing and scary. The sequence of events leading up to the mystery dissapearance of the Event Horizon (the lost ship) is brilliantly done in the way it gives the viewer creepy little hints about the ships disspearance and the crew members that were aboard at that time. This Movies concept of this ship going through a man made black hole which lead it into a real Hell is enough to scare me whereas I dont typically get scared from horror flicks. This movie raises interesting questions about the possiblity that a real Hell  exists out in the Universe which is something that our science cannot refute since our technology has not explored the far reaches of the universe. If your a person that has any type of perspective, you will definantly enjoy this film. If your a person that needs to shut off thier brain during a movie, go watch "Blade" or "Resident Evil" and enjoy that mindless violence although this movie isn't to far off from displaying that amount of Gore.
