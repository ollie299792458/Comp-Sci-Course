This is one of those films I've tried to love for years, and still think it's one weird script.  I understand the source of this story was the relationship and marriage of Doris Day to her first husband whom from I gather was a piece of work. Most of the dialogue seems improvised and after a certain point repetitive and self-indulgent. And with the two leads not very sympathetic characters, for me it becomes hard to stay with for almost 3 hours.  But the music is great, and still it fascinates me as an experiment.
It also seems to me that Scorsese could not have loved those 40's musicals this is claimed to be an homage to, or this would have been a much different film.
But my biggest complaint here is this Blu-Ray release, which is a somewhat improvement over the previous DVD versions but still not to the level it should or could be.  The opening and closing sequences are a marked difference and look great, but the rest of the film is still generously grainy and that should have been cleaned up.  I mean, how many times are companies going to reissue a film in a new medium, not improve it, and pass the buck on the consumer? From VHS to Laserdisc to DVD to the Special Edition DVD to the 30th Edition DVD and now to Blu-Ray.... Are we supposed to wait for this in the 3-D version for further improvements and then buy it again expecting that the studios will finally give us what we pay for?
