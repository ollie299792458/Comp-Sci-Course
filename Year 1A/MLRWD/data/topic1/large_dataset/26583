After films like "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" and their various spinoffs, today's audience may think it knows what a farce is but in truth, it hasn't a clue. In fact, genuine farce is a rare thing and probably the toughest of comedy genres to pull off. Few directors nowadays have the guts to take one on because they know the odds are against them (Speilberg never attempted another after 1941 flopped.) Only a handful of titles qualify as the genuine item, among them:  Bringing Up Baby, Asenic and Old Lace, His Girl Friday, and more recent examples like What's Up, Doc? and A Fish Called Wanda. One Two Three may be one of the purest representations of farce ever put on film. Try to imagine pure comic chaos operating to the ticking beat of a swiss watch and you begin to get an idea of what the film is like - and it's like no other. A spectacular melding of form and theme, the film's stylized hyper-kinetic precision is a sly satire of corporate culture and its vaunted dream of machine-like efficiency. The spirit, however, is pure anarchy. A truly amazing comedy which deserves to be rediscovered.
