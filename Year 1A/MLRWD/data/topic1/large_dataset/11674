Even though this DVD is not as good as Devotional... its worth buying.

I'll start with a few negatives first.

Dave does not sound as good on this DVD as he did on Devotional and other concerts I have seen.

I am also not a big fan of the "mellowness" of the Exciter album, which is carried over to this performance.  There are a lot of "slower" songs on this performance that I feel take away some of the energy.

Condemnation was done very poorly on this DVD.  Those slow hard drums were almost eliminated.  I almost have to skip over this track after hearing the Devotional version of this song.

And since they seem to promote the Exciter songs on this album, I don't know why they left out "I Feel Loved".

With that said, there are a lot of bright spots of this DVD.

The "mellowness" of the DVD turns into a major positive when they sing "Waiting for the Night".  Probably the BEST song on the DVD.  "It Doesn't Matter", sung by Gore is another great "mellow" song.

They did a great job on a number of songs like Never Let Me Down Again, Enjoy The Silence, and Halo.

Hearing Black Celebration was also a pleasant surprise.

Overall good DVD.  Worth the purchase.  Now I am just hoping they decide to put out a "Touring The Angel" DVD since that concert was awesome.
