I saw two movies during the past 2 nights.  The first, "Battle Los Angeles" was a fun, testosterone filled bloodbath, I will admit was ejoyable enough to keep one in his or her seat (well, "his" seat anyway.  That piece of entertainment cost about +/- $70,000,000 to create.  It was fun as I said but I developed no emotional attachment to the charaters, the plight of humanity in the face of such an overwhelming force (consider here your attachment to Rocky, or the Rebel Alliance) and when said and done, was just a fun movie to see once, maybe again later on when you forget how it ends.

"Kill the Irishman", and indie-pic probably made in the single-digit millions, had outstandig acting with Ray Stevenson showing some emmotional range, Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken as an antagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio and an actor who continues to grow, Val Kilmer; along with the usual stable of Italian mafia character actors.  I became involved in rooting for this anti-hero and without giving too much away, wanted to reach out a hand to help him on his life's path.

Absolutely engrossing, it is amazing, both films released the same day on DVD, one promoted heavily on TV, the other overlooked even when doing an internet search for "New DVD's this week".  5-10 years from now, one will be a cult-classic, the other will be all but forgotten.  LEt me tell you, it won't be the $70,000,000 picture that profited in the long run.

If it happened in Boston it would be up there with the greats, somethingn about the Irish anywhere else lacks a little something, perhaps I am just bias.  Nevertheless, seldom is a film worth 4 out of 5 stars and if possible I would give it 4.5/5.

"Kill the Irishman" based on a true story, will not be a waste of your time or money. Slainte'
