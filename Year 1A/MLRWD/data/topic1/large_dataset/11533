Winning a much deserved Oscar, the 1976 film All the President's Men is not only an accurate portrayal of the Watergate scandal but also keeps its viewers intrigued and entertained. Then breakout stars, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, play the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. The two work diligently to break the story and eventually gather enough evidence to bring down President Nixon.

Bernstein's disheveled and quirky character serves as a perfect catalyst to Woodward's straight-laced reporter. Just beginning, Woodward is trying to make a name for him while Bernstein on the other hand knows all the loop holes and takes every short cut. Hoffman and Redford were brilliantly cast to play the roles, accurately depicting the two men because of their interesting chemistry.

After learning the detail behind the actual scandal it is easy to see the time put into researching Watergate to so perfectly illustrate the reality. Because "deep throat" just recently came out to the public it was interesting to see how the mystery is kept anonymous throughout the film. If "deep throat's" discovery has sparked interest in the film, you are in for an interesting history lesson and intriguing entertainment
