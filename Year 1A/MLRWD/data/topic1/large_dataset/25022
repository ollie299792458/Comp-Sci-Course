Well, this movie wasn't great, but nor was it bad. I would have given it 3 stars, but grading it against other movies of similar theme (e.g. "The Witches of Eastwick",) it actually comes across pretty well.
The Pros: This movie is probably the best mainstream portrayal of actual, modern witchcraft that exists. Words like "The Craft" and explanations that witchcraft does not entail a belief in or pact with "Satan" are very good. Other than that, the story is nice, the settings are beautiful, and the acting is well done. Over all, things are pulled off very well here. Oh, and I love the semi-subtle allusion to karma (everything you do will come back to you later on).
On the other hand...
The Cons: OK, there are some major realism issues here. For example, there is no spell to bring a person back from the dead. And, well, love spells? Come on! Aside from that, the flying at the end has to be pretty bad. Still, I suppose for the purposes of movie-making, one has to make exceptions in order to make things interesting. I can't say I totally agree with that, but I'll deal with it.
So over all, I would actually recommend this movie. Sure it has its faults, but over all it is a pretty magical, if not magickal, movie. One of Sandra Bullock's better thinking-movie roles (at least as far as this is a thinking movie, and really that's a whole other issue). Enjoy!
