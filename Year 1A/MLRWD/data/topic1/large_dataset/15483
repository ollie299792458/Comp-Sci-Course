"The Devil and Daniel Johnston" is a moving study of a singer-songwriter-musician-illustrator-artist who almost loses his career - and indeed his very life - because of manic depression.  Director Jeff Feuerzeig's sensitive documentary explores Johnston's early years with his fundamentalist Christian family through his later years as a psychotic singing storyteller hell-bent on casting out the devil in his many disguises.

This movie reveals the artist's many sides:  impetuous youth running off to join the carnival; independent filmmaker yearning to be a star, director, producer, and distributor; historian responsible for recording audiotapes of his childhood; visual artist documenting his thoughts and feelings into comic book-style drawings; idealistic performer hoping to be the next John Lennon; folk singer obsessed with heartfelt lyrics about his first-love; and psychiatric patient taking his meds, receiving his therapy, and dreaming of release.

Johnston's parents and friends provide a loving - though unflinching - look at the man through in-depth interviews with the filmmaker.  The film blends vintage performances, current footage, grainy home movies, photographs, drawings, and recorded audiotapes to present a layered look into Johnston's personal history.  His artwork, rooted deep in his childhood pain, has been displayed in galleries and museums around the world, and his music has attracted an international cult audience including Matt Groening, Sonic Youth, David Bowie, Tom Waits, and Beck.  Even so, Johnston's mental illness has prevented him from achieving the level of fame he always desired.
