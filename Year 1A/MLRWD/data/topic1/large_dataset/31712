All I can say about Terminator is that it has class!  I've yet to see another movie in the same league.  I'm not really a Science Fiction movie fan, but this movie was amazing!  The first in this two-series movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Terminator from the future which has come to terminate Sarah Connor, because she later gives birth to John Connor who would lead a mission against evil machines like terminators.  Sarah knows nothing about it until she sees a news flash which informs her of the murders of three people with similiar names: Sarah Connor.  Sarah at once knows that she is the fourth target and tries to hide from Schwarzenegger.  Micheal Biehn comes in here.  He is the 'good guy' of the movie (not to mention cute!).  He is a person from the future and has come to help Sarah.  His name is Kyle Breece.  After helping her for a few days, they fall in love.  They go to a hotel and, just before they're leaving from there, Schwarzenegger comes.  They fight him to the his and Kyle's deaths.  Sarah is very sad and heart-broken.  Later, she becomes pregnant with Kyle's baby.  She makes tapes describing Kyle and the chemistry between them.  A very thrilling, yet touching movie.  A must-watch for all ages!
