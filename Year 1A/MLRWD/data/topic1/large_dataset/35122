This is one of the best teenage movies in 80s. It has lots of good elements, like romance, school problems, great music, fighting combats, and the zen of karate. This is a unique martial arts movie. Most of them focus on fighting combat scenes; however, Karate Kid instead focuses on the mental side: Wax On, Wax Off, Sand the floor, Paint the house, etc. Those are as a matter of fact the defensive techniques for learning blocking. You can see the director carefully sets up two traditional styles of karate: Hard and Soft. Obviously, the Cobra sensai &amp; his students are from hard style, very aggressive &amp; no mercy. In contrast, Miyagi &amp; Daniel are from soft style, focusing on defensive technique and mental training. They meet together finally in a tournament. 
For this DVD, it lacks of some extra freebies. Only subtitles and theatrical trailer are included. No deleted scenes, no directory's commentaries, and no documentaries. I'm sure lots of people will appreciate if there's a DVD box set for the entire Karate Kid series with some good extra features.
