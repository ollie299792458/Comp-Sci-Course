The first word spoken is "sh*t."  Why can't characters say "ouch!" or "oh!"?  The 7-year old child actor wisecracks about "t*tties" and sex. Great-grandpa dies and no one prays. The Swedish maid is tall and blonde and says "Yah Yah" and sleeps with Grandpa the day he wanders into the movie. Why? Because Hollywood thinks "Everyone talks and acts this way." They have no idea how people live.

Ordinary people are throwaways. We have all our meals at KFC while the "real people" are driving beat up VW busses and doing "important things" beneath our noses.

Michael Caine does a good job looking old. The father does a good job looking like an underwear-ad male model playing the part of a father. The child-actor is stock footage of the John Denver haircut, wise-cracking, sex-savvy cutey pie.  Christopher Walken is supposed to be a just-out-of-prison grandfather, but his hair is brown as a shoeshine, and stands straight up in a kind of Lyle Lovette imitation. He shreiks the F-word a few times so you know he is acting.

A dour, sour movie that looks like a Hollywood version of an indie movie - which it is.

If you get the DVD - the interview with the writer tells you enough: slovenly, unshaven, unkempt - the Hollywood version of the "writer." The guy can't even take a shower, or sit up straight and talk to us after we bought his silly movie.
