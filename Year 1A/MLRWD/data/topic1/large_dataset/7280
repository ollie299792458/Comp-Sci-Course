Take an actor, any actor and take away his ability to talk. Put him in a movie and ask him to play a buffoon and do slapstick comedy and while doing it ask him to connect on a deeper personal and emotional level to the audience.
Imagine how hard its that to pull off. I don't know too many actors who could do it, actually most of them would fail miserably.
Yet there was one man, Charles Chaplin who not only pulled off this masterpiece of artistry but did on a medium that was just in its natal phase.

In "City Lights" Chaplin creates an icon of the everyday man entangled into the mishaps of society. His heart is in the right place but as we all know sometimes good intentions are not all it takes to keep you out of trouble.
Special mention has to be given to Harry Myers who I think performed as well as Chaplin. His millionaire character is the epitome of the human condition friendly during a sunny day, dark when the fun is over.

The ending as many people have wisely pointed out its one of the most iconic pieces of film making to grace our eyes.

Also good to point out is the fact that Chaplin not only acted in the film. But he wrote the story, produced, directed and even wrote the music score for it.

Now if this is hasn't been overwhelming enough. You have to consider that the medium and many of the basic rules of Cinema were created by him.

It is simply something  to shrink you shoulders at and awe in amazement. A testament to human genius
