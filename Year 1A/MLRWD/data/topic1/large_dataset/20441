This film, I believe, is an underrated sci-fi classic. That opinion is based on the fact that the film continues to be over-looked on periodical lists and/or discussions of the like, and I really don't know why. It provides adventure, character-development, a bit of comedy, decent acting, good cinematography, and good dialogue (not to mention some fine special effects for their time, provided by none other than Ray Harryhausen).
I've always been fascinated by genius trumping contemporary thinking--in this case, by almost seventy years! ('The Fly' does this as well). For this story, instead of someone figuring out the mechanics of teleportation long before the scientific community does (or, at least, eventually will), the scientist in this film does the same with his approach to going to the moon.
But all that aside, the movie, to me, is quite enjoyable. I was fascinated by it as a child and as an adult I continue to enjoy it. Edward Judd does a great job and, of course, Lionel Jeffries (who died last year without much fanfare) makes the character of the scientist sing (great job, Mr. Jeffries!).
Overall, this movie is highly recommended to fans of semi-sophisticated, early sixties sci-fi. In regards to that kind of genre, it doesn't get any better than this.
