Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle.  It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.

This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) & Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.

I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.  I don't care where your from or what colour your skin is, you can enjoy and be moved by this film, a true masterpiece
