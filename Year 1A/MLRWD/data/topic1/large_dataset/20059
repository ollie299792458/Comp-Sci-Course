This is a good movie that most likely was far ahead of its time in the 1940s. When I first saw it nine years ago, I was disappointed that Ray Milland's character didn't find sobriety through  Alcoholics Anonymous. However, AA was still a very young entity (only 10 years old) at the time this movie was made, so it may not have been enough of a force for the filmmakers to have considered for inclusion in the story.  (About 17 years later, things were different: by the early 1960's, AA had a proven track record of success, and credibility, as the impetus for positive change in Jack Lemmon's character in The Days of Wine and Roses.) But even the founders of AA pointed out that there are many ways to sobriety; they never claimed that AA was the one and only option. If Ray Milland's character had to go through delirium tremens and its associated, terrifying hallucinations to be scared sober, that's ok, too. Could have been an effective warning to viewers struggling with alcoholism, themselves.
