Having spent many years as a full-time ballet dancer, I have always been quite body conscience.  After recently retiring from dance, my hectic life got the best of me and I found myself gaining a few unwanted pounds and losing my prized muscle tone.  After spending nearly a year stubbornly working at developing my own exercise program, I finally realized that my needs had changed and a few plies and grande battements would no longer keep me looking young and lean.  I decided to invest in some minor workout equipment,  such as 5 lb. weights, a stability ball and a yoga mat, and start doing some workout videos.  Since I lack both the money and the motivation to actually go to the gym, this proved a great alternative, especially since my first purchase was Denise Austin- Shrink Your Female Fat Zones.

Because of my past dance training, I still find that some workouts don't actually get me to the point of breaking a sweat. This is not the case with this workout! The first of the two workouts gets my heartrate up and works all the female trouble zones as promised including the abs, hips, and upper arms.  The second half of the programe involves a stability as well as light weights and it certainly works well, although I'm experiencing a bit of difficulty due to investing in a poorly designed stability ball.  Overall this is a great workout, and Denise Austion has a wonderfully positive attitude during the entire workout which really pushes you to do just one more leg lift! If you're a beginner, the first 20 minutes workout should be sufficient and once you work up to a more intermediate level, you can continue through the stability ball segment.  Definitely worth the money!
