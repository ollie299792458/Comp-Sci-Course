Look at the picture of James Dean in the photo on the DVD. Punky looking.  A kind of "smirk" on his face.  Older photos had a lit cigarette dangling from his lips.  Images like that NEVER appealed to me and therefore, neither did this film. Never had any interest in seeing it.  And I would not.  But one night, some 22 years or more back, I was up, couldn't sleep, around 2 a.m., flipping through the (then fewer) cable channels.  NOTHING good was on the tv. I stumbled across this film.  Didn't know what it was. I said, oh, so this is the famous James Dean, eh, and started watching just out of curiosity.  WITHIN MINUTES, I was addicted to this story and could not, would not, turn away.  The acting was incredible, so convincing I forgot that I was looking at James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo.  These performers went beyond amazing. These characters came to life.  I had to close my door in case any in my family got up and walked by my door because, several times in this film, I, a grown man, was sobbing.  I don't mind admitting to that, but it was a reaction, especially to a movie I had heretofore had no interest at all in seeing, a reaction that I never expected.  Quite unexpectedly, one night over 22 years ago, I unexpectedly discovered one of the most beautiful and touching films I have ever seen in my entire life.  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE will always remain a beloved favorite of mine. The story is gripping and gut-wrenching and the actors (now all sadly having passed on) give utterly unforgettable performances. If you have never seen this film, by all means do.  And if you have, and don't have a copy of it yet, then you KNOW you need to get one.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  Simply amazing and beautiful. You will never, ever forget this movie.
