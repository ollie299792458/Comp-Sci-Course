Everybody did a good job in this movie.  The storyline was very nice and it teaches many lessons.  The only weakness is that it drags a little a some points.  They could have sped it up a lot and it would have been better.
The plot is nothing original.  It's been done dozens of times, so it's very hard to make it seem unique.  This movie does have a uniqueness, mostly in the contrasting personalities of the two stars.
A twice-divorced, flamboyant, middle-aged mother (Susan Sarandon) moves with her unwilling teenage daughter (Natalie Portman) from small-town Wisconsin to Beverly Hills, apparently to fulfill some life-long dream of the mother's to live it up in California and for her daughter to become an actress.  The daughter leaves behind a very close friend and a cousin and complains every step of the way.
The mother makes one financial mistake after another and they constantly have their electricity and telephone shut off because she doesn't pay the bills.  They move from apartment to apartment which only makes things worse.  They get into repeated arguments about finances and the mother's failed love life.  The entire movie is a battle of wills between the mother and daughter.  Only after the daughter learns to accept her mother's ways is there peace.
