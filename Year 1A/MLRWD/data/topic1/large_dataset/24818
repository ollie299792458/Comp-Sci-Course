Even after 25 years, after an endless succession of sequels, parodies, and intertextual references, it is easy to see why this became the highest grossing movie in history, and it remains the best horror movie ever made.  And it's not because of the shark -- though the shark is big and scary, providing much more heart-pounding suspense than some guy in a hockey mask slicing up campers.  
It's because of the trio of precisely realized heroes drawn from Moby Dick -- Martin Brody, the by-the-book Ishmael with a troubled past, who hates water but lives on an island; Matt Hooper, the effervescent shark-chasing Queequeg, who offers Brody a chance for salvation; and Quint the sea-chanty singing Captain Ahab. Their bonding is intense and exhilerating, and at the end of the movie one feels that Brody has finally been redeemed, and Hooper has finally found a home. There are dozens of wonderfully-drawn minor characters, like the stammering mayor or the dumpy housewife whose son is eaten by the shark, and Amityville is a character in its own right, beautifully photographed and absolutely real -- its nice to see a beach for once populated by actual people, not gym-toned eye candy.  
The movie ages well, with only a bit of slang and some ludicrous leisure suits to place it in the 1970's.  The DVD could use more extras: there are hundreds of rather dull production photos, a few shark facts, and a short documentary, but the best horror movie ever made needs a full scene-by-scene commentary.
