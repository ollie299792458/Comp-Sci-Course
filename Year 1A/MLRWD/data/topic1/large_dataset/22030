When you watch the interplay between Douglas Wambaugh and Judge Bone, Ray Walston might as well have had antennae coming out of his head. (For the uninitiated, check out Walston's old TV series "My Favorite Martian".) Their banter was that otherworldly. And this show was nothing short of cosmically brilliant. Take a philosophical or legal issue that seems ridiculous on its face, interject it within a small town where absolutely everyone instantly knows everyone else's business, and watch the magic unfold. The issues are years ahead of their time and include a doctor's HIV status, stem cell research, human growth hormone injections for short children, keeping alive a pregnant brain-dead woman in order to give birth, and polygamy, among many others. There is also a pervading sense of humor ranging from Fyvush Finkel's "character" to Walston's "Get out" to teenage love (gay and straight), the dating of identical twins, and Carter Pike's eternal quest for semen. You get the idea. And if you don't, then watch the show. It's worth your time.
