I bought this version to augment our homeschool study of Julius Caesar because it had so many actors whom I recognized.  But right from the opening credits, I could not read the blurry titles or names, and I eventually gave up because my eyes got tired from squinting in an unconscious effort to try to bring  this hopelessly poor-quality film into focus.  I wondered if it was a pirated copy.  On the other hand, what I saw of it was just what I wanted: vintage actors trying their hand at a kind of acting I have rarely seen most of them do.  I was expecting a fine performance from John Geilgud, and was not disappointed.  Diana Rigg was reasonable as Portia. Robert Vaughan's excellent Casca was a very pleasant surprise, quite a change of pace since the last time I saw him he was the Man from U.N.C.L.E. As for Jason Robards, he and Shakespeare should just avoid each other;  Robard's performance was wooden and his lines delivered in a flat voice. Still, what I saw of it was good, nostalgic fun, and I truly regret having to return the DVD; but in the end, I could not watch it because of the poor quality of the filming.
