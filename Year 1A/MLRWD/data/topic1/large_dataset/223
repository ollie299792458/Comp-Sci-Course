I had high hopes for this movie.  I didn't catch it in theatres, but I work in a video store and have been counting down for the past month until the day I could finally rent it.  After what seemed like a lifetime of waiting, I finally watched the movie.  I was blown away and despite the high hopes I had held my expectations were surpassed by a supreme margin.  The acting was perfect, flawless.  Each character was matched with an actor who captured the spirit to a 'T'.  Jason Lee is in his best role ever, despite it being a seemingly small part.  Billy Crudup is now in the running for my personal list of best actors.  And of course, it was great to see the lovely Fairuza Balk return in another simply dazzling film.  Even with the perfect cast a movie could still do badly, but Cameron Crowe added a beautiful script, and lastly, an extremely well done soundtrack that epitomizes the feeling of the movie.  It even includes "Fever Dog" by Stillwater.  The story was too great for words.  I hoped that it would not end. I was too caught up in the story, and I wanted to find out the rest of the epic.  What happened to Stillwater?  Where does William go from there?  And Penny?  But even with questions, I was left feeling like everything was perfect in the world, longing to have grown up in such a lovely time where bands had long hair and self indulgent guitar solos, and people actually yelled "Does anybody remember laughter?"
