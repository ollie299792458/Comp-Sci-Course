This guy is a joke. I blame the prison system for his behavior and outburst.  If this Mike Peterson would have spent time in American Prison
during the 70 or 80s or even now his fame or so called fame would have never happened. American Prisons are no joke and this CLOWN AKA Bronson
would be dead before he was transported to another prison. He would have been accepted by whites, and if he had any rank he would still be
controlled by the prisoners NOT the system.  My Point is that American Prison are Hard Core and so are the inmates that are within the walls of
these prisons. London should visit our Prison to see what HELL is like and maybe they would change or at least make a system that works. No System
is perfect but I can guarantee you that are prisoners are out of control.. But only if we allow them to be. Discipline goes only so far and as Mr. Peterson
did not learn from his Beatings. This should have been a clear sign from the beginning that Transporting him from 1 prison to another and beating him did not solve anything.  Bring his Butt to America we will show him what Prison is all about!

About the movie>>> Strange and bizarre but interesting. I would not call it a movie but more like low budget sundance film with some decent acting.
