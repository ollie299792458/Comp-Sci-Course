I purchased a PS3 when it came out. One of the reasons I was hot for one was for Blu-Ray playback. I have a rear projection Mitsubishi HD set from a few years back. It has no DVI or HDMI, just standard Component HD inputs. I got home with my new PS3 and Blu-Ray disks and set it all up. I watched a few fantastic looking Blu-Ray movies: Fifth Element, Last Samurai, and Enemy of the State. But when I finally put Fugitive in, I was blown away. I can't believe how this older film scanned to HD so well! It was like watching it for the first time. My whole family stopped what they were doing and sat down and watched this movie. Now I have enjoyed the quality of all the Blu-Ray disks I have spun up in my PS3 as they have all finally made my Mitsubishi 48 inch HDTV show me what I paid for when I bought it. But this disk made my Mitsubishi look like a 55 inch movie theater. I swear, the picture was bigger and more in-my-face than other Blu-Ray disks I have watched. I don't know what Warner Bros. is doing to re-master their movies to HDTV, but keep it up!

P.S. - I knew Tommy Lee Jones's face was messed up, but HDTV shows it all! DAMN!!
