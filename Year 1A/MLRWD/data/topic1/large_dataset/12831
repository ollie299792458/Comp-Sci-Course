Hellraiser 2: Hellbound is a good sequal, meeting the requirements that all sequels must: more blood, more terror, less character developement, and less thought put into the story.  The reason why I gave Hellraiser 2 four stars is  because out of the franchise Hellraiser 2 is the closest one to the all around goodness of the first Hellraiser.  Hellraiser 2 is the last to feature the original cast of Cenobites (which also happens to be the best) as well as the origin of the head cenobite, Pinhead, played by Doug Bradley.  Ashley Laurence, the actor who Portrays heroine Kristy Cotton, returns but her acting is cheesy, possibly due to the editing which makes a lot of her statements sound strange and out of place.  However the best part of Hellraiser 2 is the creation of a new Cenobite (which is somewhat shown) Dr. Channard, which is one of the coolest Cenobites ever and has some great lines.  All in All Hellraiser 2:Hellbound is a must see and a must have for any Hellraiser fan, what is seen is Hellraiser 2 is only briefly repeated in Hellraiser 3 and not very well.
