This is not the best version of A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM out there.  Once again, for some strange reason, it has been decided that Shakespeare didn't know what he was doing, and actually, the setting for the film is Italy,  not Athens.  And as the film opens we discover that characters like  Hippolyta (Queen of the Amazons) and Theseus (Duke of Athens) actually live  in a 19th century villa.  Rather remarkable, that.  Oh, and wait till you  hear!  Nick Bottom the Weaver has a wife.  Where she came from, I guess  we'll never know.  She even has a speaking part.  
There's also the  mystery of the bicycles.  They're definitely not from Athens or from Greek  mythology.  And the fairies' haunts in the woods look amazingly  pre-Raphaelite.  
All that aside, there are some nice performances in  this film.  Stanley Tucci does a wonderful Puck, Kevin Kline actually  manages to do a good job with Bottom once his wife is out of the picture,  and the other tradesmen are quite well done.  Flockhart does a passable  Helena, and Michelle Pfeiffer is ravishing as Titania.
One thing I  couldn't get past in this movie is that there are at least four, count 'em,  four different accents being employed.  Hermia is obviously a long lost  sister of Elisa Doolittle, while Lysander sounds a lot more like, oh, James  Mason... meanwhile, Hippolyta seems to have gone to the Gina Lolabrigida  school of diction and Calista Flockhart... well who knows WHERE she got HER  accent.  
Oh, while we're at it, is it REALLY necessary to have mud  wrestling in bloomers?  I mean, we all would have paid just to catch a  glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline.
Yes, this video is worth  seeing.  No, it isn't great Shakespeare.  Watch it just for fun.  Let's  hope Branaugh is over his Hamlet fiasco and back producing SERIOUS  performances of the Bard's work.
