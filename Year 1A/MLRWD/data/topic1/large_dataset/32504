The extras on this are so amazingly bad it kept me awake all night with my rage (oh how my rage keeps me warm) so you got interviews with the actors sure you cant get them all. I see that but they babble on with such self importance and there oh so intimate knowledge of youth culture cause they where in a teen movie.
Now could they get any crew to talk about the movie maybe john Hughes? There only one lame attempt to explain the process of the production is the costume designer. Now I am sure she is great at her job but there is only so much you can here about the look of the characters.
So to make up for such large holes such as no molly, no Emilio, no john Hughes and one crew member they bring out the big guns people who have directed other teen movies. Diablo I plagiarized a South Korean movie Cody who wrote the film Juno. She just fumbles about with phrases like "I heard they did this." All here say on her part except for her own experience of when she saw the film, which I have no interest in at all.
Others extras include them denying that there wherever brats in the brat pack in which they try to make themselves look squeaky clean and change history.
Please if your extras are this bad just don't release them.
