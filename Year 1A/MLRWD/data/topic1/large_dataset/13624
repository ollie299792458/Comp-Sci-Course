Ranma 1/2, the gender switching comedy by Rumiko Takahashi, has long been a favorite of fans. Closer to Urusei Yatsura than Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi returns to a high school setting and ultimately a more episodic plot. This first season retains more of a continuous plot than any of the later seasons, and introduces most of the main characters. Though the series eventually becomes tedious, this season is fresh and fun. Anyone who calls him or herself an anime fan should definitely take a look. The Ranma dub is notorious among fans that suffered without subtitled versions for years. This DVD set solves this problem once and for all, including both Japanese with English subtitles, and the well-done English dub. Anyone who has never heard Megumi Hayashibara's Girl-type Ranma should watch it just for that.
The box is nice, but the DVDs are no frills. The Furinkan Gazettes, although no liner notes, would still have been a nice addition. Still, this is a great series and a good box set. I highly recommend it. Four stars.
