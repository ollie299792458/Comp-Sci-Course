Sure, as other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't a true story, and it doen't claim to be; as clearly stated by the producers at the start. It does depict, however, the very difficult terrain in which one had to fight any enemy in pure rain forest jungle, especially if it's in their backyard; visabilty - very limited; progress - very slow and laboured; disorientation; waterborn diseases; insects; difficulty of receiving essential supplies etc., etc.

There's a lot to like; the Franz Waxman score from the credits onwards gives just the "right feel", Raoul Walsh's direction provides just the right amount of emotion, sentiment and action that is appropiate for each and every scene; and he most certainly exploted the acting talents of Errol Flynn to draw out Errol's best for whatever part he was playing under Walsh's direction. (It is a great pity that Errol Flynn was very much under rated as an actor, in my opinion, and as a result he didn't get sufficient roles in which he was able to demostrate his abilities; he was essentially type cast as an action hero, romantic lead that looked good if nothing else and nothing could have been further from the truth).

The movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let up until the end; sure it is long at almost 2 1/2 hours, but not unnecessarily so. It is pure entertainment that was made at the end of WW2; so don't think too much about it, just enjoy.

I wonder how long we will have to wait for another actioner WW2 film to come to DVD, Desperate Journey with Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Nancy Coleman, Raymond Massey and Arthur Kennedy; also directed by Raoul Walsh and with this cast you know its great entertainment!
