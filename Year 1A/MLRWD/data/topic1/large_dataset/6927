Wow! What an experience. I caught this documentary late one night in England about a month ago. Just as I was about to go to bed this utterly amazing documentary started to play. The moving images and music, the scenes, the ordinary and extraordinay folks of the Deep South totally blew my mind. The extreme cultural difference both calming at one end of the scale and totally disturbing at the other made me compelled to purchase this DVD on release.

Much has already been written about this documentary and it all is very valid. Seeing prisoners talking of experiences, churches where all can be cured with a blessing. No right and no wrong. A clear divide in an amazing community yet a divining common goal. A hard way of live but throughout a common spiritual believe.

Shame it was put on so late on BBC2. I will write something more substantial once I have watched this again on the anticipated DVD. Jim White - what a superb storyteller. Just telling it as it is respecting those around him. A+;
