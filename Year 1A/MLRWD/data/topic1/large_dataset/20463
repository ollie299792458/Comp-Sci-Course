After watching and loving Kill Bill: Volume 1, I made Pulp Fiction a priority to see.  There are so many things I love about this movie I'm afraid this review won't do it justice.  If you've seen Kill Bill and enjoyed it, you'll most likely enjoy this 1000 times more.
The plot is perfect in every way.  You gain a great amount of respect for each individual character as the movie goes on, and really begin to care about them.  At first it seems that none of the characters are connected, but slowly they all come together in one hell of a finale, by which time you feel like you're a changed person.  I can't say enough nice things about this movie, it's amazing.  The film is also darkly funny, I found the hardest I laughed was at Christopher Walken's brief appearance, which ties into my next point.
The cast of this movie is awesome.  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis all give great performances, as do all of the rest of the cast who play smaller parts.  A movie is always better when you like the entire cast, and when everyone in the cast just seems to fit well together.
The movie is also characterized the the music, the cinematography, and the overall raw feel that it has-- I loved every second of it.  It has such energy and passion, you just can't help but stare at it.  Because of Pulp Fiction, I think of Quentin Tarantino has earned a place on the list of "Best Directors of All Time".  I urge you to see this movie, you won't regret it.
