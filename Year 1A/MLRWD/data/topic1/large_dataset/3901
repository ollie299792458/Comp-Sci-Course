ok The story was great, it captured Clark and Billy's characters peoperly, you also
meet Black Adam and how tough he is, but thats not all!
EXTRAS:
you get the other showrts you would find in other dvd's included with some DC animated features
in a nut shell...
*Jona Hex - animated short
( Bounty hunting and western fun! )
*The Spectre - animated short
( cold justice, 70's style, right down to the music and the washed look, almost dirty Harry like)
*Green arrow - animated short
( a fast paced rump with the power couple, Green Arrow and Black Canary!)

now more extras! These are episodes relating to the characters hand picked by Bruce Timm.

* Jona Hex - Showdown - from the Batman Animated series on fox , Jonah faces an old enemy of Batman
and his henchmen
* The Spectre - Chill of the night- from Batman the Brave and the Bold, this actually got me hooked with
the campy series, which I despised until I saw how dark the show can get. loved it watch here as
Phantom Stranger and Spectre bet on Batman's soul.
*Green Arrow - Initiation - from JLA unlimited, good fun :D
* Shazam - clash - from JLA unlimited also, NICE!

so you get a few shorts and a few full episodes, widescreen matted format
a run time of 63 minutes, but it's worth it! Many characters in one DVD
in their own little adventures, which were very well animated too, excellent voice acting.

now you know a little more before buying it :D hope yall love DC as much as I do and pick this one up
