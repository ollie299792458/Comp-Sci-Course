There are some great moments on this DVD, most notably the woman coming on stage in St. Louis to sign for the hearing impaired and Eddie Vedder hoisting a boy on his shoulders to jam on the climactic "Keep on Rocking in the Free World." But while there are warm, emotional segments on the disk and the sound is lush, the picture quality is pretty lousy. This is a DVD, folks. Not an 8 mm movie. The close-ups on Eddie and the other band members should be much sharper and the lighting should be vivid and colorful. But images are soft and,for the most part, dull. The roadies who shot the footage had their hearts in the right place, but their technical skills are lacking. Still, once you get past the lousy picture quality, you can appreciate this DVD for its terrific sound and its ambition to capture special, moving moments of the 2000 American tour. 
Also, this DVD makes it clear that Pearl Jam has become the Eddie Vedder show. He's like Neil Young to the Crazy Horse of Mike, Stone and Jeff. The only other person on stage who demands attention is Matt Cameron. While Mike McCready's guitar licks sound great, the video often shows him looking off to the side of the stage appearing bored and disinterested. Jeff and Stone occasionally jam together but this band is hardly as exciting to watch as U2 or the Who. I love their music and Eddie Vedder is a charismatic front man, but they don't have the same energy on stage they had 10 years ago.
