"The Funhouse" is another of my favorite slasher movies from the 80's.

I love the carnival setting in this movie, As a kid I always loved freak shows ,I loved the way they incorporated the freak show into the story and when the barker aka "the creatures father" says to the creature "You could have ended up like your little brother in there" referring to a horribly deformed stillborn baby in a big jar of formaldehyde that the teenagers see while going through the freak show tent.

The creature in this movie is very effective.

As a woman it was even more disturbing because of the scenes where the creature is intimate with the fortune teller and then when he is kissing and drooling all over the girl that's trapped in an air vent or whatever it is.

You know he has the same sexual needs and desires as a normal man and I actually felt sorry for him because he was a product of his upbringing and his deformity.

Hooper somehow seems to humanize him no matter how hideous he is.

It has some good kills and a good feel to it "creepy"...It's another must for the collector.
