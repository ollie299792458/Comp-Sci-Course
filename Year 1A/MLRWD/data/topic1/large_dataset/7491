In spite of the ever changing cinematic landscape, some films will always be "classics." Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Star Wars, and now: Jackass Number Two.

From the edge-of-your-seat excitement of the opening sequence to the chaotic mother-of-all-pranks at the end, this movie will take hold of you, like a mother clutching a newborn babe to her warm bosom.

The shenanigans of this group of merry pranksters will captivate and enthrall even the most jaded and blase of viewers. Indeed, Camus, himself, would arise and proclaim "HUZZAH!" upon seeing virtuosity personified in Johnny Knoxville -- I should note, that if Knoxville had only this single labor to his credit, it would be an oeuvre to rival the works of Shakespeare and Mozart combined.

Of course, my humble words cannot do justice to this treasure, this... Magnum opus. I urge you to experience this matchless pastiche of celluloid excellence while it can still be called "The Greatest Movie That Ever Was."
