First, I am an OIF and OAF vet... Put down on the Army - geez - did that person miss the point of the movie. If you have a relative or friend in theatre (that is the proper, not american spelling of the word), Buy, rent, or borrow this film.

Look at it on a broader context. What each of the roles shows is reality; if you cannot handle reality - move to Canada (especially Quebec).

This film is not about war or any branch of service. This film is about what, all too many, veterans have gone through AND are still going through. This film; stirred, dug up, overwhelmed memories that I thought I had a handle on.

I am buying several copies of this DVD and mailing it to family members; in the effort, to prevent the massive screw up they did on my return. This film is only the tip of an iceburg and I have one other family member still over there.

Take it in context - open your eyes and minds, coming back from war, especially urban warfare, is difficult and many family and friends cannot understand what is felt; or as Jackson's character said, "I feel nothing." This film should be standard issue to families as loved ones deploy...
