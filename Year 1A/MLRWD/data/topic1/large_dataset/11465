Will someone PLEASE tell Ian Anderson to shut up with the clever smart assed remarks and do what he does best, sing and play!!!! This could have been a wonderful DVD. However, buyer be warned, it is NOT Jethro Tull live at the Isle of Wight. Rather, it is selections of their performance along with interviews and clips from previous films of the crowd, etc. It is a shame that classic songs, "To cry you a song" and "With you there to help me" were omited in favor of nonsensical audience interviews and other documentary dialogue. This DVD is not for long time Tull fans, but rather for those "tourists" as Joni Mitchell called them, who want a brief glimpse of '60s nostalgia. They should have created a DVD on the model of the Jimi Hendrix Fillmore concerts where there is an opportunity to view the entire performance without interruption as well as the documentary. I would have been willing to pay extra dollars for this. Instead we are treated to a middle aged Ian Anderson dispensing his "wisdom" to those who came to hear good music. When will these "artists" (film makers AND musicians) smarten up to the fact that their pontificating gets in the way of their art. Too bad, great band! Hey, Martin Barre gets it right!! Too bad there's not much of him on the DVD!!
