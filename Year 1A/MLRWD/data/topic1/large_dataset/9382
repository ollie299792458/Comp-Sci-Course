While I do prefer psycho over this one, Rear Window still is a masterpiece of one of Hitchcock's best. The cast has two greats in Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, the music is classic, the suspense is fanastic, and the plot's perdect. The plot is centered around a photographer played by Jimmy Stewart who is sidelined because of an accident. He thus is in a wheelchair and lives life by inspecting and observing everyone in the neighborhood. He has his binoculars and learns that one person might be an opera singer, and another might be a writer. That's what he does the whole day. What's so fantastic about this is a study of people and their hobbies and jobs. The photographer has nothing to do and can find out dark secrets of some neighbors even. When he is convinced that the wife of one neighbor has dissapeared, he inspects the husband, convinced he has killed her and burried her in her garden. He then sends his girlfriend over to the man's apartement to inspect. His plan is dangerous but absolutely brilliant. The movie itself is brilliant with a great score, one hell of a neat plot, and a great finale. The suspense is great and Hitchcock once again has proven himself to be a legendary director.
