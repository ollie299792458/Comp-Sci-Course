Basically the more times you answered "Yes" to the above questions, the more you'll like "Spaced." Its release here in the 'States has been a long time coming, and now that it's here, you need to GET it. You WILL need to pay attention when you watch though. If you think you can get full enjoyment of this show while taking on the phone or playing WOW, you'll miss out on a lot. The setups for some of the jokes are subtle, and sometimes in a completely different scene... or even a previous episode.

If you don't buy it, at least rent/Netflix/YouTube it, or whatever. You shan't be let down...

If you have a brain and a witty sense of humor.
