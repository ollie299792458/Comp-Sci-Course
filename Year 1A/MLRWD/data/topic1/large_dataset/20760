The relationship in this story is something that I geunuinely wanted to enjoy.  I know how it started but I wasn't sure where it was going to go.  I wanted this film to be on the same shelf with BELLE DU JOUR, LAST TANGO IN PARIS and BAD TIMING: A SENSUAL OBSESSION.  And, more recently, SECRETARY.

I like a good twisted sexual love affair.

Charlotte Rampling is outstanding in her role, and Dirk Bogarde is perfectly-cast.  Their scenes make the film.  Unfortunately, they don't make up most of the movie.

I thought the sub-plot of former Nazis completely ground the film to a halt, interferring with what made this story so compelling: this couple who survived their roles in the Holocaust, believing they'd "recovered" their humanity and joined decent society again...only to fall back into their affair of master and slave.

The only thing I enjoyed about the other Nazis in the film: recognizing the actor who played Draco, Diana Rigg's crime lord father from the James Bond movie, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  The rest was just dull and distracting.

And for a Criterion Collection edition, I was surprised at the "extras" on this disc: Play Film, Chapters, Color Bar.  That's it.  And, yes, one of your special options is clicking on Color Bar and seeing...a color bar.

But Charlotte deserves the three stars.  She certainly deserves much more.
