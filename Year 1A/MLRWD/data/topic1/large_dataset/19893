I absolutely love Roman Polanski's movies, but this has to be one of the best. I think the reason is that Polanski also stars, and his turn as the naive, soft-spoken, innocent Alfred is what makes this film a true classic. Almost all of the funny moments happen as a result of something he does or says or something that is done to him, and if nothing else, his expressions are adorably fun to watch.

Aside from Polanski, this is one of the few accounts of his future-wife Sharon Tate's beauty & skill. The chemistry between the two is intoxicating, especially when you see how confident Tate is around Polanski and how shy and introverted Polanski seems around here. The end scene where the two are riding in the carriage (before she...well, you know) is so bittersweet and touching.

Okay, aside from Polanski & Tate, there are other wonderful aspects of this film. The score is eerie and perfectly suited to this masterpiece, and the scenery is intoxicating (just take a look at the snow, not to mention the adorable snowman that Alfred builds for Sarah).

The funniest scenes definitely take place once the Professor & Alfred get to the castle. I love when Alfred is to scared to sleep in his own room, and he tries to get in bed with the professor.

The ball was a perfect climax to the film, especially when the vampires realize that the only relection in the mirrors is of Alfred & the Professor. The last scenes are horribly nerve-wracking and tense, with a perfect finish. Leave it to Polanski to end this film the exact opposite of what you'd expect. A happy ending? Not in a Polanski movie.

That's why we love him!
