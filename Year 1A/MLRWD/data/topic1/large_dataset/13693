This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. It's got music, it's got murders, and most importantly of all, it's got TOONS!!!!!!!!! Everything a movie should have. Robert Zemeckis is a well-acclaimed director who's done films like Back to the Future and the "newly-released" Polar Express, (but those are completely different reviews... all of which should be very good). Bob Hoskins is hilarious and makes the movie seem realistic. (He's somewhat of a "Scrooge" character). Christopher Llyod is great as he portrays the villain, Judge Doom. (I like that the original concept was that he was the guy who shot Bambi's mother). Though all the actors gave a splendid performance, Charles Fleisher (the voice of Roger Rabbit) was the best. He even wore a rabbit suit on set of the film. I'm also amazed at the wonderful effect of putting toons and actors together in the same frame. (I guess that's why, "Roger Rabbit" has won an academy award.) Probably never again will anyone see Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck in the same frame together. Everyone who hasn't seen this should go watch the flick right now. They can last for 104 minutes. The DVD is also worthwhile, too. There are Roger Rabbit shorts that were originally seen in theaters and an interactive game in which you save Toontown. It was considered that there would be a sequel to "Roger Rabbit"; one that would go directly to video and DVD. If a sequel was made, I'm sure it would be great. In the words of the sexy Jessica Rabbit, "Why Don't You Do Right" and Zemeckis surely has done right in making this a periodic, memorable movie. It has secured a place in film history.
