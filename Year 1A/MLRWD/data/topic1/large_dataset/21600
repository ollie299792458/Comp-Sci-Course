Sorry, my english is not too good, ...but I'll try to explain my point: Twin Peaks was a great TV serial I loved it, especially Pilot Episode was really magic, I mean ...it had the right mix of suspance, mistery, and likelyhood.
That's completely absent here. Total lack of likelyhood.
A lot of people who seems taken by a madhouse (F.B.I. agents too!...may I say particularly?) and some "being" who could well be find into a Hyeronimus Bosch painting!!!
Poor Laura Palmer painted as a girl that pass her time sniffing cocaine and f...ing every guy who meets her!!! Not to mention the changing of Donna Hayword actress, and the absence of Sheriff Truman, Josie Packard and Ben Horne (three important characters of T.P.)!
More: in T.P. Laura is supposed to be under psycho-therapy, but where is Dr.Jacobi? Laura's father is supposed to be a properly qualified lawyer, but in this movie even an idiot could see that he's completely fool!!!
The movie turns in a psychedelic adventure since the beginning and shows an oneiric world cutting off almost every contact with real world, ...Twin Peaks had it's oneiric face too, but it was much more controlled and well integrated in the history that neverthless remained pretty much real.
I'm not happy to give this opinion because I really loved T.P. and still loving it (by the way, I've buy the DVD 1st season: fantastic, with a lot of extras) ...but sincerely I'd expected something more from a director like David Lynch.
The movie, that I bought because as a "T.P. fan" I couldn't miss it, was quite a disappointment to me.
