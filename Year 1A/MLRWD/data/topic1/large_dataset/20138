If you want an accurate description of the real Andy Kaufman's life this movie would not be the way to go; you should buy one of the many biographies that came out at the time of this film's release. If you want to see an entertaining look at what Andy Kaufman was like, both on stage and off then you should see this film. Seeing Jim Carrey on screen playing Andy Kaufman is like seeing the actual Andy Kaufman. Jim Carrey becomes Andy, and it really is the highlight of the movie. Weather he is reading the Great Gastby, wrestling women, being alter ego Tony Clifton, fighting on the Letterman Show, or doing the famous Mighty Mouse seen on SNL you believe Jim Carrey is actually Andy Kaufman. The performance is not only believeable, but very very compelling. The supporting cast includes Danny Devito, Hole's lead singer Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti. All put in very capable performances, but are overshadowed by Carrey (which isn't necessarily a bad thing cause this is basically HIS movie). The story follows Andy's career hitting all the highs and lows, ending with his tragic death of cancer. The movie covers sooo much of his career it seems like it spreads itself thin, the audience gets glimpses of Andy's antics, friends, family, etc.. but it doesn't really go in depth on any one aspect. In the end the flaws of the plot and pacing aren't nearly enough to make this a bad movie. It is funny, touching, and by the end you really see what Andy's act was all about. He toyed with the audience getting you to both love and hate him, either way you enjoyed ever second of it, as you should this movie. The DVD version of this movie is solid, but REALLY could of used a commentary track. Hearing Andy's friend Danny Devito and Jim Carrey talk about the movie would have been outstanding....instead we are given deleated scenes and a documentary. Although the extras on the disc are good, imagining what they could have been only leaves you a little bit disappointed.
