More radical than even Psycho, "Peeping Tom" will knock your socks off.  The entire movie sort of stalks along, gently pulling you to watch.  Nothing will disturb you more than the amount at which you will love Karl Boehm and his sweet yet deathly voice.  His austrian "S"s come across in the creepiest way.  Quietly, he whispers to Anna Massey's character, "Happy Birsday," after brutally killing, and of course filming, a prostitute.  I just can't get enough of the thrills this film gives me.  Forget Psycho (which came out a few months after this one) and buy a film that "ruined" Powell's carreer.
Perhaps even MORE engaging, if at all possible, is the documentary featured on the Criterion DVD, "A Very British Psycho."  You will never regret getting to know the writer of the film, Leo Marks.  Marks was a codes expert during WWII and is the most fascinating man I've ever heard talk.  He even made me like poetry (not an easy task, trust me.)
Buy this DVD immediately and spread the word.  People deserve good things and Powell's movie deserves as much recognition as possible.
