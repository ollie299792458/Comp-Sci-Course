First of all, I thought I had heard of the New York Dolls before I saw this movie, but I had no idea who they were.  I certainly didn't realize the impact that they had on popular music.  So from that point of view it was interesting to see that glam rock and punk both can trace their lineage directly to 'The Dolls'.  It is really amazing how many bands these guys influenced in their short meteoric career.

But that's not the point of this movie.  What could have been a compelling 'Behind The Music' episode turned into so much more as the director shot this movie.  The filmmakers got lucky - this story about an aging rock star transcends into a tale of humanity right before your eyes.

I don't want to talk about what happens because that would ruin the experience.  When the movie started and I met Arthur "Killer" Kane on a Los Angeles city bus, I was oddly intrigued.  Kane has a strange, gentle way about him, and a soft spokenness that makes you watch.  During that bus ride, Arthur had no idea where his life was about to go, and neither did I.

The great thing about this movie is that you take the journey with Arthur.  It's a journey everyone should take.
