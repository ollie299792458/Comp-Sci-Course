I've ordered and received three of the Legacy Collections: Frankenstein, Wolfman & Invisible Man.  I've found no problems with their condition or playability.  There was a loose disk in one of them but it played with no problems despite minor scuff marks.

I must say that the nay-sayers who gave such poor reviews to these wonderful collections based upon their own individual playback issues caused more than a little concern for me.  Perhaps they should try their disks in more than one type of DVD player.  Not all DVD players like all disks.

I sincerely recommend these collections for what they are; good quality in both audio and video.  Certainly as good or better than when they were shown on TV in the 50's, 60's and 70's.

Perhaps for those un-pleasable few who complain that their quality isn't up to modern standards; take a look at when they were made.  There was no such thing as high definition or 5.1 surround sound in the 30's, 40's or 50's.  Give it a rest!
