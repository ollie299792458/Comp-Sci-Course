"Pocahontas" is the first Disney movie aimed at the adult audience rather than kids. While previous animated features were filled with lots of humor, talking animals/objects/cartoonish-looking characters, "Pocahontas" is a complete opposite, therefore it's got many people complaining about. Aside from the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith, the main theme of the movie is the strong message of tolerance, harmony and wisdom. Some viewers need to understand that this film was created to teach our minds and touch our hearts, whereas the entertainment value is not the most important this time.

"Pocahontas" brings honor to the Native American society, perfectly reflecting the beauty of their world, that was so different than the "civilized" one. The Indians are presented as the spiritual people, respecting their land and all the forces of nature. In the most memorable sequence, Pocahontas is singing: "I know every rock and tree and creature has a life, has a spirit, has a name/ And we are all connected to each other in a circle, in a hoop that never ends". This message is very inspiring to both adults and children, as nowadays, in the world ruled by money, we're so blinded and preoccupied with the material values, that we forget what's basic and ultimate. In terms of giving a valuable lesson, "Pocahontas" is probably Disney's most important movie to date.

Animation and the backgrounds are just stunning. Pastel-dominated color palette makes the film a wonderful visual experience. Unlike "Aladdin" or "The Little Mermaid", "Pocahontas" has far more realistic character design. No huge eyes, no too big heads and anorectic postures; all the characters seem to be made of flesh and blood and are so perfectly animated, that sometimes you forget they're just hand-drawn cartoons. All the animators (we have an excellent opportunity to "meet" them, thanks to the bonus material on the dvd) captured the personalities of the characters, transfering their own vision, emotions and sense of style into paper. The most wonderful of them all is, of course, Glen Keane, the Pocahontas' animator who has made an impressive progress since the plain Ariel days. While "the mermaid" definitely didn't look top-notch, Pocahontas looks just too good! She's anatomically perfect, she has a beautiful and sophisticated facial features and looks like an extremely talented actress - if it wasn't for the fact she's animated, she could be Hollywood's hottest lady. Oh, and that voice...

The voice actors - while the animator provides the looks, it's the actor who captures the spirit. Spirit of Pocahontas is simply beautiful, thanks to Irene Bedard, who's voice sounds maturer and deeper than any Disney heroine before. Irene, a Native American actress (who looks surprisingly similar to Pocahontas), did an outstanding job making her character unique and multi-dimensional. Irene also hosts "The Making Of Pocahontas" available on the 10th anniversary dvd, so we can see how beautiful and lovely she actually is. Another surprise is David Odgen Stiers, a Disney veteran, who's credits include many many characters (f.ex. Cogsworth in "Beauty & the Beast") - this time he's a villain,  Governor Ratcliffe, as well as his servant Wiggins (!!!). Ratcliff is a perfectly arogant and wicked huge man, while Wiggins is an annoying little guy - I can't help but admiring this extremely versatile actor. Mel Gibson does a great job as John Smith - I really liked his performance. Pocahontas' father, chief Powhatan is voiced by Russel Means - his deep voice perfectly fits the character. It's no secret that Disney voice casts have always been flawless and this time the voice makeovers are just perfect.

If you're not an animation fan, the reason you should see Â„Pocahontas" anyway, is the amazingly beautiful music composed by a musical genius, Alan Menken.  "Pocahontas" soundtrack is mellower than any of previous Disney soundtracks, as the movie is rather adult-themed. I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't for Menken's music, "Pocahontas" wouldn't have been such a remarkable work of art as it is. The soundtrack is engaging on each level - both musically and lirycally (Stephen Schwartz wrote great lyrics). It truly reflects (or maybe creates) the atmosphere of the story. Instrumental tracks are the perfect background to the events of the story - they're very cinematic and telling; there are several moments in the movie when the characters don't need to say anything, for the music says it all. The Broadway style musical numbers are very important to the action - they establish the characters' point of view in a unique and memorable way.

The "Pocahontas" leading lady's songs are the true standouts - Pocahontas got to sing the most beautiful and valuable songs the Disney heroine has ever been apriveleged to sing. "Just Around The Riverbend" is a lively manifesto of Pocahontas' independent and adventurous spirit - it's the first time in a movie when we begin to love the character. But the strongest moment comes with "Colors of the Wind" - Pocahontas' anthem of wisdom, love and harmony - the message of this song is ultimate to our world and all the universe. Listening to "Colors of the Wind" is nothing short of unforgettable EXPERIENCE and I believe it's one of the best songs in history (well deserved Academy Award). Pocahontas' singing voice is provided by a Broadway veteran, Judy Kuhn. What's very interesting, she had been casted before they even found a speaking voice of the character. Hearing her voice I can easily see why - Judy has this unique ability to give a strong, emotional performance without getting whiny or trying to hard. Everything's in control yet honest, humble yet impressive, mature yet youthful. That stands for Pocahontas' personality - Judy makes her sound like a self-confident, unapologetic young woman who doesn't want to prove anything, but demonstrates her beliefs and wants to be taken the way she is. I also adore the Polish version of singing Pocahontas, beautifully sung by the wonderful Edyta Gorniak, who sounds different than Judy Kuhn, but is equally perfect.

If you complain that "Pocahontas" is not historically accurate, note that in fact it wasn't meant to be. It's based on a legend of Pocahontas, who was the inspiration to make a valuable movie with strong message. So perceive this film as a whole new story and open your mind to enjoy it the way it deserves.  It's a little uncoventional for a Disney film, but that only makes it special.

"Pocahontas" - this movie is the paradise to the eyes, heaven to the ears, and bliss to the soul. A must-see masterpiece!
