I vaguely remember seeing this movie on television when I was a kid, but didn't pay much attention then. But lately, I've become interested in cheesy horror flicks, especially ones that include creatures, so I bought this at a great price to look at it as an adult. What a hoot! I was actually alone in my living room watching this late at night and trying my very best not to wake up my roommate with my intense laughing. It's a lot of fun. It's also a sloppy film. There's dead bodies that are still breathing, a couple of actors that look like they're about to bust out laughing at any moment, animals that are not native to swamps. I actually felt sorry for some of the creatures. The filmmakers just won't leave the poor things alone. I like how the film emphasizes the threatening nature of the animals by...zooming in on their faces with the camera. (OOOH! Scary!!!) One of my favourite scenes is when one of the men in the film is supposedly being attack by an alligator, (or crocodile, I'm not really sure which one it is) but the reptile seems to actually be accosted by the man. The animal is not even opening it's mouth and the man is wrestling the poor thing, kind of like Martin Landau and the tentacles in Ed Wood. Then there's the Frogs. Lots of shots of them doing some mighty intimidating...croaking. That's it. Well, that and hopping. They're actually kinda cute (and plump). I like the scene near the end of the film where they're taking over Ray Milland's house and one of them is spinning around and around on the record player. Wheeee!!! Silly! Silly! Silly!
