Season Three is a great season, with only a few mediocre episodes (Meridian &amp; Fascination). 
My favourite episodes are (in no particular order):
- THE SEARCH 1 &amp; 2 (Odo meet his "family")
- THE HOUSE OF QUARK (very funny)
- SECOND SKIN (Kira's worst nightmare comes true)
- CIVIL DEFENSE (The look on Dukat's face halfway through the episode is priceless)
- DEFIANT (Tom Riker (from TNG's "SECOND CHANCES") steals the Defiant)
- PAST TENSE 1 &amp; 2 (Great drama, great acting)
- VISIONARY (I always like stories dealing with time travel)
- DISTANT VOICES (A very surreal episode)
- THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS (another mirror universe adventure. The Mirror Kira is one of my favourite characters)
- IMPROBABLE CAUSE/THE DIE IS CAST (Great acting by Andrew Robinson and Ren&eacute; Auberjonois (Garak &amp; Odo)
- FACETS (We "meet" all of Dax's former hosts, including Curzon)
- THE ADVERSARY (a very claustrophobic episode with a surprise ending)
The extra's are all in the same league with those of season 1 &amp; 2, with a feature on the Dominion, ODO'S CREW DOSSIER, MICHAEL WESTMORE'S ALIENS and several hidden files.
If you are a fan, as I am, you will already have bought this. If you are not, you will soon be if you buy it.
