Adam Sandler's two best movies, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, are now available in one set. Both are worth buying and with them in one set is even better.

HAPPY GILMORE

Adam plays a wannabe hockey player who turns pro-golfer, so he can buy back his grandmother's home. Happy is different than most normal golfers. Happy is a loud and rowdy player who runs and swings with all his might. Because of that he can drive the ball 400 yards. Under the guidance of Chubbs, a former pro golfer, and his grandmother, he tries to win the championship.

BILLY MADISON

Billy Madison is an idiot who has a rich father, the owner of Madison Hotels. His father wants to pass on the company and his fortune to Billy, but to do so Billy has to go through all 12 grades in 24 weeks. If he fails to pass all twelve in the 24 weeks, Eric Gordon, an employee wof Madison Hotels gets it.

Both of these films are top notch and are a must have for fans of Adam Sandler.
