I have seen this movie countless times (must be over 30 times now). I caught it on video as a rental once and was hooked (can anyone remember this movie being promoted very much while it graced the silver screen?). This is one of the most spectacular movies of the decade, and one which I most surprisingly (and against all trends) must say was SUPERIOR to the novel that predates it. James Schamus' screenplay, coupled with Ang Lee's directorial ability (see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for an altogether different application of his talent, also Sense and Sensibility) makes a beautiful and purified adaptation of this novel: the cultural and emotional fallout stemming from American catastrophes like Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the broken and aimless aftermath of the political protest era of the Hippies.
Set in a wealthy Western Connecticut rural suburb, The Ice Storm is the story of two affluent families whose lives intertwine over a Thanksgiving weekend. The culmination of the story tells of the fractionalizing of a nuclear family; the last step in the gradual deconstruction of institutional religion that took place in America after the Second World War.
Gen Xers, Existentialists, deconstructionists, and film buffs, rejoice!
