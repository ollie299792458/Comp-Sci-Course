Don't let the words 'explicit' or 'Exclaimer' color your judgement of this movie. The only shock comes when you realise that this is not merely a longer version of a standard episode sans bleep track. This is a well made  and carefully crafted piece of animation cinema. Sure, its badly drawn and  has a greater rate of swearing than any other main stream picture, but take  a while to sit down and acutally watch it. The biggest shock is not the  language or the subject matter but the fact that it is not as purile,  either in subject matter or execution. This is not a cheap gimmick to sell  more Kenny Dolls. This is a real movie event. 
Believe it or not I was  present at a screening where people were crying at the end of the picture  and gave it a standing ovation.
It's definitely not for the family, but  if you are reasonably intelligent 'adult' then I think you'll be pleasently  surprised by what you get for bucks.
A round of applause to Trey Parker,  a unfairly judged genius if ever there was one.
