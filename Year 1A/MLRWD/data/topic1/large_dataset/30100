I'm not sure what I was thinking when I rented this tragedy of a movie. I was seduced by the positive remarks ensconced on the cover of the movie, I suppose. I can't think of any other reason why I would pick up this -- otiose, dull, exasperating -- movie.
Jennifer Aniston stars as a bored girl exhausted by her supermarket job, and her pot-smoking dull and lifeless husband. Entranced by the gothic self-styled Holden from Salinger's &lt;i>Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i>, Aniston's character decides to risk everything -- which is pretty much nothing -- and have a fling. The fling turns into one of those languishing romances where the nerd-boy threatens to commit suicide should she leave him. Meanwhile her husband's best friend catches her at a motel with this kid and threatens to squeal should she fail to sleep with him as well.
Lameness escapes in every minute of this mangled, lifeless waste of precious time. Dull and pedantic, the character's go through a mindless dance with forgetable scenarios and a plot so thickly-lined with stupidity it leaves you with a sense of general dread for not having stopped the insanity when you still had a chance.
Avoid this movie. It is _terrible_.
