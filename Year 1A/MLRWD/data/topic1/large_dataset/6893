This is a really great horror fantasy film directed and written by Clive Barker after having wrote and directed the hugely successful Hellraiser a couple of years before. This is a really amazing film, bsting the genre open, as it is not exactly strictly horror but not real fantasy either. It is like a dark gory fairy tale, well better than that sounds. It it huge, fast paced, well acted, amazing special effects before CGI came along. Truly memorable bizarre monsters with real depth and different sides to the whole story.
It was tragically badly promoted and distributed on release but they just did not know how to sell it. Now though it could be very huge on DVD. This actually though, as great as it is, is not the final cut of the film. The director Clive Barker does intend to eventually regain the missing or lost scenes from the film studios and recut them into the film as they were originally intended. If you see this fantasic fresh dark fantasy film, you should join the fans in pushing for a much deserved proper director's cut of the whole film as intended with bonus features and commentaries for this special highly unique oringinal horror film.
