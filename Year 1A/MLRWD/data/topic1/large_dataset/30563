I distinctly remember seeing the trailer for this film in the movie theater and a person near me said loudly "won't be seeing that movie." It's not for everyone - But it has since become my favorite  fantasy film. Straight from Tim Burton's subconscious vision he paints the  tale of a sensitive, isolated stranger who is brought into the realm of  Day-Glo suburbia by an Avon lady with the best of intentions. The story  unfolds as the Main character is perceived as both creative and destructive  by the denizens of this pristine, ordered world. The consequences are  always grimm -  Bittersweet, beautiful, and very visual storytelling (art  director Bo Welch) takes this classic theme and elevates it to the highest  artform a film can acheive. Edward is Frankenstein's Monster as the artist  in society. The outsider who is appreciated for what they produce - but  abhorred as a personality by those who worship their art. This should have  been out on DVD much sooner!  With commentary by Burton and Master  composer Danny Elfman. I can't say how much of a treat this will be for  fans of both. So to quote a classic episode of Seinfeld featuring two  Italian Barbers " Edwardo Scissorhandsa, He maka me cry..." I am  it it is me and so on.
