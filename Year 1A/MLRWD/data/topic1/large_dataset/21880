Spike Lee is an excellent director and Mr. Genet is an excellent author.  The film's topography shows the reality that the universe is changing. Attitudes and politics are changing.

  Unfortunately, Mr. Lee had to tout the feminist and lesbian vote by not depicting why these women are using the "role reversal."  If this were an autobiography, I think that the audience would see that some, not all, of the women in the film have been victims of male torture.  In one scene, Fatima's live-in lover says, "I don't even feel like a woman" since she didn't get pregnant.  My question, then, is "Is Fatima a male in their relationship?"  Also, an additional question is "Why do these lesbian women have to identify roles in their relationships?"  Why is Fatima's lover cooking dinner for both of them, after she walks in the condo with a business suit (in one scene)?

  Finally, Jack is portrayed as a victim.  He is not.  Jack is a Wharton graduate who feels denigrated to consort to other forms of employment and/or career alternatives like: teaching, working at McDonald's, or playing nursemaid to his sick father. Therefore, he does not have to be a "stallion" sending his spermatoza into women who are paying him.  Furthermore, Jack doesn't have to feed the children that he is creating. He is not the victim of rape and furthermore, he signs a "release of parental responsibility."  This fact creates the stereotypical "black stallion."  Jack, an educated man, becomes an irresponsible prototype of the black male who does not support his progeny.  Here is where Spike shows that the black male stereoptype is alive.

  The movie is worth watching so that you THINK.  As ususal, Mr. Lee leaves you guessing.  He does not answer the questions for you.  You have to think, probe, and delve. The storyline is what makes the film receive a 5 but, if you are not in the mood for thought provocation, watch something else.
