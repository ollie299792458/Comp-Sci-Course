All too often film critics will bash a movie simply because of a person who is in it.  Swept Away was called "a leading contender for a Razzie" (the anti-Oscar) before it even opened.  I hope those people actually go see the movie because they will be surprised.
This movie is not perfect.  Parts are very "Taming of the Shrew"-esque.  I would have given more time developing the transition from "Amber the ..." to "Amber the Nice".  And there was one scene where Giuseppe and Amber are on a lift that is pretty cheesy.
HOWEVER, the rest of the cinematography was wonderful.  Madonna played the part beautifully, and in my eyes, redeemed herself after "The Next Best Thing".  Adriano Giannini was simply amazing...I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him in Hollywood.  The story was fast-moving, interesting, and fun.  This movie is well-deserving of four stars.
I highly recommend this movie, but just remember:
1)  Don't compare it to the original "Swept Away..."  This is an adaptation for 2002.  It's not meant to be like the original.
2)  Go in with an open mind and just enjoy the show!
