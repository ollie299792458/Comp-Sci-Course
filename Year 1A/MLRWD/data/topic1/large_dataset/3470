Obviously if you knew what it was about when you started watching, you couldn't have expected it to make any sense, right? But apparently some people were expecting just that, even after the opening monologue which pretty much defined the only "plot" of Rubber.

In this scene, a police car knocks down row of chairs in the middle of the desert. A man gets out of the trunk and gets a glass of water from the driver. He explains to the viewer how the element of "no reason" is present in everything, and basically says that to enjoy a film, you have to be able to suspend disbelief and not overanalyze all the little details. ("In the Steven Spielberg movie E.T., why is the alien brown? No reason.") He then proclaims the following film as being an homage to "no reason", before dumping his glass of water on the ground and climbing back into the trunk. At this point you should realize that Rubber is not exactly going to be the most normal film in the world.

What I'm getting at is this: If you can't understand, enjoy, or otherwise appreciate the opening monologue, you will not understand, enjoy, or otherwise appreciate the rest of the movie.

Rubber aims for nothing except entertaining the viewer with the power of sheer ridiculousness. There is barely any plot to speak of; the entire movie is almost a string of random events which happens for *no reason*. Why does the tire come alive? (no reason) Why does he have telekinesis? (no reason) Why is there a live turkey in the motel room? (no reason) Why does anyone like this movie? (no reason) Yes, I really don't see a reason why anyone should like this movie.

And yet, it works. Rubber is a brilliant satire on the human thought process, among other things, and by the end of it you will probably feel as if the filmmakers have just made you the butt of some stupid joke; but isn't that the point?
