In order for me to really like a movie I need to feel some sort of empathy with a character...a, yes...I can understand that, sense of what is going on...frankly I have never had thugs break my arms, beat me senseless, put me on a rack or applied electrodes to various parts of my body...however, I have been to the Dentist.
When Dustin Hofmann has his front tooth drilled through in an effort to extract information, it literally made my spine shiver...now that is pain I understand...then when his torturer leers over him and says..."we need to find a fresh nerve", I knew I would be telling him everything I knew...killed Kennedy? sure I was there...Hoffa? I'm your man...Gold? no problem, I know where the pirates hid it...just put the drill away...
For me this movie has the most horrific torture seen ever filmed (perhaps because I have been in the chair).
If memorability is a criteria for a great movie then this is great because I bet you will remember this movie every time you go to the dentist...for the rest of your life.
