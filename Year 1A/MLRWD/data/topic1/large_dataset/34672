What can I say?  Oh WOW.  I thought the movie was FANTASTIC!!  Vin Diesel did a superb job as the "scum of the earth" punk guy: "I like anything fast enough to do something stupid in." (I love his "Kiss my [...] Scarface" attitude -- it's absolutely insolent and rude... it really fits the basic character at first.)
There were definitely some good one-liners -- there were a... few.... suggestive scenes, but those overlooked, I was amazed at the great preformances and nonstop action.  I found myself crying with Elina, laughing with Xander (Vin Diesel), and getting very close to diving under the couch when he blows up half the gang with his band-aid bombs. Let me tell you -- explosions get LOUD.
Unfortunately, not everyone agreed with my 5 star rating -- my parents were pretty bored with the constant guns 'n bombs attitude -- "finished your pop, finished your snack, finished your dinner finished your tea... have they finished fighting yet?"
The plot was okay.  It was pretty easy: Xander was yanked out of his comfortable punk life and tested several times by the NSA (a secret agent group).  He was then sent into the "real" fight.  He has to infiltrate a Czek terrorist group called "Anarchy '99" on the pretences of wanting 10 cars for an anonymous company.  He does that well, and gets the info -- then the tricky part comes: Going deeper, and figuring out what they're doing without being caught and killed.
He makes friends there, especially the lovely Eilana, the "woman" of the leader of the gang.
One of my many favorite scenes is at the end when Samuel L. Jackson rings up on Xander's computer phone and says that he passed the "test".  I laughed so hard!  I take that as a good sign, as perhaps there'll be a sequel.
"Xander.... Xander, I know you're there -- our GPS picked you up... Good news!  You passed the test!"
I'll leave the rest to you -- BUY it and WATCH IT!!
"You're in the Xander zone now..."
