This movie is a great romantic comedy about a young woman, Sarah, who thinks she has lost everything but in the end realizes she hasn't.  It seems that the young woman starts a whole new life and turns into a different person when she is forced to leave her home in the suburbs to live in the south side of Chicago.

 It seems that she lets the death of her mother take over her mind, body, and soul.  Then when she meets Derrick, one of the boys in her class, he seems to help her overcome her fears and help her start over.  He wants to make her dream come true of attending Julliard, the prestigious dance school in New York City.

 Combining the battle of friendship with romance this movie is unbelievable.
