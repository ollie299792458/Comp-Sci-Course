Having seen this movie when it first came out it was clear to me that time had not dimmed my appreciation for the subject matter.  In the roughly 30 years between the viewings I've had the opportunity to visit the actual Sand Creek massacre site, research the historical record, and gain the advantage of maturity to enable objective examination of the events associated with the sad debacle.  While the first half of the video is speculation, the massacre depiction is actually fairly accurate.  The (actual) 3rd Colorado Volunteers did in fact engage in numerous acts of barbarism, sadism, etc. against women and children (mostly) and the few old warriors left in camp.  The majority of the camp's younger men were away on a food hunting expedition.  So, while there are elements of stereotyping (e.g. the handsome, muscled chief) and the love interest aspect does tend to lull one into feel-gooded-ness, the overall message is delivered quite effectively.  I recommend this to anyone interested in a non-traditional treatment of a sad event in our country's relations with our Native population.
