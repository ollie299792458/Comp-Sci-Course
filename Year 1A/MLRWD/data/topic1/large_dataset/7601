First, I would like to state that I generally like "Traditional" Productions.  Most new takes on a "Classic" don't always work for me.  Yet, every so often a piece is so well thought out by the director and cast that I can honestly say "My eyes have been opened."  This is such a production.  In general it reminds me of the Pre-Nazi Germany of the musical CABARET.  It works for me.  However, what truly raises the "Ante" is an excellent singing and acting cast.  Things in the pit are also great.  The three leads all sing wonderfully and act naturally.  They really dig into their characters.  I also found the Sparafucile another new great bass voice with a sonorous low F.  He also acts credibly. The sets especially in Act III work well.  Damrau, Florez and Lucic are the best we have today for these roles; and are great even when compared to anyone's  ideal of a long past GOLDEN ERA!  A dream Quartet for any era.  Sure it's Modern and creative but it works and works very well with both the music and the libretto.
