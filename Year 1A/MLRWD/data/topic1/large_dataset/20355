First, I have to say that I am an EMT who works the third shift in a large US city.  While this is definitely a fictional work, let me tell you that this film is much closer to reality than you realize.  What strikes me is the characters.  I have lived and worked with people just like everyone that Nicholas Cage's character encounters on the job.  The "I'll fire you next week, I promise" theme is absolutely real, I am not kidding, that IS my boss talking. The partners...John Goodman the "normal guy,"  Ving Rhames the funny partner who wants to go look at hookers, Tom Sizemore the partner who wants to fight a mental patient...I know people exactly like this!! The story about the critically ill patient and his family and getting a bit too involved--it's not quite real to life but I can identify very strongly with it.  And yes, they're ALWAYS on the top floor and you have to carry all your gear up ALL those stairs!!  Finally, the scene where Sizemore just takes a baseball bat to the ambulance, I've always wanted to do that just once.  ;)
So for me, this is like a home movie...I tell people if they want to know what it is like to be an EMT, it is part Emergency!, part Mother Juggs &amp; Speed, and part Bringing Out the Dead.  Buy it, get into its dark philosophy, enjoy the film.
