I will not attempt to describe the plot as this has already been done rather well by a number of people. I will just rave... 12 Monkeys is the most breathtaking piece of recursive temporal symmetry since Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. Perhaps one of the most perfectly conceived and executed movies of all time - up there with Blade Runner and Jacob's Ladder.
While the Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix, 12 Monkeys is necessarily simpler, because of its movie format. Yet the movie generates the same transcendent majesty as the concluding temporal convergence reveals to the viewer that this has been as much a spiritual odyssey as a brilliantly constructed Science Fiction story.
Without giving anything away, the bitter-sweet climax is one of the most stunning and uplifting scenes in the history of the film industry. This total classic and its cast and crew should have won everything in sight. It's way over Joe Wife Beater's head, but any true Sci Fi fan will love it.
