Any negative review on this movie was made by someone who I guess just didn't get it. Sure the pan&scan sucks, so watch it in widescreen. And Danny can get a little annoying at times, but the humor well makes up for it. This movie not only has an interesting premise, but its a satire on the whole action movie genre. Danny telling Jack he can't die until the grosses go down is gold, and if you don't agree then you have no comedic insight whatsoever and this movie is not for you. Other little things as well, Jack's great action hero cliche one-liners, Danny trying to point out to Jack that its impossible for every number in LA to start with 555-, that there are no regular or unattractive women there, or that Jack shouldn't trust Practice since he was a bad guy in Amadeus. If you understand the way movies are, then the comedy in Last Action Hero will leave you laughing the whole way through. I believe this movie is completely underrated, and a big reason I think it tanked at the box office, aside from its humor not being appreciated or completely understood, is everyone went to see Jurassic Park which came out at the same time. Think of the horrible satires we have today: Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans. All of which aren't worth the plastic case they come in. But with satires being so popular now, if this movie were to have come out in theaters now I believe it would have done phenomenal. Definitely worth the watch.
