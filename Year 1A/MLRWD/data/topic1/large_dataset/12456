I had never seen Kyle XY before I stumbled over it, here on amazon.com. After a few YouTube clips, a visit to TV.com, and the recommendation from a few reviews on here, I decided to give the show a try.

Let me tell you, Kyle XY is a great show. Long story short: it's based around a boy (supposedly around 16, though I would guess 20 or more) who wakes up and has no idea who he is. He is taken into a foster home and learns how human behaviour works, etc.

Some bits (such as eating the banana peel with the banana) are entertaining, other things are interesting (like how Kyle develops as a person and learns what is and is not socially acceptable), and others are almost a wake-up call to our daily human behaviour (like why we lie to each other).

The main characters you are focused around are all interesting in their own way.

The only complaint I have is the backstory of who Kyle is and where he comes from. Whilst we obviously need answers for all these questions, I personally prefer the social drama and other storylines of this show.

All the antagonists of this show are cheesy, and not very well written. However, the show only focuses on them for the last few episodes of the season, and there isn't too much time forced upon them.

Hopefully the second season will either quickly answer and move on from all the questions, or have a major re-vamp on the "baddies" of this show.

That aside, if Kyle XY keeps up this quality, I hope it manages to last for many more seasons!
