Amazon.com should make it more clear, that this is not the standard "Ultimate Edition" but the Ultimate Edition (version 2).  These are not the same sets.  Even though reviews and images posted are of the original... THIS IS NOT IT.

The V.2 does not come with the original theatrical version, and is just the "Extended Cut".  On top of that the transfer is so poor, you have a better chance of seeing a higher quality version taped off of a television broadcast from 15 years ago.  The picture is excessively grainy, blurry in most spots, and the colors are faded or washed out.

This belongs in a dollar DVD bin. I thought that for less than[..] on sale, I was getting a bargain... now I feel ripped off. While it may cost close to your standard video rental, it will be watched fewer times.  It's truly sad that such a magnificent movie can't ever be viewed again how it was originally intended to be seen.

My advice... Avoid all Artisan Entertainment products until they can figure out how a movie is meant to be watched.
