Alias is the second best show on television, second only to 24.  The nicely intricate plot twists and gripping action all help to contribute what a fantastic show this is but what really makes this show so special are the performances from a fantastic cast.  In particular, it's the complex and layered relationship between Sydney and Jack and Irina that is really the heart of the show.  That's what the show seems to be about.  That and Sloane's obsessive search for this ramboldi device.  This show has made me fallen for Jennifer Garner.  I love her.  She's amazing. Victor Garber takes what could be a very unlikable character and brings the humanity out of Jack Bristow making him sympathetic.  Lena Olin is wonderful in a very complex role in which we're not sure whether she can be trusted or not but we want to believe her because Olin is so good.  The rest of the series regulars Michael Varten, Bradley Cooper, Ron Rifkin, Carl Lumbley and Kevin Weissman as the lovable but dorky and goofy Marshall, are all exceptional.  This is the second best show on television and has become one of my all time favorites as well.
