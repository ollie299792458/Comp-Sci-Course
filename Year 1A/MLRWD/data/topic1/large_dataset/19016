I had no idea of the magnitude of this film!  I was browsing through my local video store, and since I usually like foreign film, I went to that section, and upon reading the captions about this film, and seeming to remember hearing of it before, I decided to rent it.  I was so happy I did.
This film, while very "heavy", is just so well done.  It beautifully intertwines three different stories, with a car crash being the one thing all the parties have in common.  One party was from the car that crashed, the second party was in the car that got hit by the first, and the third party came upon the crash, and rescued an injured dog in the back seat of the first car.  Dogs play a central role in each of the stories.
What I liked especially about this film was the clever way in which we see the characters from each of the stories "interact", even if only passing each other on the street.  I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who generally prefers "non-Hollywood" films.
