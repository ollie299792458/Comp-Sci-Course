For those who do not respond well to irony and satire, then Heathers is not a film for you. Taking the contemporaneous hysteria over teenage suicide and using it to poke fun at the high school world that more closely resembles reality than John Hughes' films makes for touchy subject matter for those who can't see the irony.

From the invented group "Big Fun" who sing the popular song "Teenage Suicide (Don't Do It)", to the interior monologues of various teen friends as they stand around the coffin of one of their departed (but once hated) fellow students, suicide is used by the narrative for both humour and social commentary. This is not to say that the film encourages teens to consider ending their lives; instead it promotes other ways in which teens who feel victimised in high school can deal with its horrors.

Winona Ryder and Christian Slater in the leading roles were actually teens when the film was shot, and lend a lot of credibility to the film where other teen films fall down with their twenty- and thirty- something casts. The scriptwriting is phenomenal for a teen movie, and this brilliance has probably not been replicated in this genre since. The DVD also includes a great commentary track noting the original ending which was too controversial for New World Pictures to allow to be produced. You can find the script for the alternate ending in the bonus features as well.

Given that New World Pictures (the only studio willing to give the "out there" script a go) went out of business just after the film's release, and the monopoly of the big studios continues, it's unlikely we'll ever see another film quite like it for teens.
