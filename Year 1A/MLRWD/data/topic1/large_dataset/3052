I checked this film out simply because I needed something else in my order to get free shipping.  I knew the movie was well-received and favorably reviewed on most sites, but I had no idea just how good of a film I was about to watch...

First off, the setting... Treasure City.  I love all of the Hindu deities and symbols present through this gorgeous production.  The whole city is a wonderful spectacle full of brilliant, vibrant colors.

The two stars of this production--Black and White--make an interesting family... White is definitely one the most unique characters from any anime I've seen.  Black is trying to take care of White and the city by any means necessary, and White is there helping Black keep it together (in his own way).  As White says during one scene with the police, "I have all the screws Black needs."

If you like watching anime that really stands out as being spectacular, you won't go wrong with Tekkonkinkreet.  Beautiful art, spectacular animation, and interesting characters all come together to create this masterpiece.
