This is an achingly intense and visually stunning movie that has been one of my favorites for years.  The role of Tristan was MADE for Pitt, and Aidan Quinn stands out yet again as the wonderful, versatile, underrated actor he is. Julia Ormond is beautiful and refined in her role as the love interest of all THREE brothers and is painfully convincing as she descends into insanity. Isabel Two is not given much of a speaking role, but I found her to be one of my favorite characters and the actresses that played her as both a child and a woman were lovely. Anthony Hopkins is...well...Anthony Hopkins. He is perfect as the idealistic, knarly old patriarch and his obvious favortism of his middle son explains a lot of what motivates the OTHER two.

As an earlier poster mentioned, the timeline in this movie was a little confusing, and there were a few editing oversights (Brad's hair kept changing in the SAME SCENE), but none of it took away from the breathtaking cinematography and some stellar acting.  I thought the voice-over of the Indian chief was very effective and helped create the 'atmosphere' of the movie. The soundtrack is rich, haunting, and agonizingly beautiful.  The music alone practically hypnotized me. Legends of the Fall is a brutal, beautiful, dark journey into madness that will leave you breathless and emotionally exhausted at the end, but I found it definitely worth the ride.
