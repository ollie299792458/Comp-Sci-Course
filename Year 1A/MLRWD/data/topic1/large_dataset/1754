Slasher movies have a very specific purpose ... and if you enjoy that purpose, you'll enjoy them, not so much despite the fact that they're not all that well made but, in part, because they're not all that well made.  Slasher movies differ from true horror movies in that ... well ... they're not really very horrifying, unless you're VERY easily upset by even the HINT of danger and/or violence.  Slasher movies are, to most people, more silly and/or stupid than horrifying.  They are a very intentional blend of eye candy, danger, fear, violence and gore ... in varying amounts, depending on the target audience and creators tastes ... aimed at tantilizing people with a glancing second hand experience of things forbidden.

SPM is a rather mild example of this genre, at least by my tastes, and wasn't all that tantilizing.  It had it's moments and I did add it to my collection for a time.  Other reviewers go into more details of the plot and some of the compromises made in the production, and I don't see any point in rehashing what's already been said.  My bottom line review of the film ...

a)  If you're in the mood for a rather mild but amusing slasher flick ... this might be just the ticket.

b)  If you hate all slasher flicks ... you'll probably hate this one too.

c)  If you want something really intense ... either a very graphic slasher flick or a true horror flick ... keep looking.

d)  If you want to "study" the genre and be familiar with some of it's milestones, this should be on your list of movies to at least rent.

I don't think there's any right or wrong about this ... just what suits your personal tastes.
