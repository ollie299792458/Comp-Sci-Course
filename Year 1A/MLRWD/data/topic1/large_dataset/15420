This is an excellent film choice when you're wanting endless suspense and terror. This movie is PACKED with it from start to finish. C. Thomas Howell gives a great performance as the naive young man who makes the mistake of picking up a deranged hitchiker in order to keep awake during the lonely, dark, rainy night. Almost immediately after letting the stranger in, he becomes uneasy and suspicious but isn't able to get the guy out of the car until he's forced to choose between life and death. Although he thinks the nightmare is over he soon realizes it's only just begun after witnessing the guy in another car he's passing along the highway. And so begins the cat and mouse game between the two. The wonderful Rutger Hauer delivers one of his best performances as the cold, calculating predator who takes a strange liking to the boy since he was the one who got away. The killer's reasons are never officially revealed but for a few subtle signs such as the wedding band he wears and constant demands to the boy to "stop me", this showing to us his crazed longing to die. He won't do it himself, will not stay imprisoned behind bars, and certainly won't end the madness until his selected pawn destroys him completely. My guess is he was a once normal, happily married man whose world got disrupted tragically and now has nothing to lose since his sanity has already left.
