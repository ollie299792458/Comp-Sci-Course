One of the most inexplicably underrated films in my memory.  It wasn't that "12 Monkeys" didn't get any praise; I saw it during its theatrical run, and the reviews were all generally positive.  But it just never seemed to catch on in the collective consciousness the way it truly deserved.
This is easily as fine a work as Gilliam's earlier "Brazil."  In fact, I like it better.  The most brilliant stroke is leaving so many questions unresolved--you may think you know the answers, and perhaps you do, but all of the loops are frozen a tantalizing fraction from closure.  Who, for example, is the mysterious woman who claims to be in "insurance" at the end?  Haven't we seen her before?  And just what part of the whole experience is in James Cole's head? 
Director Gilliam's unique visual sense is wrapped around the entire puzzle like the most well-fit suit you can imagine.  I honestly can't think of a flaw with this picture; I loved it, and it has a well-earned permanent spot in my collection.  Avoid if you have no interest in a challenge; everyone else should devour "12 Monkeys" like the visual and dramatic feast it is.
