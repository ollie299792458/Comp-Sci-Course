Me and my family are relatively new to opera. I purchased this DVD because of the pink dress on the cover -- I thought my girls would like it. Well, that and I've never heard Renee Fleming.

Honestly, I'd be tempted to give this 4 stars. The staging was nothing special. And some parts were a little flagging. However, the two main characters carry the show easily. It takes a while for Rinaldo (Lawrence Brownlee) to appear. But when he does, he takes over immediately. He is absolutely amazing. I cannot figure out why I haven't heard of him before.

Armida (Renee Fleming) appears before Rinaldo, but it takes Renee a while to warm up to the role. And interestly, you can even see this in the in-between interviews on the disc. In the first interview, she's a little aloof. But in the second interview, she's all there. By the time Act III rolls around, she has a full head of steam and is really into it. Wow!

The music of this opera is really quite nice, too. Much of it is quite pleasant.

On the whole, the performance was excellent. And Lawrence Brownlee gets a standing ovation.
