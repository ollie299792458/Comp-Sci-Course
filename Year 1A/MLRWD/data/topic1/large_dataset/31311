...the FIRST to seasons are Where its AT! If you don't believe me, buy this and find yourself LAUGHING silly for HOURS on end!!
And ...!! Whom-ever thinks the RED Bolloon is funnier Than the PSYCHIC HOTline is a [wrong] and does NOT understand the Mr.show INTELLIGENCE! ...
Ok, so maybe i forgot some of the other points, but i'll make this point crystal clear!
Mr. Show is BEST WHEN WATCHING season one!  There are so many points they make that i just bole over; GIDDY with the GIGGLES!
For instance. When they bring out that guy with the ponytail and the toffutti, he's like my uncle.  he says "WORK IS PLAY!" and i really agree with that point, but the WAY they portray that CHARACTER is so true to life, i just get the FITS! ITS SO TRUE that people are FUNNY LIKE THAT GUY!
another sene i like is whene they have ronnie dobbs run around the streets like COPS! and they pretend he has some weired DISEASE, but they don't go into depth, otherwise the viewer (you, me, the world) would begin to care for him, and he's really NOT one of the GOOD GUYS! he's a CRIMINAL! so i like the way they Portrayed that CAHRECTER! um let me see what else is REALLY GOOD ON SEASON ONE AND TWO of these dvds. THREE TIMES ONE IS FREAKING HILARIOUS!!! if you've ever seen mtv, you'll GET IT! STRAIGHT AWAY! they boy they hit the head STRAIGHT ON with that One! they show that mtv ISNT all it's cracked up to Be! and we ALL learn something. um also .. i don't know the point IM making (crystal clear, remember) is that there's a whole MYRIAD OF FUNNY STUFF ON THIS two dvdS!!
BUY IT NOW!! believe ME!! it's WORth it!! EVEN I LAUGHED at the red balloon scit, but i still think its the low point for that episode.  ENOUGH ABOUT ME!! BUY THIS DVD!! ITS GREAT AND WELL WOETH THE COST!!!
