Hello,
I like Will Smith. I usually like his films. I found both versions of this one lacking, though. The heart of the problem is an incomplete story. It's flawed in its addressing of the infected inhabitants, & in explaining the viral infection. He declares victims as having become completely devolved, w/no higher thought processes left intact. Then they're shown to adapt his own snare equipment in trying to capture him. Even the alternate film, which addresses this flaw somewhat, just doesn't add up. How did the virus go from Cancer cure, to global pathogen? What was the army's involvement? Weaponization? Also, while doing a one actor film is tough. I think the story could've been portrayed better. Incidentally, did anyone else notice the infected leader's strong facial resemblance to the robot in "I, Robot?" I'm betting it was the same digital model of the actor from that film. I was looking forward to this movie. I'm afraid this one disappointed. Oh well. You can't hit a home run every time, right?
