I just watched this movie again and I have to admit, it gets me every time. When I first saw this in the theaters it really effected me. I walked out of the theater feeling very vulnerable. We are all riding on the knifes edge. A small group of people could let a series of circumstances quickly spiral out of control and without a moments warning, we would all perish. This is the world we live in.
 The acting is excellent, everyone sells their characters and I believed I was sitting with the US and Russian Presidents as they furtively decided what to do. It is terrifying to think of how many Generals actually want war and try to push (both) Presidents towards conflict.
The main "event" was bad enough, but to me, when the Russian bombers fired on our aircraft carrier, I just gasped. This is war. Right here, right now, THIS is the end. Russian military hardware firing at American hardware? That's the END, people. Right here, right now. Today. Did you want to live past today? Too bad! Final stop, everyone gets off.
The story is complex and well written. There are a dozen things happening at once and everyone is great at their part. I liked how even when world events were accelerating the CIA team was piecing together names, shipping manifests, signatures and financial records tracking communications, money, travel, piecing together the details of what was happening and who was really behind it.
The most chilling part of this story was the look on the Russian Presidents face when his generals told him that the B2 Stealth Bombers were airborne. Ever wonder what it's like to stare in the the abyss? To stare death straight in the face? That's the look.
