There have been only three movies which were so bad that I walked out of the cinema during the show:  Two of the Batman ones and Mumford.  The first two for terrible acting, screenplay, ...; and the latter out of pure boredom.  I would not have left during Swing Vote, however, because I would have been sound asleep halfway through.

I borrowed the DVD from our local library so there was no cost except lost time.  (If you decide to see the movie, by all means don't spend money on it.)

There were only four parts I liked:
1)  The introduction of the term "insourcing."  (As defined by Kevin Costner:  Importing Mexicans to do jobs for lower pay.)
2)  Bud's daughter sneaking into the polling site to exercise her father's right to vote.
3)  During Bud's speech, the letter he read about the family with two parents working and not being able to afford to live in this country.  (...which probably resonated with most viewers.)
4)  When Bud enters the voting booth.  (Finally!)

I have to echo others' comments about the superficiality of the characters, etc.  But, I was also bugged by the over-the-top presence of special interests like Planned Parenthood and Sierra Club, as well as moronic mouthpieces like Maher and  Matthews.  I would have preferred a more generic approach, but this wasn't a make-or-break deal.
