I loved Harold and Kumar in 3d, i will order this movie on Blu-Ray as 3d.

But... everyone needs to know the movie studios have changed things.  gone are the digital copies compatible with itunes.  many of us have put lots of movies into our itunes on our computers, even shared on the home network so i can use on my apple tv's around the house and keep everyone happy.

Now enter Ultraviolet, the movie studios competition to itunes.  Which i understand Apple has a closed system.  Would it be terrible to get apple to finally open up?  Ultraviolet is closed also to stupid app's.  there are no compatible set top boxes or more.  and if you dont stream a movie within 3 years of authorizing it, you can't keep it.  Ultraviolet is a stupid system no where are capable as itunes.

do your own research....  Movie studios ought to offer a version of the movie just as a stripped down BD in HD and let people save the $ on the handicapped digital copy that is hard to use and limited in capability.
