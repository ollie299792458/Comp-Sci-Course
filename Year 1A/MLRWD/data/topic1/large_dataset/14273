In 1975 or 1976 I saw this movie 6 times with my friends we could not get enough of this movie. We started our own singing group called ourselves THE SPARKLETS. It was 4 of us everybody wanted to be IRENE CIARA only one of us could play that part. I always would talked to people about this movie only a few people saw it back them. I grew up in NEW YORK CITY and everything was available to us, I could not imagine not going to the movies to see this movie on the big scene. In 1984 when VHS came one of my girl friends had 2 VHS machines she was older than me and she never even heard of SPARKLE so I rented the movie from a local video store gave it to her and she recorded the movie for me she just loved this movie she even kept a copy for herself. Back in 1989 I let another one of my friends watch the VHS tape when she went to return it back to me she had left it in her car and someone stole my movie.I would love to get this movie on DVD now not VHS so I'm waitng for that day to come so I could have have the BEST BLACK CINEMA MOVIE EVER MADE on DVD.  ALMOST 50
