We just watched this film again the other night, and I was amazed at just how powerful it remains.  There's nothing amiss here--Peter Weir has made one of his best films (from a great portfolio), and the actors have given extremely intense performances that make everything here work.
Probably the most important aspect of the film, though, is the treatment of the fear of death and the difficulties involved in having "cheated" death.  The movie makes us ask ourselves, "How would I feel if I survived something that should have killed me?", and of course, there really is no answer.  How would I look at the world after surviving a plane crash?  How petty and unimportant would all of my everyday trivia become?  How difficult would it be to be around people who still found the trivia to be important?  Max is faced with life after having cheated death, and life no longer makes as much sense to him now that his fear of death--his fear of losing things--is gone.
The greatest strength of the film, though, is that it doesn't give us a condescending view of the trivial things that we see as important, but treats with respect those things that give meaning to our lives and help us to go on.  And all this is accomplished in a very watchable way, with characters that we can care about and a story that keeps our interest with seemingly little effort.  This is well worth the time it takes to watch it--several times.  Hopefully, they'll release a widescreen version someday.
