Seriously the first 30-45 mins. started strong.  I thought if the movie kept going with the storyline that these vampires came from outerspace that this was going to be great. I thought this movie was going to be one movie that you saw as a kid, but through the course of life forgot about. It started interesting where the vampires sucked the life out of a hand full of people. Those people in turn sucked the life out of others to regain life they had lost, and so on.

It was about half way through the movie I became confused.  When I get confused it's hard for me to move past my confusion, so, the ending also had me at a lost. It was honestly like someone came up with a new idea for the movie, and literally changed the direction half way through the film. Now the vampires were evil spirits that possessed their host bodies.  The vampires would leap from one body to another, with the previous host body showing no sign of being possessed.  They kinda had a reaction as if they had pass out or something. Besides that they physically seemed ok.

Like I said when I get confused it can be hard to focus on the rest of a movie.  again it was like the director or writers changed the plot to the movie.  Now when the vampires attacked someone, that person changed into a zombie like thing. I just wish they would have kept going with how the movie started. It seemed like it was going to be your typically vampire movie. The vampire attacked someone, that person becomes one and attacks, and so on.  overall i believe the movie deserves a few watches to fully understand and enjoy.
