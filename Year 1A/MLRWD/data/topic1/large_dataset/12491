This movie will not appeal to most casual, modern movie fans, lacks the technology for believable CGI effects that most younger audiences would eb accustomed to and the thing I noticed most was that Argento seemed to be obsessed with having women's heads go through broken glass. (Yes, it was to an excessive extent, in my opinion).

However, as a collector of Connelly's works, this is a must have! If you like classic horror and films that do actually have storylines and can ignore the more primitive effects such as swarms of insects painted directly onto the film media, you will want to get your hands on this rare find before it ends up being completely unavailable! The commentary even mentions that this was the film in which Connelly had an accident that required surgicly reattaching one of her fingers. If you want to find out the details, you'll have to get this and watch the commentary carefully.

Like Knut Kristiansen mentioned in a review above, I too am still wishing Opera and some others will someday be re-released (as well as the unrelated "Seven Minutes in Heaven" featuring Connelly, but only available on VHS and possibly degraded from age of the magnetic media).
