There are very few films that I truly came away from stunned. Fight Club was one. English Patient was another. Films that pushed the boundaries, did things differently and refused to conform to cliched and predictable Hollywood movies. Films that lean away from mere entertainment and more towards art. Without a doubt, American History X is one of these films.
The storyline follows Daniel (Edward Furlong) and his older brother Derrick (Edward Norton). Both are restless white skinheads who are part of a neo-nazi skinhead gang. The plot unravels Derricks penchant for leadership while Daniel looks up to him in awe. Filmed in both colour and black and white, this is very powerful film-making backed up by powerful performances.
Much of the story holds a message, which is one that I'll leave for you to find out yourselves. It looks at racism, both from whites and blacks. It looks at those who look past the colour of someone's skin or hold no grudge for prejudice that another man holds. It looks at family and role models. It looks at the unnecessary anger that a whole generation of people can have.
This is a powerful and impressing film that everyone should see.
