I've always been an admirer of Edgar Allan Poe and I include his works in most of my literature classes, so I was excited, but a little wary of this movie at first.  When I read about John Cusack portraying Edgar Allan Poe, I wasn't sure that he would be able to pull it off, don't get me wrong, Cusack is a decent actor but Poe is special, at least he is to me, so I wasn't sure he could rise to the challenge.  I'm happy to report that he did a good job in this movie, I enjoyed it very much.
The story was interesting and exciting that held my attention until the very end.  I kept thinking that this story fits nicely with what little we know about the last mysterious days of Poe's life.
I also liked hearing the little bits and pieces of Poe's actual works that were peppered throughout the story especially "Annabel Lee" which is one of my favorites (and that of lots of my students!)
I'm not sure if it is historically accurate or if that really mattered to this movie, but it was certainly entertaining and fun to watch so pop some popcorn, turn the lights down low to create the right atmosphere, and watch this movie!
