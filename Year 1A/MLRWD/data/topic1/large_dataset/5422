Not just that, but I'm a guy.  I enjoyed Devil Wears Prada (OK, so shoot me) and was surprised to discover that this "real" look at Vogue is just less interesting.  I know all about Anna's reputation, but you never get a feel for her in this documentary.  Either she doesn't have much to say by nature, or isn't very self-analytical, or just isn't that interesting a person.  We basically learn she has a daughter who wants to be a lawyer.  When we see her in action at work, making decisions left and right involving people's careers and lives and fortunes in an arbitrary fashion, I just kept thinking well this is probably how just about every CEO in America operates.  When you've got the power, you don't need to justify your decisions - you either like it or you don't, and everyone else is there to carry out your mandates.  In fact Anna is so uninteresting after a while that the filmmakers ultimately end up making a film that's more about Grace Coddington, who we are supposed to admire for her backstory and her photo shoots.  But in her own way she's just as stubborn and opinionated as Anna, doesn't make her right or wrong, it just shows how arbitrary the fashion business is.  Again, probably like almost every other business.

Speaking now as a guy, I have to say I was surprised that the world of fashion mags isn't full of fantastic looking ingenues spending way too much of their income and time on appearances.  I've been to ad agencies where the staff looked and dressed better than these folks, and they're in the business!  And I never would have believed that a character like Andre Talley existed until I saw him - now THAT at least lived up to the hype of a Vogue lifestyle.
