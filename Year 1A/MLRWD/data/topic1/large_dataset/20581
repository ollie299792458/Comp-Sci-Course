When I saw this movie, I wanted to see it again and again, it was so good. This movie made me cry, and frecked me out a bit. Some parts were funny others were intese. For those people out there who always read the critics reveiws first before going to the movies, and don't see what they intened on seeing, don't always take someones word for it that what you always read isn't true. Because this movie did not desverive two stars it desverived more than that, like five or more. Kevin Spacey, I thought desvrivered an oscar for his performace I thought this movie was that great. Kate Winslet was great too, she did a really fantastic job. It's hard trying to make the audience really believe the actors that they are really this people in the movie, and in this movie I really thought that I was with these people on a mission to find the truth, seeing thier lives. Great acting should take you away completely from reality, this movie did. I highly highly recomend this film to anyone who is a fan of the actors, director, the story. You'll love it, but be carefull don't watch this film to many times because it's a tear-jerker deffenatlly.
