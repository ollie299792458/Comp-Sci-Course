I owned "Michael Jackson - History on Film vol. 2" for years.  I've always wanted to get the second installment, but never did for one reason or another.  When Michael died, I knew it was time.

I watched it for the first time tonight, and I'm very bitter about two things.  "Thriller" and "Beat It"'s videos were repeated on vol. 2 when they already appeared on vol. 1.  I wouldn't have minded a live version or either video, or maybe a "making of".  I was disappointed for their repeats, when there were several videos that could have taken their place, like "Dirty Diana", "Keep it In the Closet", "Leave Me Alone", etc. that would have been splendid.

Having said that, there are three points of highlight that makes this DVD worthwhile: the 1995 MTV Music Awards performance (OMG) and "Scream", which in its day was the most expensive video ever made, and the only one Michael did with Janet.  Last but not least, the first public performance of the moonwalk, on Motown's "25: Yesterday, Today and Forever", which rumored that MJ wasn't intending on performing in originally.  Aren't we glad that he did?

Make sure you know what you're getting before purchasing.  For my money, I would have bought vol.1 only.

6.  Smooth Criminal (not in its entirety... I could have sworn there was a whole nother part of this video that's missing)
7.  1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance
8.  Thriller (the other repeated video in question)

Side 2:
1.  Scream
2  Childhood
3.  Earth Song
4.  You Are Not Alone
5.  They Don't Care About Us
