I never got the chance to see the X Files when it aired originally. I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.
