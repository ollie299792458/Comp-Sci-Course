I purchased this disc and settled in to enjoy a recap of one of my favorite zombie movies and WOW - did I ever enjoy the added scenes and alternate ending!  NOW the sequel makes MUCH more sense to me - I detested it the first time around and haven't even seen the third of the trilogy - now I have both on order and can't wait to get my hands on them.

One of the points that "people" miss--and I use quotes because I do believe this type of film has its female fans, but the game and the movie by and large is "consumed" by a predominantly male audience--is that this is not only a very, very fun action/zombie flick, but with a powerful female action heroine.  I'm seeing this more and more in movies and as a female person, I am thoroughly enjoying it.  Resident Evil is one of the leaders of the pack in this regard.  I am compiling a collection of videos that are not only great movies, but have great female leads.  I've been waiting for this trend all my life; someone to identify with in a film who isn't a screaming victim!  THANK YOU CAPCOM!
