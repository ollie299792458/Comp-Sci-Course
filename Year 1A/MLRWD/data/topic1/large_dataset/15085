Ah, Evangelion.  As almost every other anime fan out there, I saw this series years ago and instantly fell in love with it.  So I was obviously looking forward to the (oft delayed) DVD release.  So how does it rate?  Pretty well.  ADV has taken many steps to "localize" the show  even further than it already had.  Notes and papers that flash up on the  screen have been translated completely from their Japanese into English.  The "giant kanji title bars" of the VHS version have been  scrapped in favor of subtle appearing text.  While I appreciate the effort,  I'm not sure why Gainax authorized this, and I could do without it.  The  english voices are decent.  Being the only anime-fan who's watched the  entire series dub, I can assure any fans that the acting only improves as  the series progresses. The video quality isn't bad, despite what I've been  hearing.  I actually remember feeling that the VHS quality was substandard  in the original recording, with off-center title bars and the like.  That  quickly became part of Eva's charm, and I'm glad that it's been retained,  really.  It isn't bad, it just hasn't changed.  I did spot a few DVD  transfer errors in this disc--choppy frames or skipping flashy parts.  Hopefully ADV's DVD editor will pay a bit more attention in subsequent  releases.  Evangelion is a masterpiece, and should be experienced by  everyone, anime fan or not.  Its broad, sweeping scope and tragically real  characters elevate the series to a plateau of excellence.  I'm glad I have  an excuse to watch it all again (and again...in four languages!) So if  you've never had the pleasure of seeing Eva before...why haven't you  already bought the disc?  Do it now! If you've already gone through it  all...I would recommend giving serious consideration to the DVD  release--afterall, it'll last forever!  Just..keep the VHS version around  to introduce newbies to the full impact.
