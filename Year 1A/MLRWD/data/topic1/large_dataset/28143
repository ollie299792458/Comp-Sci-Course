This movie is fantastic. You don't really realize how great it is until after its over though. It is a great story. A Catholic Boarding School teacher falls in love with her female student. That's right, it is about lesbians and homosexuality. However, if you are just looking for "lesbian action" don't waste your time with this, its not a sex movie. If on the other hand, you are mature enough to handle such a plot, you'll love it. So after an hour of the student pursuing the teacher and the teacher being wary and afraid to be with her.....well I can't tell you how it ends. What I will say, though, is why it is so great. It does not openly debate, discuss, or point out anything about homosexuality being right, wrong, good, or evil. What it instead does is tell a wonderful tale of romantic, yet forbidden pursuit, and no matter what your stance is on homosexuality in general, you cannot help but hope for a happy ending, and get wrapped up in this love drama. After the movie is over, you think of how bittersweet the story is and poor this and at least that and then it hits you - You have been focusing on love, passion, heartache, and beauty....but NOT about Straight or Gay relationships. That's the beauty of this film. It captures you into a world of pure love drama and you forget that it is about a controversial subject at all. Regardless of your stance in this controversy, all you can focus on while watching is a love story between two human beings. Watch it, you'll love it.
