AND IT'S IN TECHNICOLOR!
Why hasn't MGM/WB and Ted Turner made a definitive version of this classic on DVD? This movie competed against "Gone With The Wind" in the 1939 Oscar race. For the love of Richard and England, just look at the cast to see why; and just watch the movie to see what great movie-making is all about.
A script that begins in frame one and doesn't let up until the final credits roll; a cast that was almost everybody who was anybody &lt;who wasn't working on GWTW {with the exception of Olivia deHaviland> in Hollywood at the time; a score that UNDERSCORES the action wthout overpowering it; and a final version that is among the most arguabaly perfect motion picture ever made.
My title of this review asks "Does it get any better?"
The real question is "Has it ever been DONE any better?" This is a violent movie. Lots of people die from a well-placed arrow. Yet the blood and gore is non-existant, although the point is well made. There's love and romance romping through the greenwood, yet all the performers are fully clothed, but erotic gets a new meaning when Flynn ascends to deHaviland's chamber, and they make love standing up, fully clothed, but you don't miss a whit of what's REALLY going on!
This is cinematic story telling at it's finest! A beginning, a middle, and an end, with a climax that will rattle the rafters!
Buy it. Watch it. Love it.
You can't go wrong.
