Over-rated? Cliche? Confusing and tiring? Then you just might be one of those lucky, run-of-the-mill suspense flicks that refuse to cease its pounding on Hollywood's door! Come down to the local video store today to find yourself that special spot on the rental shelf, next to "Last House on the Left," and "Jeepers Creepers," today!

Director Matthieu Kassovitz's intentions were the noblest, Halle Berry pushed as hard as her abilities would allow, as did the most part of the supporting cast, but 'Gothika' has several flaws worth considering.

What do films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "The Haunting," "Jason Goes to Hell," and "Bride of Chucky," have in common? They're uninspired, trite crowd-pleasers. Emphasis is placed on the gore and creepy atmosphere instead of the acting quality and polishing the plotline.
Scripting is fair, if not somewhat raw, but Downey Jr.--as the skeptic shrink associate opposite Berry--(in this reviewer's opinion) could have shown a bit more skill.
 The secondary caracters, considering the compact amount of cellophane they were given, proved good stock characters, but that's the weakness, anyway. Berry reveals her intriguing versatility as the misunderstood psychologist, Miranda Grey, proving a great upcoming role before her plummet into the calamity of 'Catwoman.'

One can be thankful, to say the least, that an excellent score, masterfully crafted by the one and only John Ottman, boldfaces and holds true to the [overdrawn] haunting themes--a surprise, considering he previously scored Halloween H*20 in '98.

On the whole, though folks, we can thank God (and Kassovitz, for that matter) that the gore was kept at a somewhat minimal level, remaining a suspense/drama flick and not insulted to the horror genre at Berry's expense. Average. Not profound, or "icily chilling," (Sorry, Siskel and Roeper) but subtely average.

Rented it, liked it a little, flushed it,
