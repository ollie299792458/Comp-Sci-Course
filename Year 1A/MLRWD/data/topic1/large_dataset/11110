"The Frighteners" is one of those movies that has you exasperated at the finish, but smiling from ear to ear! This movie has it all! Great story...incredible action...awesome special effects...great characters! Zemeckis crafts a brilliant screenplay with wonderful actors in out-in-leftfield roles. I don't want to give away the movie's plot because getting through it is so much fun. You'll jump, laugh, and gasp! I've shown this movie to many people and every one has liked it. Zemeckis must have really liked this movie because the digital effects are astounding along with Zemeckis' trademark jaw-dropping shots. Also, the ending sequences are absolutely incredible. Filmed in unbelievable fashion, they leave every moviegoer asking how he did that. Once again, can't tell you why (it would ruin the end). There are so many richly-drawn supporting characters, it is impossible to name them here. All of them add their own magic to the ensemble. 
For those inquiring about the quality of the disc, let your fears subside. The picture is very clear and natural looking. The colors wonderful and natural. The Dolby Digital soundtrack is thunderous and very impressive! Every sound is rendered cleanly with monsterous LFE channel support. It is truly an impressive reproduction of this movie. The disc does contain a few cast/crew bios and some production notes, but they are not the grade of some of New Line's extras. Still, the disc stands out for it's impressive presentation of its feature. 
I hope everyone discovers this little gem. It makes for great movie fun and will be great addition to any DVD library! Get a hold of this DVD! You will be entertained!
