This is a must-have item for anyone who loves watching Gene Kelly as I do.  SINGIN' IN THE RAIN was the high point of his career and also put Debby Reynolds, Donald O'Connor and Cyd Charisse on the map to be noticed for more important roles in the future.

The quintessential musical, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN seamlessly moves from story to musical numbers, from humor to romance, and shows the brilliance of Gene Kelly and others in the "Freed Unit," the name affectionately given to those who worked closely with producer Arthur Freed--the only producer who was given free reign at MGM by Louis B. Mayer during that magical time.

If for no other reason, this movie gives you a chance to see Gene Kelly's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN number on a sprinklered, tarp-covered backlot street.  Although technically not his best or most spectacular, it is certainly his most memorable for the sheer exhuberance he shows over being in love.  You can't watch it and not smile.  As Leonard Bernstein said when he first saw the number, "That is an affirmation of life."  Truer words were never spoken and, even today, that number and the rest of the movie feel as fresh and enjoyable as they were 50 years ago.

Regarding the 50th anniversary edition--there are many special features worth having, the best being the documentary on Disc 2 called WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING, a documentary on the making of this fantastic movie.  Other features include a documentary on Arthur Freed and his many contributions to songs and musical pictures over the years, as well as older footage showing the original film debuts of the songs from SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, all of which were written and showcased in the 1930's, with the exception of Donald O'Connor's showstopping number MAKE 'EM LAUGH.

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a classic among classics.  It is a culmination of Gene Kelly's choreography and performance, Donald O'Connor's comedic skills, Debby Reynolds' charm and innocence, Stanley Donen's directorial skills, Arthur Freed's production abilities, and Comden and Green's collaborative genius that will stand the test of time.  The commentary consists of comments by Debby, Donald, Cyd, an Arthur Freed biographer, and Baz Luhrmann (director of MOULIN ROUGE.)  Enjoy it then share it with someone else and enjoy it again!
