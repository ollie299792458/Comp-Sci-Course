Having watched the first three seasons, as well as the first two pilots, a few notes: The original pilot, co-starring Valerie Curtin and Suzanne Zenor as the female roommates(Jenny and Samantha) has the same premise as the series pilot "A Man About The House" although several pieces of dialogue are different as well as the characters' names.(John Ritter's Character is named David Bell, and Mr. Roper's first name is George). Also, the script for the second episode "And Mother Makes Four" is nearly identical to the second pilot co-starring Joyce DeWitt as Janet and Susan Lanier as Chrissy. Also in season one, Richard Kline makes his debut as Larry Dallas with a small guest part in the episode "No Children No Dogs." Although it was at first only intended to be a guest part, Larry would eventually become a regular character at the request of John Ritter. In season 2, the laughter continues with the season opener "Ground Rules," a hysterical bedroom scene in "Strange Bedfellows," the series' only holiday episode, and a guest appearance by Loni Anderson. John Ritter, you are greatly missed!
