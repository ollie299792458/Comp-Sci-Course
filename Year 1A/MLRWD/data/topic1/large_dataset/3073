Season five of "Alias" was incredible. It supplied not only some of the best independent episodes, but also the best season-spanning arc since season 2. Great twists, excellent acting, and mile-a-minute writing make this season an absolute must-have.

Memorable episodes include:

"Prophet Five" - The world of Alias is completely shaken up. A major death, a major shock, and a brand new enemy are all introduced.

"Mockingbird" - A great introduction for the new characters, as well as great story for the regulars.

"The Horizon" - Sydney and Vaughn reunite as the series sends us one of their biggest shocks ever.

"Maternal Instinct" - Sydney, Jack and Irina are together again. Enough said.

"30 Seconds" - Great writing, and a return for Nadia's character, as well as at least 3 jaw-dropping moments.

"All The Time In The World" - Rambaldi's endgame comes together as Sydney and the gang take their last stand against the evil that has been among them all along...

A must have for all fans. The final season brings us back to basics... it's well worth the cost!
