When I saw Das Boot, the Director's Cut, I knew it was the best submarine movie ever released, the best war movie, and one of the best dramas, and I've watched it maybe thirty times. I don't even need the English subtitles any more. But there was a nagging sense that certain character developments just came our of nowhere, like the crew's antipathy to Lt Werner, and I always thought the captain's persona was a little sketchy. No more. All the nagging questions are resolved, all the scenes that seems to have come out of nowhere, and a certain disjointedness in the way the story developed, all resolved. Das Boot, uncut, develops slowly enough for us to really get to know these men, their lives, their loves. We see the Captain interacting with his Junior officers; we see the teacher, and the friend, as well as the leader. We hear the raunchy talk among the seamen. Add to that the superb narrative overvoice by Lt. Werner, and we not only see, we smell the cramped interior of that boat, the sweat, the stench of diesel, the overwhelming constant dampness. The boredom becomes palpable. We learn that that the crew isn't as united as the Director's Cut leads us to believe. And there's more. The translation used in the English sub titles is much more accurate. The soundtrack has more detail, more of the industrial noises of submarine life. It's a revelation. If you're a Das Boot fan, you must see it uncut.
