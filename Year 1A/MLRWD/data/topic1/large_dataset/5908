enter the dragon was bruce lees first big budget hollywood film and sadly the only one cause he died a few weeks after it was finished and never got to see how much people loved it during filming of enter the dragon he would pass out during some of the final scenes in the room of mirrors and he would go home and take pain pills and he told some friends he had nightmares that he would die soon so he went and had a lightning rod put on his house(in asian culture it wards off demons) and oddly enough it had blown off in a storm just days before his death anyway in enter the dragon us agents want bruce lee to penetrate an island fortress thats producing opium and stop the evil bad guy the only way he can get there is by accepting an invitation to a fighting tournament they hold there so he sets off to stop the evil badguy this movie has some incredible martial arts like bruce lee using the nunchukus so fast they had to refilm the scene 3 times and bruce lee really getting mad at an actor on the set who was jealous of him and he decided to really kick him in the scene and he kicks the guy so hard the man catching him breaks his arm this entire movie has a kind of magic in the air you really sense coming death in this film and you really sense this guy was special he isa legend and if alive today he would have adapted like he always did and mastered ground fighting i get tired of hearing hewas great for his time but todays fighters would take him to the ground such statements prove you fail to realise why brucelee was great his endless search for knowledge he had mastered almost every form of martial arts back then if defeated by an enemy he would learn his style comeback and defeat him brucelee was also a golden glove boxing champion and could benchpress 260 pounds and he weighed 130 he would do 200 1 handed pushups a day and a 1000 situps before his death he was breaking concrete bricks with his finger tips bruce lee to me is the greatest martial artist alltime hes the legend
