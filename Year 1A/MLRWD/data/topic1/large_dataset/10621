What a tedious film. I bought this film thinking it would be interesting - and I love a mystery. It took me a while to figure out the characters are in HS because there is never a scene that takes place in class.  What was that theater group about? And that strange Halloween party with the cryptic "performances" - where did that take place? Some rich kid's house with the parents gone?

Half the time I could not hear, let alone understand the use of English...if it was English. After the first 15 minutes, I started fast forwarding through the movie and just watched the scenes. You can pretty much get the idea of this movie without hearing a single word. It was like a bunch of young Californites with too much money and time on their hands decided to make a film that would piss of their parents.

The main antagonists in the movie are masochists doped out on lithium or pot - maybe both. The only parent is portrayed as an oblivious  "Leave it to Beaver" pleaser.  The only other authority figure is a vice principal who comes across as narcotics detective negotiating with his street contact. I hate to imagine meeting any of the characters portrayed in this film. I obviously do not fit into the category of audience that this film targets. Thank goodness I only paid $3.00 for it at the local Big Lots.
