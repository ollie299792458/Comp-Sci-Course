This is a fun movie, which suffers after a couple of viewings.  Three subplots work together to show different aspects of life in both bear and gay culture: Obese Michael wants to undergo lapband surgery but his chubby-chaser novio Carlos stands against this move; stable couple Fred and Brent consider spreading their love around; and young Tyler (with his fey friend Simon flitting about as a foil) yearns for hairy love with the A-gay, Uber-bear Roger, who also wants to claim Tyler as his own, but some large handsome fellow always intervenes at crucial points in their mutual chase.  Fred and Brent are the most realistic, with natural dialogue and genuine, harmonious interactions.  But this cozy tableau will not sell film festival passes.  Michael's desire to strangle his stomach is understandable, but in the end he decides not to do so, because he rejects "society's narrow definition of beauty."  I found myself asking about biology's narrow definition of health, considering that Michael is pushing 400 pounds.  He does not concern himself with diabetes, high blood pressure, and joint destruction, because he has Carlos. In the end we grin at the "Aw, shucks" romance of Tyler and Roger, but the likelihood of it either coming about or surviving seems pretty slim.  Tyler is supposedly 21 years old, but he is completely emotionally actualized and wise, dispensing apothegms and bon mots, while Roger is willing to drop his doggish ways for true love.  A man of his age would have deeply embedded habits and instincts; in real life, he would need a couple of years of abstinence to become a man who is able to settle down.
