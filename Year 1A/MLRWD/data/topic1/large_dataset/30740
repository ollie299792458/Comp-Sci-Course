First time I saw it was in 1981, at a small theater; I had managed to talk a visiting friend(s) to go with me.  The theater had some folks dressed up as "The Dream Police" (talk about a flashback!) who were actually policing the line of Rocky Horror fans.  Great kitschy movie, I have to say.  I just recently found it at Walmart for $5.00.  The extras are great, but if I have to quibble - the DVD-ROM portion does not work.  Okay, so pick at me because I like downloading screensavers and playing the silly games. The DVD-ROM portion wanted me to download/install something called "PCFriendly."  Well, it doesn't work and any of the players to download to even attempt to get it to work are major trouble (FYI - stay away from those!).  I just want the DVD-ROM features!  Perhaps I am not computer savvy enough - sigh.

That said, the hints on when to "interact" are great.  As for the footage of the fans, it seems hit or miss.  Some is great; some looks like just some random goof in the audience filming on his camcorder; but, I suppose if one wants to imagine what it would be like being in the audience, one could give it a pass.

If one just wants to watch the movie and have hints when to interact? It's great! If you want an evening of silliness and can enjoy the whole kitschiness of it all, get your popcorn, newspaper, squirt guns, etc, and have a blast!
