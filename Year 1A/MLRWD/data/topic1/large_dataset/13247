"...no denomination has nailed it yet, because they are all (organized religion, that is) too self-righteous to realize it's not what you have faith in, it's that you have faith," says the muse, Serendipity, played by Salma Hayek, which spells out what this movie is all about.  That and the fact God has a sense of humor, and is canadian, hehe.  
  At the first part of the movie a warning appears which basically says do not take this film seriously.  Unfortunately, some people thought different and took it very seriously, basically saying that God would never have a sense of humor and  they protest it.  These people need to wake and smell the comedy, because this movie is funny. witty, and very entertaining. It is about two angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) who have been banished from heaven (for reasons that will be explained in the movie) and must live out the rest of human history in Wisconsin, which I guess is worse than hell, ask the Metatron, played by the ever-talented Alan Rickman.  
  UNfortunately, these two angels have found a loophole in Catholicism, which would let them back in to heaven.  But if this happens the world will end because it will prove God wrong and God is supposed to be infallible.  So the metatron tracks down the last scion (the last living relative of Jesus) played by Linda Fiorentino, and with the help of the 13th apostle (Chris Rock), which the bible failed to mention, and Jay and Silent Bob(Smith and Mewes), they head towards Jersey to stop the angels. It is a comical trip through with dialogue so funny, you may get whip-lash.  Also, a welcome part from George Carlin as a Cardinal, not to mention that Jay and Silent Bob play bigger roles compared to previous films (Clerks and Chasing Amy). GRADE: A-
