Everyone has their opinion; mine is that the darker, more serious JCVD movies like this (U.S. regeneration), Cyborg, and Sudden Death tend to be his best. There's no doubt the second Universal Soldier movie with Bill Goldberg was just a joke and doesn't fit in with the amazing original and this latest intallment, which would be just as good as part 1 if Dolph Lungren were in it for more than a total of about 5 or 10 minutes.  If you liked the character and feel of part 1, then do yourself a favor and pick this up because it feels like it picks up after a LONG pause since the first one - as if the joke of part 2 never happened.  Yes, Van Damme is getting old but he still looks fierce in this; acts and appears just like a 50 year old zombie on steroids would.  I was very skeptical about this one but after watching my friends copy and having the price drop down to a reasonable $9, I just bought it.  It is undoubtedly one of the four best action movies to come out in the 2000's along with Ong Bok, The Protector, and Rambo 4.
