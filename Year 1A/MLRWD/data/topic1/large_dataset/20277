This is definetely a film I'll watch again and again. I'm too old for most Disney movies, but this one is brilliant. It's not just or even mainly for little kids, as it's got a lot of complicated ideas in it which will probably be lost with them. Mulan follows the story of China being invaded by the Huns and a Chinese girl, Mulan, dressing up as a boy and going to war in her father's place because he is too old to fight. This is treason and if she is found out she will be killed.  The film is a mix of humorous, sad and dramatic parts which works really well, and there is barely a dull moment; my list of 'favourite parts' covers almost the whole film, the only part that drags a bit is with the ancestors' spirits, as it just seems to lag a little there, with Mushu the only one being really funny. All the songs are great, the best ones that come to mind are 'Reflection.' and 'The Girl we're Fighting For.' but all the others are good, too. Mulan is a very strong character matched only, I think by Pocahontas in Disney films, but I prefer Mulan. The animation is also  stunning, the scenes at Mulan's house and also in the parade near the end of the film are the best. This is a film I recommend to anyone even if like me you thought you were growing out of Disney films. It beats even my previous favourite,Pocahontas. This film actually lives up to its advertisment as 'a film the whole family can enjoy,' as most Disney films don't.
