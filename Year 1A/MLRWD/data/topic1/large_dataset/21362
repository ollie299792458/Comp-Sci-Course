I recently watched Crossroads again, for the 4 or 5th time, broadcasted by a major network in this instance. I am always amazed at how many of my friends have never seen the movie and just rave about the film when they do get a chance to view the flick for the first time. I am a musician of sorts  and consider the movie as one of my all time favorites. The guitar duel at  the end is a must for all musicians of any kind and should even be  appreciated by part time church organists. Anyone who has ever had any  experience learning to play any instrument can appreciate the incredible  display of guitar mastery demonstrated in this film. 
This film wouldn't  need a plot to please the casual musician.  I am always pleased to hear the opinion of a new viewer, they are always excited about the timeless music recorded for the  film and the neat twist of the plot in the end. I highly recommend this  movie for viewing by anybody with an ear for music, just don't miss the  ending which ties everything together in one of the most entertaining films  of the last few decades. On a par with "Mr. Holland's Oppus" and  "Shine" on the musical-entertainment content scale. 5-stars all  the way!
