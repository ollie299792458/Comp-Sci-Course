This Tornatore venture virtually oozes four decades of atmosphere and is beautifully embellished by punctiliously detailed sets, costumes, and threaded with lush musical themes. The life of a child abandoned on an ocean liner at the turn of the century("1900" played by Tim Roth),is recounted in the present and flashbacks by his friend Max(Pruitt Taylor Vince),an aging, down-on-his-luck trumpeter,to a pawn shop proprietor (Peter Vaughan).
1900's prodigious musical talents are displayed many times, but three instances are outstanding for their humor, drama and melancholy, respectively: the piano "duel" between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton(Clarence Williams III); the rhapsodic pathos of a love theme as 1900 records a wax matrix while absorbed in the angelic face of a young woman outside his window(M&eacute;lanie Thierry), soon to be lost in a crowd leaving the ship--and him--behind; the brightly lilting tune he plays as the brakeless piano rolls about the ballroom in a turbulent sea with Max at his side.
To refer to this story as mere character development understates its value. 1900 symbolizes a man, never having left the confines of the ship, who lives in a defined, finite world and who,though the piano finds infinitude in his imagination and music. Ultimately,however,he must confront the inevitable: to leave the ship for the seeming boundlessness of dry land or die in a state of non-existence. There is no record of his birth and only one recording of his work.
Roth's subtle skills are brought to the fore in 1900' sometimes brilliant,sometimes naive--and always irreverant--character.
"Legend" is fresh and challenging,admixing philosophy and fable into myth. After four viewings, there is always an overlooked detail,expression,or nuance missed previously.I may be satisfied after four more.
