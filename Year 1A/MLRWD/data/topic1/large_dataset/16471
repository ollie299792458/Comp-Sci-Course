This is not a great movie, and it isn't as impressive on video as in the theater, but it works on a number of levels. I saw a packed house applaud this film twice and I think I know a reason why.
Hidden in all the  stupidity (although there are some incredibly well done scenes-- the alien  arrival; the first battle) is a story about a bunch of underachievers  shaking off their problems and saving the day.  You have a President  failing in the polls (Pullman), a fighter pilot (Smith) who repeatedly  fails to make the astronaut corps; an alcoholic Vietnam era fighter  jock(Quaid) who can't do a crop dusting job right; a stripper (nothing  against strippers) who manages to save her family and her dog during the  alien launched holocaust. It's no wonder so many people wanted to see the  aliens lose -- in many ways this movie is about overcoming obstacles.  
This movie also makes real everyone's ultimate fantasy of super aliens  taking on a super power -- probably why the blowing up of the White House  caused such a reaction -- seeing that, you know the battle's on. 
The  message of everyone working together is somewhat lost in the jingoism of  the film, but seeing an Arab/Israeli pilot team  kind of brings home the  message.  It is a silly movie, but at its heart it connects with people's  optimism.  Most movies today are more cynical, so it's interesting that  this one works.  Enjoy it.
Also, much has been said about the inability  of the laptop to connect with the alien ship-- Goldblum discovers the  alien's use of our satellite system -- according to the movie they had  already made THEIR system compatible to ours. Well, it's possible, anyway.
