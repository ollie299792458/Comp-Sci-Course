There are two types of Coen brothers movies.  There's when the Coens decide to challenge the analytical part of the mind (Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing, The Man Who Wasn't There) and there's the lighter side of the Coens (O Brother Where Art Thou, Raizing Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy).  
This, my friends, is the latter.
And in my humble opinion....their funniest movie to date!
Yes, this means that I'm ranking it above O Brother (which is, according to Joel C., "the most expensive three stooges movie ever made").  What, you don't agree?
Okay, let me put this straight.
Well, there's The Dude.  And you may not realize it, but he is a private detective in the leanest sense of the word, pure base concept here...but make no mistake, he is a true gumshoe in the likes of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe.  Here he is, just a regular....well, dude.  Minding his own business when two hired thugs break into his apartment thinking he's the Big Lebowski (he's not, but he is named Lebowski) and relieve themselves on his rug...a rug that "tied the whole room together."  Now he isn't going to sit still for that, not after his good friend played by John Goodman goads him.  So he's off to see the Big Lebowski for a replacement rug, but gets caught up in a botched kidnapping and the weirdness ensues.
Here the Coens use every cliche in the old detective noir genre.  The respected politician (who is corrupt underneath his philanthropic veneer).  The local sheriff who disrespects him.  The creepy henchmen.  The seductive mistress.  The humorous sidekick.  The odd bit of tragedy.  The only things missing are fedoras and trenchcoats.
Plus, you get the Coens' hallucinogenic imagery.  The "bowling porno" dream sequence should be considered a moment of new Hollywood legend.  The nude abstract painting of Maude.  The euro-techno freaks and their pet ferret.  
For a few bucks, the price of a movie and popcorn, treat yourself to a movie you're sure to enjoy.
