This is my all-time favorite movie!  My father told me I had to watch it, and when I finally saw it with him, I was blown away!  I kept asking him, "Is this real?  No, really...is it?"

The gist of it is this: Mark Borchardt is an aspiring horror filmmaker that spends a little too much time drinking and dreaming.  He even admits it in one of the best lines of the movie, "...to not just drink and dream, but to create and complete."

Mark is a dreamer, a big one, but that's what makes him so endearing.  He never gives up on his goals, even when he's flat broke and working crappy jobs.  He gets his friends to help him - people that are, for the most part, far from professional actors and filmmakers - and continues on.  He wants - no *needs* - to make it.

One of the greatest things about this movie is its purity.  Mark wants to make it for all the right reasons (he truly *loves* horror movies).  He's honest, determined, and an all-around good guy.  There is little about him that is pretentious or shallow.  He's making art for the right reasons, even if it doesn't come out as good as it could.

The movie is also hilarious!  There are a TON of great lines in it: Mike Shank saying he used to get "really pissed off inside" when he couldn't find someone to drink vodka with, Uncle Bill screaming, "It's all right, its okay!  There's something to live for - Jesus told me soooo!", Mark's kid saying, "Don't bother me, you...you...you FOX!"...

I've must have quoted this movie hundreds of times, and watched it just as much!  I mean it - I went through a period where I would watch this movie everyday!  My friends and I even left a message on Mike Shank's answering machine!

Lastly, it is directed beautifully: the shots of Mark driving...the junkyard...Mark closing-up the cemetery... And the use of Mike Shank's music is perfect!

Great, great, GREAT movie!
