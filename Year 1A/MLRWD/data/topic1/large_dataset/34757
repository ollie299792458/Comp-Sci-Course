i have never seen nine inch nails perform live before, but i've always been pretty familiar with their work.  tonight i viewed this video at my university's movie theatre, but i could have sworn i had a flying seat over the stage and the audience at the actual show.  this is a quality video, with amazing shots of all five band members, the stage setups and lighting, and the energetic audience.  the power of this performance is overwhelming, i even got sucked into the songs i didn't know or recognize.  this video offers many unsung hits and huge favorites from "the downward spiral" and "the fragile."  it was refreshing that in between trent's bouts of madness over industrial guitar and drums, he shared some amazing instrumental tracks from "the fragile" with the audience (including wonderful versions of "la mer" and "complicated").  even though i'm sure there's nothing like being there, i feel like i got an excellent idea of what experiencing nine inch nails is like, and this video is going on my permanent rotation.
