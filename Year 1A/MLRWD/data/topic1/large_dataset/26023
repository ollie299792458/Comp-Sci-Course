Honestly I dont get how anyone could say this movie deserves less than 5 stars.  Its an amazing movie.  I have read the reveiws that were posted before this one and I am shocked that they would say this movie is anything like the Faculty or any other movie of the sort.  For one thing, the Faculty is a very old movie and I think you should let it die down now, and secondly this movie has nothing to do with Faculty.  There are no students being taken over by Aliens, no teachers turning kids to aliens, etc....  If this movie was said to be compared to any other movie it would be American Pie and thats only because its hilarious.  There was nothing about this movie that me or my friends didnt like!  We sat in front of the TV with our eyes glued the whole time!  Honestly I reccomend this movie to anyone, except the people who refuse to stop comparing movies to other movies.  Thats the first mistake you could ever make while watching a film.  So if you want a good life, a bit of a scare and a really fun time go out and buy this movie!  It has everything you could want in a movie including the surprising ending that will leave you wanting more!  Enjoy..!
