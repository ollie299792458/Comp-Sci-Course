It's hard to look at this film on its own, without comparing it to the original film, which is one of the great comedy classics. It's certainly a fun film, with a number of very good songs, a great performance by Nathan Lane, and a good one by Maththew Broderick.

But, it falls short of the original in several areas. The biggest is probably in the character of Leo Bloom. Broderick's performance, while often good, just isn't up to Gene Wilder's manic insananity. Just contrast the scene where Bloom tries to hold onto his blanket. Broderick seems forced; Wilder seems truly nuts (and is much funnier).  (To be fair, perhaps the reality is that Broderick's performance is stagier. There are styles of acting that work very well on stage but don't work as well on screen and vice versa.)

And of course the original Dick Shawn's brilliant performance as over the top actor L.S.D., playing Hitler. (The musical had the the character of the director also play Hitler.)

So, in the end, it's a good 4 star film, compared to the 5 star original.
