I've never really read much of the iron man comic. I limit myself to a few titles because if left unrestrained I would go into debt via comic shop.

So I can't attest to the authenticity of character portrayal. Though friends who do read the comic say it's close enough.

With all that, in my opinion, this movie was a great super hero movie. I really loved the two new Batman movies but have heard some people argue that Begins was a little slow. And while I can see what they're talking about, it didn't seem boring to me.

Meaning: I like that they're doing these origin movies. Iron man could have been a flop but it wasn't. I looked at my watch afterwards and thought, holy crap, that was 2 hours!? There was absolutely no chance to be bored in this film.

The movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. I had my doubts about Downey Jr pulling off the role. And let's be honest, it was Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr. It was a perfect role for him. He made the character believable.

That I didn't realize time had passed is the best compliment I can give this movie. Unlike the Matthew Broderick Godzilla a few years back where I looked at my watch and realized it had only been twenty minutes into my suffering.

My copy of the DVD is on it's way to me so I can't attest to the special features. I'll try and review them when I've watched them.

If you haven't seen this movie, rent it and see. But I don't think you'll be disappointed. Buy it so they'll continue to make movies of this caliber.
