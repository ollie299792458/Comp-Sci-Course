-I got hooked on the Fame TV series when it was actually on TV.  Then in the ninety's, I rented the movie and was shocked by the content, especially Coco's screen test that turned out to be with a porn producer(not overt). But it is a good lesson to better learn through the screen and not in real life. Just having purchased and watched it, I would recommend this to anyone that had aspiring childern; though be it with caution.  One of the things that I noticed was the shell that many of the students found themselves in and how they broke out of it. It is also a good progression of going through the high school years.

-It reminds me of my high school days when I was involved with art[photography] and known as the academic smartass.  I was a frequent award winner and at one of the ceremonies, a person asked how I was able to beat him out.  Never thinking about the other winners, I mentioned that I simply competed with myself, to do the best work that I could put out.  This theme comes through in the movie with the characters, as well.  You may be the best dancer and find that you are in rough competion with yourself regarding academics. It also demonstrates that becoming the best also relies on the other people in your life that break through and make a difference.

-Anyone that enjoys live performance would be interested in this as it illustrates the behind the scenes sacrifice and commitment that performers actually make.  A very enteraining deciption of everyday life and how to get the most out of it.
