Some families make a ritual of watching "It's A Wonderful Life" or "Miracle on 34th Street" each holiday season.  Not ours; our top choice is this hilarious view of one Christmas season in Ralphie's life, as seen retrospectively by him as an adult.
  More a series of picaresques in the life of a little boy who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas than a full storyline, it takes us on a journey through childhood, going from the little brother who must be allowed to eat like a pig to eat at all, to the town bullies and their continual harrassment, to the father who wins a "valuable prize" one day in a newspaper puzzle contest.  Throughout, Ralphie is plotting ways to still get the gift of his dreams, the Red Ryder--"you'll shoot your eye out"-- BB gun.
  Part of the charm of this film is the narration of Ralphie as an adult looking back on part of his childhood, but it also has many universal themes that are so common to kids, no matter what era.  The bullies, the longing for a seemingly unattainable thing, the playground dares, the constant daydreaming--all these are presented in an entertaining fashion that still causes us to think, "Yeah, I remember that."  Our kids are watching this and saying, "That is just like when I..."  This is a wonderful piece of silly escapist nonsense that all members of the family can truly enjoy.
