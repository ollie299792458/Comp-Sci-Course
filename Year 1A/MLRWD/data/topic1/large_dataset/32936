I have to agree with some other reviewers. I've seen the original series and I still have all of the episodes of the Showtime version recorded. When I saw this on the shelf as "The Complete Series", I naturally assumed that the discussion of a direct-to-DVD conclusion had finally gotten some results. Instead, it turns out that this should be called "The Incomplete Series". Of course, you have no way of knowing this if you buy it in a store.

There's no indication on the outer packaging of what episodes are included. No indication that it ends prematurely and no mention that the series was cancelled before the conclusion of the storyline.

This show was a single continuous storyline with numerous highly connected sub-plots. Pretty much all of them are left hanging. Unless you want to join a large community of frustrated fans who are unlikely to ever receive any sort of closure, I'd avoid buying the set. (no, there's absolutely no hint of what the conclusion was going to be in any of the commentary or extras, either :/ ) However, if you catch wind of a real conclusion (made-for-TV, direct-to-disc movie or even a simple paper copy of Manny Coto's story notes), rush out and buy this set and enjoy it first.

Yes, it's an outstanding dramatic Sci-fi series with top-notch writing, acting, direction and production. However, the more that you enjoy it, the more upset you'll be at being left hanging.
