Barbet Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" works mostly because the director keeps us away from Jeremy Irons' character and his thoughts, and to adopt his point of view would surely be a mistake. The structure is intensely loose, and perhaps owes much to the celebrated "Citizen Kane". The film allows an unconscious Glenn Close to narrate some of the past events, but her calm and sweet voice may lead the viewer to believe she finally found her place, like the William Holden character in "Sunset Blvd.". Barbet Schroeder uses subjective flashbacks (which makes them not necessarily true), and we always adopt the lawyers point of view: the book that was the source of this film was written by the real von Bulow's lawyer. The relationship established between the aristocrat and the lawyer is very subtle: van Bulow's life depends on the lawyer's ability to succeed, and when the lawyer becomes sure of that, he attempts to eliminate class barriers, allowing himself to call the aristocrat for his first name and inviting him to his home. And yet, van Bulow is so intensely attached to his own way of life that he never loses his facade or temperament, as when he says: "I don't carry my heart on my sleeves".
"Reversal of Fortune" never attempts to find a climax: its quality resides mostly on the ability of the viewer and in the mannerisms of the characters. The film is constructed like a puzzle and its rhythm is pedantic but strangely fascinating. If the filmmakers were trying to create an exercise in style, they surely succeed it: we are left cold and doubtful and the movie lacks a purpose except entertainment.
