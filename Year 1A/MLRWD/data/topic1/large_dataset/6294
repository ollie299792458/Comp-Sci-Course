If you liked Tim Burton's film "Ed Wood," then this is where it all began!  This box set is a fine, very impressive example of Edward D. Wood, Jr.'s core film catalog, and the tranfer of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" looks especially gorgeous in monocromatic B&W.  The films may or may not hold up, but if you're an Ed Wood fan then this box set is an absolute MUST to own.  None of the discs have any extras (save for their respecive original trailers), however, "P9" has a terrific 2-hour documentary titled "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion" which features interviews with surrviving cast members, other filmmakers, critics, etc.  In my opinion, the best part features a modern-day discovery of the original run-down Hollywood movie studio/set where "P9" was actually shot.  Co-star Conrad Brooks walks inside and surveys the shambled remains and fondly recalls his personal memories.  Very nostalgic and incredibly moving.  The last disc, "The Haunted World Of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the best part of the set, and worth the price just for this 112 minute documentary film (it can be purchased as a stand-alone, but if you're interested enough in Wood's films, you'll obviously want the box set anyway).  It's also packed with amazing extras, more interviews, behind the scenes, making-of's, ultra-rare(!) lost footage, etc.  There are also some very clever (and a bit startling) Easter Eggs to be found, but I'll let the viewer find them on their own.  All-in-all, a great box set at a great price.  Ed Wood would have been proud.  If only he were still alive to offer his own audio commentaries and personal insights.
