With the exception of Jack Carter, Michael Caine's Peachy Carnahan has to be one of the actor's finest characterisations in cinema (Indian train passenger: "Mr. Clatterburydas failed entrance examination, Calcutta University, 1863, a writer of correspondence for the illiterate general public", Michael Caine: "Shudd-uup!")
