40 years after its release, Planet of the Apes is still striking for its original soundtrack, impressive makeup and strong messages.  While obviously born out of the doomsday mentality of the Cold War, many of the themes are still relevant today: the clash between science and religion, the merits/consequences of withholding information for the public good, and the destructive tendencies of mankind, to name just a few.  In spite of the sometimes cheezy acting, we still get Charlton Heston's famous line - "Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!"

After the first movie, the sequels go from bad to worse, and the premises go from far-fetched to utterly ridiculous but they are fun to watch (as long as you don't think too hard about the scientific explanations) and do a decent job of wrapping up a more complete explanation of how the apes rise, albeit with some crazy sidetracks. The sequels can be hard to find in video stores for purchase or rental so if you're going to go for it, you might as well own them all.
