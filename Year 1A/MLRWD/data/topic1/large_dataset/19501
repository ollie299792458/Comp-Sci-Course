Disaster Movie is a disastrous movie written and directed by Jason Freidberg and Aaron Seltzer, yeah Jason and Aaron with a terrible sense of humor. This movie stars Kim Kardashian, Matt Lanter, Nicole Parker and Carmen Electra(worst actress). This movie features characters and celebrities(not played by themselves) like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Hannah Montana, Speed Racer, Dr. Phil, Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, etc. This movie doesn't make any sense. It had some immature sex jokes.

I refuse to talk about the plot of this movie, because this movie sucked. If you want to know about the plot, look it up online.

It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, not just the worst movie in general, I mean one of the worst comedies ever. The parodies are ridiculous, the story was written bad and the jokes were bad and the acting was terrible even the actresses. I didn't laugh a bit throughout this movie. I wish I would rate this 1/2 stars, or even better, zero stars if that's an option. This movie was nominated for Golden Razzie Awards for worst picture, two worst supporting actress, worst rip-off, worst director and worst screenplay. This movie needed to win at least one Razzie Award. If you like to watch comedy movies and laugh your butt off, do yourself a favor, please avoid this movie, its not worth your time and money. I would never recommend this movie to anybody.
