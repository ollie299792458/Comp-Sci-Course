I'm someone who has more than a few nutrition classes under her belt and I thought I knew the pros and cons of juicing fairly well (that being less pros and more cons), but boy was I wrong! I've recently read T. Colin Campbell's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932100660">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health</a>" and was blown away by his research. I noticed that a lot of the people who bought that also bought this documentary...I thought I'd watch it to see what it was about not realizing it was all about juicing. I can say to my shame that I almost let my preconceived notions get the better of me and considered turning it off. I'm glad that I didn't! This documentary was truly inspirational. It was the perfect blend of humor and information and it wasn't boring for even a minute. I highly recommend watching it and allowing yourself to be inspired by Joe and Phil's journey to reclaim their health.
