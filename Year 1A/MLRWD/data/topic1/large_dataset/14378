What can I say...? I never saw such a bad movie. I've seen a considerable number of european super-low-budget horror films from the 70's but this goes beyond all limits! This film has all: the most stupid zombies i've seen ( they have feelings!), incredible make-up errors, people running from zombies laughing (take a careful look at the restaurant scene..) and even the camera man can be seen in a mirror for about half a minute (for those of had, unfortunatly, seen the film, review carefully the scene where Howard Vernon talks with the reporter in a living room full of mirrors)! And the voice doubling??? Magnificient! And Daniel White,the music man, didn't care: he picked his soundtrack for Jesus Franco's Female Vampire and used it...  Unbelievable...! Oh dear... those who had made this masterpiece must had gone crazy.. Well, after this film I believe that my home-made films like Theatre of Pain and Antro da Necrofilia can became Gore classics.. Warning: This is one of the worst films i've seen! It's hilariant..! that i can guarentee... Oh well.. I prefer Neurosis...
