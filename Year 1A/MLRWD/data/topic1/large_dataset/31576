This is a superb little film that is an icon of what is termed "film noir". It reeks atmosphere throughout. An aging boxer played brilliantly by Robert Ryan wants that last big fight and a win under his belt. His girl friend understandably does not want him to fight any more and tries in vane to persuade him not to. Unknown to Ryan the fight has been fixed with inevitable consequences.  Not to spoil the ending I shall not relate any more of the story. It is the attention to detail that makes this film special, the character observation, the audience including a woman who revels in the brutality of the fight, the man who is so carried away he lives every throw of the punch. An overweight man obsessed with eating as much junk food as he is with the boxing. There is the seedy room in the "Hotel Cozy". Peeled off wallpaper and a ceiling lampshade made out of newspaper. Every detail has been so well thought out. Coupled with some enigmatic photography this gripping film is a must for film noir and boxing fans
