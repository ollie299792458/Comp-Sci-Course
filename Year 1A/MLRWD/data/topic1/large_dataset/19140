Saw this film last night and have to say I was extremely relieved to have finally seen a decent scary movie for a change, instead of the teen-slasher, no-plot, know-whats-happening-next films that have plagued the genre for a while now.  It looks low budget but not too low budget, but it doesn't detract from the storytelling.  It reminded me of when I was young, telling scary stories late at night to friends.
It does have it's scary moments - I have to say I did jump a few times (the crows - eek!  I'll make a bird pie methinks...), and it didn't stray from the path it was taking, but it wasn't a film that would keep me awake at night.  However I really felt cheated with the ending - what a let down!  Maybe it was supposed to be, I don't know, because it does leave you wanting to know more.
I would recommend this film - it is worth seeing.  It won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained no end.  I should've went to see it in the cinema, even with it's poor ending, but if they ever make a sequel, and here's hoping they do, I'll be the first in the queue to see it in the cinema!
