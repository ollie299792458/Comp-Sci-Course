This documentary was shot during Bob Dylan's tour of England in 1965. At this point, most fans of popular music only knew the name "Bob Dylan" because of his music being re-sung by pop-musicians, such as Peter,Paul & Mary, The Byrds, The Turtles...etc..
Film maker D.A. Pennebaker decided he was going to follow young Dylan around, and capture a private look at someone who still wasn't fully exposed to the pop-world. This was a time when Dylan was just starting to rise up from the underground folk scene and become a pop-identity of his own.
"Don't Look Back" gave most viewers their very first look at this poetical folk singer, who obviously was having a hard time handling his fast growing popularity as a song writer/singer. Yes, for most of the movie we see Bob giving everyone around him a hard time....well, can you blame the poor guy? When you're only 24 years of age and everyone's analyzing every word you say, and wanting to know WHY you said it...and bothering you to sign autographs...and demanding you be a romodel, JUST because you wrote some good songs....it's a little hard to cope with. 
Bob Dylan played head-games and snarled at people for one plain and simple reason. PROTECTION! The only way he could protect himself against media and fans, was to be vicious and cocky. Who knows...maybe behind closed doors he was the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet. 
This is quite an interesting look, at one great musical legend, who not only inspired such bands as The Beatles, but also inspired many young song writers to speak their minds, in a way-that helped change the world!
