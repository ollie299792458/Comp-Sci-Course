The main character, Bree (Felicity Huffman), a week before her sex reassignment surgery, is forced by her therapist to fly from LA to New York to bail out of jail the 17 year old street hustler son, Toby (Kevin Zegers,) she she had been unaware even existed. They embark on a cross country road trip filled with self discovery, wry comedy, and pathos. The plot line is the tried and true formula of the transformational road trip, yet the irony of Bree's concurrent sexual transformation freshens a story that could easily have been clich&eacute;.

Kevin Zegers and the rest of the supporting cast are superb, but Huffman's characterization of Bree is Oscar caliber.

Transamerica has been making the film festival circuit, winning awards at the Berlin Film festival, the Tribeca Film festival in New York, and the Frameline International Gay and Lesbian film festival in San Francisco.

Obviously a labor of love, Duncan Tucker wrote, directed, and wisely cast Felicity Huffman as Bree (before she had been cast as a "desperate housewife"). Huffman's husband William Macy is executive producer.

The Weinstein brothers recognized just how outstanding this indie is and have slated it for December 2, 2005 limited general release--one of the first post Miramax films to be released by their new company.
