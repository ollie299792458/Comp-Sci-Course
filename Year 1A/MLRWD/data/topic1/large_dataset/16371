In this edition, the movie itself is almost unchanged from the theatrical release.  Unlike the 40 Year Old Virgin DVD, there are only a few undeleted or extended scenes so the pacing and mood remain the same.

The extras are way above average.  More than just the typical deleted and extended scenes (of which there are many), there are also behind the scenes documentaries and laugh out loud mockumentaries.  I had seen lots of material on the internet and was afraid this edition would simply be redundant.  Far from it, there is an abundance of new and hilarious stuff in here.

As usual, it's obvious why some of the deleted scenes were deleted.  Others are certainly funny enough to warrant your time.  A few are must-sees.

The documentaries focus on specific characters, actors, or events during shooting.  The editing and the subject matter are both good.  Even the director diaries are funny.

The mockumentaries are quite impressive.  They were obviously planned well before principal photography began, as they were filmed in parallel with the movie itself.  "Finding Ben Stone" shows various actors substituting Seth Rogen in scenes throughout the movie supposedly as auditions for the role.

Even the menus are nice.  Each one plays some deleted/extended scene, and not just ones already included elsewhere on the DVD.  For example, the language selection menu is nothing but clip after clip of just Seth Rogen laughing.  Great for all of us who think Seth Rogen is adorable.

The commentary track manages to be funny and avoid too much of the usual tedious banality.

All in all, this DVD is a great value.  Furthermore, it accomplishes something similar to the DVDs produced by Kevin Smith and Peter Jackson.  Aptow, Rogen, and crew come across as fascinating and funny film makers who are a pleasure to get to know better.
