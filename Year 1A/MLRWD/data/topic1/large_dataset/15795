Leslie Nielsen is even funnier in drag with this hilarious spoof in the tradition of 'Scary Movie'. Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) is the male version of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' in that he doesn't connect with his family roots as monster slayers until he's tested by the monsters. Soon there is no escape from the truth as Stan is forced to venture into a bizarre neighborhood with his friends to make a delivery to 'the last house on the left' where they are confronted with strange events along the way. Though the film does slightly touch on the use of common stereotypes, I happen to think some stereotypes are always funny. After all, most stereotypes have a hint of truth to them, or people wouldn't connect to them so easily in the comedy crowd. Those of us who also watch a lot of horror films will 'get' more of the humor. Be sure to watch the extended and deleted scenes, as well as outtakes, especially cast interviews. Thanks for the endorphin rush Bo Zenga!
P.S. If you're the type who 'comes to the party not looking for fun', you probably won't enjoy this movie. If you want straight horror, this isn't the movie for you.
