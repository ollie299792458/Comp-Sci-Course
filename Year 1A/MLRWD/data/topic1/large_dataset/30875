The first season of West Wing shows us how good television can be. If you've seen the movie The American President, the look, feel, and sound of West Wing will seem familiar to you, because Aaron Sorkin also wrote the screenplay for the movie.

The focus for the West Wing is mostly on the staff, though, and that's what makes the show so interesting. The character development is absolutely superb-- you care about the characters, so you care about the storyline. In addition, the writing is so clever, and you will find yourself busting out with belly laughs at points.

If you have missed the first two or three seasons, and have only seen it in the last couple of years, you may be extremely underwhelmed and not see what all the fuss was about. The first season will answer that question for you. You can now catch reruns on Bravo and sometimes in syndication, but it can be hard to jump in in the middle without knowing who everyone is and what they do. This set gives you the perfect opportunity to see it from the very beginning.
