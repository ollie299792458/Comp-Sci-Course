I would hardly have thought it possible, but this film conveys the main themes and events of Sterne's book, although in abbreviated fashion, and with the addition of a faux behind-the-scenes drama or two.  There is full exposure to people and their little obsessions (their hobby horses).  This is a tale of misfortune.  The misfortune attendant on young Tristram's conception, the misfortune of his manhood being somewhat truncated by a falling sash-window, the misfortune that befell Uncle Toby in battle and defeats him with the widow, and the misfortune of Tristram's father, who sees all of his plans for his son come to nothing.  But it is all viewed with Sterne's very own shrewd and knowing humor.

I can fault nothing except, perhaps, the Gillian Anderson actress-from-America subplot, which I would have omitted.  I think most people will have a preference for either the Tristram Shandy story or the "behind-the-scenes" story of the filming.  I preferred the former, and this movie ended way to soon for me.

Although Stephen Fry is something of a self-parody, the content of the extra feature in which he tours Sterne's home is enlightening.
