First of all, anyone going to see this movie must accept that it will be, in no way, a hugely dramatic piece of work that will make you question your own humanity. Even though this is essentially a revenge story, it does not carry the weight of, say, Dostoevsky. What it does accomplish, however, is to make the inner child within all of us want to be cowboys. American Outlaws captures the spirit of the dime novel to bring you yet another interpretation of the Jesse James story. All the outlaws are good, the people they fight are bad, and all the showdowns feature more action and gunplay than you can shake a stick at. It is not blood-and-guts gunplay, but more what you'd see from Frontier Town at Disney World. What definately caught me by surprise was the adherence to the way guns were in the Old West. Sure, there's the occasional "No way" shot, but most of the action has one man walking among many guns blazing because the others can't react fast enough because of surprise or shock. You could do that in the Old West because revolvers were primitive enough that the best shots were close up and calm. If you did the unexpected, the other guy was much less likely to hit you. The only real I almost wish this was a PG movie so that more kids would see it, but I think the studios felt they'd make more as a teen movie than as a family flick. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable movie that really brings the inner child in all of us to life.
