"Come undone" or precisely translated "ALmost nothing" is a story about a summer love between two young lads. One of them just discovers his homosexuality (Mathieu), the other is more experienced and concious what his needs are (Cedric). The background story focuses on Mathieu's mother who tries to recover from depression after she lost her little baby.
What is quite unusual in this film is that the director decided to mix three different time frames, which, the decision, makes the film difficult to follow.
There are too many questions left not answered. Why Mathieu wanted to commit a suicide? Was it a suicide attempt or not? What went wrong with those two?
Unfortunately the end of the film is far from being clear as well. Nobody knows why and what for Mathieu decides to meet Pierre (Cedric's ex-bf) and what will be the outcome. Are these two ment to be together?
Apart from slow screenplay with some vague moments, "Presque rien" is a well acted film. Both J.Elkaim and S.Rideau (check his part in "Le clan") created characters in full dimension.
Two other facts: the film incl. a funny, but dirty version of the hit song "Libertine" (Kate Ryan or M.Farmer) and very hot sex-scene.
