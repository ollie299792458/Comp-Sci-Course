Bringing Up Baby is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's funny, wacky, with sharp dialogue and stars two of the absolute best actors to ever live: Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. Both of them are wonderful and play off eachother so well in this film. This is the movie that made me a huge fan of both Cary and Katharine, and I've seen many of their movies since. This one is still my favorite!

I've seen BUB many times - everytime I see that it's on TCM I am compelled to watch, telling myself I'll watch just a few minutes and then of course I end up watching the whole thing! It's so fun that it sucks you in and you lose track of time. I was very excited to hear that it was coming out on DVD, The picture and sound on this DVD are both very crisp and clear, definitely a worthy transfer. There are several extras, but my favorite is a 1 1/2 hour documentary on Cary Grant, that includes home movies, old photos, clips from his films, and interviews with his friends, family, and actors that hold him in high esteem. It's an excellent documentary about a great man.

Definitely recommended.
