I purchased this DVD collection for Christmas and I think it is well worth the money.

The Best of American Idol

The Best of American Idol has all the auditions as well as great performances from the winner and runner-up of seasons 1-4. Paula Abdul looks back at each season and also does interviews with the performers from AI 4 as they go on tour.

It is pretty cool to look back at each season. They also have an interview with Kelly Clarkson, her platinum presentation and tips for future contestants.

The Worst of American Idol

The Worst of American Idol is my favorite out of the three discs that come in this set. It has some of the funniest auditions of all time, from William Hung to the Route 66 girl and Keith, who Simon called the worst singer in the world. There is a an hour-long feature as Paula Abdul looks back at the wackiest moments from the first 4 seasons.

There is a third disc which has some interviews with American Idol 4 contestants, plus homecoming footage from Carrie Underwood and Bo Bice. If you are a huge American Idol fan, then this is the best purchase for you.
