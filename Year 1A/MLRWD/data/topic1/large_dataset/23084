Don't be fooled by the other reviews here: this is Kurosawa at his best and film-making of the highest quality.  Yes, the print and the translation need to be cleaned up, but don't let that keep you away.  The chemistry between Shimura and Mifune here beats that of any other screen duo I can name, and often Kurosawa's directing attains it's sublimest levels (the stack of steaming girls in the dance hall attic, for instance, and the elemental merging of back- and fore-ground during the violent standoff at the end, silent save for the tiny, separated sounds of communal harmony).  But the best thing about *Stray Dog* is its literary-quality script.  "When does a Stray Dog become a Mad Dog?" detective Sato (Shimura's character) asks.  It is the pivotal question all post-war Japan needs answered, precariously balanced as it is between chaos and order.  Which way will Japan go?  Murakami (Mifune's character) chooses order, though he has suffered the same injustices other young veterans faced after the lost war.  Murakami's alter-ego, however, the movie's faceless-until-the-end villian - also a veteran - descends into a mental chaos, a collapse which could spread, Sato fears, bringing down society.  Who's to blame for the instability is a question Sato believes unimportant and  even dangerous -- but Murakami isn't sure.  Watching Murakami wrestling with this question as he self-tortuously searches the dirtiest parts of the city is like watching a hero of old Romance trying to reconcile his demons before they claim his soul: no Victor Frankenstein here, however, but a Japanese Ishmael.  The film is a masterpiece.
