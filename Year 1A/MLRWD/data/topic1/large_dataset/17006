FILM REVIEW (DVD review below):

Although "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" didn't scream "Sequel time!", the box office gross, popularity, and the subtitle alone couldn't have demanded anything else. "Dead Man's Chest" was of one of the best summer films of all time and did everything a sequel should do: There was more action, more thrills, more laughs, and a richer storyline.

Pros:
*Outstanding performance from Johnny Depp and newcomer Bill Nighy as Davy Jones
*The new villains are awesome
*Amazing action
*Rich, engaging storyline
*Fantastic and emotional score from Hans Zimmer
*The Kraken
*Beautiful locales
*Amazing CGI courtesy of ILM
*Good pacing and an enthralling cliffhanger

Cons:
*Plot could use more strengthening
*More story?

My rating: 5/5

DVD REVIEW:

This is where DVDs go right. This 2-Disc set has plenty of features. Disc 1 includes the movie plus "Bloopers of the Caribbean". Disc 2 features over 5 hours of bonus material. The highlights of this disc are "Charting the Return" and "According to Plan", which are fantastic "Making Of" features that last almost as long a the movie. There is also a feature on the creation of Davy Jones (which is awesome), an interactive feature on Jack Sparrow's costume, "Mastering the Blade" which shows how the actors trained for their sword fights, "Dead Man Tell New Tales" which shows how the movies inspired new additions to the classic Disney ride, and a feature of the Bone Cage sequence. All in all, this DVD delivers in terms of features and is a must have.
My rating: 5/5
