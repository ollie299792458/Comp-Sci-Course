"In 1969 the wild ones went to Woodstock; the unlucky ones went to war but if you didn't know where you were going, they sent you to Claymoore." Such was the provocative opening to the theatrical trailer for the film "Girl, Interrupted". This short narrative, however, sets the tone and scene for the world in which 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen struggles to cope with both the mental illness she fights to understand and the world around her which refuses to acknowledge the fight she is waging.

 Based on the personal memoir of Susanna Kaysen, "Girl, Interrupted" invites audiences into the bizarre and absurdly funny worlds of mental illness and psychiatric treatment viewed through the psychedelic lens of the late Sixties, a time when some could argue that the world outside of a mental institution was no different than the world within one. Providing viewers with more than just a period piece of a nation wrought with war, social revolution and a drug-induced counter-culture, this Academy Award-winning film is in a class of its own, leading viewers through a heartbreaking journey of self-discovery and self-evaluation, all the while, acquiring an eclectic host of friends and experiences which ultimately shape the process and outcome of that journey. If anything it is a message for adolescents who struggle to find their identity at a pivotal time when being a teenager often means, quite ironically, proving you are an individual by copying everything your friends do. The final narrative of the theatrical trailer puts it into perspective and puts it best, "Sometimes you don't know how to fit in until you find a way to break out."
