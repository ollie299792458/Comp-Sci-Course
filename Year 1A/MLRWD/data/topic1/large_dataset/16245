I was looking forward to this movie. I love animation, and am always on the look out to see animated features like this one and the "Iron Giant." The previews made it look spectacular, however the rock and roll music made me begin to worry. The worried feeling was not off the mark either. It started off great, the visuals of the Earth getting blown up...not to mention Earth's debris taking out the moon, too...were really amazing to see. The colors and backgrounds of the computer graphics were really breath-taking. Worth seeing once.
However, once the plot gets going, it fizzles. The first incident, I thought "okay, this is meant for a younger audience." Then it got worse and worse and worse. By the time you get to the Ice Fields (very amazing sequence...visually), all respect for this flick was long gone. I don't want to give any of it away, but they played out the prison and betrayals scenes extemely poorly. I just couldn't buy it. Another issue that bothered me, if the Drej are a single energy unity, why do soldiers march inside the space ship? 
Other than the visuals, what earned this DVD those three stars are the deleted scenes included in the extras. The featurette is a 20-minute commercial for kids which does not say anything useful about the making of the movie. Trailers and TV spots remined me why I skipped catching this flick in the theatres. However, the deleted scenes were amazing. Alot of the sequences you find in there are not completed. So, for example, there are line drawings of the characters with a CG generated background. It was very intersting to see, and provides a glimpse of a stage of animation we viewer rarely get to see.
