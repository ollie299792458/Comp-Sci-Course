I've loved this movie and the music in it since first seeing it shortly after it was released.  Recently I learned that many of the odd little events were not so far from reality being based upon real events in Django Reinhardt's life.  The crescent-moon chair is very close to the star that Django had built but then was afraid to actually use.  Just as Emmett Ray was a cleptomaniac the real-life Django was skilled at "informal procurement" and was pleased when his youngest son showed a talent for the same. :)

I'm sure that none of us can even imagine the background that Django came from but Emmett Ray certainly brings to life a character that faced equally difficult challenges while having a rough start in life on the American side of the pond.  Add in the "ego of genuius" and you have a volatile, yet delightful mix.  I've known a lot of Jazz guitarists and Sean Penn's characterization of the fictional Emmett Ray is not all that far from reality.

If you love music, especially Jazz guitar, you will probably enjoy this movie.  Also, if you enjoy a character that is clueless, insanely egotistic and ultmately lovable, look no further than Sean Penn's portrayal of the American Django, Emmett Ray.
