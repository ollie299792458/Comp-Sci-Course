Aerosmith waited to put this dvd out until the "honkin on bobo" cd. I want to explain as a life long aerosmith fan why i think there was so much chit chat in between songs. They wanted to explain the PROCESS of making honkin on bobo, they wanted to give their fans who they are devoted to dearly a inside look on their "back to their roots" project. Alot of people in these reviews especially one by somebody named christopher claims that no girl u nder 25 knows all the lyrics to aerosmith songs and hes wrong because Im 24 and i know every lyric to every aerosmith song. If you want to know why aerosmith has came through everything from publisized drug abuse, some managers that were just trying to back stab them and use them, 2 of its original band members leaving the band, and then returning in the 80s, and the ability to get clean and rebuild their outstanding carrer then you need to see this dvd. The dedication that These guys not only have to their fans but each other is something that is never seen in bands. The reason why aerosmith has stood the test of time and will continue to rock and roll for years is because along with being band mates, these guys are brothers by choice. Any TRUE aerosmith fan knows what im talking about and LOVE THIS LONG OVERDUE DVD.
