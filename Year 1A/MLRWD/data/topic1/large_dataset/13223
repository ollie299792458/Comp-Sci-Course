I agree with the reviewer who says that this version is the most faithful to the "light, bright and Sparkling" spirit of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Yes, a lot of liberties are taken with the plot; and, yes, Greer Garson is a rather mature Elizabeth, but not by much. I have seen and appreciated both the BBC 1980 version wth Elizabeth Garvie (for its faithfulness to the novel) and the A&E version with Jennifer Ehle (for the beauty of the production), but neither one matches this version in conveying the crisp bouyant humor of Austen's writing.

Though published in 1813, "Pride and Prejudice" has its roots in the 1790s, when its first iteration, "First Impressions" was written, so it's really more a product of the witty Age of Reason than of the sentimental Gothic era. A lot of productions tend to give the story too serious and sentimental a tone.

There are so many enjoyable features in this rendition. The characters are played with zest by Melville Cooper as Mr. Collins, Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennet, Marsha Hunt as Mary Bennet, and Frieda Inescort as Miss Bingley. It's hard to think of anyone better to play Lady Catherine than Edna May Oliver. The humor is high, as are the bonnets. Though the costume is more suited to the 1830s than the 1810s, it expresses some of the eccentricity that runs through the novel. Altogether a charming, fun film.

This version might not be your definitive P&P, but as someone who read the book before seeing any of the film or TV minis, I found it was the one that had the truest 'essence' of P&P. A nice addition to anyone's Austen library.
