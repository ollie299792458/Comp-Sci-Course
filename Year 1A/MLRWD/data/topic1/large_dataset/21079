I'm talking about this brand new 2DVD set of Oklahoma! 50th Anniversary, released on November 15th 2005. The concept is great, 2 discs, disc one is a CinemaScope version, disc two is a Todd-AO 70MM version, with proper widescreen aspect ratio & great sound. But the picture quality on Todd-AO version is a real garbage. Very soft, fuzzy & lack of definition as if you're watching a second generation VHS copy! The 70MM source material for this transfer is extremely bad and suffers from a severe color fading. The cinemaScope version on disc one looks much better & sharper although the color balance & color timing is totally wrong and it suffers from an extensive electronic edge enhancement, some video artifacts & color bleeding. This is not what it should be. Generally speaking, films shot in 70MM format should have far superior image & color quality than 35MM CinemaScope, but not this DVD transfer. 20th Century fox Home Video has done nothing but insult consumers. If they think they can get away with this, forget it. They can fool me once but not twice. My advice? Don't buy this DVD set. Rent it to see some wonderful special features, especially on disc two, and listen to a soundtrack, wich is very nicely remastered, but not for the image quality.
