I bought the single-disc release a year of so back and am seriously considering upgrading to this new release.  The single-disc transfer is fine, but to own a remastered version in 5.1 surround with all the special features is very tempting.

Of course, those into sci-fi know this to be one, if not THE mother of all sci-fi classics.  Ranking along side pictures like: The Day the Earth Stood Still, (the original) War of the Worlds, (George Pal's) Time Machine, and the like.  Of them all, this one may be my favorite.  The story (based on Shakespeare's Tempest) is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the FXs hold up amazingly well.

I maybe somewhat bias however.  As a boy, I had a serious crush on the curvaceous Ms. Anne Francis and never missed an episode of her short-lived series (Honey West) when it aired in the mid sixties.  Oh, and let's not forget that this was Robby the Robot's film debut.  He may be the most enduring icon from the early sci-fi era.  Robby seems to pop up on occasion just to put smiles on our faces.  From: (the original series) Lost in Space, The Twilight Zone, to Mork & Mindy, and Earth Girls are Easy, he's libel to show up anywhere.

Well, I suppose that's enough reminiscing. I've sold myself on this gem all over again... Time to buy!
