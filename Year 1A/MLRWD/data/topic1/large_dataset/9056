If your a fan of the original buy IT!  Its so much better.  Yeah it lags a little bit but they had to start somewhere.  They really upped the game when they did the episode Dog Eat Dog and the last episode A Funny thing happened on the way to me killing you.  THAT'S when I felt they were really breaking away from the UK version.  You really can see how Josh has to trust Aidan.  If you were a fan of the original you know whats going to happen but then there are differences.  Oh my only compliant is in both series more in this one we don't know what the werewolf's powers are.  So to speak they only scratch the surface.  We know Josh senses are heightened but what else can he ultimately control the transformations and can he sense in wolf form the people that are his friends?  There isn't a lot of special features but one is I love is the feature explaining things of what the three of them are and how in each they do the fake teeth and all.  Sam Huntington really shows you and the make department how they did the scene Dog Eat Dog.  It really shows how much they put in for just a little bit of camera work plus I hope we can see what Sally can do and when they shot Josh on his left the people on the other side of the cage were not there.  I can't wait for the next season and hopefully season 3.
