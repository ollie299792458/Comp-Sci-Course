I'm a big comic book fan, pretty much since I was 3. around 7 I started reading the flash. so of course when I saw it on here, had to pick it up. as I watched the first episode, started to vaguely remember the show. it came on right after I got out of school and wasn't home often. this is pretty much back in bedrock when vcrs were still fairly expensive. by the time you get to the 2nd disc, you really see how bad the show was and why it was punted after 1 season. I always have problems with shows that can't figure out where they are in time. 1/2 the time they are in 50s (cars, certain fashions in the episodes) and the other 1/2 the time they're in the 90s (computers, other fashions, cars). the acting is a step above a high school production most of the time. the final episode was with mark hamill and it looked like he lost every bit of his acting ability. the stories are horrible, even the villains you know (trickster, mirror master, capt. cold) are terrible in the writing. I trading this pos on a site without a bit of remorse. it may bring fond memories of when it was on but wow, even shows I watch from the 80s now look like shakespeare after wasting my time watching this. if there was a way to give it negative stars, 100% would be doing it

rumor has it a flash movie is in the works. hopefully no one associated with this project will be involved. if they are, redbox.com for the rental. even then you'd be overpaying
