It is rare that a movie can transcend language and cultural barriers to convey a story that appeals to the emotions of the viewer.  The Road Home is one such movie.  Without resorting to a summary of the movie, which is surely repeated elsewhere, the Road Home is a love story.  Despite being unable to appreciate the magnitude of the marriage for love concept as opposed to marriage by arrangement, as I am an American, I was still able to recognize the love depicted in this movie.  Despite not being able to understand Mandarin/Cantonese, the emotions are clearly conveyed through the actors.  One feels for them and roots for them even if there is no blatant antagonist to rouse your emotions.  Clearly the movie has touched other viewers as it won the Audience Award at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and Silver Berlin Bear at the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival.  The Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern and Ju Dou) film bloodlines do not raise unattainable standards or expectations, but may actually raise the standards for his other movies.  If Zhang Ziyi is typecast later as a method actor good only for martial arts and sex kitten roles, one need only view this movie to see that they are wrong.  You should watch this movie.
