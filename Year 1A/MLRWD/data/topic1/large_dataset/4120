Sinners And Saints

Sinners And Saints brings new meaning to the concept of "Pain"!

I would imagine if one has nothing to lose, and there are no gods, all things are absolutely possible?

I found Sinners And Saints to be a fantastic philosophical adventure delving into many human concepts such as: good and evil, sinners and saints, either/or questions, and the big question of "Why".

Sinners And Saints is non stop (shoot-em-up) action... no nudity (that I remember), no romance, not too much lull talking about the olden-days or the way things could have been.

the stage, for Sinners And Saints, is creatively set in New Orleans, Louisiana after the infamous Hurricane Katrina, depicted as realistic, grungy, gritty, grimy and very dangerous, except for the newly rebuilt part of the City which is overly saturated with vibrant colors, plenty of sunshine, leafy trees and singing birds.

the "stun grenades", used in Sinners And Saints, are really nice... :)

great looking, well built, leading men, a plus in any movie -- if ya ask Me! :)

Horrific graphical imagery -- very creative ways to torture or knock people off.

Sinners And Saints adds a whole new layer to the meaning of the word 'Pain".  --  some of these images I really didn't need to linger in my brain -- Not for kids, imo. 'nuf said.  Does this sound like Your kind of Movie?  --Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012
