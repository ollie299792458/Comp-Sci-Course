I purchased Yojimbo (on DVD) shortly after stumbling across my first Kurosawa film - Sanjuro - late one night on TV. To call Yojimbo a  masterpiece would simply tread well-trampled ground. My jaw was hanging in  astonishment throughout most of this film. There's tons of humor subtly  tucked away throughout, explosive action sequences, and one of the coolest  crime-jazz theme songs I've ever heard. The bad guys are ridiculously - yet  perfectly - overblown, both physically and in their mannerisms. I realized  with astonishment that Japanese Anime and Manga must owe a huge debt to  this film. The short, bizarre sequence with dancing Geisha girls left me  absolutely floored. It's one thing to call a director "genius",  but Kurosawa's more than that: he's downright hip. Yojimbo is proof of  this. And it's so effortless to watch, you often don't realize the genius  happening right under your nose. I had to pause the film several times to  think about what he had just made look so easy.
The print is absolutely  glorious. When the sleeve notes call it a "luminous transfer",  they're not kidding. A couple of jumpy splices, but I'll gladly forgive  these. The transfer does total justice to Yojimbo's brilliant photography.
