Adam Sandler is a funny, funny man.  Several years later, "Happy Gilmore" continues to crack my stuff up.  And - more recently - I applauded his reinvention in "Punch Drunk Love".  Sandler.  Yay, Sandler.
Having established that...
I'm not quite sure what happened in "Anger Management".  Ridiculously farfetched plots, slapstick humor, and Sandler flick alumni are standard fare when it comes to the S-man; I love 'em, you love 'em, we've all come to eagerly expect them...but these elements just don't *work* this time around.  This movie wasn't funny...or even remotely entertaining.  Truth be told, I've never been so bored or restless during a film.  
It does have a few novelty moments, courtesy of some cameo appearances.  Woody Harrelson as a transexual prostitute?  Heather Graham obsessively jamming brownies in her face?  Rudy Giulani calling out for a "five-second frencher"?  Thrills, albeit cheap ones.  
Jack Nicholson.  Great actor, *extremely* under-utilized in this movie.  He spends approximately 80% of the film, making exaggerated "all work and no play..."-esque faces.  While entertaining, elastic Jack gestures do not a fine movie make.  
Even my boyfriend - of the "Sandler is God" mentality - was disappointed in this one.  Go figure.
In short:  I can't really recommend this movie to anyone...die-hard Sandler fans included.  Definitely a shame, given my own expectations of the movie.  In my humble opinion, the most gripping part of my entire movie-going experience was the wicked, wicked Matrix 2 preview (woo!).  Aside from that...I'd wait for the DVD release in a few months.
