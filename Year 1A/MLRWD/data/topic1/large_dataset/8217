I originally got this just because GACKT was in it. But really, all the leading roles are an amazing cast. Who'd waste time arguing that each of these actors haven't been great?! Well, anyone can say what they want, I guess. But truth be told, they made a quite enjoyable film out of what might have been less that that for me.
Sorry. I'm just not into the vengeance genre. (And this is obviously not the biggest budget film). But I thoroughly enjoyed the fantasy aspect about it. Very comic-book like. Very colorful. The fight scenes are obviously rehearsed and at times looks more like dancing or play fighting. For me, it's reminiscent of the Adam West Batman series hinted with bits of Sin City or something. But maybe that's just my oddball comparison.
Many of the costumes seem to be a spin off of Dick Tracy meets The Wiz. Not a bad thing. Just makes it a little more fantasy-like.
As for GACKT, Josh and Woody, they were without question the best actors in this film. Ultimately, they are the reason I keep watching again and again. They keep it interesting and will help to draw you in to the story a bit. At least, it's their characters that the the story follows most.
Even in the end, the characters backgrounds are still somewhat vague. It could be that it leaves it open for individual interpretation. But really, it's slightly unsettling to not have a more definite idea about the history of each character. As for Josh's character, I think it remains that his name is never even announced (hence, the 'nameless drifter'). Maybe it's supposed to add/keep the mystery?
The story itself is pretty good. At least, there IS a plot and a somewhat grand finale. Sometimes its a bit cheesy, repetitious or has way too much dialogue. (just like my review? haha) Not really gory, but there's bloody scenes that make me go 'dang!'
Overall, nice action film for movie night in with popcorn.
