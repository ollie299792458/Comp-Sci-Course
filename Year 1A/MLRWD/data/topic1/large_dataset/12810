I got a great little anecdote about seeing this movie. I really wanted to see it and i couldn't drag any of my friends to go with me so i went  alone--perfectly okay with me.  This was opening weekend for the film so i  was expecting SOMEONE to be there, but i was mistaken.  For the first time  in my life i was in the theatre completely alone.  Just me.  No one else.  I felt like i owned the place.  I laid back, put my feet up, munched on my  popcorn and laughed outlout to my little heart's content.  Granted, i  didn't completely understand everything that was taking place but i did  have a ground understanding of Watergate and Deep Throat and all that.  It  helps to be a bit of a brain when watching this movie because there are  very little things that can go right over your head if you don't know the  historical significance of it.  Overall, this movie was great!  My favorite  part of the movie is when Woodward and Bernstein strut in slo-mo down the  office hall amid cheers from their collegues (watch Bernstein do that flip  thing with his hair- it's a riot) If you arent quite familiar with  Watergate don't forget to watch All the President's Men first as siad  before; it's a big help and a great movie; although alltogether different  than this one. It's a shame more people didn't dig this film because it's  so worth watching, it deserves five stars. Sitting in my seat all alone had  its perks- as the credits rolled and Abba's Dancing Queen played i merrily  danced down the aisle and sung along.  I felt silly but i was on Becky and  Darlene's side- they got that "bad man" out of the White House  and i felt like celebrating right along with them.  The only thing i was  missing was the roller skates.
