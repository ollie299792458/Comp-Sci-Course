This has been on my top 3 list of comedies ever since I first saw it in the 90's. It just doesn't get old. Like everyone else says, it's perfectly paced, and it brings consistent laughs throughout. Something about this movie, with it's amazing soundtrack and it's sense of adventure that just makes you feel good.

I first found out about the unrated version when I was at Target and just saw it for sale. When I saw "6 additional minutes", my heart was gonna explode, it was like getting to see the movie for the first time again, and what began as pure excitement, ended very quickly with sheer disappointment. Let me just make a long story short here. Almost every additional scene completely ruins the brilliance and subtlety of every classic scene. It turns a quick witted character comedy into stupid bathroom humor, and not funny bathroom humor. Before seeing this movie, I always thought that the Farrelley brothers had past their prime after Kingpin, thinking that they abandoned clever pg-13 humor for moronic R humor. I think this unrated version proves my point. I think back then they had enough self restrain to hold back enough and not cross that line between shockingly funny and shocking for the sake of being shocking. That's why so many of these scenes were left out, for the good of the greater "picture". I've learned one thing from this unrated version, and that's that I will never buy an unrated version anything ever again. Here's a rule of thumb for everyone. Never buy an Unrated or Extended edition DVD/Blu-Ray of anything. If it didn't make it into the theaters, then there's a very good reason for it, and if it's not a Director's Cut, then that means that the Director himself agrees with that decision of not including it, so therefore there's any one entity that could be responsible, and that's the money hungry producers and studios who could care less about the integrity of their film, just as long as they can make an extra few bucks from it.
