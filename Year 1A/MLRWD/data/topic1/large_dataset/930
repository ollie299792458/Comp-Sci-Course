I can only say to be sure that many, many people born between about 1965-1977 probably either highly identify with Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack's watermark character from this film), or have wished they could meet someone like him. The appeal of this film makes it one of a very rare breed of teen movie - the kind that last.
This DVD edition gives you great insight into both the original concept and the making of the film. You learn for example that Cusack wasn't keen on what turned out to be one of the most identifiable scenes in 80's film, and that Crowe almost wasn't able to snag Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes due to a bit of a mix-up.
Many times watching deleted scenes on DVDs only serves to make you realize how necessary the deletions were in the first place. In this case, though, the deleted scenes give you an insight into the film that might've been. I don't want to give too much away, but mainly I'll say that the depth added to Mr. Court (John Mahoney as Ione Skye's father) really helps to understand what eventually happens to him.
Being a DVD freak and a huge fan of this movie, I strongly recommend this edition.
