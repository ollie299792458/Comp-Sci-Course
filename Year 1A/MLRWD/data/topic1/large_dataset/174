An epic and extensive depiction of the life of Che, to be complemented by ``The Motorcycle Diaries`...a must see to understand how Che became what he was, after a journey through the illiterate, impoverished, exploited counties of Latin America.
I am not a communist, and these films evidence the attitude of the USA to Cuba from 1959 as a series of terrible misunderstandings and mistakes, starting with the Kennedy attempt to re-install the Mafia in Cuba at the bay of Pigs, through to the Clinton negociations, which were disavowed by Congress, in the 1990`s, all pushing Cuba into a corner.
The Cuban revolution can be viewed in this film as a description of an oppressed people`s success in ridding itself of a dreadful dictatorship, promoted neither by China nor the USSR.
Move forward 40 years to the `liberation of Iraq, and the Middle East moves to overthrow of Dictatorship...context, history, evolution of mankind, generosity of the USA (so often proven).
