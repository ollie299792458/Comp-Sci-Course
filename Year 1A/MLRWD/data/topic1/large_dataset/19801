The story of two non-geeks who are sick of the pretentious "in" crowd's thoughtless, tormenting ways towards outsiders, Heathers is a darkly comedic vision of revenge and regrets.  Winona Ryder plays Veronica, the fourth in the most popular group of girls in school, the other three all named.. Heather.  She meets J.D. (Christian Slater's angst-y, eventually psychotic portrayal of a loner going to the same school), who is a refreshing drink of apathy to her dehydration from cliques.  From there, they join forces in overcoming stereotypes and unintentionally creating new ones as they "accidentally" kill the most popular Heather and make it look like a suicide.  As J.D. has a hard time hiding his urges to continue doing the same thing to other popular students, Veronica begins to question his sanity, as well as her own.
Ryder plays an excellent basketcase of a character, who knows deep down what is right (following your instincts and doing what you want to do, not what your friends want you to do), but has a hard time deciding whether or not to be her own person or just go along with the Heathers.  Although Slater can, at times throughout this movie, get a bit annoying (Jack Nicholson, anyone?), but in such a way that you have a hard time deciphering whether it's just part of the character, or his acting ability (or lack thereof).  Shannen Doherty also plays a wonderful snob in what ultimately turns out to be one of the best dark comedies of the 80's.. the type of movie that is often poorly imitated but never duplicated.  
Highly recommended, especially if you went to school (any grade, anytime) during the 80's.  Even if the storyline doesn't pique your interest, off the wall humor and loads of sarcasm and cynicism will make this an enjoyable movie for you.
