Arthur, starring Dudley Moore has to be one of the funniest comedies ever made. Dudley Moore shines as the loveable Arthur (for which he earned an academy award nom.) who just can't stay sober. Just about everyone in the cast of this film is simply brilliant. Especially Dudley and the man who plays Hobson. (I forgot his real name) These two are simply magic on the screen and work off each other extremely well. Liza Minelli is also very good in this film and her and Dudley have a great chemistry together and pull off some wonderful comedy.
This has been one of my fav. comedies for a long time now and I just saw it again today and was compelled to finally write a review on it. It's so ironic, considering that Arthur is somebody current society frowns upon deeply. A womanizing, drunk who drinks and drives at every excuse and is immature and irresponsible. But you just can't help but adore him. He's as funny as funny comes and the comedy in the film is true to life. (not stupid comedy like Something about Mary or films of the like)
I have not seen the dvd version of Arthur yet, but it's a fantastic film that deserves to be on everyone's shelf. And at a price like this you couldn't possibly go wrong. Pick this movie up today and witness the pure genius that is Dudley Moore as "Arthur"
