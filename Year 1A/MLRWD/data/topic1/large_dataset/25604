It gives me no joy to write a negative review of Local Hero. This is a smart, original film, miles removed from standard Hollywood junk. I just think it's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't extend their intelligence to the task of developing more interesting character relationships.

Alas, in my view, every character and relationship in Local Hero is stereotyped and sentimentalized. There are two romances (of a sort) in the movie -- between Mac and Stella, and Oldsen and Marina -- but both of these are based on nothing much, and go nowhere. Meanwhile, the buddy-relationship between Mac and Urquhart is also obscure; first they seem antagonistic, and then they suddenly develop a low-key "bromance" that was tough for me to unpack. And while I recognize that Mac undergoes some kind of mental transformation during the film, I missed exactly how the town managed to "seduce" him; nothing seems to make a dent in his surface, hang-dog personality.

Strangest of all is the relationship between Burt Lancaster's character, Mr. Happer, and his verbally abusive therapist; this subplot threatens to become interesting at first, but soon degenerates into a series of repetitive, inexplicable, and unfunny scenes. And let's not even talk about the Wise Old Man of the Beach, who looks and talks and acts like every other Wise Old Man in the history of fiction.

In the absence of proper development for these characters, I found that the film simply meandered along to an obscure conclusion. In fairness, I didn't find the film to be slow -- it's too strange to be slow, and besides, I like controlled pacing. I just thought Local Hero got bogged down in excessive Quirkiness with a capital "Q," and never got around to the business of engaging me on a human level. And while this movie may look clever when compared to Tango & Cash, is it really as clever as La Dolce Vita, or any other classic foreign film I could mention? I just don't think it holds up to serious competition...
