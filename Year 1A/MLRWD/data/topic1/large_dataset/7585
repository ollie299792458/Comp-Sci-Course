Before there was George (I hate America) Clooney or Alec (I'm leaving) Baldwin or the other seemingly endless supply of America bashing leftists ruling Hollywierd these days. There was a class of people who made films to show the greatness of this country and the chances it gives it's people to succeed. "A little lookin' out for the other guy" was said by Sen. Smith, what a statement within a statement. Sen' Smith was chosen as a "fill-in" replacement Senator by a corrupt governor and a corrupt headman who "runs" things from behind the scenes. Little do they know what true ideals will do in the face of adversity.

This movie is a joy to watch and probably should be taught in school as a lesson in how our government works and how to take a respectful stand for what you believe in, even when all the chips are stacked against you. It also shows, now almost 70 years ago, how the press can be used by it's editors and writers to steer public opinion one way or the other. If you don't enjoy movies of this era than I ask you to open your mind and see through the crassness and decadence of today's society and enjoy a movie made by truely gifted people who weren't trying to tear something or someone down. Rather, they tried to instill dreams and confidence in the audience. Confidence in their neighbors, confidence in their way of life. Please enjoy this movie, I know you will.
