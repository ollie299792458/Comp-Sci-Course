My husband bought me this set for my birthday. It's one of my most prized possessions. I remember watching it as a child on a televison set that had a green screen! I wish I had paid more attention to it then as I'm always telling my 3 grown children that if I could go back they would have been raised like Beaver and Wally!

Just looking at Ward can sometimes bring tears to my eyes. He and June were the perfect parents. It's amusing to see how different things were back then. For instance, when one of the boys gets in trouble who does the principal ask to talk to? Ward of course! June will say is there something I can help with and the principal responds, no I really need to talk to Mr. Cleaver! That wouldn't go over too well these days!

It was a show of innocence, boys getting in trouble but they always have a guilty conscience and have to do the right thing. There are so many lessons in this series about how children should be raised, with love, affection and discipline! Ward and June were never too hard on the boys but the boys certainly got the message when they did something wrong. I can't imagine anyone in this series being played by any other actor. I watched the Small World episode and it made me very sad. I didn't want to see anyone but Hugh Beaumont and Tony Dow!

The only improvement that I would like would be for the discs to be one sided. You really have to be careful handling them.

As you can see, I love this series and can't wait for the next one!
