I saw the first W&amp;G short "A Grand Day Out" at an animation festival a long time ago when it first came out.  I thought it was cute and had strong production values, but the plot and style didn't really impress  me.  I hadn't seen the other two shorts until I purchased this DVD.
I'm  still of the same opinion of "A Grand Day Out"  , but "The  Wrong Trousers" and especially "A Close  Shave" are  extremely cute and make this DVD worth buying.  In general, if you like  sweet, gently funny (but also gently witty) animated stories told in an  adorable manner, buy this DVD!  Don't expect any really Big Thoughts or  Deep Ideas, just a very enjoyable viewing experience.  The extras on the  DVD are also quite interesting since they trace the evolution of Nick  Park's work, though it's rather sad that the Behind the Scenes Footage of  "The Wrong Trousers" seemed to comprise of only part of a TV  special rather than the whole show -- this inquiring viewer wanted to know  more!
