I have seen all of the movies made of The Secret Garden, and I have been in a stage production as well. This one is the best of any film adaptations. All the players are so much more real and likable than in the others, so it's easy to enjoy this presentation when you can get emotionally involved with the people in it.

In the stage play, the chanting scene is full of music and mystery, and is an embodiment of Mary and Colin's wonderfully heartfelt wish to somehow magically call her uncle back home, so he can see how well Colin is doing and they can be a family, healing the years of anguish and loneliness that they all have suffered in different ways. This film is the only one that even came close to capturing the essence of that scene, which is meant to be whimsical, and to further establish the magical powers of the garden and of the lingering love Lily holds for them. It does so much for the story as a whole.

I am going to purchase this DVD for the director of our stage play, who also happens to be my brother, and who did a great job with our production. It's the only one that does justice to a story that has meant so much to the whole cast and will always carry a special place in our hearts.
