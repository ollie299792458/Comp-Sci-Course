Lindsay Lohan finally returns in the eagerly awaited follow up to "The Parent Trap" reprising her roles of twin sisters Aubrey and Dakota. Instead of a straight continuation of the story the creative team opted for something more along the lines of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead II' making it more of a remake and a sequel in one by slightly changing the situation that was established in the original. Here in this film rather than have the two girls meet as Tweens and play matchmaker to their parents they instead grow up separately and don't really meet so much as feel eachother's pain so to speak. The change in tone will most likely be a turn off to fans of the original as it is a much darker film and considerably more violent. I for one enjoyed the different approach it makes for a much more satisfying sequel that also stands on it's own as opposed to a complete rehash of the original like 'Home Alone 2'. As I mentioned before this film has far more dismemberments than the original and also quite a few scenes that feature sexual situations and themes so as a warning to parents; only let your child watch this if they REALLY loved the original! That said this is a very good sequel despite the fact that the twins don't really share much screen time together so there are far less shenanigans between the two and the matchmaking has been replaced with graphic scenes of torture but I suppose this was always where the story was headed. So if you loved the original 'Parent Trap'( The Lohan one, not the Haley Mills or Olsen twins versions) and would like to see a spirited if only slightly darker follow up then I stongly reccomend this film for the whole family!!!!!
