Sam Raimi is probably one of the most underrated directors of all time. A Simple Plan is a perfect example of his brilliance. This is a story of two brothers and thier friend who find a duffel bag full of money in a crashed plane in a rural area. They must decide if they are going to keep the money or turn it in to the authorities. Bill Paxton is superbly cast as the "conservative" brother and Billy Bob Thorton is "brilliant" as the slow witted Jacob.  A Simple Plan is extremely intense throughout. An example of the "domino effect" when it comes to trusting another person.  The cinematography in A Simple Plan is outstanding. It takes place in a rural northern american town in the dead of winter. A feeling of "cold seclusion" is evident throughout the entire movie. The soundtrack is "creepy" and very fitting to the surroundings.  Any movie directed by Sam Raimi is worth watching. Any movie that has Billy Bob Thornton (one of my personal favorite actors) in it is a must for anyone who loves brilliant acting. Put these two geniouses together with a very smart and intense storyline and you have A Simple Plan. A must see for anyone who appreciates great cinema!!
