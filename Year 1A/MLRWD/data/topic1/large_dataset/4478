I own the New Line Platinum Series Special Edition of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. You get more than just the movie when you buy this. You get an extra second disc that loaded with special features, replicas of evidence photos from the crime scene, and a collector's tin shield.

I gave this movie five stars. I am a horror movie buff and I'm interested in the whole idea of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie was pretty damn good for a remake. The original movie is a classic and always will be, but this remake is almost as good. It's not always easy to remake a classic and have a positive outcome. This had no trouble with doing that though. Even though this remake is relatively close to the original, there are also quite a few differences. For example, the group of teenagers pick up a girl instead of a guy. There are some things that have been added to help liven up the movie which you'll probably notice when you watch the movie. This isn't a horror movie that has nudity, but it has just about everything else such as drugs, vulgar language, violence, gore, etc. It's all good. I don't want to explain any scenes that are in the movie. I just recommend that you do see it. You won't regret it. It's a good movie so don't listen to the bad critics giving it reviews not worth your time reading. I hope this review helped you out.
