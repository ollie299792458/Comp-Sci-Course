Without adding yet another critique of the actors, limits of the soundstage, and story recap that too many seem bent on reprising...I would just like to make the observation that this story was refreshingly unique compared to some similar productions that I would label as pro-FDR/New Deal propaganda. While some of Hollywood's preachier attempts alluded to the notion that the Federal Government would be the "Big Brother" (CCC, NRA, WPA) taking care of the people who were/are either too poor or stupid to take care of themselves, Dead End clearly illustrates the simple truth that "we" (the people) are our brother's keeper.  Not "them" (the government).

Some people today could benefit from the moral of this film. "Joe Architect" (McCrea) does the right thing. He doesn't keep his yap shut and look the other way when a crime is about to go down. He steps up and incidentally ends up taking out the murderous weasels (Bogart/Jenkins) as well as playing an active role in the lives of his neighbors in trouble (Sydney/Halop), giving of HIS time and money to better their lives. THAT is the mark of a better society. The generosity of it's people...not the feckless waste of it's government.
