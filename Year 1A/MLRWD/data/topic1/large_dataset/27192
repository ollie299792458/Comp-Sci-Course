A beautiful story and asthetically pleasing character designs and art, Jin-Roh The Wolf Brigade tells, in simple terms, the tale of Little Red Riding Hood but Jin-Roh is a bit more complicated than that. Quoting a version of Little Red Riding Hood, there are many versions of this classic fairy tale, throughout the movie, it tries to explore human nature. Set in an alternate history of Japan, Jin-Roh portrays a romance between a member of an elite Special Forces team, set in place to maintain peace in a time of civil unrest, and a Red Riding Hood, or bomb carrier who are caught up in politics and conspiracy. But it also asks an important question; can a "beast" or rather a wolf in man's clothing live among humans? Once a "beast" always a "beast".
The second disc has a number of Japanese trailors and one English trailor and althought there are many Japanese trailors most seem to be the same. The second disc, or Extras Disc, also inlcudes interviews with the creator, director, character designer, and music composer. The interviews give you a good picture of what Jin-Roh is {hisory behind it and what the story is about}, as well as their own personal feelings about the movie. The second disc also includes fairly extensive weapon, character, and background sketch galleries for those who enjoy seeing those elements in their first stages before the color, detailing, and animation processes. Personally it's a nice add in.
The third disc is the Jin-Roh Soundtrack. The music blends very well with the movie and is good by itself, especially the main theme, but is much better with the movie as most soundtrack music is. If you are a collector of anime music like I am you will enjoy this CD. If not but are a fan of music with action and/or drama and the romantic feel then you won't be disapointed. The music was composed by the same person who composed the music for Macross Plus and Escaflowne.
