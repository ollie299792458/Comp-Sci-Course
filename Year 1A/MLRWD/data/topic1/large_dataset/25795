Sorry if you are on the right--this isn't really directed at you, just the one member who seems to think a couple of online reviews speak for an entire group of people.  I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious.  The songs in particular were very funny--The Pearl Harbor one being my all time favorite.  It's definitely not humor for everyone.  If you're sensitive to Sean Penn's plight (i.e. having to get involved in EVERYTHING) then this movie is not for you--the same is true if you're a big fan of Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, conservatism, leftism, country music, "blow-em-up-real-good" politics, RENT, etc.  You name it, and it's probably made fun of here.  The only reason I personally can't give it four stars is that, like past reviewers have said, some of the humor is just silly toilet humor that isn't particularly funny.  Just some of it though--the vast majority of it is truly inpsired.

Okay, apparently you don't know what a "sweeping generalization" is, but statements like "the left has no sense of humor" qualify.  Even if you clarify the statement later, that statement (your title no less) is still a sweeping generalization.  My title was a satirical stab at yours, which I apologize for in my first sentence.  As you say though-"pointing out the truth may sometimes be painful to hear."  And just to clear things up, I was calling sweeping generalizations stupid, not you (that would be silly-I don't even know you).
