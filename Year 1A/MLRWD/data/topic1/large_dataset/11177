There are a couple reasons why I bought this:
1. I love this movie. It's such a timeless movie that I HAD to buy it.
2. I didn't have it on DVD.
3. Everything else was icing on the cake.

I wanted to make sure it came with a DVD and not just a Blu-Ray since I don't have a Blu-Ray player.  All the good stuff is on the Blu-Ray, but the DVD isn't chop liver either. Here's what you can expect in this set:

-All-New Hardcover Book The Sound of Music: A Few of our Favorite Things (It was cool learning about the real Von Trapp Family.  I didn't know they bought a farm in Stowe, Vermont in 1942 and over time turned it into a lodge and tourist site.)

-Reprint of 1965 Theatrical Souvenir Book

-Snapshots from Salzburg

Plus there's a track from Leah Michelle at the end (She plays Rachel on Glee)

While I didn't get to enjoy the Blu-Ray, I was plenty satisfied with everything else.  Plus, I have something to look forward to when I finally buy a Blu-Ray player.  This is a great movie to have as my 1st Blu-Ray movie!

If you're a huge Sound of Music fan, you can't go wrong by buying this!  You'll love it!
