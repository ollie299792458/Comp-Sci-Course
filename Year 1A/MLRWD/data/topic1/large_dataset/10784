A classic 80's comedy with big name stars and lots of cool cars! This is the type of movie that shouldn't be critiqued and nitpicked, a flick where a person should shut their brain off for an hour and a half and enjoy! 
Based on a true race event, Burt Reynolds leads the all-star cast in the ultimate racing event, The Cannonball Run! A bunch of people in souped up cars, some disgused, some not, vow for the title of WINNER in the race, and they will do anything to get it! Reynolds plays J.J. McClure, who, with his trusty sidekick Victor (Dom DeLuise), disguise their vehicle as an ambulance, thinking that cops would never pull a car like that over. Along the way, they pick up a freaky doctor (Jack Elam), and a female patient named Pamela (Farrah Fawcett). Others stand in their way, such as two female hotties (Adrienne Barbeau, Tara Buckman) in a black Lamborghini, Jackie Chan playing himself in a souped up Subaru, Roger Moore playing a man who thinks he is Roger Moore in an Aston Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin playing two fake, drunk priests in a Ferrari, Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw as two hicks who take 5 caseloads of beer and one bag of chips for the race, Burt Convy playing a wall street stuntman who races with his motorcycle on one wheel the whole time and Jamie Farr as an Arab Sheik vowing to win the race for the Nation of Islam!
The action and comedy are great, Dino and Sammy really ham it up as the two fake priests and I also think the two females in the Lambo who unzip there suits everytime a cop shows up is also great comedy. The title song is also a great one, it's fast and catchy, it definitely stays with you after seeing the movie. There are a lot of in-jokes throughout the movie so be sure to pay attention to what they are saying, or you'll miss them. Followed by "Cannonball Run II" in 1984 and an unofficial sequel titled "Speed Zone!" in 1989.
