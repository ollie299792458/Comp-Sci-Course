Do you think you know the basics of the Amish people? I thought I did until I saw this documentary. VERY interesting look at the age of decision for Amish kids. I was surprised to see what kinds of trouble the kids get into while trying out the "English" way of living. This video will really make you question the Amish way of life. I though that the Amish religion was a sect of Christianity that followed the regular tenants of the religion. Now, I think its more of a cult that makes up extra-biblical rules for no apparent reason than one of the higher ranking men think its a good thing to do.
This movie really points out the need for a "middle of the road" lifestyle. It shows kids who rebel to the point where they have death threats, find that they like the sex, drugs, and alcohol better than the lifestyle they have been living their entire lives. This movie also points out the lures that the "world" can have on anyone. This movie also shows how the Amish have a good grasp on grace. They accept these kids back into their society after their decision making time regardless of what has happened to them in the past. This movie also shows how the Amish can reject their own when they decide that the Amish lifestyle is contrary to their own beliefs. Unfortunately, it gives credibility to the abuse that churches often inflict on people.
