Futurama Volume 1-4

Futurama the Series

Simply put, one of the best series ever created.  There is so much detail put into the animation its amazing.  You could watch the episodes 100 times and still find new things every time you watch it.  Definitely ranks as top 3 in my all time best TV shows.  It's a shame it was cancelled.

Comparison

This is simply put one of the most amazing boxsets out there.  The colors and quality of the episodes are absolutely amazing.  Compared to other boxsets like The Simpsons, Family Guy, ATHF, etc; this boxset has some of the best extras and "best bang for the buck" value.

-one of the few DVD boxsets that actually allow you to pick scenes in the episodes (YES like movies!)

-TONS of extras, deleted scenes, etc etc.  worth the price JUST for the ridiculous amounts of extras.

-the boxset case is the absolute highest quality, best looking, and well done case I've ever seen or owned

Price

At first glance, the price may scare you off (I know it made me think for a few days), but I assure you that it is well worth it.

-first off, if you were to buy this at bestbuy or something, it would cost you roughly $200.  at $119, this is a STEAL.

-Unlike other TV boxsets that basically JUST give you the episodes, this boxset gives you TONS of extras.  It is well worth the price just to get all the extras.

-I would highly suggest you purchase it from amazon.  While shopping around; I check out ebay (~$150), bestbuy (~$200), and circuit city (~$180) and none were as low as amazon.
