The breakfast club is without doubt the biggest mixed bag of a film that i have ever seen. Its good in the way that its the most 80's film that you'll ever see, and its bad in the way that it's the most 80's film that you'll ever see. In other words its good in places but cheesy as tangy cheesy cheese in others.
The story itself to me is pretty ludicrous, five kids get detention and then over the course of the film become close freinds after they express their deepest emotions to each other. Now maybe im just too much of a cynic but i can honestly say that in all the times that i was in detention i didnt want to talk to anyone.
The acting is also really bad yet good in its own 80's way. The performances from Judd Nelson and the Teacher guy are so over the top that these guys cant even see planet earth anymore,and thats not me being sarcastic thats me being truthful, I apologise to all the people who hold John Bender close to their soul, its just my opinion, I am a rudos luchadore after all.
The only real grudge that i have with this film is the soundtrack, I apologise again but that Simple Minds song makes me want to chainsaw my own face off.
But I can see past that and appreciate what is a quite enjoyable film, just dont expect an experience that films like Kill Bill, LotR, Night of the living dead, and True Romance will give you just expect a good way to waste a few hours.
