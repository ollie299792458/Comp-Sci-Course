I've been a Friends fan ever since it first aired in 1994. Watching the first season again reminded me of why I fell in love with the show in the first place - strong characters and fantastic writing. From the pilot onwards, each character had a distinct voice and could carry their own storylines.

It's also one of the few shows on television that can make me really laugh out loud. Who could forget Joey giving Ross advice on how to talk dirty? Or a flustered Chandler stuck in an ATM vestibule with a Victoria's Secret model? Or Monica pulling back a shower curtain to sneak a peek at Joey's 'pee-pee', only to find it was Joey Sr. soaping up in there?

Not to mention, the building up of the characters' histories that play out into the entire series. Season 1 is where Ross finds out his lesbian ex-wife is pregnant with his child. It is where we first see Monica's strained relationship with her parents, especially her mother. We see Chandler's countless insecurities and his use of humor as a defense mechanism. We see Rachel struggle to get her footing in her completely new life. I especially love how they incorporated the character of Ursula, the ditzy waitress from Mad About You as Phoebe's twin sister. I also love seeing how Joey's character develops from a 'typical playboy' to a guy with real heart (as seen in TOW the Boobies, and TOW the Birth).

The DVDs also include great bonus features for fans (though I personally wish there was more). The pilot has an audio commentary from the producers of the show. Plus, there's never before seen footage in each episode -  it's always fun to try and spot those scenes.

This is definitely some of the best television ever. No wonder 13 years later, people are still watching.
