I've loved "Hamlet" since I was 17, and seen many different movie versions of it.  What I like best about this version are the little nuances, the tiny moments that provide bits of insight into the story or the characters.

For instance, the way that Laertes (Liev Schreiber) interacts with Ophelia (Julia Stiles) provides many of these moments.  When he leaves at the beginning of the film, he takes one of her barrettes with him.  When she's gone mad, he keeps putting his arms protectively around her, like a big brother who wants to shield his shattered sister would.

Another example is the way that Polonious and Laertes always seem to be looking past each other.  There's father-and-son affection there, but they're really very distant.  Polonious wants to seem like a good father to Laertes and Ophelia, always dispensing advice, but you really get that he has no idea who they are.

(SPOILAGE ALERT) At the very end, they throw a great twist in -- Gertrude understands not only that Claudius killed her husband, but that he's trying to poison her son.  She drinks the poison out of both remorse for her past actions and in a vain attempt to save her son.

All in all, it's a solid modernization of the story.  Some of my favorite parts of the play are missing, but the meat is there.
