My 15-month old daughter loves this video! We had been watching My Baby Can Talk-First Signs for a while, and we were both sick and tired of it! (Don't get me wrong, it's a great video, but we had been watching it for too long :-)). This new video caught my daughter's interest and attention immediately! She laughed and smiled throughout the video, and after watching it only once, she started signing for "plane". We've been watching it for a couple of weeks now, and she's already signing for at least 10 of the words presented there. I love the fact that there are so many different people in this video. In addition to the adorable little girl who demonstrates each sign, and who appears in the First Signs video, too, there's a cute little boy, three other babies and a few adults. This gives the video variety and is really fun to watch. It also teaches useful words such as "daddy" "mommy" "diaper" "cracker" and introduces the concepts of "please" and "thank you". All and all, a wonderful purchase. I highly recommend it!
