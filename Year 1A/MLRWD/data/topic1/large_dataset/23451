Not going to bother with the story line. If you have not seen it, I don't want to spoil your viewing experience with bits and pieces of useless details about the film which you will soon find out for yourself.

What I can tell you, however, is that I was completely speechless for about 20 minutes after the final credit rolled off the TV screen. Usually, I hit the stop button even before the first credit comes up when I am done with a movie but... oh no.. not this movie. I was so enervated by the sheer choking death grip of this unapologetic cinema that I couldn't careless about turning off the TV or DVD. I just sat there... dumbfounded.. totally, utterly disturbed and entertained at the same time.

I am sure my mouth was open for the entire time and no sound came out other than occasional f** and s** and several crude English vocabularies deemed unfit for public use by the FCC.

Those of you who have seen it... will agree with me, or at least understand what I mean when I saw the final twist that shook Daesoo Oh to his core and sent him to unmerciful eternal damnation fit for a page out of Dante's Inferno, I unknowingly stood up and yelled at the top of my lungs at the TV screen cussing up a storm. It was a scream for personal salvation as much as highest praise I can bestow on actors and the director of Oldboy.

What did I just see? Can I unsee it? If I close my eyes and pretend that I didn't just see what I saw.. will it go away? Then... a sudden realization hits me... my gosh.. as sick and twisted as it is... this is cinema at its best.

Watch this for cinematic beauty, gripping story telling, flawless or incredibly flawed personalities acted out by gifted actors. Most of all, watch this film because this is a movie Hollywood can only wish it can make.
