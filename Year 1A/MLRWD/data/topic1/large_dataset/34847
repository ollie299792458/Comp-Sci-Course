I finally got around to ordering and watching this DVD. As a fan that watched these two come up through the WWE ranks, and as someone who sites Bret Hart as a personal hero, this DVD was a MUST. I ended up getting it for my birthday and today I took the time to watch it.

To hear these two legends speak of their careers and to have the always excellent JR conducting the interview was almost to unreal to believe. The interview delivers and I for one was completely satisfied. Listening to Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels talk about how things started off with mutual respect and degenerated into a personal rivalry with each guy taking very personal verbal cheap-shots at each other week in and week out on national TV during the late 90's was so incredibly fascinating.

As a fan I watched this unfold as it happened. I was glued to RAW in those days and it was so great to see the classic clips and segments with the two guys involved talking about how this all came to be. Of course the Montreal incident was discussed, the emotion from both men, as they reflect on those events was moving.

I can't say enough about this DVD. I am a die-hard Bret Hart fan, and this DVD delivered. I have to use another day or two to go over all the extras. It is nice to have all those matches in one great place.

The one thing that I was wishing, is that Bret never had that stroke. If Bret and Shawn could have a match today they would school everybody currently employed in todays WWE.

If you were a fan this is a DVD for you!
