Unless you grew up in Indiana and experienced "Hoosier Hysteria" first hand, you can never understand this movie completely. For the longest time, the state of Indiana had one big state high school basketball tournament. Every high school that had a boys varsity basketball team was automatically in the tournament, you did not have to qualify. It was much like March Madness in the sense that you would have very small schools (much like Hickory in the movie) knocking off the bigger schools in the state and making their season right then and there. It didn't matter if they went on to win the state tournament, it was the magic of the David vs. Goliath type game where the little guy prevailed.

About 8-10 years ago the smaller schools in the state decided they wanted their own tournament, reducing the state to "class basketball" based on the size of the school. 4A being the largest and 1A being the smallest, there is now 4 state champions rather than one. Therefore, we will never get the chance to experience the "Milan Miracle" for which the movie 'Hoosiers' is based on ever again.

Thanks a lot to the little guys who just could not stand the fact that the bigger schools won most of the time, but every now and then that one Hickory Huskers type team came along and pulled the  upset, Cinderella story, etc..........
