Actually, I think that nearly every James Bond movie could be called "stupid but fun," but this one has more fun than any other in quite a few years.  If you're looking for a thoughtful plot and well-drawn characters, well, what are you doing looking at a James Bond film?  But if you want James Bond doing what he does (blowing stuff up, drinking martinis), well, this movie is as good as most of the others.
I'm surprised to be saying this, because I agree with most of the criticisms leveled at the movie.  Yes, the villian Renard is a non-entity, and by the end of the movie, he's more pitiable than threatening.  And Pierce Brosnan still hasn't quite recaptured that wounded, cynical flavor that made Goldeneye such an exceptional movie.  And you probably didn't notice the outcry when Denise Richards was passed over for an Oscar (the award for Most Inappropriately Dressed Nuclear Physicist having been eliminated the year before).
But the good far outweighs the bad.  Let's face it -- when you go to see a James Bond movie, you're looking for excessive explosions and gunplay.  Here, you get excessive explosions and gunplay.  You also get solid acting by Sophie Marceau and Judi Dench.  And even the most ardent detractor must admit that Pierce Brosnan at 75%, as he is here, is about 20 times as good as Roger Moore at 100%.  All this is to say, leave your thinking cap at the door and enjoy the beautiful sight of stuff blowing up.  You'll feel much better.
