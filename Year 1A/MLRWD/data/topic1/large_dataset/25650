Potential viewers shouldn't be deterred by pointless and ridiculous commentaries of seemingly short-attention-spanned reviewers who like other bands anyway and shouldn't bother writing about Led Zeppelin.This movie was meant to present the four individuals of the band in a collective context,therefore each group memeber is showcased in the live footage and in a fantasy sequence.The original three-hour concert is not fully used,instead relevant parts where interwoven with off-stage scenes,hence creating a closer outlook on each individual.Jimmy Page is featured on 'Dazed And Confused'(where he plays a sort of warlock),Robert Plant on the "double header" 'Song Remains/Rain Song'(with an Arthurian character),John Bonham on 'Moby Dick'(he preferred an honest,family-and-friends environment) and John Paul Jones on 'No Quarter'(presenting himself as a man with two faces,one as a musician and one as a"pater familias").The live footage is superb and so is the playing.Critics of the era always stated the difference between the heavily orchestrated studio versions and the four-piece live arragements,often calling them "thin";their gullable readers trusted this assumptions and not their ears,and the accusation is present to this day.I'm not old enough to have seen Led Zeppelin Live but I have read such articles and I do trust my ears and you can trust yours by listening to this DVD,its soundtrack,the Led Zeppelin DVD and 'How The West Was Won' on CD,you'll be able to tell if live Led Zeppelin is worthy of the legend they created.The marvellous renditions of 'Since I've Been Loving You','Stairway','No Quarter',the title track,'Dazed','Heartbreaker/Whole Lotta Love' and the sheer power of the band on stage in '73 are enough reasons to purchase this DVD.There's a criticism by someone who claims to have seen Zeppelin in '77,if you want to experience the awesome power of the band in '77 go to the Led Zeppelin DVD,on disc two select promos and the menu is a bootleg recording of the June 21st concert at the L.A. Forum with accompanying bootleg footage(from Birmingham and NY),listen an marvel at it(the picture is not very good but the audio is excellent,that is why it was relegated to a menu feature).The only drawbacks in the movie are the re-enacment of some bits-mostly close-ups(Page had to struggle with gaps in the footage to match with the audio) that are only apparent by very close inspection.Also the audio editting suffers somewhat when matching,almost by force,some scenes.This does not occur on the soundtrack where such limitations where not imposed by the lack of visuals.Also the output of the DVD is not as loud as the Led Zeppelin DVD,but the '76 mixing work is outstanding.Another inhibiting factor is that the fantasy sequences are shown during some instrumentals,and songs like 'Over The Hills',although played at this concerts of July '73 when the shooting of the film took place,were discarded.This DVD is a great remnant of the Led Zeppelin experience.Miss it at your own risk.
