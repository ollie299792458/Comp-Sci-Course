Woody reaches his greatest heights with this movie. Of all his other great movies (of which there are many), I think only Manhanttan can rival this one in terms of story and character development. Since I got my DVD player (two years ago), I've been patiently waiting for this one to become available. I can't urge you strongly enough to purchase this movie. Not only a great intertwined plot, but Woody giving one of his funniest performances. If you're a Woody Allen fan, then I'm sure you've seen this one already. And for the uninitiated, this is a great introduction to the later Woody movies. Woody has sometimes gotten other actors to play his character in his movies (see Kenneth Brannagh in Celebrity doing his best impersonation of Woody or John Cusack in Bullets over Broadway)and while they do a good job, the original is just better. This one has it all, Woody, award winning performances from Diane Weist and Michael Caine, a brilliant supporting cast and a great screenplay. Run, don't walk to purchase this one. It's a guaranteed winner.
