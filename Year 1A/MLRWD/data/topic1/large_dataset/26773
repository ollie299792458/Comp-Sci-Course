Is there a better opening sequence in the history of film-making than the picturesque montage of Matrix and his daughter frolicing in the woods surrounding their rural hide-away?  Here we see the two of them having breakfast; here they are petting a dear, turning their heads to pose for the camera.  A true Kodak moment! Believe me, there has never been a more happy father-daughter tandem than Matrix and his Jenny. But then the hapless duo are beseiged by an army of mysterious Latin Americans and a guy that looks a little too much like Freddy Mercury to believe he is actually a worthy adversary of our superhero.  Holding his daughter ransom, the kidnappers try to force Matrix into assassinating a Latin American politician.  But Arnold has something else in mind!  He does a little kidnapping of his own, but of course the beauty that he captures ends up falling for Arnold's compassion and musculature, and ends up helping him in his quest to save Jenny.  The two of them have a series of wholesome, plutonic bonding experiences, such as stealing a bunch of artillery - including a rocket launcher - from a local department store.  There are no surprises here - just typical Arnold v. Army battles sequences, with Arnold easily taking on hundreds of soldiers, only suffering minor shrapnel injuries.  
Movies like this aren't made anymore; or, if they are, they go straight to video.  This flick is a relic, a time capsule from the Reagan years.  While it embraces such Reagan ideals as the rugged individual, it also seems to subtely criticize Reagan-style imperialism.  Although Matrix certainly doesn't agree with the Latin American guerilla tactics, he doesn't exactly embody American patriotism either.  He stands separate from politics, critical and suspicious of all who seek power, wanting only the love of his daughter, and some nice interracial hanky-panky.
