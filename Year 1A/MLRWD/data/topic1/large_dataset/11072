This Movie has a powerful view and impact on certain issues that arose in the time it was set. But it is based on a work of fiction. Therefore I am pretty sure it has a message to send across just like many if not all movies...besides "Die Hard." It is a powerful movie that has impacted so many for a reason. It gave us hope, it let us see the impact on so many lives.

Every scene has you riveted, and takes you on this long journey with "Celie." You feel for her character, and want her to find some happiness through so much adversity. You want so much for her to have her happy moments. Both Goldberg and Jackson were flawless in their roles as Celie. And who could forget the powerful scene where Nettie and Celie are parted. Still gives me goosebumps.

It is truly a classic piece of movie making history.
So even if you hate "chick flicks" (though it is not one) and have some issue with certain views.
I think the awards can speak for themselves.
