I grew up watching this movie. It's one of a select few films from my childhood in the 90s that have achieved a place in my heart that can NEVER be removed(Aliens, Terminator 2 are some of the others). I've always loved this film.

Watching it again on Blu Ray after many years...I'm in love with it all over again. In fact, I've forgotten how good it was.

With all the hype over Nolan's films, this film has become forgotten and underrated it seems. Which is a damn shame considering it's the best film of the franchise.

The acting is top notch, but what surprised me was how good Danny Devito was as the Penguin. He's portrayal of the disgusting, yet tragic, interpretation of the character makes him the best villian out of all the films (Yes, even better than Ledger, who while doing a good job, DID NOT top Nicholson).

The standout though in all of the awesomeness within the film is Danny Elfman's score. Everything about it hits the right notes to bring out the emotion within every scene. Special mention must be given to "The Finale" as the piece with or without the scene involving Penguin's death, still brings me to tears. It's just that good.

The Blu Ray Transfer of this movie is spectacular with scenes that would be put many recent movies to shame.

So do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie.

You won't regret it.
