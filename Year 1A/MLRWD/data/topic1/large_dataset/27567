The Eagle has Landed may be seen as two movies, out of synch with each other. The first is a very fine move driven by an ensemble cast that has just the right touch with WWII era characters. Donald Pleasance is scary as the powerful, pathological Himler, Duvall as a trapped, brilliant intellegence colonel in the German high  command, and Sutherland is brilliant as a charming, ruthless IRA spy. Even the minor characters are well drawn and do not give off false notes. Jenny Agutter convincingly plays a local young women who is dragged by her heart into events and Jean Marsh is troubling as a Nazi spy who insinuates herself into English country life.

The "other" movie is burdened by the almost impossible to believe framework and fantastic details of the plot, which is that a two-squad group of crack German commandoes is to kidnap Churchill from an seaside report disguised as Polish troops, with the help of an IRA spy who has been there less than a week. Of course, armed only with a phony letter from Hitler and the urging of Himler, an intellegence colonel is going to set this whole thing in motion and provide command, control and liason. And, the Germans are going to wear their real uniforms under the fake Polish ones, for some reason of honor that escaped my understanding. For anyone with any undertanding of Hitler's war machine, British homeland defense or the wartime bunkering of Churchill, all this is too much to suffer gladly.

So, the fine cast moves along, being driven and reacting by events that are logical within the framework of the plot, which is incredible.

In the end, the personal stories of the characters win out, and are quite memorable, while the plot line seems, as a narrator-like figure says about the secrecy of the portrayed event, like it "ever happened."
