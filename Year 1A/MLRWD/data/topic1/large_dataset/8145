I, too, saw this last night on TCM, along with the very welcome documentary about Budd Boetticher's life.  Some years ago I became a big fan of the Boetticher/Scott cycle of westerns when a local repertory movie house showed a double feature of The Tall T and Ride Lonesome.  That last image of the burning tree which ended Ride Lonesome really stayed with me.  Ever since then I've searched in vain for any of the Boetticher/Scotts on VHS and later DVD.  I certainly hope this release heralds the methodical release of all six others on DVD.  The film itself was a perfect start to the series, with Lee Marvin in fine form as an arrogant, insinuating presence.  I find it hard, ultimately, to put into words just WHY these films are so damn good.  Yes, there's fine cinematography of the western landscape, but many genre flicks have that.  Perhaps it's the sure, confident handling of well-worn conventions, the charm of Scott, the more "felt" quality of the violence.  In any case, having grown up a movie lover but a Western skeptic, Boetticher showed me that westerns can be truly involving films.

Release them all!!!
