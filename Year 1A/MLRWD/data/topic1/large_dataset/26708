As much as I like "uncut" Shakespeare, I found this film a fun little gem. The meshing of 1930's music, black and white "newsreels," and the variety of talents made for an enjoyable viewing.

I really liked the entire look of the film, from the "all the credits at the beginning" (just like films done before the 1970's) to the use of specific colors to for each character's costumes to changing Holofernes to Holofernia (it makes the utterances of the vicar about "society" mean a lot more than I thought it did when I read the play in high school).

Some reviewers complain about the presence and "lack of ability" of the 2 Americans in the cast. I didn't think that they did a bad job at all. Also, the fact that most of the performers are mainly actors rather than singers and dancers didn't bother me either. I prefer a good actor delivering the lines and emotions properly and dancing "amatuerly" than having it the other way around.

My overall favorite sequence is the "farewell" scene where each pair of lovers arrange to meet a year and a day hence and they sing "They Can't Take That Away From Me" followed by a "newsreel" of what happens to them all during that "year and a day" and the reunion at the end of the film.

Additionally, my niece watched it with me and she is now reading Shakespeare's comedies, watching other films and reading about the history of the first half of the 20th century. I can't call the film a failure when it has that effect on someone.
