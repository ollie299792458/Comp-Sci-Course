I own a number of MST3K box sets as well as the "essential collection".  From my experiences with the boxsets, this is the best set so far.  There are actual extras, as well as the original movie trailers, something that they have neglected in the Rhino sets, hopefully Shout Factory will continue in this vein.

The fact that these are in their own slim cases with lengthier descriptions on each case gives a little context to the episode as it pertains to MST3K (example: on the back of Laserblast it notes that it was the last Comedy Central episode.)
The bonus features are informative if a little drab, the "oral history" is predominately sit down interviews with a few shots from the show dropped in, but the KTMA footage is interesting.  The extras are (as usual) really geared at hardcore fans.

But the episodes in this collection are some of the strongest work in the whole series.  I prefer Mike to Joel(Joel only gets one appearence in this set), and Werewolf and Future War are my favorites of this set.  But First Spaceship on Venus is very funny and Laserblast has some hilarious moments.

I don't know if a first timer is going to drop $40 on a DVD set, but if you are a "casual fan" this is a great set to start your collection with.
