The first half of this movie is magnificent.  Altman effortlessly handles the complexity of both the "masters" and the servants, as they settle in for the weekend.  The performances are spot on (even Ryan Phillipe is actually more than adequate given that his inadequacies are properly used), and the script and direction are perfect.  I don't think that I've ever seen a movie that explored these dynamics so successfully.  (Aside:  anybody who sees this and wishes that they were a member of the English aristocracy has problems best dealt with outside of such a hierarchical situation.)
So, what's wrong with it?  Previous reviewers were right in saying that it isn't really a good whodunnit.  That's fine.  Uniquely, though, it becomes almost tedious once something starts happening.  This isn't a fault, really, especially as the the end result adds poignancy to the whole.  It's just that the third act is a little boring, even with the wonderful build up and thought-provoking denouement.
I recommend this movie without reservation, except to say that I wish that Altman et al. had carried through a little better.  Still, an almost perfect movie about a happily lost time of manners uber alles.
PS: How many people when seeing such films always see themselves as part of the aristocracy?  The odds are against you, you know.  Sorry, couldn't resist.
