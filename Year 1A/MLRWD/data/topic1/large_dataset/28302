As movies go, The Man Who Would Be King is one of the all time best. It has barely aged at all (perhaps Caine's hair do is a bit dated) and is an example of great filmmaking. Probably by today's standard's it lags a bit in places (it's called pacing kids) and has some great action sequences but not too many exploding things. And don't forget that this movie was made before CGI etc (although several scenes are clearly matte paintings, but even those are top notch).

In short a really good, entertaining action/historical adventure film that anyone should be able to enjoy.

The DVD itself is fairly amazing. Yes, the DVD is one of those "two sided" deals that you will have to flip over half way through the movie, and yes, the movie tends to just start. You have to press menu to get to the menu, but those are minor quibbles. The real joy here is the amazingly clear picture transfer that was done for this film. Trust me, I have seen worse (Fiddler on the Roof for one). There are no marks, drop out or defects during the movie. Someone has really gone through and done a first class clean up job. It looks like it was filmed yesterday on digital film.

The extras are interesting, so to speak. The 12 minute short "It Must Be Magic" is interesting in that is has dated very badly (it goes on about how Moroccans have never seen movies etc., in a very un PC way) but provides some insights. Warning: DO NOT watch it until you have seen the movie as it contains a fairly huge spoiler!

There are also several fairly useless text info screens about Kipling and Masons etc. The other previews are for other films (although an original trailer for The Man Who Would Be King is on there too).

In short, as good as you remember it and a pristine presentation make this a must have!
