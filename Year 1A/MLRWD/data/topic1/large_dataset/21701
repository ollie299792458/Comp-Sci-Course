And if your fate is to see this video game disquised as a 'movie' then your 'Fate' is no better than mine.

What a steaming piece of junk.

I won't bother deliniating the proposterous plot. I won't lampoon the inane 'script' since this is more a ripoff than the Scary Movie series. At least those films didn't have any false pretesnse.

What a pretty package. Lovely to look at, but don't get downwind. I've seen worse movies. Hence the two stars: One for the processes used in making the film look so amazing, one for the set pieces, which so long as you overlooked anything else, were pretty to look at.

But I've seen better scripts on YouTube.

Drivel. Unrelenting misdirection. Huge logical disconnects. And voice work nearly as good as the stuff you might catch on Saturday morning cartoons.

This is an action piece, so you expect a high death count. But honestly, the botched attempts at 'meaning' and pathos were almost humorous. Too bad to enjoy, and not bad enough to enjoy as a 'bad' movie.

Stay away.
