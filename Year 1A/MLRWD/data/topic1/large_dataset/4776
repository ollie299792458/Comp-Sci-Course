I'm not sure who this movie was made for. If you have never read the books, you will be utterly confused. If you HAVE read the books, you will be utterly OFFENDED and APPALLED at the blatent disregard for everthing Anne Rice wrote. The ONLY saving graces were the music, the queens costumes, and the stunning portrayal of Marius by Vincent Perez. Aaliyah's one and only good scene was her taking out the "Adrmirals Arm's" - which was perhaps THE MOVIES only good scene. Stuart Townsend i'm afraid confused the roll of Lestat with the roll of THE CROW. Or was this atrocity perhaps the fault of the director? "NO NO NO!!! POSE MORE!!! TILT YOUR HEAD DOWN AND STARE THROUGH THAT BROWN SMUDGE AROUND YOUR EYES THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE! YEAH! THAT'S IT! THAT'S GOOD ACTING!!" And yes this is minor, but who exactly was it who decided EVERYONE'S hair color had to be made the exact OPPOSITE from how it was written! ...  Please take the above warning and, if you must see it due to your loyalty to Aaliyah, trust me...wait for the video.
