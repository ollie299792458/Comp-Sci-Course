this is a film about sexual control and domination. the heroine is in submission to a sexy male boyfriend, who refuses to have sex with her as part of an obvious male power trip. forced to seek her freedom, she embarks on a variety of relationships, including a long term s&m affair and a random encounter in the street, that explore the limits of her control or lack of it. the denouement includes a sexy male boyfriend who finds himself interested but no longer in control, and a pregnancy, which in this film is the ultimate female burden and the ultimate female liberation. the lead is extremely well played, not all that physically attractive (she lacks the curves shown on the dvd cover!) but smoldering and sexy in a seemingly spontaneous way (she has two seduction scenes where her hair is her best asset). her pain is often subtly played, not with screaming but with resignation. the seduction "duel" between herself and the old lothario, where the issue is really who is seducing whom, is the erotic high point, nicely done. well worth seeing.
