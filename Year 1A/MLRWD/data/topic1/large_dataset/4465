This isn't one of the best movies for me or one I'd want to watch again.  However, I appreciate the originality of the story and the outstanding execution of it.  I agree others that this felt like a movie master piece in terms of how the scenes were shot and how the story unfolded like peeling an onion.  I liked the layers of the story and its characters.

Here are the highlights.

PROS:
- Solid acting
- Great casting
- Visually appealing
- Well executed storyline (and what a story!)
- Characters had depth and were well developed
- The beginning and the middle kept me intrigued

CONS:
- Rape scene (I always appreciate a heads up on that)
- I agree with some of the reviews about the ending.  It was a simple ending.  I expected some kind of emotional break down or something more intense.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie and am glad I watched it.  Would I watch it again?  No.  Would I recommend to others?  Yes, definitely for some.  It's not for everyone.  I wouldn't recommend it to my parents for example.
