Good stuff. If you liked the 'Prophecy' trilogy (I did) and/or 'Constantine' (this too I liked), you'll like this.  Angels killing demons, demons killing angels, angels killing each other, with talking monkeys caught in the middle (that would be us). The archangel Gabriel mesmerizes as the ever-loyal, dutiful, devoted son of Heaven facing off against the archangel Michael, who's come to save mankind from Heaven's wrath (where's Lucifer in this mess?). And--wait for it--the angels are packing some serious shoot-'em-up hardware. Cool stuff.

But wait! I'm sure that--when presented with such blasphemy and heresy--theologists, historians of religion, and the devoutly righteous (and everyone else who's standing around waiting for the world to end) will probably stick forks in their eyes, drop to their knees, look to the sky, and spew out some "talking in tongues" psycho-babble, all while howling and beating themselves with whips. But who cares? Who lets these "I see dead people" UFO abductees in the clubhouse, anyway?

This is good, fun stuff. Grab it.
