For the novice fan of Johnny Depp (i.e., "Edward Scissorhands" and "Pirates of the Carribean"), this movie will prove to be a pleasant surpise, into the world that Mr. Depp truly dwells.  His portrayal of a man, William Blake, already broken, yet unknowing of his future, is exuberantly interesting and beautifully unsettling.  Jim Jarmusch is known for his keen sense of cinematography and laughs, but this picture shoots straight from the hip of seriousness and straight-forward conciousness:  Silent, subtle, and poignant, this film is brilliant.
  Driven by a powerful subtext, this movie finds Johnny Depp as William Blake (hint:  Not the dead poet) who is steering a seemingly promising life, straight into a dimming light, toward a city of burgeoning industry, somewhere in the old west.  Complete with an encounter with a an Native American Indian named Nowhere, whom soon becomes his guide, he sets out to find, unknowingly, what it is that his life has in store for him.  Throughout his travels, deep into woodlands, he makes his way toward, to meet what it is he does not yet completely understand.
  The underratted facet of this movie, is the fact that it is shot completely in black and white (or, as my friends refer to it, Blake and White); an aspect of film that has not been efficiently accomplished since "Young Frankenstein".  A perfectly foreshadowing cameo from Crispin Glover rounds out a cast that includes Robert Mitchum and Iggy Pop.  Watch this and please be impressed by the purely natural feel to this movie, for it is an art that has been lost with the passing of such directors as Alfred Hitchcock and Akira Kurosawa.
