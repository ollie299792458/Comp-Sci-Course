This engaging movie tells a tricky love story with warmth, humor, and great intelligence.  The story centers on the relationship between two very different high school classmates.  Steven Carter -- "a young guy who  just happens to be gay," as he describes himself -- engages his  particular circumstances with a cautious determination to be his true self.  Skinny, intelligent, a bit of a geek and a cheerful survivor, he displays  the scriptural mixture of the lamb's innocence and the serpent's cunning.  In a park men's room, he is surprised and pleased to encounter John Dixon,  a star athlete currently dating the most glamorous girl in town.  John  shares Steven's longings and, falteringly, begins to respond to his  implicit, gentle invitation to "get real" about his deepest  nature and to live an authentic life.  But John has a lot to lose....  Steven and John make a highly original screen couple, and the sweetness and  tensions of their relationship are limned with unusual clarity, care, and  understanding.
