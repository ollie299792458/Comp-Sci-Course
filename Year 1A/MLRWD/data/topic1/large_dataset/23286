The movie Twister is one of my favorite "disaster movies". I have watched it 50 or more times.  The special effects are so cool and the acting is really good, especially Helen Hunt, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Jami Gertz. I have owned the regular DVD for some time and because I recently acquired a Blu-ray player and love the great picture and sound it affords, I decided to duplicate this movie and get the Blu-ray version.  I have to say that after watching it the first time I can't really tell that much difference in the Blu-ray compared to the standard wide-screen version and was a little disappointed in that.  I didn't think the resolution of the picture was as good as the other Blu-rays I have seen.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sound was a little better. As prices of Blu-rays continue to drop I will continue to purchase them in lieu of the standard ones, but right now they are still fairly pricey. BUT if you love Twister and have a Blu-ray player I still recommend you buy the Blu-ray because it is closer to the price of the standard DVD than many current releases and the sound alone is worth that little difference.
