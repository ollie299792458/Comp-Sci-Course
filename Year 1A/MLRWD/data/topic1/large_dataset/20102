Michael Learned was actually my draw to buy this film - I was just interested in what 'Mum Walton' was up to in her career. The film pulled me in from the start, however, I'm going to have to review the time sequence better (I did find that the only issue that prevented me from giving 5 stars after first watch.) As an adoptee myself, I always find it interesting to see how other men handle the issue. (I have not been interested in finding the birth mother.) The story wreaks of what I think is wrong with the south and this nation at the moment - the religious element is of little use to human kind when used against others.

Performances were excellent across the board and I think with the exception of Chris Sarandon's character the others seemed like people I'd like to meet. I am a reserved sort of viewer, but I felt there were no real issues in this film that would prevent someone +13yrs from watching. I think we are fooling ourselves to think we don't know at least someone who is gay no matter what age we are.
