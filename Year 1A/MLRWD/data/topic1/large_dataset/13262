I just finished watching Hesher. Now there are very few things I actually take the time to come on here and write a review about. This movie was 5 star in every imaginable way. I know the critics gave it chilly reviews and people on here were less friendly to it than that. The only explanation is that they plain just didn't get it. It had everything. It was funny, disturbing, dramatic, and made you think. The acting was superb by all involved. And the writing while yes, quite vulgar, was not vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. It had a point to it as it helped to shape the mindset of the character Hesher, and continued to help show the intensifying frustration and grief of the family as time went on. Absolutely destined to be a cult classic. Most movies that have become a cult classics were critically shunned when they first came out, most were brushed off as being offensive or nonsense. It was only later that people would begin to understand the films, and I do believe that this is what will happen with this absolute gem of a film.
 So if you are tired of cookie cutter Hollywood movies, and bored to tears of yawn inspiring indie dramas, you should definitely check out Hesher, as it offers something different, something wonderful, and most of all, something that makes you think. Absolutely brilliant, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
