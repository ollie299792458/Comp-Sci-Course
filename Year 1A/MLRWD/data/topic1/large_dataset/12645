If he were alive, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel would have been amused to find out that one of Moscow's popular cafes was named after this film. It is not surprising because the Russians enjoy abstract, modernistic ideas (Marxism was one), or at least used to. The oddball cinema is a conduit to transmit these ideas into unsuspecting minds. Amaze the bourgeois; overturn conventionality for effect was Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's goal. But the director was talented enough to go beyond that. The movie is a hypnotic tale of strange situations (quite without a plot) where characters exist in a dream-like state - all with compulsive urges to entertain themselves. The blatant self-indulgence is the only action. This mode of society, Bu&ntilde;uel hints, doesn't offer a chance of salvation, or as the Buddhist would say, no escape from the circle of Samsara. To me, the movie has a hint of a critique of our western way, as if it coming from someone who is not grounded in the Christian paradigm, or coming from the East. Bu&ntilde;uel had in fact rejected official Christianity and made a mockery of it. He was a Spaniard who was shocked and disgusted by ultra-conservative Catholic prelates cozying up with Spanish fascists in the 1930s, even though his friend Salvador Dali had played with the fascist ideas. Bu&ntilde;uel anti-fascism (and anti-imperialism) is perhaps the explanation why the Russians honor him (and so do the Mexicans). The thing to understand about Luis Bu&ntilde;uel is that he, behind the surrealist fa√ßade, was a prankster and a joker. His film-making was a series of practical jokes - he liked to be messing up with the minds of his viewers. To be vaccinated with a shot of Bu&ntilde;uel's counterculture in the age of the Disney cinema is probably not the worst thing. Also, the extra documentary DVD is quite good.
