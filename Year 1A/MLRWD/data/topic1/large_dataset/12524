It was a matter of time. When technology has penetrated so many aspects of or daily life, it wasn't weird that love became an option.

Two strangers that get involved in a relationship through e-mail is the premise of You've Got Mail, the movie that reunites Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Hanks plays Joe Fox (F-O-X), the owner of a book megastore who comes to destroy the competition in the New York West Side, where Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) has a lovely and small bookstore.

Enemies and rivals, Joe and Kathleen live, without knowing, an anonymous romance through their computer screens. She, although tries to maintain a human and personal touch in her store (which Joe's store lacks) and is skeptic to cultural globalization, can't stand a day without logging into the place where the words of her "dear friend" wait for her.

These two constitute, over e-mail, a more solid relationship than the ones they have in the real world. Kathleen's boyfriend is a columnist opposed to technology and change. Joe shares his life with Patricia, a book editor so hyperkinetic she "makes coffee nervous". But the worst obstacles to J&K relationship are themselves.

This is a very romantic film, a little manipulative and unbelievable, but its ingenuity evokes the feeling of an old movie. Hanks and Ryan are a perfect match, complementing each other beautifully. Talent, charisma and chemistry are a combination used with success by these two actors.

The other leading character is New York City. Director Nora Ephron captures its vibrant rhythms and romantic views in such a subtle way, one can't help but falling in love with the city.

Even admitting that is not perfect, this film is very entertaining, fresh and pleasant; it has a great soundtrack and a script that makes the search for love something delicate, mysterious and irresistible. Who can wait to log in?
