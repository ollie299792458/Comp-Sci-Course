Yes, if you don't know the films that are being parodied here, this movie will make no sense to you. However, it's one of the smartest satires of a film genre I've ever seen. Janeane Garofalo's performance alone walks the line between overacting and making fun of overacting so well that it's easy to see why some people might just think it's a bad movie. Don't make that mistake; it's intented to be bad. And when the film goes off on surrealistic tangents -- the trip to town, the disposing of bodies -- it still works, because the film has set up its premise so well. So buy and enjoy. Paul Rudd's performance as the bad guy/stud is so perfect it merits some kind of award. The scene where he has to pick up the plate he's just thrown on the ground is a masterpiece of pantomime. He so disgusted ast having to do it, that he "machos" all over the room. And the music, especially the "fire, desire, higher and higher" song, is hilarious. Loverboy will never seem the same again. AND the van crash is one of the most perfectly timed scenes in any comedy. Watch it again, and you'll start laughing in advance of the scene, when the driver is singing Danny's Song. What a great film. Bring on the Pepsi Light!
