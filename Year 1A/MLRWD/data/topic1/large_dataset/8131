I just finished watching this movie, and my next course of action is to buy it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I think that all people, pot-smokers or not, should watch this movie, as it debunks many of the myths concerning pot use that are prevalent today. Most people know that government propaganda usually over-exaggerates risks, but few people know just how safe marijuana really is. This movie is an eye-opener.

That being said, I am very, very, very disappointed with Doug Benson's performance. If you watch closely (or, hell, not even that closely...), you will notice that he almost never inhales. Not once during the movie did I see him inhale. It was obviously a gimmick, and I really resent the fact this man was chosen for this role. He gives a bad name to pot-smokers. I doubt he was even high for the majority of the movie...

Great movie. Would have been much better if the main character actually did what he was claiming to do, but the message was left unharmed, and that was the point of the movie.
