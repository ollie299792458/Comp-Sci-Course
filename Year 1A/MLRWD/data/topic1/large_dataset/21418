Like the Iron Giant, we're all prreprogrammed to varying extents -- but we don't have to accept the programming any more than the big fella in this splendid animated feature. From Hogarth, a spunky young boy, the Iron Giant learns "You are who you choose to be." That is powerful, powerful knowledge for the Iron Giant, as it is for everyone. That message is what makes the movie a true "must see" for all ages.

Since childhood, we're all programmed from our environments and our experiences. We behave in certain ways and think in certain ways because we've accepted the subliminal programming going on around us from parents, peers, society, news media, advertising, etc. And sometimes we become programmed as weapons, as is the Iron Giant, using wounding words or actions aimed at others because we've accepted programming to do so.

The Iron Giant's story reminds all of us that programming can be changed. We can choose to think differently. We don't have to act and react in the same old ways, like our parents or friends do. "You are who you choose to be" is an empowering statement of personal freedom to be the best we were meant to be.

Is it easy to choose to change? No, not always. No, not usually. The Iron Giant certainly encounters difficulties, from the fear-based military and towns people, as he changes his programming. But with the will to do so, it can be done.

Friends can help us see our true selves and potentials. At his metallic heart, the Iron Giant is a gentle, sensitive creature, and when Hogarth extends the hand of friendship, the Iron Giant truly blossoms. Hogarth's faith in the Iron Giant helps the metal man have faith in himself and helps him hold the image of himself as a "good guy" and not a programmed "gun." The Iron Giant and Hogarth are tremendous role models for self-empowerment. I wish every person would see this movie and absorb its message.
