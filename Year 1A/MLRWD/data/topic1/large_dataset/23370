Coop (Trey Parker) &amp; Remer (Matt Stone) star in this hilarious comedy.  Baseketball, basketball with baseball rules, starts out in their driveway and becomes national sport. Squeak Scolar played by Dian Bahar comes to their house to shut off their gas.  He eventually ends up living with them.  In Baseketball you can do something called a "Psyche Out" where can you taunt your opponent (no limits).  The Psyche Out's are one of the things that makes the movie so funny.  
The funniest games they played where against San Francisco and against Texas.  For Coop to own the Milwaukee Beers he has to win the Denslow Cup.  There is a short, funny segment with Robert Stack from Unsolved Mysteries. This is a great DVD with lots of special features (my favorite, the Reel Big Fish video "Take On Me", but maybe that's just because I like RBF.  If you like "South Park" humor or "There's Something About Mary" this is a must own.  Otherwise, just rent it.  R.I.P. Dale Earnhardt.
Oh yea, I have seen this movie 8 times.  It's that good.
