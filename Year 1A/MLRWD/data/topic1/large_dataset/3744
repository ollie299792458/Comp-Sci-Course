Kiss has released some good tapes (Exposed, Extreme, kiss my ass, unplugged) but this is not one of them. I found this recently in the "cheap tape bin" of my local video store. They are running out of energy here, and releasing videos without alot of interesting content. The first half is interesting but material that kiss fans have seen already. the second half of the film is unessential - rock and roll over and love gun songs are played constantly in the background but none of the songs have been preformed. there are dumb clips of getting "psyched" before a concert (3 times enough already). There is Ace and Pauls birthday celebrations (why on tape?) the dialog is long and few between and no interviews to tie it all together like in the preious videos. I actually like psycho circus, but there are no videos from that period here except for the last 1 minute of the tape. What made Xtreme, Konfidential and exposed so good was full preformances of songs but there are only tidbits and clips of songs. Sorry Kiss but you sould have done better.
