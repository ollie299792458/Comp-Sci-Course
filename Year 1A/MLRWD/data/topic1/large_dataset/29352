SPOILERS: At first, I thought this was a silly, updated Pygmalion, but it turned out in the second half to be a smart precursor to the women's liberation movement coming a decade down the line. Judy Holiday plays a kept woman who is blissfully ignorant, often drunk, and wrapped in furs. Her thug tycoon boyfriend is embarrassed of her faux pas during a meeting with a Congressman and his wife and so hires Bill Holden to put some smarts in her. He starts her on Enlightenment thinkers and she comes to realize she is living in a gilded cage. By the end, the thug becomes threatened by her knowledge and new-found independence and tries to rein her in, but she outsmarts him and leaves. The two things that weigh this movie down are the "Gee, ain't America swell" tone of Holden's teaching -- it seemed parochial and out of place with his character -- and the tacked-on ending where Holiday and Holden get pulled over by a motorcycle cop having just gotten married. By the third act of the movie, she was ready to leave and explore the world on her own terms. This last five minutes seemed installed to satisfy the studio and the viewing public not yet ready for that much feminine independence.
