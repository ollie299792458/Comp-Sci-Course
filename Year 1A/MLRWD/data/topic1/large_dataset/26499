Why did people love Mel Gibson, before he set fire to his career?  I watched this movie, and how I missed the old Mel, the funny Mel, the guy who could laugh at himself.

What Women Want is a battle of the sexes movie, but its also a very funny movie about the change that came to advertising when the retail world woke up and realized that women really did control a whole lot of the money.  What to do? What to do?  Things had progressed beyond Mad Men, of course but agencies still had a whole lot of men sitting around trying to imagine what women wanted--instead of hiring them to handle the problem.

In What Women Want, one dinosaur of a man, Mel Gibson (yeah, I know)  gets to hear what is going on in women's heads.  Its quite a shock because even though this guy has lived a charmed life--he never suspected that so many of the women around him were thinking that he was a Class A jerk.  Furthermore, he found he deserved it.  Gibson doesn't turn into Mister-Sensitive-Man but he does begin to understand that the opposite sex seems to be made up of human beings.  And he is really really funny as he finds out.

Helen Hunt is great in this movie, but there are lots and lots of well known actresses in small roles.  The soundtrack is classy, romantic and perfect--with lots of that "man's man" Frank Sinatra, to set just the right tone.
