The first time I saw this movie was in the theaters when I was 14.  At the time I remember enjoying the movie, but without any specific insight or understanding of the drama on screen.  I simply enjoyed it for all of its entertaining quirks in dialogue and for the unusually involving(for a 14 year old at the time) love story.  Afterwards, I found myself thinking about the movie more and more often throughout the years.  Watching this movie occasionally became a sort of habit for me.  As I matured(at least I hope I have) I came to fully understand the reasons why the film touched me with such significance.  The story dealt with a seemingly successful man who also seemed to have everything a man can want and need.  The character of Jerry Maguire is the perfect archetype or role model that any parent can hope for their sons; successful and stable.  And more often than not most men believe, as they grow up, having a life of financial security and an "efficient" mate, constitutes happiness and a fulfilling lifestyle.  Those qualities were denounced early on in the movie.  With this knock down of the very things I held high in my priorities in life, the movie was already an attention grabber for me.  Slowly, as the story progressed, it gave Jerry Maguire situations after situations of personal challenges and obstacles to get him to the point where his search for his identity and priorities in his life were over.  Because of this, I hold this film in the highest regard.  It is one of my personal favorites and I'm sure to a lot of others as well.  There are better films than this, sure, but I hold this one dearer to my soul than any movie I've ever seen so far in my life.
