Next to LionKing & Balto, of course.

I first heard about this movie "Anastasia" when it passed thru theaters in Nov'97, but I never got around to seeing it until the first week of Jan'98 - and I'd ended up missing like the first ten minutes of it, due to transportation issues. After the movie, my general thoughts were that it had been just good, and I went on with life, lol. But for some reason, it was about two weeks later, when I suddenly thought - "That's an awesome movie!!!" and I wanted to go back to it.

Then I was so annoyed that I couldn't remember most of it, so I tried to see it again, but it had already left all my local theaters. I spent the next few months, obsessing over anything that I could find about it, and the real story that it's based on, trying to remember every scene. I would even draw out scenes in a special binder that I had put together for the movie, along with pictures from various paper ads, and I also wrote and dreamt about it too. I counted down the days until it would finally come out on video - April 28, 1998, at which point of course I went right out and got it and started watching it over and over, practically memorizing every quote and song. I still have that same vhs even now, and I still think it's an awesome movie!

Now that I have the DVD, I love it too. You can check out a bit of how-they-made-it stuff, as well as the official trailer. Plus, you can choose what version to watch, widescreen or fullscreen - *all* movies on dvd should have that option!

Hope you enjoy this movie and thanks for reading ;D
