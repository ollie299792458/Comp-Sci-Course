I'm absolutely shocked that Thundercats is finally being released on DVD. My only hope is that nothing goes wrong down the line with the releases and ALL what is it...127 episodes? Get released. I was on the brink of buying the entire set off of some website that some guy had made up until i happened to stumble across the info. on amazon that the set was finally being released. Truly a great day for anyone that grew up on this stuff. Its amazing how true it is when you hear people talking about how pathetic cartoons are today compaired to what was released in the 80's. Thundercats was a prime example of one of i'd say the top 5 series of all time, and although it took quite some time for it to come out its refreshing to see it on the way.

 I couldn't tell you how many times i've gone to Best Buy, Target , or whatever the case may be and would see a "new" box set of some old school series and said to myself how in the hell is this out in the stores yet NO THUNDERCATS!! Sure to be a crowd pleaser  Thundercats is finally on the way....Now only if we could get the  entire X-Men series on the move as well which had 96 episodes? Don't quote me on that...I'd be a happy happy boy!
