Please do not rent, pay or purchase this atrocious film.  It has not a single redeeming quality.  Not even those who enjoy senseless entertainment will walk away happy.  It commits the cardinal sin of trying to purchase an audience through hitting the right moralistic buttons.  When you've got nothing else, get preachy.  This film suggests pathological killers are the product of abusive, perversely religious fathers, and merit our sympathy. Yea right, the problem in our society is people take their religion too seriously. What world is Mr. Singh living in?  Can't these post-mod lefty Hollywood sophists conger up a plot without taking a gratuitous stab at organized religion?  The predictable plot, poor acting and vapid dialogue were difficult enough to take.  But the sappy moralizing put the movie over the top. If making bad movies were a criminal offense, Mr. Singh deserves the death penalty or at least life without parole.  Under no circumstances enter "The Cell".  You will regret it.
