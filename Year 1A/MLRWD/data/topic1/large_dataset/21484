My 4 year old son loves polar bears but he was quickly bored by this film. I didn't even make it to the end of the film with the so-called propaganda so I can't comment on that but if it was anything as embarassing and pandering as the rest of the film, I can understand the complaints. I like Queen Latifah, but the phrases they had her say made me cringe. The usual serious nature-special narration was interspersed with phrases that are desperately trying to sound hip but will be hopelessly outdated in a few years, like "When your mother's a polar bear, you best be going," the walruses are "all up in each other's business," and "that's just how they roll;" regarding the walrus whiskers: "That's right, those sweet 'staches aren't just for style." The worst is when "it's time for a game of pull my flipper" and you get walrus farting sounds. If this were made in the 1960s, you'd have the narrator talking about the "far out" bears and "groovy" walruses dealing with starvation which is a total "bummer."

By the way, I couldn't care less that the story is a composite and not a "true" documentary - I just wanted a good story. Despite some beautiful visuals, I can't recommend this to anyone.
