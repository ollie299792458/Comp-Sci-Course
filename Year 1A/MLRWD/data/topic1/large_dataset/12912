This movie is best viewed start to finish. I could not do that with my new 3D LG 1080p, plasma with shutter glasses from amazon.com. The glasses kept on dying in about ten minutes because I was viewing out of the short range of about 7 feet of the shutter glasses.The 3D effects are good with the shutter glasses. They are better than the passive 3D glasses I have with my new LED 1080p 3D TV from amazon.com.

This was a movie made for 3D presentation. I think that this was Sanctum's only reason for release.

All movies are cool if they are in 3D. The 3D TVs and 3D Blu-ray players have better 3D than the cheap, colored, cellulose film paper glasses.

The film is 2 stars with 3D the true star of the flick (kinda redundant).

Amazon is far cheaper on the new 3D TV sets than everyone else for the time being. Just thought I would throw that in (preposition). Shutter glasses, from what I have seen are sharper than the passive 3D glasses like in the cinema. With LG LED 3D TVs you can use Real3D glasses from the theater on your 3D TV.

I do not work for amazon.com. I do not know anyone who works for amazon.com.
