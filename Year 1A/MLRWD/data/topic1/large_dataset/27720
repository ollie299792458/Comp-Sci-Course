There is always a danger in seeing a movie which has been praised highly, particularly a comedy.  I had heard so many good things about this movie that my expectations were very high. And I have to say that initially I felt disappointed.

The plot can be summed up simply by the title of the movie and is driven by the hero's search for not so much sexual fulfillment as release.  The movie did not start well.  The hero's friends were a group of unlikeable, crude misogynists.  The humour was obvious and bordering on offensive.  The vision of modern dating was, well, depressing.  However, things began to improve hugely with the entrance of Catherine Keener's character.  Here at last was a real person who had real relationships.  From that point on the film became a sweet movie that had something to say about modern life and the way we view sex.

Now this movie did have its funny moments.  Steve Carell is enormously talented, and to be fair I never saw the theatrical version which is apparently much better.  On the whole ,an uneven comedy with a message.
