this movie is undoubtably the scariest movie of all time. with jerry goldsmith's score it is a masterpiece. it is a true psychological thriller, you can not watch a showing of the omen and be the same person you were, you will look at life and god and religion so differently. the movie isnt a real jumpy kind of scary movie, its the type that horrorify you by watching it and thinking of it, what if it is true! just think the movie is about a couple adopting the anti-christ, the devil's son, and having finding out this realizing he must be stopped. imagine satan's son is walking  among us as we speak, he could be our next door neighbor, our child, our sibling, our friend, or our leader, like our president. and george bush isnt the devil so leave that example out, dont worry bill is out of office, the devil dosnt rule us now,lol. but just imagine that's the horror and magic and susspense of the omen. it is a spine shiver of a film, if you dont own it buy it i tell you it could save your life, soul, or end up to be your favorite film, this movie is more like a guide than a film. it will guide you to defeat satan and his army. this film is the best of its series, and it is a true classic, with to die for acting, especially the nanny, or the demon i should say. but it is a great movie, if your not convinced yet to buy it for the money, than go rent it than come back and buy, cause you'll have to have it! beware though, after watching this film your life will change in some way, whether it be a little or alot, so be warned. the 666 will change your view on life, god, satan, heaven, and hell. BUT BUY IT SO YOU CAN OWN THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER, O YEA THE EXORCIST IS WUSSY COMPARED TO THIS FILM SO IF YOU THINK THAT'S SCARY, TRY THIS FILM ON FOR SIZE! THANKYOU.
