Admittedly, I'm of the group who feels that relative to everyone else making movies today that Woody Allen has never made a bad movie.  I regard "Radio Days" as one of his best.  The story, such as it is, evokes the early 1940s in New York through the the popular radio shows of the day as recollectd by the narrator, who was a pre-teen when the movie takes place. The movie goes back and forth between a fictional world created by radio--think Wallace Shawn as the Masked Avenger--and the narrator's working class family.  There is no plot to spoil.  The movie ends on New Year's Eve 1944.  You wish it could all continue, but it can't.

Although "Radio Days" is a comedy, in a way it reminded me of John Ford's "How Green Was My Valley," which was similarly recollected years later by the now grown narrator.  In both movies there is no real lead, and the story episodically follows a family's adventures over the course of a couple of years.  Instead, you get one memorable character and scene after another.  In "Radio Days" you will also get lots of laughs and grins.  Not to mention the era's music, whch enhances the atmosphere.

What I like about John Ford and Woody Allen movies is that every character and actor in the movie seems important to the director.  So enjoy Michael Tucker, Julie Kavner, Mia Farrow, Wallace Shawn, Dianne Weist, Jeff Daniels, Josh Mostel, and Tony Roberts, and others take their star turns.
