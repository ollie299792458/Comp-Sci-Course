i know i'm not supposed to, but i love this movie.
the real reason is sharon stone, who does seem to have a habit of selecting movies in which she is the only interesting actor.  this is somewhat true of basic instinct; it is definitely her "star vehicle," and the whole movie is built around her very convincing show of sexual power.  (you can see it even in her screen tests - examples of which are included on the dvd - although she had yet to nail the essential condescending cruelty of the character at this early stage.)  the plot is completely unreasonable, as verhoeven himself admits: catherine trammel is literally clairvoyant to plan out her crimes with such impossible foresight.  but stone convinces you to "suspend your disbelief."  and even though you know she's guilty of a slew of heinous and inhuman killings, you want her to get away with it.  crazy huh.
but the other actors are all up to par here; michael douglas is always convincing as a raving lunatic, jeanne tripplehorn pulls off her vaguely repressed-bisexual yet fundamentally well-intentioned psychiatrist, leilani sarelle serves up a male fantasy version of a homicidal butch/lipstick lesbian, and dorothy malone even drops in for a turn as an impulse-murderess grandma.  
yes, basic instinct is derivative; the san francisco setting, the score, and catherine's interrogation-scene getup are straight out of vertigo, as has been belabored to death.  but this girl is more diabolical in her sleep than kim novak on her worst day.  the movie is beautifully shot throughout...you can think of it as a vertigo remix with soft-core porn, slasher violence and drugs thrown in for kicks.  
the accompanying icepick-shaped pen writes in blood-red ink.  tasteless.
