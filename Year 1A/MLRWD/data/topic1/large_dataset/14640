I remember the anticipation I had just seeing the previews of this movie.  I gotta say the movie definitely lived up to my expectations, and believe me, I don't give a lot of FIVE star ratings!
Identity tells the story of 10 strangers stuck in a motel.  One by one these strangers are slowly being murdered.  Now the survivors must unravel the clues to what brought them all together, who the killer is, and the connection they all share.  
A great mystery suspense thriller.  I love it when a movie puts in a taste of mystery in its storyline, and this film is nothing short of mysteries.  The twist and turns, and complete 360's of this movie can only be compared to a Six Flags roller coaster ride.  This movie brilliantly also tries to give hints through out its course, making the viewers go "Ohhhhhh, I see..." especially the second time through.  The title of the movie is a big clue in itself.  Definitely worth seeing twice, especially the extended version of this film which comes in the DVD version.  The ending was probably one of the more intelligent/brilliant endings I've ever seen, and really have to be appreciated.  There was also a little bit of Pulp Fiction-esque cinematography, especially in the beggining, which was done nicely.
With great acting, an all-star cast, good writing, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, Identity has all the ingredients for a great mystery thriller.  Watching it with friends is definitely recommended!
