My Thoughts:

 So wife and I had a date night Saturday Night and went and saw The Dilemma at Regal Cinemas in Augusta.  We both enjoyed the flick, but based on the trailer it seemed as though it was going to be much more of a comedy than it was.
 The Dilemma couldn't decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  It didn't dance that fine line of being a dramedy as the movie has both extreme moments of Comedy and Drama.  It also doesn't have very likeable characters other than Vince Vaughn, an even then he's a bit of a douche.
 By all means,  if you're a fan of anyone in it, watch it just be warned that the flow of the flick is confusing.
