Not much to say but what we have here is the definitive recording of the great Verdi Requiem.  However, This 2005 release of the actual recording of 1967 seemingly sacrificed the (vocal) audio for the superb video quality.  The images are crystal clear.  I don't know how that was managed but I have the 2001 release of this same dvd and the audio (vocal) is superior.

Price, Gihiaurov, and von Karajan are as close to perfection as one could get. Cossoto is great and I was totaly unaware of her before this recording.  However, if you listen closely you'll hear her having some difficulties vocally in two areas.  You'll have to listen to find out for yourself. Pavarotti was too nervous and stiff for me and I wish a more seasoned tenor could have been chosen.  However, he possessed the voice in spite of his stage presence.

My disappointment is that Von Karajan allowed the chorus to accompany Price as she soared to those beautiful notes in the Libera Me.  Trust me; she needed no help.  It would have been the icing on the cake if she had been allowed to do it alone.  I would have loved to have seen her soar alone as well!!!

The orchestra and chorus were simply amazing.
