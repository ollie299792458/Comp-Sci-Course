House M.D. is a great series, really the antidote for everybody sick and tired of your usual hospital and doctor routine. Funny, smart, sarcastic, cynical, pretty dark at times and always entertaining. Not one episode of Season 1 is dull or boring. Every episode features one or more patients with mysterious sicknesses that really put the abilities of all members of Dr. Houses team to the test. It is like CSI for doctors. They even do field work which often includes breaking into a patients house or appartement to find important clues for solving the case. Hugh Laurie as Dr. House delivers his lines razor sharp and with amazing feeling for timing and tone. I often had to watch a certain scene four, five times in a row because I could not believe he just said or did that. Sometimes Dr. Houses behaviour borders on anti-social, most of the time it is grumpy and insulting at best. But he is a brilliant doctor and deeply dedicated to his job. He just doesnt like people, which, considering his occupation, is quite a problem. His mottos are: "Everybody lies" and "Patients are idiots" and he treats people accordingly. Normally, this would get pretty boring and annoying to watch pretty soon and on his own, House would just be a grumpy guy with a cane and an addiction to painkillers (the latter being a great twist to the story and always good for some hilarious scenes). But a superb supporting cast keeps everything in balance. Omar Epps et al are doing a great job and a lot of scenes and banter would not work without them. House M.D. would not work without them. The extras on this DVD are worth watching but I would have really enjoyed cast commentaries for some episodes. Maybe on Season 2. Cant wait to see it on DVD! Meantime, everybody go buy House M.D. Season 1. You will get your moneys worth!
