This film is is simply excellent, far superior to My Fair Lady which to be honest I have never been a huge fan of: I regard it overlong and Audrey Hepburn was a little unconvincing.  This film concentrates on the play rather than songs and visual eye candy, though the latter it still succeeds in, with the ball-room scenes and some beautiful shots near the opening of the streets of London capturing the period perfectly.  But it's the performances that carry the film mainly; Hiller is brilliant but Howard is truly fantastic, the role fitting him like a glove as he takes full advantage of the hilarious script.  But special mention must go to the DVD - the print is absoloutly GORGEOUS, the film looks as if it was made yesterday and the dialogue is as clear as a bell without a hint of noise.  Occasionaly the print slips slightly in the latter half but these tiny interludes of what seems like an unmastered print only make you see how superb the rest of it is.  And the packaging is also worth mentioning - the insert has some great photos and a replica of the original poster.  At this price especially no collector should be without this disc.
