TV in the 50s and early 60s was more varied and creative than it often is remembered as having been - think of Playhouse 90, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, One Step Beyond, or the Twilight Zone. However, the sitcom genre was family-friendly with a vengeance: Donna Reed, Leave It to Beaver, Make Room for Daddy, Ozzie and Harriet, and so on. There was and is nothing wrong with shows of this type, except for the fact that these were the only images of domesticity presented in that format.

This, like so much else, changed in the mid-60s, and The Addams Family was a part of the change. I loved the show from the first episode, which aired on September 18, 1964, (and, incidentally, I was smitten by the lady in black played by Carolyn Jones the same night). The Addams family poked fun at the standard TV family as much by its resemblance to one as by its deviance. Like the Charles Addams cartoons on which it was based, The Addams Family stood ordinary conventions on their heads; typical was an early episode in which Morticia finds (horrors!) a baseball glove in her son's closet and holds it up at arm's length by two fingers, as appalled as another mother would be by drug paraphernalia. These people were not merely oddballs, they were seriously dangerous, with children who literally played with dynamite, but were utterly likable for all that. They defied social norms along with all the busybody regulations (property, weapons, safety, and the like) to which most of us long have been resigned. The sensual interaction of Morticia and Gomez differed enormously from the behavior other sitcom couples as well. Actually, it still does differ; contemporary shows have much more randy jokes, but that is far from the same thing.

The first season on DVD arrived in the mail this week. I've been enjoying it as much as when I was eleven, and I still have a crush on the long haired beauty with the lovely gray pallor.
