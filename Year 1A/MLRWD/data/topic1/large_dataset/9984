Oliver Stone does an excellent job of arguing the case for a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. The facts, and some of the unexplained mysteries, all documented, are presented to the viewer in a most compelling way. You come away from the film wondering if there really was a conspiracy.
This movie does not have the feeling of paranoia that most other movies about conspiracy have, and here I am thinking of "The Enemy of the State" for example. The calm and rational development of the argument, with more information gradually added distinguishes this work from other more frivolous films. A line in the film which I think is quite telling is that if the assassination had happened in Russia, and the facts were as they are, would the idea of a conspiracy be that hard to swallow. It may be the willingness of the public to disbelieve the possibility of a Government that works against it's people, rather than the lack of facts, which makes conspiracy so difficult to believe for many people. 
Even though Stone was true to the facts as he found them (or as others furnished them), he did take artistic license in some areas. This does not make the point that the movie is trying to make any less valid. Any movie about historical events, usually has some sort of creativity in it regarding minor events such as the flawlessness of the speeches, flashbacks, additional dialogues etc...
If you aren't one who buys into Conspiracy but who enjoys a good film, Costner's performance is stunning in this one and wont disappoint. The movie, in it's own right is excellent, and I would highly recommend it for it's own sake. Whether you believe the arguments or not, get this movie to see the story from the other side.
