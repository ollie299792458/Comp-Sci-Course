For those who already own a DVD of Ben Hur and have been scouring the net, as I have, to see if the new Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) (1959) is worth the investment, the unequivocal answer is YES!

I first saw Ben Hur at the movies when I was about 10 years old (yes... now you know I'm closer to Attends then Pampers) and revisited it several years after, in the VHS decades and again in the early and late DVD period (yes I do like the movie).

This newly re-mastered version in anamorphic widescreen is absolutely incredible to view (they had to have spent a fortune re-doing this one) as well as listen to, with the addition of enhanced (not overdone) 5.1 surround sound (from six track stereo --- back in 1959).

Enough has been said about how great the story and movie is, and I couldn't agree more, even though I don't have any particular bent for biblical epics.  This movie is a classic, in the true sense of the word, and it takes on a new dimension with this particular DVD release.

In reading reviews it is often helpful, I think, to get a sense of  the author's realm of experience and what other movies or types of  DVD's he or she likes, just to see if there is a correlation of tastes, and so, I offer some of my favorites, in no particular order or type, Saving Private Ryan,  Titanic,  Eagles (Hell Freezes Over), Sting (the Brand New Day Tour),  Inherit the Wind NOT Gone with the Wind (Spencer Tracy and the Scopes monkey trial), Gladiator, Master and Commander, Amadeus, War of the Worlds the Cruise vs...etc.

Enough said.
