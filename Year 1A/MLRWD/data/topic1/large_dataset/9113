I used to think Cowboy Bebop was the tops in the anime field. Wolf's Rain at least ties with it.
The story, in a nutshell, is that this is a futuristic world where humans are confined to domed cities that protect them from the wastelands outside (if you seen the Final Fantasy movie, that's it). Wolves are also believed to be extinct in this world. But, four young men prove this wrong; Kiba, Toboe, Higei, and Tsumei round out the four primary characters, and do it well. These 4 wolves, who can disguise themselves as people, set out in search of Paradise. That's the outer story, but like any good anime it goes MUCH deeper.
The art of this anime is also the equal of Bebop (one of the characters even looks like Spike; if you've seen Bebop you'll catch on to which one). The backgrounds are fully and completely detailed, and the characters are also well fleshed out, art and personality wise. You can really 'get' the characters within the first few episodes.
Not only is it from the same people who did Bebop, it also still has Yoko Kanno's music (Yes!!).
And on top of all this, also voice actors from two other excellent animes are in here; the same voice actor as Vash the Stampede from TRIGUN and Alucard's voice from HELLSING.
All this together gives an excellent anime, one that belongs in any collection immediately.
