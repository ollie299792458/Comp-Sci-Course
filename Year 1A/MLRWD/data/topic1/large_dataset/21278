The film itself is great.  Fricke manages to keep your attention throughout the viewing experience with lush visuals and amazing sound.  The 8K transfer really shows it's quality on this disc, and then some.  The DTS-HD track is solid, as well, with great directional mixing and a perfectly crafted score that fits the film like a glove.  I'd never actually seen "Baraka" before my first Blu-Ray viewing of it several months back via Netflix.  A friend referred me and described it as being the kind of must-have title when you really want to see just how good your home theater can perform in a visual sense.  He wasn't kidding!  I was plenty skeptical when he told me the length of the feature and that there wasn't any dialogue and figured it'd be a miracle if I made it past the 10-minute mark.  I was proven wrong in a big way.

I originally watched the film using our Optoma HD66 720p projector onto a 120" screen.  It looked awesome in that viewing, so I was surprised that during our most recent viewing (after our own copy arrived via Amazon) using our new Epson 8350 projector that I was impressed further.  Anyone who has a home theater system owes it to themselves (and their system!) to spin this flick at least once (and in my case repeatedly). The detail is frighteningly clear and it not only seems as though the film was shot yesterday, but also that it's actually happening right there in front of you.  Certainly some of the most vivid 2D imagery I've ever laid my eyes on.  Highly recommended.
