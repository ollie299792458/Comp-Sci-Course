I came to this film late in life. I was hesitant to view it because it had to be pieced together from various film footage found here and there, some in excellent condition, some not so good, some segments completely missing and filled in with still photos. Boy was I wrong. Within fifteen minutes the film had me glued to the television screen. Some helter-skelter drama pulls you into what's going on, though you really have no idea what's going on. Finally after a long and arduous airplane journey, you land in the adult version of Oz. A place where the Greek ideals of beauty, wisdom and goodness have long ago rooted and flourished into a way of life. Every character is perfectly cast. Ronald Coleman and Jane Wyatt (I didn't know what a beautiful and talented actress she was) are the ideal couple. Sam Jaffe makes a non-believer believe. The subtle humor and collective entanglements offer a glimpse into our silver reflections within. And most surprisingly, the still photos not only do not detract from the flow and quality of the film, they enhance the dialogue (you could almost believe this was intentional on the director's part, instead of a way to compensate for lost film footage). After the film has concluded, you'll want to watch the film again, re-live the whole experience, only this time you want to board the plane and land in Shangra-La yourself.
