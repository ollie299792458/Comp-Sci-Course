This film is wonderful. At first I had a problem with Barry Fitzgerald as the lead then I stopped to think about real life in that era and understood that it was not as we see it portrayed these days with the Mel Gibson/Kevin Costner types in the lead roles. In all probability a guy like Barry Fitzgerald would have been a detective back then. The other standouts are Don Taylor,Howard Duff and Mark Hellinger's narration. Director Jules Dassin went on to make some of the best gritty crime films of that generation. This movie was 50 years ahead of it's time and did for it's type of film what Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues did years later. The magic of this movie is that after you see it you keep thinking about it, the real scenes of New York City keep coming back and it dawns on you that you are looking back 50 plus years in time to a then real New York City that no longer exists. Watch it several times, you see more things over and over that you missed the first go around. Film makers today need to get back to the basics of story telling and stop relying on effects and shock. They should study Dassin's works.
