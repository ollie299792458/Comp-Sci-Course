It is heartening to add my review to so many others; for many years I thought I was the only person who admired this movie (it's hardly EVER on television).  Part science fiction, part geology lecture, part mystery, and a little bit corny (Pat Boone sings!), the durable Jules Verne tale comes alive thanks to Henry Levin's brisk direction backed by his imaginative band of art directors and surprisingly good FX specialists. Most importantly though is the incomparable James Mason in the lead as the sage Professor Oliver Lindbrook, leader of the expedition to the center of the Earth. At a time when many aging leading men (Mason was 50 at the time he took this part), desperate for leading roles, sleepwalked through disdained science fiction parts, Mason threw himself into the role with an enthusiasm that seems to infect the rest of the players. David Thayer plays the antagonist Count Saknussem with equal measure.  I saw it with my family at the magnificent Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles when I was nine years old. It was a day and a movie I will never forget.
