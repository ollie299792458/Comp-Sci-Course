This is one of the cutest movies ever ~ Like many other husbands in Manhattan during the summer, Richard Sherman (played by the extremely funny Tom Ewell) sends his wife and son to the country for the summer, while he stays behind.  While his wife is away, he tries to be a "good boy" by avoiding alcohol, smoking, and women!! But when a voluptuous blonde moves in upstairs his imagination starts to run wild~!!  When she asks to stay over because her air condition is broke; THE FUN BEGINS!! Marilyn Monroe lights up the screen as the innocent blonde - in every scene, she gives off such an incredible glow!!  Tom Ewell keeps you laughing all through the film while he talks to himself and has hilarious fantasies about women.  Such a Fast-Paced and SEXY film from the 50's...you don't want to miss it. I definitely recommend checking it out; especially if you are a fan of Marilyn or Tom - or if you're not, just rent it if you feel like laughing, and you may become a fan of both!! Enjoy! :)
