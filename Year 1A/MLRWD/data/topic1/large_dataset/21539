Spoiler alert.  The reality of this movie is that is simply that, a movie.  It does not materialize into anything believable, nor credible.  The acting was as good as this script could hope for.  OK, so we get some ghosts coming back to create some nostolgia but to what purpose?  This movie tries to build on the mystical assumption of a dual world where characters seem trapped in a purgatory of thier own interest and worldy failures.  The movie Ghost had this story as well.  It means to hit an emotional reaction based on pure unrelateable fiction.  Is it a bad movie, absolutely not.  Is it a great movie, hardly.  This movie is like a childhood Stephen King attempt at a sport story about the game he loves so much.  No, King did not write this and I believe if he did it would have been halted at the editor's table until the 3rd revision built the characters and plot into something intriguing.

Can relationships be rebuilt in an instant on fantasy, maybe, probably not.  Especially not if you ruin your farm, do not pay your bills, drive your wife to the point of divorce, and talk to ghosts hitting real baseballs.  Whatever turns you on.  Movies like Nobody's Fool, Hurt Locker, Deer Hunter, provide a real statement on relationships.  This is weak, ethereal, and fails to hit it out of the field.  How many times have we seen baseball movies that try to materialize into something with real meaning?  When you build the foundation for your movie on assumption that your audience must care about baseball, you are bound to see it become predicatable and like a child's story, limited.

If you love this movie, that is wonderful.  It's subjective.  I did not have a "wow" moment even once in this movie and I doubt anyone was truly surprised or learned anything from this.

This is a dollar rental, not a Blu-Ray investment.
