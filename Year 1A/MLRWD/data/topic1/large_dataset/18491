The story opens as Dean Martin is playing a card game in a saloon late at night.  One of the players is exposed as a cheat and the rest of the players, led by Roddy McDowell, decide to lynch him.  Martin unsuccessfully tries to stop the lynching.  Several months later the players in the card game start dying one by one.  Is one of the lynch mob trying to silence the other witnesses, or is someone else doing the dirty work and why?  Dean Martin has to figure out who is doing the killings before he becomes a victim.  Along the way he makes googly eyes at a beautiful ranchers daughter and the owner of a bordello (I won't spoil the fun and tell you which he rides off into the sunset with - watch the film).  Robert Mitchum co-stars as the moral conscience of the small town.

This is a mildly entertaining Western that isn't as bad as some of the most negative reviews claim, although this is certainly no classic.  Definitely a step below the middling Randolph Scott works.  Not much tension, but there are enough twists and turns to keep your interest until the big showdown at the end when the mystery is revealed.  Roddy McDowell is horribly miscast in this film (and I couldn't stop thinking about Cornelius as I was watching it).  Workmanlike performances by Martin and Mitchum, Ingar Stevens does a nice job as the bordello owner/love interest for Martin.  Yaphet Kotto has a minor role as the bartender and is probably the most interesting character in the film.  I wouldn't spend $10 to add it to my collection, but certainly worth a look as a rental.
