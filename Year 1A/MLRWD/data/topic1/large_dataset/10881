This was Jean Harlow's last truly great film and she shares the complicated but hilarious plot with people she adored in real life: Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy and her real-life romantic interest, William Powell. That Jean and William were involved in an on-again off-again romance doesn't affect the superb comedic performance of Jean Harlow. "Libeled Lady" is a gem of a comedy and it is not just a William Powell/Myrna Loy film. Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy put in great performances. One highlight is seeing Jean look quite unglamorous at the beauty salon with her hair being permed and a mud pack on her face! She deserves top billing in this film in a role that suits her comic skills. Her one scene with Myrna Loy is very touching and they balance one another out perfectly. I hope that their other film together, "Wife vs. Secretary" will be released on DVD soon. Jean is portrays a lady-like character with perfection!

"Libeled Lady" is a must-have for any fan of screwball comedies. Had Jean Harlow lived, she would have starred with such stars of this genre like Cary Grant and that pairing would have been marvelous. But "Libeled Lady" gives Jean Harlow (sans the platinum blonde hair she never needed) a golden opportunity to show that comedy was her forte and she is with three great stars and a director who made a complicated story into a delightful screwball comedy. Enjoy "Libeled Lady"!!!
