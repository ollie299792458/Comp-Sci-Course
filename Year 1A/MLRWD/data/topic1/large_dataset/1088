If you have to own absolutely everything CS&N puts out, go ahead and buy this. It's relatively harmless. But as we've sorely learned, music should never be harmless. This is music that takes no risks, and shows little inspiration except for Stills' brief exploration into "Within You, Without You" on the final cut, "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes." (Other than that, I believe Judy Collins would like them to stop singing the song.)
There is very little new here. The boys sound like they're just going through the motions as if they have to fulfill a contract. And sometimes, the motions are quite sloppy. It's interesting to hear "Carry On," a song that was a disaster on "Four-Way Street." They still can't perform it live 40 years later and come anywhere near the studio version.
I thought the acoustic songs would be the saving grace but that is not to be. Why they decided to slur "Girl from the North Country" is beyond comprehension. Musically, they're way past their prime. Their trademark harmonies no longer bring chills, just cringes. The back-up band provides the best moments.
Like everyone else here, I agree that Stills should sing solo. His voice has evolved into a bluesy growl that cannot be sweetened by his partners. In addition, if he is such a guitar legend as many claim, where's the solos? His playing has the same old stiff, fuzzy buzz that it's had for 30 years. Come on Steve, you own 100 guitars. Play a different one for a change.
I saw C&N on the 2011 tour and thought they did it all. If you happened to see this 2012 CS&N tour, I'm sure you have fond memories but on the morning after, this package is more like a hangover than a souvenir.
