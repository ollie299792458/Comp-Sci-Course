"Unbreakable" is a very powerful, well-made film.  The imagery and character development are excellent, the story intriguing, the writing very good.  Right up until the end.  I won't ruin it for you, but the movie builds up and builds up and then-- just ends.  Supposedly the first of a trilogy, but movies in a trilogy, or any movie for that matter, should be, MUST be complete alone.  I was admittedly interested and almost riveted by the slow build up, but there was no clearly defined conflict, there was no climax, it JUST ENDED.  Some have argued that "Empire Strikes Back" was not complete, but even though the major conflict was not solved, it was still a complete film on its own, even though it ends on a downer.  "Unbreakable" is only the prologue of a complete film.  Though already 2 and 1/2 hours long, it just did not end satisfactorily (is that a word?)even in that space of time.  Worth a rental at least, but with the lack of critical and box-office support, I wouldn't hold my breath for the next two films, which is unfortunate because I really would like to see how the rest pans out.
