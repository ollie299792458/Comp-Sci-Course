I just finished watching United 93, it was very well done.  The movie starts out showing the normalcy that started September 11, 2001 and it ends in the same emotional state that those events brought to America.

What an emotionally upsetting piece of work, I believe today as I did five years ago that every American should start their day watching the collapse of the WTC.  Every person that died that day should be remembered, it doesn't matter if this terrorist action was the result of US government policy or not, human lives were lost.  Whether the invasion of Iraq was a mistake or not, we still lost those lives that day.

The movie ends as abruptly as the lives aboard flight 93 did.  The black screen leaves you very emotional, contemplating what you just witnessed.  I personally felt on that day in 2001 American did not have the stomach for what needed to be done, I still feel this way.

To everyone that died that terrible day, I pray that God grant you the rest you have earned
