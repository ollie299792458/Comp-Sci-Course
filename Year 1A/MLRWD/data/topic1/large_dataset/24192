After the Furious Five fiasco, Dreamworks has decided to give you all the goodies--and more--in the Blu-Ray release of Madagascar 2.  Not only do you get the behind-the-scenes, commentary, and other extras of the DVD, you also get the two Penguin cartoons from the 2-pack DVD bundle...and...

Easter Eggs!  Go to the Penguin episodes menu.  Highlight an episode.  Move the directional controller on your remote and a penguin appears!  Each episode will let you slide off the menu to two penguins, for a total of four extra "short" animations that launch when you select the penguin.

The Penguin episodes (and shorts) are hilarious.  The quality of the Blu-Ray version is eye-popping:  while Kung-Fu Panda produces lots of color and detail, Madagascar 2 goes it one step further with some pretty amazing depth of focus.  Some of the panning shots, for example, seem to pop off the screen.

In addition to all this, BD Live will connect you to other extras:  we watched a pretty good short documentary about lions, for example.  The way the menu is built makes me think there might be more to come.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, Madagascar 2 is a bizarre and hilarious sequel.  It introduces new characters, keeps the favorites from the first, and adds yet more movie spoofs and references for the grown-ups, some of them obvious (the Lion King) and some more obscure (The In-Laws).  If you're buying for a small child, chances are they might not follow the nuances of blu-ray:  the DVD will upscale enough on most players.  But for the best experience, this blu-ray is the version to buy.
