It was a pleasure to see the zombie theme done in a thoughtful realistic way. These teenzombie films in the States do zero in terms of educating teens out of becoming zombies regarding taste and sensability! !!!! This a European film in English.
Music was fitting and truly spooky echoing on the villagers rattles and setting our nerves on edge.
Some animal cruelty but after the disgusting use of real live animals in "Cannibal holocaust" I didn't mind as it was fake. It planted a strange idea in my mind that Alice may not have been as nice as appeared to be when living ( some psychopths are utterley normal on the outside ) and why the dog went into a frenzy killed her at start of the film. ( one of those kids that start on animals before they move onto tormenting people?) More so because its too vague the time line of when she died and how much they lie about time frame.
Alice was creepy. Kids don't make good actors- it really is better to let them play themselves and then find it in themselves to add their own menace. So she did give me the creeps,,,,,,,,
Not to do a spoiler but the ending is a delicious twist on how far would you go. Especially if it means bringing the TRULY living back from the dead.
Timothy Spall is disturbing as a bumpkin. He usually plays comedy type so sinister to see him in sinister role.
The magic ceremony was too short and improbable but I forgave it because it was nicely suggested anyway. This is not a big budget film and magic is not real.  Nothing was lost. The low key normal way Alice came back was real and unnerving was the point.
Its a good film not up their in the 5 star because I'm not driven to REwatch it really a 3star in my books but 4 star for its refreshing integrity against what's out there in American movie horrorland
