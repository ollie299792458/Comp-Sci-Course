I too saw Rent on Broadway 2 years ago with my husband and loved it.  But for some reason I didn't run right out after and buy the music cd.  But I did right after seeing the movie and haven't stopped listening to it yet.  I went to see the movie with my daughter (she's 20) (she never saw it on Broadway) and we loved every minute of the movie. It was fun to watch her reaction not knowing really the storyline for rent.  She and I half way through the movie looked at each other and said  "have to buy it when it comes out on DVD."  The music is unbelievable, the actors performances and talents, the moving storyline, etc.. I'm sure the movie has it's flaws but I didn't see them.  I found a better perception of each scene from the movie as opposed to the play. I found the play harder to follow, still wonderful but I really enjoyed the movie.  I cannot wait until tomorrow to get the DVD when it goes on sale.  I haven't seen a movie in years that right after seeing it I could have purchased another ticket and gone right back in for the next showing. See the movie, it is fabulous!
