The third great film given us by a young Mexican director in 2006 (along with "Babel" and "Children of Men"), and probably the one most inclined to future classic status, is Guillermo del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno").

This is a beautiful and horrific adult fantasy about a little girl named Ofelia in Franco's fascist Spain of the 1940's, and it cleverly layers the little girl's fantasy world of insect-fairies, fauns and monsters within a stone labyrinth onto the brutal real-life post-Spanish Civil War world where cruelty and willful violence make life intolerable.

These two worlds (presented equally as real) are used by the filmmaker to convey the trauma of war through the inner and outer eyes of the little girl. The story, telling of the heroine's missing (murdered) father and ineffectual mother marrying again to an evil Capitan Vidal (a stepfather threatening to replace the girl's father-image), is a treasure-trove of Freudian symbolism utilizing true Grimm Brothers' stark violence to convey the rite-of-passage ritual through adolescence and the death of innocence. This is truly filmmaking at its highest level, a sort of amalgamation of "Alice in Wonderland" with a David Cronenberg horror film as if filtered through Andrei Tarkovsky, including pitch-perfect performances from the famous Sergei Lopez as the arch-fascist Capitan Vidal to the wonderful Ivana Banquero as the lonely and sad Ofelia.

"Pan's Labyrinth" is a follow-up to del Toro's 2001 film, "The Devil's Backbone", which also placed a young child and a fantasy element into the world of post-civil war Spain, but this time del Toro did it with perfection, making both a quintessential end-of-childhood elegy and a fairy tale about salvation.  Achingly sad and heartbreakingly beautiful, this is easily the richest and darkest fantasy film ever made.
