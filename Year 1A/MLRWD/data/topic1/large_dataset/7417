George Malley, played by John Travolta, is a nice enough guy but he is not exactly  the brightest crayon in the box. He is a well liked auto mechanic who tries hard but is not too good at anything except fixing cars. Then one day, when leaving his birthday party, he sees a light in the sky and then passes out.

When he comes to, everything is different but it takes a while for him to put his finger on it. His concentration is better. He is able to retain what he reads. He has lots of bright ideas. Along with all of this, though, he cannot sleep. He spends all night reading and coming up with gadgets and theories. Most of them work.

His friends notice things are different but they cannot shake the ideal of a dull George Malley. His intelligence makes them a bit jealous and then even frightens them. This is especially true when he manages to learn Portuguese in half and hour in order to save a lost child with food poisoning. They are sure they are afraid when he exhibits some telekinesis. Rumors abound.

Most of the rumors center around the UFO George saw on the night of his change. That makes things scarier.

George falls in love with a single mom and has a hard time winning her over. Eventually, though, he does because she can see his good heart. This is about the time that he comes under scrutiny from academic and government types. The academics want to study him and the government is frightened because they cannot control him. Things come to a head when it turns out that there is a very mundane explanation for the phenomenon and some medical types want to cut him up.

This story has its happy moments and its share of sad ones as well. It a story of acceptance and character. In some case it is the story of the lack of those attributes.
