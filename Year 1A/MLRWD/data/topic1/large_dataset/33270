"Out of Africa" has lots to admire; clearly director Sydney Pollack knows what he's doing, and the acting of Meryl Streep, as Karen Blixen, and Klaus Maria Brandauer, as her husband, is excellent. The African landscape is beautifully rendered in David Watkin's cinematography and complimented by John Barry's music. Kenya's colonial past is well evoked in this production. However, on the other hand: Robert Redford is nowhere near believable. Remember he is supposed to be playing Denys Finch Hatton, someone who was born and raised in England and educated at Eton and Oxford. Compared to Streep's efforts Redford seems to be just walking through this role. As it becomes clear that Finch Hatton and Blixen have different ideas about what course their relationship should take, some of the dialogue between their characters is very hard to take, falling just short of laughably ridiculous. Finally, it's hard for a thinking person not to see "Out of Africa" as an apology for European colonization of Africa. Like the way the romance and nostalgia of "Gone with the Wind" quickly whither when you stop to think that it is the harsh reality of slavery that makes possible the good life at Tara, so it is with Blixen's farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills. Her comforts come at the price of dispossessed Kikuyu, who work as laborers on land they once owned. True, Blixen gave "her" Kikuyu some medicine, and she gave "her" Kikuyu children a school (i.e., a shack that would fit between the couches in her living room), which is probably more than other European settlers did. But is it right that she should refer to any people as "her" Africans? It's impossible to get around the fact that in colonial times the Europeans took the Africans' land, crowded them into designated areas, and exploited their labor. Enjoy the movie, but make an effort to learn the history.
