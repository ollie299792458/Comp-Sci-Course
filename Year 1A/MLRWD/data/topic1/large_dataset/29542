Oh, when I got this video, I'll tell you now: I believed that it was Sunday Afternoon material. But, my views have changed threefold since then. It really is an epic; a tale of how willpower can survive men of the highest caliber in the most serious and severe conditions. It's Christmas: everyone is in a good mood. But one proud man stands up to the captain: he's had enough of the damn navy: shouting, dying, crying: why should he do it? He tells Gene Hackman, playing the role of the captain. He's upset, and ridicules him bigtime. He sends the pilot and his best buddy to fly recon over Bosnia, now named Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the militia see them and shoot them down. They're the real Milosovich crew. It's a cat and mouse chase: and to cut a long story short, the young pilot's friend gets shot before his own eyes. The pilot runs for miles: through railway stations, explosions, death pits and assassins. People think he's dead. But he gets home safely.
I'll give this video four or even five stars, and as a fictional thing, it really brings home how the military deals with real war situations.
