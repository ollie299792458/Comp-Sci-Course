I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees).  I bought this DVD in a store for [..], and can't believe how good it is.  I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain.  My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility.  I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again.

This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose.  He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits.  He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover.  He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time.  Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be.  I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time.

Overall, this was a great yoga workout.  Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob.  =D
