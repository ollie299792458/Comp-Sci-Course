And what a horrible mistake that would've been! Im so glad i kept watching because i ended up LOVING IT! After watching the nerdy kid get bichslapped by nearly everybody he comes in contact with for the 1st 15-20 mins of the movie, i just couldn't take it any more. So i  picked up the remote and literally had my finger on the stop button. Then at the very second i was about to hit it, Michael B. Jordan appeared on the screen and i was like ok, if they're gonna start showing this little hottie now, well then i'll just have to give it more time to see what happens. THANK GOD I DID!! I woulda missed one helluva good movie!  Although many people complain that there are too many 'found-footage' films being made, i personally like that format because it turns what would be for me just another movie into something very realistic. The found footage genre makes movies look like you're watching things that actually were happening for real. In my opinion, take away that aspect of it and film it the regular way and its just another fictional movie. Now couple that with the top notch CGI that they used and dam, this turned out to be one awesomely realistic piece of fiction. Really good movie. Highly recommended.
