Good job by Gina - one of the few women since Sigourney Weaver in "Aliens" to make me believe she was really badass. This is because Gina is *really* a badass. That she has enough acting chops to make you think she isn't just appearing in an extended cameo is a compliment to her. And this is why this movie (mostly) works in its goal of being a good action thriller.

Her acting was spare, as someone else wrote, a sort of feminine Jason Statham. In other words, she knows her strengths and one of them isn't acting. She keeps the emotions spare and doesn't try to milk a scene which lets the movie flow.

Not a legendary thriller action flick, but a good one that is worth the rental for a night. Weaknesses are the rather scatter-shot collection of Big Names brought in somewhat randomly in an attempt to flesh out the very spare plot. Outside of Channing Tatum, I thought the rest of the Big Names were almost slumming their way through the film. I just didn't buy their emotional investment (Michael Douglas looked a bit faded for obvious reasons, Banderas and McGregor didn't seem committed and Fassbender didn't have enough to chew on in the script.)

But when the movie stops trying to justify itself and just gets to fighting and fury, it is at home and a fun time. This is a flick, not cine-mah.

Three-and-a-half stars.
