It starts off with nothing happening (Sopranos home movies, they play freakin Monopoly half the time) and it ends with nothing happening (the notorious Made in America). So unless you are a collector, there is no reason to buy this, especially given the enormous price tag.

I expected this movie to keep you at the edge of your seat. It did not.
The other series were better than this one was. I even liked season 6 part 1.

I watched the first 3 episodes of season 6 part 2 and was ready to turn it off because thats how boring it was.
I kept watching it though because I was hoping that the rest would be better. They were not.
This one episode they show nothing but junior at his home and he has to take pills and he even wets himself at one point. Diary of an old man.

I didnt like the fact that they kept killing people of tony sopranos crew left and right.

And the ending of this season? I didnt like that either. Nothing suspenceful. It did not keep you at the edge of your seat waiting what was going to happen. It was boring as heck.

Everybody has their own opinion but my opinion is that if I had HBO back then and saw this season, I would not buy the dvd.
I am a long time Sopranos fan, but season six was garbage of the worst kind, comparable, inevitably, to the Godfather Part III. Everything was forced and the plot went nowhere, and it was quite obvious that the show became in some way self conscious. The writers began to take themselves far too seriously, and the ending to season six part 2 (a lame finale which only contains 9 episodes) is one of the worst endings in the history of television.
Enjoy seasons 1-5 just as you enjoy the Godfather Parts 1 and 2. Pretend the Godfather 3 never happened, and pretend that all 21 episodes of season 6 were never made.
