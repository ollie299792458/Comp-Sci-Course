watching this movie i expected a five star rating (at least!) for such a distingushed cast, but instead its a jumble of bad story lines mixed into one.
davis is the flighty socialite who marries raines, a dull and workaholic man, who happens to fall in love with her. and so he puts up with her flightiness and watches all her prospective @beaus@ go one at a time. they have a daughter and eventually divorce. but fate puts its hand in...
the above story sounds good, but its hard to say whether its a satire of womens vanity, a romantic drama, a romantic comedy, or what? davis is not in her best form, she speaks at the height of her voice and doesnt add the charisma of such a talent as hers. raines keeps his head above water at least.
its touching at places (in particular the final scene) but the script drowns out the early scenes bringing davis with it.
in my opinion, if you want to enjoy davis, watch jezebel, all about eve or now voyager, this is not, nor even within grasp, of her finest.
