Why are classic TV fans putting up with this? In a recession no less?  $51.00 for a complete season of a TV show? That's the incredibly low Amazon price. Retail is closer to 70 bucks! Even for a classic like Bonanza, that is absurd!  Paramount has done this for the past few years, putting out partial season sets of shows like Cannon, The Untouchables, and The Fugitive.  Yet, they give us full season sets of shows like I Love Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Mannix. Sometimes, they give us the full 1st season of a show(Gunsmoke, Rawhide) then double back on us by dividing up the following seasons into partial sets.  ENOUGH!  This crap was enough to deal with when people had more money than brains. But with less discretionary income available these days, it's not feasible to abuse fans of classic television with these partial season sets, then change out the incidental music to boot! TV fans, Please, PLEASE resist the temptation to buy this. I LOVE BONANZA, but I refuse to be financially RAPED by the marketing team at CBS Paramount Television anymore.  No other studio is pulling this stunt. We, the consumer have the power to make it stop.  Oh, and Paramount, how about releasing the remaining 3 seasons of "Have Gun, Will Travel" before launching another western?  Or do you think half-way is good enough?
