It would take me a million ways to describe my love for this brilliant show. I've been watching lost since the beginning and have always been impressed.

Season 2 brings us to the famous discovery of the hatch, Desmond, and infamous Henry Gale (an other??) I am not going to spoil any of the details if you have not watched. As the show developed into season 2 you really got a feel for these characters. Who they are, what they were made of , and how far will they go for themselves or each other. The answers come slow, but they do come and when they do, they are beyond words.

This show requires patience and time. If you can sit back, relax and pop the DVD in you will be hooked. Trust me! It could def get frustrating at times and make u ask yourself "OK what the HELL is going on?" but at the end of the day you realize how important each episode truly is and how much knowledge you get with every season.

Not only is this show excellent (Thanks to JJ, Carlton, & Damon) but it involves a great group of actors who make it feel so real and extraordinary.

The most current season is getting very exciting and if you are new to the Lost "cult" I suggest you keep going and hang on because you are in for the ride of your life.
