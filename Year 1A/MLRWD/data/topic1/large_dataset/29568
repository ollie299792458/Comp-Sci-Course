This movie is sooooo spiritually deep it just touched my heart! You have to take off your carnal way of thinking or you'll miss the spiritual side of it. This movie made me cry three times. Christopher plummer is the absolute best actor to play the role of JESUS OUR LORD. Through the subtle expressions in his face (like when he says "I have chosen the twelve of you yet one of you is the devil and how he looks at Judas), he captures JESUS perfectly. The way JESUS deals with the prideful pharisees and the people. This movie shows how much control Jesus had, no matter how many times they tried to take him, his time was not yet. I also love the fact that it shows Jesus was not a soft push over but yet he was serious about doing his father's will as we all should be. He expressed anger when the people disrespected his fathers house, he showed humbleness when he washed the feet of the desciples, and he showed authority when he put the pharisees in their place.Like when he tells the chief priest "I have much to say about you" and the way he looked at him and the fact that they do not understand that he's talking about the judgement day when he judges them because he is the judge and the pharisees reject him and in turn reject the FATHER. This movie would tip the scales if it were combined with "THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST" because the only thing it lacks is the severity of the suffering he went through for us. No one takes his life...he lays it down = John 10:17-18 & Mat. 26:50-53. Jesus is on point with all that he says and all his responses to the pharisees. You will see that in this movie. PLEASE LOOK AT THIS MOVIE FROM A SPIRITUAL POINT OF VIEW in order to get the dept of it. 98% word for word with the bible. GOD BLESS!! AND MAY THE LORD OPEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING!!!
