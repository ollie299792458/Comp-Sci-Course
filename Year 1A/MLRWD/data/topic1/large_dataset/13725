No use reviewing the film; that's been done. The relevant question is: is the DVD version worth it? The answer is a resounding YES!!
Picture quality improved. Sound quality GREATLY IMPROVED, it's like going from a table radio to hi-end audio. If you are a die-hard SNF like myself, find someone with a wide-screen monitor and surround sound and have the time of your life!
THE 3 DELETED SCENES--of course I won't spoil the suspense, only to say they are very short, averaging about 1 minute each (well, at least they SEEM that short) But they are interesting in how they tie into the story. Great discussion material
DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY OVER FILM DIALOGUE--excellent, full of inside scoops and tidbits, guaranteed to please.
Also includes VH-1 BEHIND THE MUSIC--this was broadcast before but certainly fits right in, you get to see the stars today. Sadly, the actors who played the mother, father and brother are not seen.
In conclusion: ever since I first saw SNF in theatres, I have never felt the "pulse" of the movie in VHS format due to technical limitations. On Oct.8, 2002, that challenge is now solved!! Long live SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER!
p.s terrific packaging too! Thank you to amazon.com for prompt shipment. I pre-ordered this back in August. They said it would be available on Oct.8th. Surely enough, I got home 10/8 and the package was there!
