This is a classic tearjerker.  I first saw this movie late one night when I was in college on my local PBS station.  I knew from the moment it started it was a title that I must add to my video collection.
It is a simple tale that makes whole the saying, "It is better to have loved and lost then not to love at all."  The characters are two "common" people (doctor and housewife, respectively) that find in one another what they lack in their individual married lives (we really don't have much of a clue as to what these are -- but it really doesn't matter -- the story is about them).
This movie was adapted from the play originally from Noel Coward; so particularly the train station scenes are obviously stagy; but what David Lean did (which I found out from the commentary) was open up the film with exterior shots of the couple "in town."
Overall it is lovely telling picture that I highly recommend.  Criterion has yet again done a magnificent job with the digital transfer making you feel like you are back in the Cineplex of the mid-late 1940's experiencing this film.  Of course, this is without the big-screen.  So curl onto your couch with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy while the rain hits the window . . .
