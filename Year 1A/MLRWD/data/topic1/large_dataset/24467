Definitely not for young children, this is an adult animation -- "adult" as in mature themes and not pornographic.  The animated movie itself follows the book very closely - all the way down to the "rabbit language" which the book provides a glossary for, yet this movie directs it in the way where not knowing "rabbit language" doesn't take away from it.
The way it's animated is not traditional and very emotionally abstract, so don't call this a cartoon or even a family film.  It's not a "cutesy" tale about rabbits but a drama and a statement about culture and society.  Very oriented on the foundations of culture and folktales (where even the rabbits have their own spiritual beliefs and tales they tell around the "campfire").
Although I saw this years ago, I have the video (and am getting the DVD) and even now I the story and direction is riveting and moving.  Deep, exciting, and not boring (unless you're from the Steven Seagle/Rambo set), this is a must-have for your collection.
FYI- some glossary terms:
-Rah: a title of royalty (as in "Hazel-rah" meaning Prince Hazel)
Roo-doo-doo: automobiles, cars
Hombre: a badger
krakkar: a swear word for rabbits
