  People seem to rate this as though it's only an action flick when it is more an adult fantasy. It's the story of an hopelessly bored office nerd with greater potential than he can imagine. In effect, his boredom stems out of his potential. Although the action and acting are great the story line and moral of the story are what stood out to me.
  Basically, Wesley (James McAvoy) is snatched out of what seems to be an endlessly meaningless existance, conditioned by having the heck beat out of him until he learns to fight back. After being mentored by Fox (Angeline Jolie) and deceived into killing his own father, Weslay takes control of his life. After discovering his true identity by studying his father as a supposed enemy, he followed in his father's footsteps by completing his plan to wipe out the corrupt cell of the Fraternity (Assisins of Fate) that trained him, with the help of his mentor, Fox, who was true to the code but deceived as well.
  We've watched the movie multiple times and wonder: what's not to like?
