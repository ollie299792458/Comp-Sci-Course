the footage in this is totally underrated subtle details like sparkling water and insects night noise instead of a big sound track, a lite narrative and low key dialgoue instead of overdrama like Jackson's version(which I love too). This is a fantasy with some dark elements in it. No it is not Rankin and Bass(Who followed up with Return of the King, a musical for kids,)as a child I was a bit baffeled by the changed production, nor is it a 2001 grande CGI show but it has elements both young and old should enjoy and Frodo isn't such a woose like Elija Wood's(scripted) character.(though unlike the books, in this movie Frodo is taller than Pip and merry) Guarde does the voice more hobbit-like. His brother is one of the other Hobbits(I think) and William Squire makes an onimous Gandalf while John Hurt an abruptly manored Aragorn "Stryder" Son of Arathorne. The only grip(and 4 not 5 stars) Baski forgot to conclude his film in a follow up it ends abruptly with "and so Gandalf and friends fight for middle earth" with Gandalf swinging his broadsword and then credits, Baski I am to assume was going to complete this and ran out of steam and didn't.(I would like to have seen the conclusion..
