It's fairly unbelieveable that there are 28 five star reviews as of writing this.  Obviously there are a LOT of die hard Bonaholics who are writing these reviews (which is great).  The only reason I lowered my rating to four stars, is that in comparing this to his Royal Albert Hall DVD, it diminished the importance.  Here are some pros and cons;

Pros;

The Gary Moore cover was a great choice, especially at the time of it's recording.
The new drummer is great, and maybe a little better than the former one.
"If Heartaches Were Nickels" was finally performed on a DVD.
The special guests are amazing, especially John Hiatt.
The snippet about Joe playing in the subway was great.

Cons;

Not that I don't like the songs, but why put "Mountain Time" AND "Woke Up Dreaming" on ANOTHER DVD?  They are very long songs, and I really didn't think it was an asset to add the same 20 minutes of songs that we heard on the Royal Albert Hall DVD.

The second DVD was really unnecessary, because if you eliminated the above mentioned songs, you could have surely added the bonus features to the first disc, and lowered the price of the DVD.

The featurette with David Crosby was very boring, and no disrespect to Crosby, but Joe looks completely bored during the whole "interaction."  It seemed to me like a situation in everyday life when you are talking to someone you are bored with, and just keep saying "yes" and "ok" in hopes that the conversation will soon end.  Does Crosby really think Joe needs hints on playing guitar?  I just didn't find this interesting at all.

So for all the people who couldn't imagine that I gave this four stars, please calm down.  I liked this DVD a lot, and would tell anyone to buy it.  But, for those die hard fans who have everything Joe has released, I have already gotten tired of two DVDs with a few of the same songs on them.  Why does Joe always tend to skip material from his first few albums?  At least the BCC DVD "Live Over Europe" had a wide range of songs.
