Except for one small movie made under communist rule in Romania years ago, I've found nothing in the entire Dracula movie franchise that really addresses the truth behind the typical vampire folklore.  I saw this movie when it premiered on TV three years ago and from the beginning, I was hooked.  I confess I didn't know too much about the real Vlad the Impaler before, so naturally this perspective fascinated me.  More than getting into the historical facts behind the popular Dracula (even if some are distorted for the sake of drama), this is rather authentic movie in the way it is shot, on location in Romania.  (Note: Look closely and you can actually see the house where Vlad Tepes was born in one scene).  Even more so, the acting was surprisingly superb for a TV movie.  Rudolf Martin (besides being the sexiest guy I've ever seen) takes on the role with an appropriate balance of humanity and ruthless brutality.  His portrayal manages to elicit some understanding of a man who once impaled an entire army on a hillside.  Other than this movie, I've seen him only in smaller supporting roles, but it's not hard to see that he is an extremely talented actor.  As Vlad's fragile young wife, Jane March is convincing, but it's hard to figure out at first what her feeling for Vlad are.  Once she starts losing her mind, that becomes quite obvious though.  Overall, I can easily say that this is a fascinating, beautifully shot and acted movie that is, shall I say (in regard to Rudolf Martin) aesthetically pleasing.  This is the kind of Dracula movie people should see.  Capes and fangs have nothing on this guy.
