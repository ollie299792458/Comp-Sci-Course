This is one of those movies that is an assemblage of perfect scenes written beautifully and performed magnificently, based upon a very excellent novel, which somehow fail to work when put together.  I think the filmmakers hoped to reproduce the success of Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia by reassembling many of the best elements of those films, without David Lean directing.  That is probably where the film fails, but it still is a very worthwhile effort.  Peter O'Toole, Donald Pleasance, Omar Sharriff, Tom Courtney, Charles Gray - the list of wonderful actors who give wonderful performances goes on and on.  The music by Maurice Jarre is excellent and appropriate, and the staging and cinematography is worthy of the cast.  Each scene by itself is nearly perfect, but I think the film ultimately fails because its grandiosity somehow misses the subtlety of the story.  The story, which is grandiose in conception actually is very small in action, albeit told against the grandiose backdrop of the war.  The question posed by the story is put beautifully by the script:  "Murder is the profession of generals, is it not?  Well, if we must give medals to mass murderers, let us try to give justice to the small entrepreneur."

This film is well worth having just for the number of great quotes in the script, and the fine performances.  Although it fails to be the great film it so badly wanted to be, it is by no means a bad film.  In fact it is a good film.  We should not let the fact that it fails to live up to its full potential blind us to its qualities.
