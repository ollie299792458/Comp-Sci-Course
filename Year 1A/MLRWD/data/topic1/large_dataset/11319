If you're expecting a movie with epic battle scenes like 300, watch something more Hollywood. This is a thinking person's film, and don't get me wrong, there are some epic battle scenes, but that's not the focus or the point of this movie. If you look at reviews for this movie, you will find they are either very positive or very negative. That's probably due to false expectations of many people. For a good comparison, think THIN RED LINE vs. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. There's a reason why some of the best actors on the planet worked for virtually nothing on THIN RED LINE. The end result was a masterpiece, but not everyone understood the movie. Instead of directly telling you how you should feel (such Saving Private Ryan did), THIN RED LINE passively brought that emotional response. I suppose some people just need to be told how to feel during a movie and need the movie to hold their hand through every step of the way. These same people, who don't want to think, and who can't open themselves up to the movie will also hate VALHALLA RISING. This is an astonishing movie about humanity. In my humble opinion this is a masterpiece. Despite being visually and acoustically amazing it is an in-depth look into mankind as it is rarely found. If you want a Hollywood action blockbuster, you won't like this movie. Go watch something else. If you have a brain, and want to use it, and appreciate awesome cinematography check this one out. You won't regret it. This is by the way, the best DVD I've seen of this film. It has lots of extras and the director's commentary is fantastic.
