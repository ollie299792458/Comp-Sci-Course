Seasons One and Two of THE BATMAN were overall fantastic- in season one there were only 2 episodes i didn't like, in season 2 there wasn't a single episode that i didn't like.  they let a story unfold with imaginative animation and visionary storyboarding.

however, Season Three:  i have no problem with batgirl coming before robin.  i have no problim with the police comish playing such a centripetal role so quickly- i have no problem with a slightly different feel as each season should have it's own feel.  i have no problem with batman now not being "wanted" by the police....

my the problem is that now it is BORING!  batgirl is unrealistic, she is untrained and not even possible.  the lack of continuity of the seasons make this feel like a whole new show.  the mystery is gone.  there is no more folk lore being told.  there isn't any tidbits of story-arch.  the struggle of batman is gone.  the turmoil of bruce wayne's heart is missing.  and batgirl come in to save the day with a now weak batman???

the story is not going deeper, only campier.

the previous opening credits were almost scary and certainly creepy, but they captured the batman perfectly.  now, with homage being played to the 1960's batman series in the title music and batgirl giving a stupid smile, it is just silly.  i am no longer interested in what had become my favorite new superhero cartoon.
