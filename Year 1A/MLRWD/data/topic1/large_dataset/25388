Simply put, this is the "Spinal Tap" of R & B/soul music. My friends and I, all fans of great r & b, soul, and hip-hop, were laughing like hyenas throughout this hilarious video. Imagine the lowest level plot and script writing possible, combined with a repeating song that is also at the lowest level of what r& b/soul has the potential to be, and add to that acting and action that are so unbelievably cheesy and insulting to one's basic, basic, basic level of intelligence that it is outright hilarious. I mean it! This should really be marketed as a comedy, because it is outright GENIUS if you look at it that way. I have never laughed so hard in years. If you want to see the depths that R. Kelly can dig down in to, check out this video, and prepare for a true comedy classic.

I find it hard to believe that anyone considers this a work of genius...it is comedy at it's greatest, parody at it's fullest, and horrifyingly bad lyric and plot writing at it's worst. The only redeeming quality is that R. Kelly seems to take it very seriously, which provides laughs like you may have not experienced before.

Totally embarrassing to any serious fan of great talent, but absolutely worth it to see one of the most absurd, comical things you might ever see.
