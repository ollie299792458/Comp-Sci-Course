A man approaches a salvage team to tow an old Italian cruise ship with a jinxed past.

The best part of this movie was the opening scene on the cruise ship where the wealthy voyagers were slaughtered.  I'm not sure if I'd say it was believable, but it was certainly a sweet effect.

Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne are in the movie - definite plus!!  Some of the ghosts were kind of cool, including the little girl and the sexy young singer.

The movie does have some decent scenes, but overall it was lacking the uneasy or eerie feeling a haunted place would have.  This is a MUST for any ghost story.  Without it, everything is just bland.

Plus the ending lacked imagination....or rather they tried to throw in a twist, but it just wasn't an interesting one. There was relatively little to no foreshadowing about the man who approached the team, so when the time came about for the twist  I was left with a disappointed feeling of,  "oh. they're going to end it that way."
