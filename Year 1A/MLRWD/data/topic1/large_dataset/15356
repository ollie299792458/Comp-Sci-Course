The "Ultimatum" was icing on the cake for me! To finally learn the circumstances of poor Jason's involvement in the "Black Ops" was really fulfiling. I found myself rooting for him throughout the film. That old saying, "if you are not with us, you are against us?" Well, that applied throughout. He wanted nothing more to do with them, but for some reason, everything that could go wrong went wrong and was consequently blamed on him again and again. He cleared himself of any involvement again, but is this the last time he will be targeted as the "source" of their (the CIA'S) problems? I hope not! I hope they continue this series until either Matt Damon is a senior citizen or they figure out a way to kill the character!

Matt Damon is the best. I was aware of him, but never took the time to really watch him perform in his previous films.  The "Bourne" series caught my attention on the TV presentation of the "Identity" film which frustrated me with the commercials so I rented the "Identity" and this began my curosity into the entire series.

I'm happy to say I own all three now and watching them without the commercial interruptions has allowed me a chance to really appreciate this actor's skills.
