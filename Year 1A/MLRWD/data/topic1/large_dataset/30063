I avoided watching this movie for close to ten years.  When I finally watched it, through a friend's recommendation, I discovered that it was one of the better movies I had seen in a while.  However, during the first twenty minutes or so, I wanted to throw the DVD out the window: the dialogue was stilted and the acting was forced, but then something happened and I'm not sure what but when they got off the train I was pulled in.  From there on, I found myself involved in an exceptional film.  The dramatic tension was great especially for there only being two main characters throughout the entire move and also not many supporting characters; it's really hard to have only two people remain interesting for a long time if you think about it.  The acting, aside from the beginning, I thought was excellent.  This is a smart, deep, and at times illuminating movie.  I knew it was purely fictional but I wanted the kinds of discussions and the kind of searching those characters did to be real.  Beyond the beauty of the movie, the DVD had little to no extra features, which I felt was probably due to laziness by the people who put it together considering how much hype this movie generated when it was first released.  Nevertheless, it is quite enjoyable to watch these two characters meander through Germany and also through their own lives.
