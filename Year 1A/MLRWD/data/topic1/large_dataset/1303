This is a story about stagnant sibling relationships. Benny (a mechanic) has structured his entire life around 'protecting' his mentally ill sister, Joon. Both are dissatisfied: she in particular has withdrawn from society and broader human interaction, and has an underdeveloped ability to care for herself. The ensuing frustration manifests itself in pyromania.

His need for control and her isolation are tearing their relationship apart, despite the very real and visible love they have for each other. Sam is a much-needed catalyst for change. I suspect that his appeal for Joon, who is immediately drawn to him, lies in the fact that he makes absolutely no assumptions about her on the basis of her condition.

It has been said that this movie is arguing that love conquers all, but I disagree. Romantic love is presented as a mechanism of change and renewal: but the real story lies in a brother's struggle to overcome his own need to protect his sister from society, and in his blindness when it comes to her own requirements as an adult woman. The viewers and Sam himself are made to confront the very real facts of Joon's illness when their attempt to abscond results in a highly traumatic episode.

Essentially, the movie is a humorous and emotional one. While not the most polished movie you'll ever see, 'Benny and Joon' comes across as very sincere, and it isn't afraid to tackle the tough issues. Johnny Depp is as lovely as always, and the film contains moments of incredible wit, warmth, and a quirky kind of humor in its portrait a mentally ill young woman who has absolutely normal needs when it comes to love, sex, and independence.

And it's nicely gritty, too, and highly effective.
