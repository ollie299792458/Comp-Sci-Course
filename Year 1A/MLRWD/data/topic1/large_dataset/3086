Yes, it can be coined a B-grade film, which means it should be held to a B-grade standard of critical review.  The first of this series was adventurous and somewhat genuine, with good acting and a solid script.  Unfortunately after that, it seemed to go downhill, with WT4 at the bottom.  The issue with WT4 is just about everything.  Part of this can be the fact this film obviously was done on a shoe string budget.  While this is pretty common for a film of this genre that is bypassing a theater near you, what it lacks even more, is effort.

Perhaps taking some time to find more investors and getting a better overall crew and cast could have helped WT4.  Even the second and third installments of this Film Series did better, where the actors portrayed their characters with enough back story and purpose to make a viewer at least somewhat curious as to how their fates might play out.  A loaf of bread and a plywood plank getting thrown into a chainsaw covered in ketchup would have faired for more entertainment than what this film delves out.

The antagonists of the story are not scary or even that sinister looking.  The trapped friends are supposed to be late teen/early twenty chums who are all couples and like to smoke weed.  That's believable, however none of these characters really has any depth or significance in the first place.  That creates a double whammy of "WHO CARES" when the juvenile gore fest style action scenes kill them off.  Believe me, the potential is there, with a supposed abandoned asylum in a Winter mountain snowstorm as a great, desolate back drop.  Unfortunately, a sub-par casting effort and a multitude of forgettable scenes just makes me wonder why they even bothered.
