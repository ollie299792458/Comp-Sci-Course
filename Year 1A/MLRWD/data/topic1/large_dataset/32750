I rate this film excellent! I do not know if it proves that we have a soul as others suggest, but it does present some very good ideas about the future. After all, "science fiction is not the future, it's a twisted view of the present." If you like this be sure to grab the soundtrack as well, which is impeccable at recreating the scenes you see in the movie.
The quality of the symbolism in this movie is unmatched in any other movie I've seen before. The producers and directors did a great job with this, and it is the perfect chance for a great story to shine through.
As an idea, this movie excels in all aspects. All in all, fascinating camera work and excellent locales. One particular scene will leave you blown away.
Science fiction used to be called "science romantic" for good reason. I've found that all science fiction tends to involve a typical romance of some kind, whether it be a love for the future or a sexual relationship, but mostly it's a love and passion for new ideas that can truly change the world around you. This film does not stray from that. Even if you've seen clips of that one genetic-related scene shown on Charlie Rose 4 times, this film won't disappoint.
