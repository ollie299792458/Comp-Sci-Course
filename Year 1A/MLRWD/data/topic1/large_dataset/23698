If you're a Gundam fan then this is one series that you must see. The story created exposes new elements in the U.C. universe that has never before been explored as well as having some yet unrevealed tie-ins to the original Gundam. The animation in this episode was outstanding and the fight scenes were very well produced. The soundtrack for this episode is also very well done and fits perfectly into the scenes. This series is also very unique in the fact that older Gundam fans who have seen all the shows in the U.C. time-line know the events that happened before (Char's Counterattack)and after the series (F91), yet still manages to intrigue the viewer and leave them wanting more.
One drawback to this episode is that it leaves very many questions for the viewer unanswered and hopefully the later volumes flesh out the rest of the story.
The Japanese and English casts are very well chosen, this is one of the few series where I actually don't mind which language that I'm watching it in.
While U.C. Gundam fans will have a far greater appreciation of this series than more recent or non-Gundam fans, I believe that this show still delivers a good stand alone story that can still be enjoyed without seeing other Gundam shows.
For those who want a get even more out of this episode I recommend watching the original Gundam, Zeta Gundam and Gundam Char's Counterattack.
This is a must see for any Gundam or Sci-fi fan.
