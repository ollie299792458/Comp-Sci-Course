I wanted to just put this up here not as a review of the show because Mad Men is awesome and if you're looking at this you probably you know that. But please if you're new to the show listen to this warning.

You MUST watch this show in order to get the most out of every episode. Most television shows I feel you can skip some episodes and still derive a great quantity of joy from subsequent episodes but Mad Men stands apart. It is a show that I think in such a masterful way build on each previous episode. And if you miss an episode you're going to miss the reasons why certain characters act the way they do, talk the way they do and do the things that they do.

For example I missed season two finale the carousel and went on to season three and I was like what the heck is going on I didn't realize it until I finished all of season three and was like something was off the whole season seemed a little bit tweaked as they were building on things that I had missed ( it is of note that the carousel was the one of the most amazing season finales that a person could miss but somehow I pulled that off I can be a bonehead sometimes)

For instance Roger Sterling has so much back story and is not even a real major player in the show but if you miss some episodes you missed the buildup to his character. Don Draper is a Shining example of someone that is touched upon and built upon in (almost) EVERY episode.

So that is my warning watch every episode of Mad Men from start to finish in order.

PS watching madmen in high definition is a must that's why recommend only watching it that way. The Blu-Ray looks amazing and may even be better than what you're used to watching on your cable high def channel.
