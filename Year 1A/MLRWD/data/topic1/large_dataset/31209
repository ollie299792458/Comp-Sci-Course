This series is one of the most enjoyable I've ever glued my eyes to and also one of the few shows that starts off great and just gets better each week. While everyone is entertained by naked men and women, sex and violence( the fight scene choreography is so different from anything else so far put to screen )one thing remains firm--the writing is extraordinary and the acting meets the challenge. The language is near poetry, and the machinations of the characters are endlessly entertaining---equal to the most magnificent show ever on television I Claudius. I miss terribly John Hannah, who stole the show from day one.Yet the most diabolical characters were Lucretia and Ilythia. They will be surely missed in the final season...unless Lucy's producer/creator husband comes up with a twin sister role for her. Yet I think not because the show must leave behind the small venue of Capua to the big arena ( no pun intended )of Italy itself. Even though we lament that the next season will be the last, we must remember the slave rebellion (the Third Servile War )lasted all of two years. Next comes the maneuvering of Roman senators, Crassus, a young Caesar, the Great Pompey, and Metullus, the First Triumverate.The show tries to be historically accurate as possible within the confines of entertainment, which is why we have the figures Crixus, Gannicus, and Onemaues. It was Crixus who disputed strategy with Spartacus, wanting to return to Gaul (modern day France )instead of escaping by sea via the assistance of Cilesian pirates ( who later on were wiped out by Roman fleets under Pompey)and whose success created a burning rivalry with Caesar.Crixus took about twenty thousand with him, headed north and was exterminated by several Roman legions.Later gaining power Crassus was wiped out by being surrounded by a Parthian host and lost sixty thousand legionnaires.Inadvertenly Spartacus was partially responsible for the decline and end of the Roman Republic.......As far as the conversation of Liam replacing Andy, I had no problem with it because after just rewatching the first season it came to me that Liam had a stronger screen presence than Andy and finer oratory skills and voice quality.Anxiously awaiting season two on dvd and Blu ray and watching the final season next spring.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007055JQ8">Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series</a>
