This movie is superbly endearing and charming! the bad: I HATED Jason Alexander's character; and I also hated the "nurse Diesel" type nurse who was nothing more than a shriveled-up old sourpuss (and what was that scene in the car where her & Rosemary were talking?  She was gorgeous in THAT scene, but not when Hal saw her! whazzupwidthat???)
the good:  Hal was SO likeable, even as a jerk! (but I'm a big fan of Jack & Tenacious D-I even saw them in concert in Bham Alabama in '02); K.G. was gratuitously included in a small part; Gwynneth was actually kinda sweet in this one; I LOVED Rosemary's parents!; Leeboy was SO fat-yet-adorable!; they really did an awesome job of making the Ralph character look ugly and dorky, he is in fact a VERY gorgeous man!; Tony Robbins really did an excellent job!; Brooke Burns did an AWESOME job as both the beautiful AND ugly Katrina!; the scene in the hospital toward the end, where Hal finally sees what's wrong with little Cadence, brings tears and chills! JUST GET IT-GET IT-GET IT!!
