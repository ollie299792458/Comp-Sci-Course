This is not your average soft porn - this movie is about a BDSM relationship.  If you don't know what that stands for, this may not be the movie for you.  If you do, this is one of the best you'll ever see.  The seduction and the energy between these two is incredible.  Kim Basinger's striptease, performed to Joe Cocker's "You Can Leave Your Hat On," is absolutely classic.  They even managed to make the midnight snack scene hot, even though I kept thinking, "Who's going to clean that up?"

This film has a well-deserved cult status in the genre.  If you're able to appreciate the beauty of this type of relationship, the only real disappointment is the way the movie ends.

If you love the story, I would also recommend the book this was based on, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060746394">Nine and a Half Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair</a>.  However, if you find the ending of this movie depressing, you definitely don't want to see the sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573623857">Another 9 1/2 Weeks</a>, unless you just can't get enough of Mickey Rourke scowling.
