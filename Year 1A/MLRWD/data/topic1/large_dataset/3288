Jim Morrison's voice changed so much as an adult that it has become an increasingly interesting topic to me. Sometimes, he sounded like an 18 year-old kid when he was actually mid-20's, and sometimes his voice became really raspy and deep. His singing voice was categorized as a baritone, meaning it was a deep voice, but you'd never think his real voice sounded like it really did. He was such an intriguing person that even his voice was a cause for interest. When he was famous and in the spotlight, he barely ever said anything public when he wasn't on stage. He was a reserved person when he wasn't performing, and may have been aware of how peculiar his voice was, but the fact that this DVD went the extra mile to find footage of him just lounging around, relaxing with Ray, Robby and John made it that much better. A lot of the stuff that you only hear about you get to actually see in this DVD, including their controversial appearance on Ed Sullivan. You also get to see the Hollywood Bowl concert on July 5, 1983 in its entirety. The Doors may have been the greatest band of all time.
