It's pretty rare that I'm in Best Buy and the TV above me is advertising something so eye catching that I completely lose my train of thought and forget why I'm even in the store. Well, when the preview for Hatchet played that's exactly what happened. I believe it was sometime in October that I first heard of it from being in the store and later found that the movie was not in theaters in my area. Disappointed, I did the only thing I could, wait for the dvd release.

Well, when the day came I went and picked it up and immediately fell in love with it. The whole movie in general, the story of Victor Crowley, the plot, the casting, everything. Never hearing of Adam Green I became interested in his work and recently bought Spiral. Both great films. Many people didn't enjoy Hatchet the way I did, they said "It's so corny" WELL THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! IT ISN'T CALLED OUT SCHOOL AMERICAN HORROR FOR A REASON PEOPLE! It's supposed to be corny with the little blood squirts. If you don't appreciate real horror, then this movie isn't for you. Hatchet is an A+ in my book.
