My sister happened to work at a video store in the late 80s and we had the luck of free or discounted rentals to replace what we lacked in cable then.  I had always been fascinated with godzila movies, Ben-Hur and Abbott and Costello films on TV at noon on Saturdays on the local channels.  I picked up Sullivan's Travels as a start to this fascination with movies beyond the latest release my sisters cherished more than the "movies without color" that I was lately intersted in.  This movie and The Philadelphia Story began my love and devotion and romanticism of the 40's romantic screwball comedy.  Sullivan's Travels like Philadelphia Story left me not just with a smile but with character.
Joel McCrea is the dead pan star which led me through adventures of a man thinking suffering was the way of a true life.  He found that laughter was.  And that is this movie's point.  To make you laugh and enjoy it.  Veronica Lake tags along as the girl in her best ever role as simply "The Girl".  And the various servents and movie studio people (McCrea plays a Director) who tag along add uproarious humor to the whole story.  Look forward to the Luxary Bus Chase.  Just smile at the simple church scene toward the end of the picture.  In our times of late, laughter for laughters sake is the pointof this film.
This movie made me look more at our past film heritage, I think it might make you too...remember these people invented the jokes and situations that you see even now in movies. Also one the kids can appreciate. Beware only of a few stereotypes of 40s nature.  But this is one you'll truly feel glad you have around to see.  Also a Federal Registry Film Treasure.
