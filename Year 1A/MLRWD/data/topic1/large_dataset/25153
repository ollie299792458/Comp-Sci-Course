As a kid, i only knew "The Lone Ranger" in reruns. Recently, I happened to come across a budget and cheaply put together DVD package of Western movies and TV shows that including about twelve "Lone Ranger episodes. My little boy and I watched those episodes and enjoyed them so much that I decided to purchase this package that I am now reviewing.

"The Lone Ranger" is basically a story of good and evil and I think that it's a great thing for kids to see heroes who have a sense of morals; that there is "good" and there is "bad" and we must choose the "good". The show is played out on a level that children ages seven and up can grasp. Most of all, "The Lone Ranger" is a story of friendship between "The Lone Ranger" and "Tonto". It's wholesome family entertainment.

This DVD package comes with over seventy five episodes which, to me, look as if they were remastered quite well, despite the fact that this show was on TV around the the time when TV was in it's infancy (late 1940s and 1950s). The package also includes a bunch of little surprises such as extras that include a "Lone Ranger" cartoon that I never knew existed; as well as an envelope that includes "Lone Ranger" memorabilia such as a photo of the "Lone Ranger", a membership card to the "Lone Ranger" fan club, a booklet that tells the history of "The Lone Ranger", and a "Lone Ranger" comic book.

The package itself it is handsomely put together with beautiful artwork and pictures of "The Lone ranger" and "Tonto" in action.

I thought that it was a great buy. If you watch two episodes a week, this package with over 75 episodes will keep you going for over half a year until you have to start all over gain.
