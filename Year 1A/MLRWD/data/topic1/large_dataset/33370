I am a HUGE fan of Sarah, partially listening to her music each day.  I've enjoying seeing her concerts and then reliving the experience through her DVD.  Symphony does not make this connection.

Her live concert tour for Symphony was the outstanding fusion of visual, music, and dance.  So many concert songs left me in awe of the creation that totally moved me.  This DVD has no connection to the concert tour.  Be warned.

Instead it is a stiff, rigid visit to a cold church with cold people looking on with cold expressions.  Sarah spends the entire concert walking up and down the aisle like some runaway bride.  Lighting and candles try, and fail, to bring depth to the visuals.  The same camera angles are used again and again and, yet, again.  Boring.  I can't even describe the audience.  It is full of people in winter coats and scarfs.  They have the most non-expressive faces that just bring the mood down, down, down.  I just took another look at them and wanted to scream.  You are with Sarah, show some emotion.

I am hugely disappointed by this DVD.  Don't buy, unless you like seeing Sarah in concert with no dancers, no costume changes, no expressive audience, no set changes, and finally, NO lifts in the air above the audience like a angel.
