Big budget, cookie-cutter formulaic films with "all-star" actors and extensive special effects are a dime a dozen these days.  It's no wonder people have become desensitized to films with all the money-whoring spineless sequels that assail them.

This movie has none of the above.  Some great B actors and comedians collaborated to make this story of "real life" so amusingly close to home for many people with different family histories.  In a world obsessed with reality tv, this film appeals to many different audiences beyond those who appreciate the sense of "realness" that those shows afford.  This film reaches those with visions of success and perfection, to the folks who have a crazy relative, or anyone who's ever been disgusted with the world of beauty and pageants.  There's something to be gained in this film for everyone.

That is to say that despite a few "contrived" moments during the course of the film, the team of directors, actors, producers and staff are able to share a convincing picture of what it means to be a family experiencing all manner of adversity, and how they cope.  The movie itself deserves four stars, I feel, mainly because it's not one of those movies you'll find yourself wanting to watch over and over again, but the alternate endings and commentary add more flavor and insight into the creative process that went on, and definitely bump up that last star to make this a must-buy purchase for anyone who enjoys family "dramedies".
