I saw this movie when it was originally released, mainly because of James Coburn, whose work in "Our Man Flint" (ok, so I was only 17) I had also enjoyed.  Be warned, this movie is really two movies in one.  The first half is a light comedy, but the second half turns dark and sad.  James Coburn projects an undercurrent of a man who may not regret his past, but would like to re-live it.  The movie is set in the American West in the early 1900's.  Coburn is an Irish Republican Army terroist who had to flee Ireland and is trying to hide out.  Rod Steiger plays a Mexican peasant who robs people for a living.  After robbing a custom stagecoach, Coburn happens along and Steiger tries to have some fun with Coburn.  Without giving the movie away, the results are not what was expected.  Coburn and Steiger end up going after the same goal, for differnt reasons.  Again, the result is not what either expects.  The end result is a lesson learned by both.  The acting play between Coburn and Steiger is very good, the story is definitely original, and many emotions are touched.  This movie will stick with you for a long time.
