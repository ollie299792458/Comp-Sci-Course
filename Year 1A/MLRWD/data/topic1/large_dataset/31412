I only purchased this when the HD-DVD's came down to 5.99. So for a great price, I got a high def copy with a copy that will play in my laptop if need be.

The movie to me is the kind of typical loser teenager tries to make something of themself movie. But thats not a bad thing if done right. And for the most part, this movie is done right. It even gets the 'adult influence' right when they casted Lewis Black. I was quite pleased when I realized they weren't going to do the stupid love triangle throughout the entire movie. Once they hit the downfall of the guy, the movie picked up for me. The rally wasn't a huge rally where everyone just changes their mind and switches to the kids side, its a rally where the people were telling the kid not to do it.

The movie does have some foul language and some situations that may be inappropriate for some ages, and parents probably need to sit through it before letting their kids watch it, and I would be prepared to have questions about some topics.

The extras were pretty good, I like the inclusion of outtakes, and this had a fairly lengthy outtake reel. There were quite a few of deleted scenes, and the commentary was pretty good...
