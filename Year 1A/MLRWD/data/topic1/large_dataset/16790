I'm not even going to bother nitpicking about how inaccurate the dinosaurs are or how rough the picture quality is; it was 1925.  There is no point in comparing it to a modern film.  For those who insist on complaining about the unconvincing dinosaurs: This was one of the first feature-length movies to employ stop-motion animation.  It was the first movie to combine stop-motion animation effects with living actors.  Cut it some slack.  (It was also shown as the first in-flight movie.)

It's _Jurassic Park_, Version I.

I'm aware that the plot of this film was panned even when it was new, and it deserved it.  The story line is somewhere between weak and nonsensical.  There are some unpleasant racial stereotypes that, unfortunately, were more common at the time.  The filmmaking is beyond dated; the movie was released in 1925 so that shouldn't surprise anyone.

The stop-motion dinosaurs look like home movies in comparison to today's computer animation, but they were state-of-the-art at the time and are still surprisingly effective if you watch the movie with the technological limitations of the silent era in mind and are forgiving.  Even if the movie itself is unimpressive by modern standards, it's very interesting from a historical perspective.
