I have recently become a very big fan of all the adaptations of The FATE/Stay Night series. I would even go as far as to say that it is the best Action/Fantasy story I have read/watched in the last Ten years. With that said, This movie Doesn't explain KEY Story points very well to make the time constraints of a Theatrical picture. In order to understand the movie entirely without Torrenting the original game (Which I don't feel is a bad idea, but it does contain sex scenes, you are warned), I suggest looking up the original Anime and watching that first. It explains almost everything that is relevant to the this movie.

With that said, I still give this movie FIVE stars. It is one of the best anime films I ever seen. Unlimited Blade Works is my personal favorite of the three story lines. The Action is beautifully animated and flawless in every aspect. The story is still gripping and very through despite the time constraints. I don't know how the dubbing will turn or if they will bring back the original cast for the dubbing, but It will well be worth the money regardless.

In short, It is not perfect, but you will not be disappointed. If it is a random buy, You will love it. If you are a fan, You will love it.

I hope this helps your decision. I already ordered mine.
