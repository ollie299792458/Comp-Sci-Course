These three films, all produced by Slingshot Entertainment are wonderful displays of 3D computer imaging.  Slingshot has also released several IMAX films on DVD that were originally shown in 3D and I sincerely hope that one day they release them in 3D formats as well, and who knows, perhaps classics like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, or Captain EO (rumored to be released in Japan on 3D DVD in 2003).  
The Haunted Castle is by far the most satisfying disc.  Very much like a cross between Myst, the 7th Guest, and The Mind's Eye, I will be playing this one at my Halloween party this year!  Alien Encounter was fun, and Encounter was a short overview of the history of 3D, I only wish they'd shown more clips from films.  The clips that are included are quite small as they were intended to be on an IMAX screen.  A great set.  My only real complaint: The inserts states the films range from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  However, they are each roughly 35 minutes long.  This is a good length, as most people's eyes can't take more 3D in one sitting.
This set comes with field-sequential glasses, which are far superior to the old red and green analglyph glasses!!!!  They use liquid-crystal lenses which flicker rapidly between right and left images. And I am certain there will be more releases in time that use this format, therefor the glasses will not sit around unused after viewing.  The glasses are by Razor 3D 
Tube TVs have better quality color and definition for this format, but I have a 51" projection TV which works fine.  Best when viewed in a dark room, which makes the flicker much less noticeable.  A must have set for 3D enthusiasts!
