This is a great story for kids of all ages. 
I'm so glad that the DVD is available because I've clear worn through my VHS copy!  I've taught myself to draw on this movie thanks to the haunting island images and the heart-pounding race scene. I've seen this movie more than a 100 times since my parents bought it for me as a child and my pulse always skyrockets during the race. What kid wouldn't want to be Alec Ramsey? I don't know how many times I wished the Black would show up at my grammar school and whisk me away to adventures beyond the Chicago streets. The movie was beautifully filmed and I can't believe that it was not awarded an Oscar nomination for Cinematography (all it got I believe were nominations for Best Supporting Actor - well deserved! - and Best Film Editing -?!-). The island was wonderfully shown, forbidding at times, haunting at others. The scene when the Black and Alec meet for the first time never fails to bring a smile to my face: what wonderful training! Kudos to the trainers of Cass Ole! That horse should have gotten a nomination... The story follows pretty closely to the book, aside from the fact that, in the book, Alec is visiting an uncle, and not on a trip with his father. Still, everything from the island on seems pretty right on. Mickey Rooney was great: the crotchety ol' trainer convinced to return to the sport of kings one last time.
"And now, here he sits, a hero among boys [and girls!!], with the love of a horse, much more than mere toys...."
