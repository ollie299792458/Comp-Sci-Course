I'm a standup comedian, on the road constantly.  Many of the hotels I stay in don't have decent fitness centers, or the fitness room isn't open when I finally have time to exercise after my shows late at night. Walking outside is often not an option in the dangerous and/or unfamiliar neighborhoods where the hotels are. This dvd is the perfect solution for me! At least, the concept is. I loved it the first two times through.  I liked her friendliness, positive attitude, and the fact that she included her girlfriends in the video. But her high pitched voice soon becomes grating -- too annoying to listen to.  And the canned music is awful!!  So I just turn the volume off and play music of my own choice while I walk along with them.  Now I often just do the routine on my own completely, without the dvd at all.  It was a great motivator, though, and I'm glad I bought the dvd. The belt is a good concept, but the elastic is too loose to give me much resistance.  When I'm at home, I skip the belt and use hand weights instead.
