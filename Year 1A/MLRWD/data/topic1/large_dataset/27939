Okay, just watched the movie and am utterly disgusted by the fact that they were trying to market this as another "grudge" type movie which is perhaps one of the main reasons why it didn't do so well at the box office.

The only similarity between "the grudge" and this movie is that they both feature Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead role. The way the movie was promoted before it's release with respect to the trailer as well as the poster fooled quite a number of people including myself (who is a die-hard Gellar fan) into thinking that this was going to be yet another "ghostly cheap scare" flick.

It wasn't until today that I had the chance to view the movie and realized that this movie was wrongly promoted and what a great movie it truly is. It has a solid plot backed by substantial performance from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Peter O'Brien. The chemistry between the two is undeniable and really did carry the movie far.

Important thing to know is that I didn't sit through the film hiding behind a cushion hence proving my point that this isn't some random "ghostly cheap scare movie". In fact they kept the annoying "jump out of nowhere and scare the pants off you" scenes to a minimum and the ones they have wasn't that scary either.

Yes, for the first twenty minutes of the film, it was difficult to follow due to the pacing of the film. However, as the movie progresses the pieces started to fit together and the final scene whereby they reveled how the connection between Joanna and terry's lover was established was truly emotional and provided a satisfying finish to the film.

If you're looking to scare yourself silly go get "the grudge" DVD but if you are looking for something that has depth with actual storylines, this movie is for you.

Bottom line, this movie has potential but this potential was sadly trampled by the tactless marketing.
