I have been the workout Queen nearly my entire life.  So when someone comes along and tries to sell me a bill of goods, I'm like..."Yeah right liar!"  I worked out in the gym with weights; back in the day when I was "the" only woman in the gym.  I have done Yoga, Pilates, running, biking, hiking, you name it I've done it.  A few years ago menopause destroyed my figure and I did research for two years to fight the middle age spread.  I was going kicking and screaming.  Then one day I thought, "What about Madonna?"  She has more money than a King but I figured maybe, just maybe, she knew something.  I stumbled onto the name of her trainer and figured I'd try it.  What did I have to lose?

I wanted to wait until the 30 days were up but I am so thrilled by the results that I am writing after 8 days.  I have lost one dress size to date.  I am actually getting dressed to go out in a dress I have not been able to wear in two years.  This woman is a genius!  I will be fifty-five in two months and by the time I reach my birthday, I'm going to be able to put my bikini back on and flub my nose at middle age.  I look fabulous and I am definitely going to flaunt it.  I FINALLY found something that works.  God bless Tracy Anderson.  She is my new Guru.

The bad news is you have to work hard.  The first workout took me two hours to get through and I lost my cookies after the workout.  I woke up the next day feeling like I lost a fight to Mike Tyson.  The diet was easy for me.  I was already doing something very similar before I began.  After the fourth day, I felt like a true athlete again and today I not only breezed through the workout but then I had enough energy to walk two miles!

Try it, stick with it and soon you will never avoid your reflection without clothes in the mirror ever again.  This truly is no gimmick.
