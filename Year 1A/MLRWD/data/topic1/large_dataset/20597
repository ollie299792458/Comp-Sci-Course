Once again, New Line has taken an incredible movie, and put together an incredible DVD to go with it.  This edition in the Platinum Series offers up many fascinating features at a low price.
First of all, Boogie Nights  is an amazing movie.  I consider this one of my favorite movies of all  time, and I appreciate it more with each viewing. Paul Thomas Anderson has  crafted a mesmerizing view of the 70's porn industry that focuses on many  different fascinating characters.  Anderson pulls solid performances from  all the actors--most notably Mark Whalberg (who deserved an Oscar for this  work) Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Burt Reynolds.  But, really, all  of the actors involved did a great job.  This truly is the work of an  ensemble.
This movie can be dark, though there are a few glimmers of  light to be found within.  Anyone who loves a movie about people and their  lives will find Boogie Nights a wise purchase.  Moreover, this is a movie  that needs to be owned--for you will want to watch it again and  again.
And thanks to New Line for putting together such a high quality  DVD to go with this amazing movie.  The commentary by Paul Thomas Anderson  is particularly intriguing.  A must-hear for any fan of the movie.
