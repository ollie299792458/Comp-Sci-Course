*warning, spoilers*

  This movie has a great message, a great concept, and a script that had some bugs in it but was pretty good overall.  If you need a pick-me-up and you're into size acceptance, you have GOT to own this DVD.

  I'm sad to say this movie didn't survive long in the theaters for good reasons (and we NEEDED this movie to be in theaters to spread the "good news" about self-acceptance!)  Trouble is, this was the director's first, every single attempt at humor bombed horribly, and the acting was horrible.  On that last note, I will point out one exception: the scene in which Jazmin has a breakdown was an extremely strong moment, as was the following morning.  It was real, raw, and deeply moving; for a second it was easy to forget that you were watching a craptacular movie.

  I'm also confused by the fact that in terms of production values (lighting, props, camerawork, costuming) the first ten minutes or so of this movie are very strong, mostly.  As the movie wears on, things just get progressively more pathetic -- a previous reviewer was right in saying it looked as if it was being shot with a home video camera.  And I kept feeling nagged by all sorts of prop issues.  Why, for example, at that lavish Nigerian buffet are they using paper plates and plastic silverware while sitting on cheap metal/carpet ugly chairs?  Why doesn't that department store feel realistic?  Why, if Jazmin has really "made it" at the end of the movie, is she carried down the catwalk in a litter constructed of cardboard that looks as if it would fit better in a 3rd grade play?  It required the audience to be in a near-constant state of "suspended disbelief" in order to enjoy it.

  Oh, and speaking of the fashion show -- for the most part, those clothes were horrible, even though Jazmin was often dressed impressively.

  *sigh*  We're going to have to wait decades for anything like this to come around again and be done right.  So Phat Girlz is better than nothing.
