This was one of the great movies of summer 99. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo star in the remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen&amp; Faye Dunaway movie The Thomas Crown Affair. Which personally i think the remake is so much better. This version is helmed by action ature John McTiernan who is best  known for Die Hard. Shows that he isn't just an action director he can  direct a romance. But what makes this movie work is the chemistry between  Brosnan and Russo who sizzle and light up the screen. Pierce Brosnan who is  very handsome and Rene Russo is gorgeous they are both awsome. 
The  script by By Kurt Wimmer and Leslie Dixon is very good and there is really  never a boring part in it. The script develops the characters well and the  heist scene in the art museum was really well done. The photography is  great so is the jazzy music from Composer Bill Conti. Oh you can't forget  the small but funny role by Faye Dunaway who was in the original. Rent this  or do what ever to see it. becuase it has great chemistry between Brosnan  and Russo and what is really great is that they are about the same age. But  what is the stand out i think is John McTiernan who shows that he can  direct other films than just action. This was maybe one of the best summer  films that i saw. And it proves that Brosnan can do other projects than  just 007 films. This films $68 million dollar gross should tell you that.
