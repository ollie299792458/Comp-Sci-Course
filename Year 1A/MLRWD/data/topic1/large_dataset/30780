I find it both amusing and somewhat sad that "George" (on October 21, 2001) commented the 1.33/4:3 DVD release as follows: "Remember film fans, you might have to do a little research on a given movie before assuming that a video release is not the true format."

Before that, he pointed out "Do not go looking for widescreen format before 1954, because with a couple of exceptions (see "sir-critic" below), they don't exist.", which is true, as well as "From Here to Eternity" is a great classic film that was shot and originally released in 1.33:1 aspect ratio.", which isn't.

Fact is, the movie was shot originally in 1.37:1, and then re-released in the new widescreen format, 1.66, the following year. Some cinemas couldn't handle that, and the projectionists had to work hard composing a decent frame...

Anyway, the movie became an instant classic, a romantic drama that ends with Pear Harbor being attacked. Montgomery Clift shines here more than ever with his naked vulnerability.
