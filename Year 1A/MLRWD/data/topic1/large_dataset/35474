I THINK THE WHOLE APPEAL TO THE JAPANESE GHOST STORY IS DEAD. I LIKED THE RING, I LIKED GRUDGE BUT AFTER THAT I REALLY CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE. THE CONCEPT IS DEAD, IS BEEN PLAYED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO THE POINT IT'S NOT SCARY ANYMORE.

SHUTTER IS ANOTHER REMAKE OF A JAPANESE FILM. THIS TIME AROUND THE SPOOKY WHITE JAPANESE GHOST GIRL IS HAUNTING THE CAMERA. HER DEATH IMAGE IS CAPTURED IN FILM EVERY TIME PHOTOGRAPHER BENJAMIN SHAW (JOSHUA JACKSON) TAKES A PICTURE. NEWLY WEDS JANE AND BENJAMIN MOVE TO JAPAN FOR BENJAMIN'S CAREER. THERE JANE STARTS TO SEE IMAGES OF A GIRL, NO THIS IS NOT A LESBIAN FANTASY ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT BETTER WITH A SHOT OF GIRL ON GIRL ACTION, BUT INSTEAD YOU GET THE BASIC LOOK AT ME I AM A GHOST THAT MOVES REAL FAST AND APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE. AS JANE EXPLORES SHE COMES TO FIND OUT A GREAT MYSTERY AND CRIME THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE.

THE MOVIE IS VERY SLOW PACED. I THINK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE AMERICAN RE-MAKE HAPPENS, BESIDES THE RING AND THE GRUDGE WHICH I THINK HELD IT'S SPOOKY NATURE, BUT WITH THE EYE, RING 2, GRUDGE 2 AND ALSO THIS ONE THEY LOST THAT CREEPY JAPANESE FEEL TO THEM. THIS MOVIE IS BORING AND TO LONG. ONLY THREE MOMENTS STOOD OUT IN THE WHOLE MOVIE AND REALLY THEY COULD NOT EVEN SAVE THIS PUSHED TOGETHER PILE OF USELESS CINEMA.

THERE IS A REALLY COOL SHOT OF A FLY CRAWLING UNDERNEATH THE SKIN AND IT COMES OUT THE EYE. ANOTHER SHOT A FRENCH KISS FROM HELL WITH A DECAYING TONGUE WAS A GREAT OVER THE TOP MOMENT. ALSO A SHOT OF A DECAYING GHOST WANTING TO HAVE SEX WORKED IN A VERY ODD WAY.

THIS MOVIE HAS NO REAL BASIS TO EVEN WANT TO BE WATCHED. IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD FAN OF JOSHUA JACKSON THEN GIVE IT AGO, HIS PERFORMANCE WAS VERY WELL ACTED AND BROUGHT THE MOVIE TOGETHER. RACHAEL TAYLOR IS HOT AND IS NOT BAD TO LOOK AT AND THAT IS ANOTHER APPEAL TO THIS PLASTIC LOOKING MOVIE, IT'S BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. THE IMAGES AND PLACES CAPTURED BY THE CAMERA LENS BRINGS OUT A LIVING ARTISTIC BEAUTY THAT YOU SEE IN MOST JAPANESE FILMS. I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS JUST TO SAY I WATCHED IT AND WAS ABLE TO TELL OTHERS THAT IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH THE TWO FIFTY TO RENT IT OR NETFLIX IT. I SAY GIVE IT AGO IF IT'S ON CABLE BUT OTHER THEN THAT A PURE WASTE OF MONEY.

DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR, AVOID THIS ONE AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL WHICH IS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THEN THIS ONE AND IS A GOOD SPOOK WATCH.
