Overall, this is a great set for any fan of Mae West. I bought it to replace a pile of VHS I have. My only wish is that this set would have included ALL her classic films in one library. Missing are: "Every Day's a Holiday", "Belle of the Nineties", and "Klondike Annie", as well as "The Heat's On".

What you do get is:
1. Goin to Town
2. Go West Young Man
3. I'm no Angel
4. Night After Night
5. My Little Chickadee

Frankly, I could have done without "My Little Chickadee" on this set. I never liked WC Fields and as a Native American, this film is really offensive (not to say that Mae had anything to do with that part of it). WC Fields treats this supposedly Native American companion like a dog he can kick around who still comes and licks him on the face at night. Fields literally abuses the companion physically and verbally and that's supposed to be funny. Furthermore, the supposed Indian says crap like "Ug" and "Big Cheif gottem new squaw?". Its sickening. The only thing I like in the whole movie is Mae's gorgeous gown worn when she sings "Willie of the Valley". I would much rather have had one of the missing films I mentioned above included in this set.

Considering the price, this set is a real bargain. The picture and sound is great and the case is thinner than the width of one VHS, saving me a lot of space in my collection.
