Did anyone else happen to walk out of this movie with their eyes strained and their stomach hurting? I saw this movie and Bourne Identity side by side and there is a definite difference in the style of cinematography.

The story seemed a little fast in the begining in order to bring Bourne back into the picture. The rest of the story was great, everyone had ample character development. They played the same idea with Bourne forgetting something and needing to find out but tied it up into another plot of spy games. Makes you wonder if spies ever live happily ever after.

Back to the cinematography, normally I'd rank this a five star movie but I couldn't get it out of my head on how jumpy the movie was. Every part had this bouncy feeling to it that just drove you nuts. I see a lot of people giving this movie good reviews but I see no one commenting on the bad cinematography job. I thought I'd pitch in my two cents. Good movie to watch, not a good movie to entertain guests.
