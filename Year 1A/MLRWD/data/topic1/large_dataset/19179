Most of the negative viewer responses related to the content of this movie are due to the fact that this "Devdas" has stripped all of the content and dramatic substence from the original Bengali classic and substituted a skeleton story surrounded by gold, glass, and glamour. Viewers who have only seen this "Devdas" have NO idea what they have missed.

It is the materialist production values combined with a complete disregard for the actors/screenplay that make this movie such a failure.  Not to mention the size and arrogance of the set, and the presumption that the movie is an inheretor of "Devdas". It is not a surprise that they kept the name, because the hypocracy of the production demanded it, for it would be literally nothing without it.

To use the Baul quip in a different way:  "It's like hanging ornaments on a dead man,"  (not Devdas the character, Bhansali's movie.)

I bought about 50 Indian movies this last year and this "Devdas" by Sanjay Leela Bhansali is the worst movie of the bunch, rivaled only by Bhansali's "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam". The two movies have some things in common, the "Devdas" being a greatly expanded version of the same shallow preoccupation with set, scene and crane shots, used in "Hum Dil.." not to mention a sacrine sensibility for color.

Both these movies had great actors, but Bhansali made characteristically little use of the.
