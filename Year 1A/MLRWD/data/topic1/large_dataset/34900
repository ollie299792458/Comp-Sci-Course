My son was two and a half when we first watched this movie with him on Thanksgiving. After that night, we watched it at least twenty more times until Christmas. My son was mesmermized, as his father and I were every time. We also were teary eyed just about every time at the touching messages about believing, friendship, caring for those in need and the simple gift of the magic of the holidays. We shared the movie with family and friends and they all loved it too. My son's favorite part was when the song, "Hot Chocolate" played so we had to buy the music CD, which he danced and sang to all holiday season and best of all it made him want to read the book the movie was based on every night, all of December. Finally, Matthew (who's name means gift) keeps saying to us even now, "Mommy...Peter never, never, heard the sound...the bell...until he believed".  Okay, so you are rolling your eyes and thinking this is too corny now, but just like the movie says, "the important thing to know about trains is that you have to get on".
