I dragged two friends to see Footloose with Kevin Bacon when it premiered in Seattle.  They didn't care very much for the film.  I, on the other hand, loved it.  I had never heard of Kevin Bacon, but I became and instant fan.  I have watched everything he has done, right down to the episodes of The Closer that he directed.

I own 6 DVDs of Hamlet.  Should I say that since Laurence Olivier filmed Hamlet there is now no room for anyone else to do so?  Are David Tennant, Derek Jacobi and Christopher Plummer to be seen as "upstart crows" who have nothing new to add?  I mean, Olivier!  How do you top that?  Or could we see Tennant and Jacobi and Plummer as actors with a different interpretation?

And, could we not look at the remake of Footloose as a different interpretation rather than seeing it as a replacement?  I loved Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer.  But, I was a Kenny Warmold fan from the moment I saw him in Center Stage: Step It Up.  As Ren MacCormack he shines, for me, as innocence and determination combined.  And Julianne Hough -- what a revelation !!  I mean, we knew she could dance.  But, as an actress, she blew me away !!!  And what a find in Miles Teller.  He was hip, cool, and funny all at the same time.

I don't see this rendition of Footloose as a would-be replacement of the original.  I see it as a new interpretation of a story that will never grow old.  And, as such, I welcome it, I embrace it, and I commend it.

Two great versions of the same story!!  Who could ask for anything more?
