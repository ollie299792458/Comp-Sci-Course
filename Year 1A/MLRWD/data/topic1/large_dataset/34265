Even though the Terminator had better special effects, I still remember getting the [...] scared out of me from Yul Brynner's menacing walk as a small child. He just wouldn't stop! And, sure enough, that was no coincidence that the terminator mirrored Westworld. The same director did both movies, Michael Crichton. Well, son-of-a-gun! The stuff I don't know as a child sure creates a big impact. Even though I love to watch all the extras that are on movies nowadays, it's very fortunate I didn't have access to all this new technology back then. It would've spoiled the thrill when I was little; I'm only speaking about myself, of course. What a great movie!

I made an error stating Michael Crichton directed the Terminator. A reviewer mentioned that James Cameron directed The Terminator. I looked up IMDB and found out that Michael Crichton wrote the screenplay for Jurassic Park (1993). Now it makes sense. Both are future thrill parks, and something terribly wrong happens involving terror to the guests. Yul Brynner is still the original Terminator in my mind. Have fun watching the movies!
