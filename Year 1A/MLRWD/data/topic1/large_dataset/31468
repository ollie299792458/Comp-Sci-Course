This is my first Baby Einstein DVD which I bought based purely on the reviews it received.  I have to say that this is a superior DVD.  I especially like the function at the beginning of the menu where you can select the option to play the DVD once or have it repeat automatically after it's finished.  The other nice feature is the Concert Hall where you can listen to the soundtrack of the DVD.  The Brainy Baby DVD I own only plays one song, but this has 19 tracks that play for over 33 minutes!  So when your baby is tired of watching the DVD, your baby can listen to classical music instead.  It's like getting a DVD and music CD all in one.  Again, you can choose to have the music repeat itself automatically.  The quality of this DVD is just as good as the Brainy Baby DVDs.  Nice, clear picture and sound.  And the blue Vincent Van Goat puppet is just too cute.  The DVD states that it is for babies one year old and up, but my two month old twins enjoy watching it (even if their attention span is very short right now).
