Unable to sleep tonight, I was flipping channels, hit the public TV station,
and ran across this guy feeding parrots in SF.

"Oh, yeah," I thought to myself, "I've heard about those parrots."  So I watched a while and
then kept watching, laughing -- about Mingus and Sophie -- and crying, about Connor, and about
Marc taking the parrots to Arizona.  I couldn't believe I could get so wrapped up in a film
about parrots although I guess I should have seen it coming, as my grandmother had a parrot
and had award-winning aviaries in south Texas!

My husband loves to feed "our" birds out in our front feeders, and we just spent last spring
watching not one but two sets of mourning dove babies get born into, grow up in, and fledge
from a Marie Callendar's pie tin on a baker's rack on our back patio. The last pair, 'the girls,'
whom we called Faith and Hope, even stuck around for a while.

I am buying this DVD to watch, and to share with my husband, who I know will love this film as much as I did.

You made me fall in love with those parrots, and I think I may have seen them, or some of their
close relatives, flying around here in Fremont a while back.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful story with us!
