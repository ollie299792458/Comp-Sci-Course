I love the way this movie was shot.  Beautiful cinematography, soothing music.  It's easy to see the passion and dedication of Jiro and the entire team.

The English translation, though, is absolutely shameful.  11 minutes into the film, critic Yamamoto is talking about how nothing has changed with Jiro compared to years ago.  He says "30 years ago" but the English subtitles show "40 years ago".  My Japanese isn't perfect but there have been many places where the translator took liberties.

The translation for the fish nomenclature is also laughable.  "&#20013;&#12488;&#12525;" or "Chu-toro" is translated as "medium tuna" while "&#22823;&#12488;&#12525;" or "o-toro" is translated as "fatty tuna".  Well, they are both fatty tuna, just different levels of fattiness...  "&#36554;&#12456;&#12499;" or "kuruma-ebi" is translated as "wheel shrimp" but it's more commonly known as Japanese tiger prawn.  "&#24179;&#30446;" or "hirame" is translated as "halibut", even though the fish is a left-eyed flounder while halibuts are right-eyed...  The translator simply doesn't know his/her seafood!  This is completely disrespectful in a film focused on telling the story of the subject being a perfectionist.

SIGH...
