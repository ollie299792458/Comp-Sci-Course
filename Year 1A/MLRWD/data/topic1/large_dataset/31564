I just saw this last night and was almost immediately extremely emotionally expressive throughout the whole film.  The juxtaposition between the rich and the poor and then the fall of society into communism is absolutely heart wrenching.  But Omar Sharif's portrayal of Dr. Zhivago is all about hope during this depressing time and his bright attitude toward life is felt throughout by the viewer as well as many of the characters, but the despair is always there.  Shadows of fear, violence, betrayal, and hatred lurk all around him and Lara, played by Julie Cristie. But Dr. Zhivago is driven by hope and tireless perseverance to build a better life for his family.  Their love for one another keeps them strong and keeps them going.

I must warn you that this movie is not for the faint of heart.  My husband, who had seen it a few times before, was emotional because of my sorrow filled emotion.  Yes, it took a monumental toll on me as a viewer and I continued to be affected by it hours after watching the film.  But make no mistake:  THIS MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING.  It is a long film (3 hours, 20 minutes), but it is at the pinnacle of genius.  Its star-studded cast performs brilliantly and in a  believably disturbing way that pulls the viewer in and holds him for the length of this epic film.

This is such a powerful movie that I should think that everyone must be able to watch it before they go off into that goodnight of existence.  In fact, I encourage it.  This film will have such a powerful effect on the viewer for the rest of his life, it is so powerful.
