Understand that I am a fan of David Byrne's music. Talking Heads has long been one of my favorite bands. I also count Stop Making Sense among the top concert documentaries of all time. True Stories, though, is just really, really crummy.
Sometime during the 80's Byrne apparently concluded that he was a Renaissance man who could take on any creative medium. Though he was a kickass bandleader and entertainer, this film shows that he was clearly not a screenwriter, director, or actor.
The ideas behind the film had potential, but the actual product is weak, dull, contrived, and amateurish - basically a student film. A few earnest performances by real actors (primarily John Goodman) only serve to emphasize how bad the other elements are. At 89 minutes it's about 84 minutes too long. It contains one fun mini-video of Wild Wild Life, one clever line spoken by Byrne's character, and one good joke about Texas. That's it.
Buy this video only on the assumption that you'll watch it once and then give it away (to someone you don't like very much).
