If Stanley Kubrick had made propaganda films, "Triumph of the Will" would have been the result. Technically brilliant, visually stunning, this film documents a Nazi rally with all of the tools, tricks,  and art that film is capable of. If anyone had told me that I would ever  sit through a film about a Nazi rally and be entranced, I would have told  them that they were nuts. Like another film with a morally repugnant  message, Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing", the director here is  so talented that the film mesmerizes even as all moral reservations and  judgments are swept aside by a tidal wave of filmmaking brilliance. The  speeches can bog the film down (although I found the closeups of these  monsters of the reich speaking to be fascinating) but you can always  patiently wait until the next amazing visual. Despite Reifenstahl's  lifelong, failed attempt to distance herself from the Nazi's, it is clear  that this is a love letter to them (and perhaps even to Hitler as there was  always those rumours, weren't there, Leni?...). This is a history lesson, a  cinematic tour de force, a warning about the deceptive powers of film, and  one of the most important films ever made by the only woman filmmaker who  can be put in the pantheon of great filmmakers without any apology. How  interesting that the greatest woman filmmaker should have politics so  disgusting. A bomb thrown in the playground of simpleminded feminists who  usually assume a greater natural benevolence and humanity in women simply  because of their sex.
