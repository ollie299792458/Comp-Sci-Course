Robocop 2 put simply is my favorite sequel ever(only tieing with terminator 2). This movie is absolutley fantastic, the score is memorable, the action is well crafted and entertaining, and the story is full of interesting twists! God, when I was small I remember watching this movie hundreds of times and for good reason! Its simply a wonderful movie, the first robocop is also a favorite of mine but my view on this film is that it's more of a "fun" story than the depressing tale of the first movie. Sequels generally follow a pattern that was established by aliens, and so does this film. Make the first and orgin story and introduce robo, and in the second have fun with the charecter! I also really love how this movie looks, its blended together with lots of rich colors and intresting set pieces(dead elvis corpses too!), not to mention it has one if not the best robot villan ever Cain, and to top it off robo's suit looks far better in this movie than the first! Theres alot and I mean alot to like about this movie, but I can understand why some critics hated it, theres a kid that dies, over the top violence, tons of gore, kids cursing and to top it off its a sequel and most people automatically hate sequels. But in my opinion none of this hinders the film for me, I don't see how it makes it a bad film. Simply put if you are hesistant about seeing this movie dont be unless you dont enjoy fun, exhilarating, well-directed, creative sci-fi movies(with tons of gore and violence)...but in the end who doesn't!
