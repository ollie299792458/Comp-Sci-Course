I had watched this show while on network tv, loved it, wanted my child to be introduced to a clean show with lots of history!!  I hadn't seen the 1st-3rd series, I was amazed at how much history was included & how the writer paid such close attention to period times and details. Of course, the relationship between Dr. Quinn & Sully is so pure & sweet, yet sexy & appealing without being vulgar; you find yourself cheering when they finally kiss! This show has something for all generations, children enjoy seeing how school, chores, discipline & daily life happened years ago. Dr. Quinn inspired my daughter by showing how women can do just about anything, with help and support of a good family and friends & emphasis on education. We loved this show and I would suggest it to anyone, especially if you have respect for history & lifestyles of the past!  The clothing & town setting, meadows & mountains & all the beautiful scenery, the Native Americans, African Americans, the immigrants, all make a beautiful show, I only wish this show could have continued, networks wanted trash on tv instead of good clean viewing for children. One sad reality this show reveals, is what happens to people when Greed & fortune come their way, it definitely shows how people change & what happens to a whole town & people in it, when progress comes along. We have progressed ourselves into a nation full of debt, greed & fortune seekers, we all need more God in our lives and this show has a great way of showing how important religion was  then & still is today. Thank you to Beth Sullivan for a Great Show, when are you going to make another one? Please include Joe Lando & Jane Seymour
