THERE IS SO MUCH I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE, BUT I TELL YOU THIS, WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE IT WAS BACK IN 1990. A VERY LOW PERIOD IN MY LIFE AND I REMEMBER HOW IT MADE ME FEEL. IT BROUGHT BACK A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE AND PROMISE MY SELF I WOULD WATCH THIS FILM EVERY XMAS WITH MY FAMILY.

AND I HAVE DONE SO, FOR THE LAST 15 YRS I TAKE OUT THIS FILM, PREPARE THE FAMILY AND WE SIT FOR 2 HRS AND HAVE A GOOD LAUGH. ONLY ONCE A YR I WATCH THIS MOVIE AND EVEN THOUGH FOR THE LAST 15 YRS I HAVE WATCH IT 15 TIMES I DONT CARE I WANT TO SEE IT 15 MORE...
