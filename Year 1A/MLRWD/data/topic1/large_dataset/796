This is the first movie in a long time that I have watched and rewatched.  Merryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child is fabulous, and  Stanley Tucci's of Paul Child is a perfect foil and catalyst for her.  Apparently Streep insisted to the director that Tucci be her "Paul" and she was right -- his expressions, his demeanor, is just classic -- watch his expressions when Julia talks about taking "hat lessons", or when Julia is sobbingly chopping huge piles of onions  - and spare a laugh for Julia's knife brandishing in the same scene.  The two together developed a magical chemistry that leaps out of the film and brings their characters to life.  I also loved the actors who played Louisette and Simone - her fellow gourmands. In summary, I can't think of another recent movie I have had so much fun watching.  I wish they would do a sequel remake of "her life in France" with these two. Their part of the movie was just too short for such a talent showcase.

However, the above is really only half the movie.  The "Julie" part of Julie and Julia is fine for a first watch, but I confess, I fast forward through it on the rewatches.  Julie's constant whining and her treatment of her husband is contrary to the Julia part of the movie, and is not so enjoyable to watch. I am grateful that her blog and book caused the Julia part of this movie to be made.  But on itself, the Julie part is .... just average.

I'll give another rave to the soundtrack.  Loved the Julia theme, and "Bushel and a Peck" and "Time after Time".

The blu ray extras were good, if a bit pricey.

This one is worth a buy, even if you only watch half the movie with Julia and Paul.
