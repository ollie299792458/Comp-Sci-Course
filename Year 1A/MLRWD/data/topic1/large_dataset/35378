i remember back in the day,this movie was baned in several countries & even in the states. For a while when we finally rented it the lable said banned/I think it had something to do w/insulting the catholic church & i can see why.A preist,maggots, siances a head being drilled not so nice.
It had some serious WOW FACTOR in its day.The film maker FULCI starred in the film in a small cameo.
When we saw it/The name of the movie was called THE GATES OF HELL\Thats the one that said it was banned & it was finally released after much editing.For in its day there was nothing out like this at all.Which only made ppl want to see it that much more.A cult classic for sure.
How the name got changed i do not know,I do know that it had 9 minutes of cut material that would not make the grade,cuz it was hardcore.So taking that bit out got it released & once popularity of curious horror fans found out about this wild film.
It only gained momentum & its notarity & to watch it today all i can do is admire FULCI's work as he made many ole films.
It has some vulgar parts in it~That in todays time of horror flicks this one would come off cheesey,I still enjoy it, But us that saw it back in the day~This was a different take upon anything that was debuting at the time.
Id say by now its a cult classic im so happy to of finally gotten a copy to go w/my collection.
If you have not seen it & want to see some pretty good ole school graphics & the story line makes sense.This is an old film that was ahead of its time as was said about fulci~BRILLIANT in his craft
