Image Entertainment has unleashed on DVD the most satanic valentine to gothic cinema ever conceived-and at least in this writer's opinion, the greatest horror film ever made. BLACK SUNDAY is not merely equal to the best of Murnau, Whale, Freund and the classic Universal Pictures tradition, but surpasses all with M.C. Escheresque visuals informed with the dark poetry of stylish sadism. Barbara Steele imbues her portrayal of the vampire/witch with a demonic majesty never before brought to the screen. Indeed, her skeletal facial features, a landscape of puncture wounds bearing forth wild, burning eyes and thick, cruel lips (promising the joys of eternal Hades) is itself the very ensign of Italian fantascienza of the Sixties.
The plot will not be retold here (but is in my full summary in Films in Review online).
Aside from the drop-dead gorgeous visual presentation, the audio commentary by Tim Lucas is definitive. We ardent lovers of Bava wait in sheer anticipation of his book on the subject (due in 2001).
Most noteworthy missed opportunities in this stellar effort is Barbara Steele's participation in the analog track. The presentation of the film in its beautiful Italian (which runs longer as there are scenes deleted from ALL USA &amp; European versions should have ben included. Indeed, the American-International print with the much maligned (and unfairly so) Les Baxter score should have been included. However, this effort is a 5-star, full thrust knockout and belongs in every serious horror film buff's collection.
