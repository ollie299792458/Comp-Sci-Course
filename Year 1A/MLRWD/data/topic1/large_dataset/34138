But where's the demension to the characters. When I first saw this film I felt sick to my stomach, I mean I was feeling terrible. But in the end of the film, I felt thrilled, then I realized that Tarantino was bringing the darkside in my personality. The scene when Micheal Madsen's character is cutting the policemen's ear off, I was laughing. That's when I notice what Quentin was doing with this film. He's trying to make you laugh, but he's also trying to make you think on what your laughing at. And when you think that cutting of the ear scene is over, Quentin just blows your mind away at the end of this movie. But this is not his best work. I remember alot of great directing shots, but there's nothing to really look into. I can study "Pulp Fiction" all day, the case that has the number 666, the devils number. The way the camera moves up to show Bruce Willis's face when he stabs one of the rapist's. The dialogue, the redemption of Samuel L. Jackson's character. That's what I mean, there's nothing to really think about at the end of "Reservoir Dogs." But this is an entertaining film, and I recommend it to Quentin Tarantino fans.
