First I have to say that Nicole Kidman does a very good American accent.  The Stepford Wives is an histarical assemble cast including Nicole Kidman, Matthew Brodrick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Jon Lovitz, & Glenn Close.  Great cameos throughout the film.  At the least its a well acted original movie based on the 1975 film of the same name(which I have not seen).
The movie centers around Kidman's character who basically has a nervous collapse when she loses her high profile tv producer job.  Her & her husband (played by Matthew Broderic), move to Stepford to start a new life.  The audience catches on pretty quickly when we first arrive at Stepford, both because its so obvious, & the previews tell a lot.  It turns out Stepford is nothing more than a bunch of husbands who couldn't take there successful, career woman wifes, so they commute in a little town where a mad scientist, (played by Christopher Walkin), turns woman basically into robots that will do whatever there men want.  
Knockout performances by Kidman, & Bette Midler, who delivers the single funniest line in the film.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  Got one star knocked off because i think this movie had another telling of the story that could have possibly been better.  More like suspense, than it should of been slapstick comedy.  Still its a delightful, entertaing film that I reccomend to everybody.
