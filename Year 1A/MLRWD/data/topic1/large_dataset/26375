What can I say?  All of the stars in the cosmos can't rate this film...beats anything British I've ever seen.  I guess when I first started reading these reviews, I thought I had the cut version, but then someone talked about the thumbs I knew I had the full one (thank the good Lord in Heaven above!).  
Anyway, unlike most of the Americans in the reviews I've read, I can't laugh while I'm watching it because I'm utterly captivated by the use of the English language in the acting and the slang that is used (brilliant is right).  I fear that I might miss something if I start to laugh (ok, I laughed at the cat).  Monty Python are schoolboys compared to this.  I can just watch it over and over, like it's a captivating, exotic woman.  You can't stop listening, nor can you look away.  You never get tired of it.  There's always something slightly different to see and new meanings to discern.  Anyone who knows "Withnail and I" knows what I'm talking about.  What's more, there's nothing silly about it.  Why give it away?  Watch it!
