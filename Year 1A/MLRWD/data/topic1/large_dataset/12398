Peyton Place <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O4KBNC">Peyton Place: Part One</a> is one of the true classics of television. This series was never released on VHS and I have waited many years for the release; I was not disappointed. With an exceptional cast and storyline, this series offers viewers all aspects of small town life. The rich, middle class, poor, the arrogant and meek, the powerful and the weak, the truth and lies, the open and the secret, and the effect each life has on another. I was not born when this series began in 1964 and came across it may years ago when it was shown on Romance Classics but only saw a few episodes before the station went off the air. The subject matter is still relevant today (although not as strongly) and is presented without audio and visual distaste. I don't believe there has ever been a series that can come close to this one. Give it a try if you've never seen it-I don't think you'll be disappointed.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XW7ID6">Peyton Place: Part Two</a>
