I don't have much to add to what the other reviews have specified about the new BD version of RHPS, but I have to say the new 7.1 DTS HD audio track blows all of the other previous home video versions out of the water.  It always bugged me that the stereo mixes on the older versions dating back to VHS and laserdisc merely used the original soundtrack album recording dubbed over the movie soundtrack.  This was most notable during the "Time Warp" when Magenta would sing.  The vocals in the movie are completely different from the vocals on the album.  The movie has more of a "sung live" sound while the album is definitely a studio recording.  I'm so happy to be able to hear Patricia Quinn's vocals from the movie now on Blu-ray!  Also, the picture is so sharp that I saw numbers written on Tim Curry's thigh that I never noticed before and I've seen the movie well over 100 times.  My only concern is an odd little "beep" that happens during the "Time Warp" when the party-goers "bring their knees in tight."  It's a very strange little sound that happens every time the knees come together.  I don't know if this is something only on the 7.1 track as I haven't listened to the other versions yet, but it was odd and I hope not a problem with the audio since it is superior to any other version to date.  The disk also includes the US and UK versions as well as the option to see the first part of the movie as it was originally intended - in black and white!  That was a hidden easter egg on the last DVD version, but it's much easier to access now.  Excellent job on this one and kudos to the team at Fox for putting together such an exceptional presentation of an exceptional movie!
