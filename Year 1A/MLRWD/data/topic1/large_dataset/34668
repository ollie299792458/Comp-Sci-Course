I just discovered Supernatural this spring via reruns. Once I saw a couple of episodes, I was hooked. In spite of the fact that the writing is uneven (though getting better), the acting can be a bit over the top - or stiff - and they jump the shark more times than Fonzie on crack, I am still hooked on this show. I really do want to know what happens next. Does Sam keep on kicking @ss and taking names? Does Dean ever find true love and white picket fence happiness? Could both brothers please spend more time with their shirts off? Ahem... anyhow, I really enjoy the Crowley character -- wicked fun, the Devil we hate to love -- and Death is a very cool character too, just how I'd picture him, very gaunt and with his own blues soundtrack. Cass as God I'm not sure I buy; looks like he's being set up to Fall and become the next Lucifer. Hopefully the brothers get their respective acts together and save him from himself. The writers need to stop focusing on all the angst-ridden emotional bromance garbage they've been beating to death for the last two seasons or so. The boys need to get back to the real work of saving the world from behind the wheel of a classic car. Can't wait to see what they do with the coming season. Meantime, I'm gonna sit back and enjoy all the behind-the-scenes goodies that come with this DVD.
