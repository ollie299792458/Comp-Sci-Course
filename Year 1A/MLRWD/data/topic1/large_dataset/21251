"The Weather Man" is too long, too gray, too depressing for words.  Almost all the "action" takes place during a forbiddingly frigid Chicago winter.  There are endless shots of snow and slush and an icy Lake Michigan.  By the end credits I'd lost feeling in most of my extremities.  Nic Cage's character was impossible to sympathize with, and therefore, hard to care about.  All his problems were of his own making, and one couldn't help but wonder how he and Noreen had stayed together long enough to produce their two children.  And, for cryin' out loud, how many divorced couples attend "trust" seminars?  Michael Caine is excellent as the over-achieving father figure that the weather man tries to live up to.  Hope Davis is appealing as the exasperated ex who puts up with this whiner for the sake of the kids.  Gil Bellows has a cameo as the counselor who takes pictures of shirtless young boys.  I bet he's glad he ditched that whole Ally McBeal thing for roles like this.  My biggest gripe would have to be the way this movie was presented in the trailer.  It looked almost like a slapstick comedy.  Believe me, it's anything but!  And, after seeing the first weekend grosses for the film, I think it's easy to say the forecast for "The Weather Man" is bleak.
