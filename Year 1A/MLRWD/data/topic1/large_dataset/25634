I was VERY excited yesterday when I finally left work to go home and watch my Stargate SG-1 season 8 DVDs... I was disappointed... not by the show, don't get the wrong, the show is INCREDIBLE, I absolutely love it! but, the DVD set was not.  It does not include but a few of the behind the scenes (which, if you have any of the other seasons are always very fun to watch!), and probably the worst part was that one of my all time favorite episodes, "THREADS", was cut. The original version was a 90 minute show and I cannot believe they included the shorter version on the DVD!!!! I was really looking forward to having the complete episode for my collection, how upsetting.  I don't understand why they include more features in the Asian and Europen versions... The US releases should be just as good, not incomplete.

If you haven't watched the show, I do recomend you start by watching it from the beginning; the story lines are complex and smart, and the characters have evolved and developed very much throughout the years.  To me, this was the last season of the show; It was Richard Dean Anderson's (Jack O'Neill) last year, and he has always done a more than amazing job, he brings an energy to the show that you can see is missing on the new season, it's just not the same without him.  Him, along with Amanda Tapping (Sam Carter), Michael Shanks (Daniel jackson) and Christopher Judge (Teal'c) have a wonderful chemestry, and their characters are very strong, unique and complex, which adds up to the greatness of the show.  I am not a big science fiction fan, and yet, I adore Stargate sg-1.  It's an intelligent show, with outstanding production, acting and stories, that focus not only on fiction and fantasy, but on social, political and human issues. If you like stargate, you will enjoy the DVDs, but, I have to say again, the collection was not was I expected, nothing to do with the show, though, it is an OUTSTANDING SHOW above all!!
