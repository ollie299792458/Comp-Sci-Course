Amistad is a very moving and thought provoking movie.  It gives us a look at a part of our past which we should all learn more about.
The story focuses on the struggle of illegally captured Africans to re-gain their freedom and return to their native Africa.  The Africans are captured, transported to Cuba and then transferred to another ship, La Amistad, for the final leg of their journey.  However, there is a mutany and the Africans seize control of the ship.  All but two of the white crew members are killed during the mutany.  When the ship nears land, Long Island, to replenish deminished water supplies, they are captured and face trial for murder.  
The drama that unfolds is fastening and disturbing.  The struggle over freedom is based in determining if the Africans are actually illegally seized Africans or if they are slaves, that is if they were born into slavery, and therefore property.
  The ensuing legal battle gives the viewer a look into the many conflicting forces that were at play in the United States during the 1830s.  It is also a sobering look at how the politically powerful tried to manipulate the legal system to get their desired ends.
Cast is very strong and gives a very moving performance.
