My parents introduced this movie to me when I was young, and it's been near and dear to my heart ever since.  Gene Kelly delivers the same stunning choreography that we all know and love.  It fits seamlessly into beautifully written songs that are guaranteed to make you smile.

For people who are familiar with movies from this era, Brigadoon really has an all-star cast!  Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, Cyd Charisse... those were some big names back then!  When you watch the movie, you won't be surprised why.  Everyone in this movie excels at acting, singing, and dancing.  The performances are solid across the board.

Ultimately, Brigadoon is a Scottish fairy tale.  It's a magical town that appears for a day once every two hundred years.  The one day it appears, two men stumble across it while lost on a hunting trip in the highlands of Scotland... and one man stumbles into the heart of a local woman.  The two fall in love, and he has to decide whether to stay in Brigadoon with her forever or whether to return to New York to his life and fiance.

Wonderful movie, family friendly, and a classic that you will watch over and over again.
