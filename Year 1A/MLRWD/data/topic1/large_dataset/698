"Go douche old man."  Nice.  And that was one of the lines I COULD repeat here.  Very sophomoric.  Although I don't like recommending brain rot for older kids, this is one that's gotta be aimed at them, the 15 year old to 17 year old mentality.  I wasn't aware this was going to be a parody of a monster movie otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.  It's stupid, ageist and sexist...the kind of things that teenager-types seem to love...just sayin.

***SPOILER WARNING!!!***

The monsters, on the other hand, were excellent!  That's why I'm mad, because the creatures were awesome and could've been used with a good, serious, intelligent script -- but instead, they made it  just too dumb.  I'm not going to say there weren't any funny bits, there were.  And someone said they didn't say where the creatures came from or why they were there.  Not true.  The creatures came to the tavern because someone had run over one of their own.  So, they came for revenge....2 stars for the creatures and nothing else.
