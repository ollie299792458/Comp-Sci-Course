the relationship between the four main characters of the film seemed to fill me with a soft sense of sophisticated solace that just seemed to grip at my heart holding it and letting it bleed into me the beauty of each  characters pain  their relationship is but a complex yet beautiful  depiction of the human experience trying to resolve a certain degree of  psychological and emotional pain within their lives through the use of  others as a means of therapy a therapy that is indirect and complex but yet  consoling reavealing a mystery within their relationship that kept me  intrigued throughout the film a bizarre yet wonderful atmosphere seems to  permeate throughout the film an atmosphere filled with soft mellowed colors  and textures that just seemed to fit the complex psychological mystery of  the characters relationship with one another i truly loved this film the  last 12-15 mins. of the film were truly exemplary i could feel these  characters within me the characters indirect manner of gaining contact with  one another directly touched upon me my heart just seemed to bleed for this  movie the film just reminds me of the beautiful complexities that seem to  run through the human experience
