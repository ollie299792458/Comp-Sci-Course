Forget the original Toxie, Class of Nuke em High, Tromeo and Juliet, and even Terror Firmer: Citizen Toxie is the definitive Troma movie! The characters are excellent, the script is genious, the directing is inspired, and the acting is just campy enough. There is no plot to get in the way of the over the top gore, tomatoes, and "Special" people. Let's get to the characters, shall we? Of course there's Toxie. No intro needed. Noxie is the Noxious Avenger, Toxie's doppleganger from Amortville. Lard-butt is toxie's "morbidly obese sidekick." Sarah is the ever name changing blind wife of toxie. OH, in Amortville she's deaf not blind. Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD quite possibly steals the show as a drunk loser of a vigilante. Well, almost steals the show. Tito steals the show, a special crack head who is undergoing a major case of teen angst. As Tito says in the film when discovered getting high, "Being a teenager sucks. Being a retarder teenager sucks more. Drugs make it suck less" Toxie: "wow, you're quite articullate for a special druggie." Tito: "what's atriclate?" LOL!!! This is what the script is like the whole time, but better and even more obscene. The DVD extras are incredible, 3 comentaries, a feature length making of docu called "Apocalypse Soon,"(don't miss the segment with the stunts coordinator complaining about his 3 FEET JUMP.) deleted scenes to the documentary, deleted scenes, bonus footage, trailers, like, 4 premiers, not-so-hidden hidden easter eggs, and more. Buy this DVD, turn off your brain, like, totally, and have some friends over: it'll be fun.
