Boris Kodjoe and newcomer Tamyra Gray were the lead characters along with long lost Aloma Wright who plays Ms Ernestine.  Ms Ernestine is like the Pastor's right hand woman.  She is like the female leader of the church without giving her a title.  Clifton Powell was the co-founding pastor of a church which helped recruit 2 young sons to become ministers of the Word. One, Boris Kodjoe - David Tyler went on to become a secular singer after his mother's passing and his father's abandonment emotionally.(David is the Pastors son) The other, Charles Frank who stayed in the church became a full- fledged minister and eventually through Pastor Tyler's death takes over the church.

The problem is NEVER in this movie do the people PRAY!!!! The Gospel should be about Prayer.  Now later on in the movie which is the most touching part, Charles Frank seems like he has lost his soul.  He goes to God and asks for his forgiveness and on Sunday preaches about the mistakes he has made and those who have made mistakes.  The movie ends with Minister Hunter becoming the Assistant Pastor he should have been all along and Brother David Tyler coming back Home to help find the church the was once ALMOST lost.  Not bad and the songs were GREAT!!!

For One who is religious you will definitely enjoy the singing of Yolanda Adams, Donnie McClurkin and Fred Hammond and the new Tamyra Gray. Im glad Ms Gray has had a chance to showcase her talents.  Fot those who dont remember who she is. She was once on American Idol opposite Fantasia Barrino- Free Yourself.

I'd suggest some go out and buy it;  others go out and borrow it.
