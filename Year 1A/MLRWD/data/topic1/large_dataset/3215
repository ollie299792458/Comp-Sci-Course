This film is about a suddenly divorced woman who ends up touring Italy with a group of gay men. The build up to this amusing tour is very creative, also the many antics on the tour bus were funny, due to the ironical fact that a single divorced female was on tour with a group of men - all of whom were gay. It is an amusing, down-right funny film in many ways. It is also an inexpensive way to see the landscapes of Tuscany.

Starting a new life in Italy, on a whim, a spur of the moment, the need to escape, escape to another country, escape anywhere, is a fantasy, many people may have, especially if the people are divorced. The adventures of living in another country along with recovering one's sense of balance in life is the well developed topic of this film.

The tour bus stops in a town and our heroine sees an old home for sale in the picture window of a real estate office. It happens the tour passes by this very same home  and to the surprise of all, our protaganist asks the bus driver to stop. She enters the house and discovers a young European couple negotiating on the selling price with the owner, who is a widow, and her solicitor. Everytime the European couple offers a bid, the widow raises the price of the house. When our divorcee makes an offer ... the widow accepts it. The Europeann couple stalk off, complaining about how the rich Americans want to own everything.

Our divorcee admits to the widow, she can not afford the price she agreed to. The widow shakes her head, sadly, "no". The widow states through an interpreter, the solicitor, that she must have a sign from G-d before she can sell the house, right after that, a bird flies in and leaves a parting gift on our divorcee's head. The widow is happy and smiles ... that is the sign. It only gets better from there ... This is hugely funny film, reminds me of the movies made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
