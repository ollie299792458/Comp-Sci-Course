Although seasons 1 and 2 were very good, season 3 felt rushed and incomplete. The story lines were disjointed and made no sense. Where did Jessie all of a sudden appear from, why couldnt they just do flash backs or something to explain how Jessie and Isabel met, and why did they have to get married so fast. It is well known that the actors wanted the series to end and along with the competition from Smallsville maybe it was time but the writers could have done a better job.

The finale sucked, basically the aliens forget thier real mothers plea to come back and save thier planet. No instead they choose to forget who they are and bum around earth playing superheroes. I think thier plan was to travel around in a beat up van and help ppl that needed helping....stupid. What about in season two when Max from the future comes back and tells Liz about the war?  is that just obsolete now.Also what happens to Michael and Maria do they ever really get together? and why did they have to leave Jessie behind? no the finale felt incomplete and rushed just like the entire 3rd season did. Its too bad that such a very good show couldnt have ended with a bang instead of a thud.
