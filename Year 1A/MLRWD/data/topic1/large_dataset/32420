"The Birds" is a movie that seems to have really stood the test of time. Even though this film has no background music at all it is a definitive masterpiece from the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.

Blonde beauty 'Tippi' Hedren makes her movie debut playing the sassy Melanie Daniels. The movie begins with Melanie shopping at a pet store in San Francisco. Right as she enters the store Alfred Hitchcock has a brief cameo walking out of the store with his dogs. Melanie is later abruptly attacked by a sea gull after she has driven to Bodega Bay. The dialogue between Melanie and a lawyer, Mitch Brenner (played by Rod Taylor), his younger sister Catherine (Veronica Cartwright) and Jessica Tandy (who is Mitch and Catherine's mother in the film) was well written and occasionally humorous.

A relationship slowly develops between Melanie and Mitch, but is interrupted by a bird attack at Catherine's birthday party. The attacks escalate as the birds inexplicably wreak havoc. Melanie is badly wounded from a violent attack near the end of the film, as it slowly leads up to an unforgettable closing scene.

In summary, this is an excellent movie. Even the special effects are good, considering this was made long before digital technology/CGI was possible. Highly recommended!
