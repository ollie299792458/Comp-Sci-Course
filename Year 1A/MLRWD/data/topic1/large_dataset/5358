I saw Philadelphia for the 1st time two nights ago. Even though I enjoyed the movie (Hanks performance was excellent, the courtroom scenes were not too boring, and Antonio Banderas is always hot!)I have a question for reviewers who keep criticizing the film for the support that Beckett's (Tom Hanks) family shows. Why is that deemed unrealistic/too Hollywood? In my opinion that was one of the most beautiful aspects of the film. Believe it or not there are many families who are supportive and loving to their homosexual relatives. Often it is the cliche to make the homosexual person an outcast in the family or hated by his father etc. Since I am seeing this film 12yrs after the release I am used to seeing gays in cinema/television having troubled relationships w/their families if they have one at all. Also for any family to want to turn their back on their dying son is heartless, so it was refreshing to see a gay son so unconditionally loved by his family.

  A second question is for one reviewer who felt the ending was "greasy". Why did the ending not make sense? There was a scene w/Beckett and Miguel(Antonio Banderas) where they discuss planning a memorial service. Beckett obviously wanted a memorial service/life celebration not your standard funeral. So the ending made perfect sense to me. Also I do not think Washington's character(Miller) made a complete 360 on his views on gays. But it would be unrealistic for him to have that experience of defending and working w/Beckett and not come away with something.
