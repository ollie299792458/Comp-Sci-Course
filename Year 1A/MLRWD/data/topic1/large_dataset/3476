Good Will Hunting.  Let's see.  The good first.  This is the movie that  stars of Damon and Affleck, paving the way for them to make better movies  like Dogma.  This is the movie that finally gave Robin Williams a  well-deserved Oscar.  This movie also introduced American audiences to the  beautiful and talented Minnie Driver.  Now for the bad.  This movie paved  the way for Affleck to make Armaggedon and Forces of Nature.  Williams gave  a boring performance in the movie (watch his small role in Dead Again with  Kenneth Brannagh, it's the best of his career, plus his Oscar should have  been for What Dreams May Come.)  Also, Driver appears to have dropped off  the radar after this movie.
Ok, the plot of a genius janitor at one of  the most prestigious universities in America but who doesn't truly have the  ambition is most definitely unique.  However, the movie is too long, too  boring and too profane.  I can watch almost anything without being bothered  by the mere f-word and this movie was too much even for me.  All this movie  is is Damon getting mad at people for pushing his intellect, Damon and  Affleck fighting everyone they run into, and Damon and Driver fighting  before they realize they're in love.  Boring.  If you want to be  entertained, watch As Good As It Gets which came out at the same time as  Hunting and features stellar perfromances from Helen Hunt, Jack Nicholson,  and Greg Kinnear.
