Hancock is a good movie for teens and adults as younger viewers may not be able to take in the whole scope of the movie or appreciate some of the more adult humor.

This version is unrated but I'd give it a PG-13.

There are periods of profanity and violence so if you are squeamish about watching or are squeamish about your children watching then I would not recommend this movie for you.

Other reviewers may have stated that Hancock was no Superman or Batman and that is true in the same way that Alien is no Jaws or vice versa even though they are both monster-type movies.  I don't think Hancock was trying to be Superman ... it is what it is and it should be taken as such.

If you watch Hancock and DON'T compare it to another superhero flick or pick apart every little camera angle I think you will enjoy it as it is funny and the ending is touching!

Just try it!  Don't listen to everyone else says and miss out on a movie that you may REALLY like!  If you don't want to spend the money buying it just yet then rent it or borrow it from a friend but at least give it a spin!
