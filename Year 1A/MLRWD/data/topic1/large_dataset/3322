Backlash 2003

A good event but the two main events could have been a lot better

WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS MATCH

Team angle vs. Los gurreros

A high flying match im glad that team angle got the victory because I hate Eddie gurrerro I don't care if he is now dead I hate him and im so glad I wont have to watch another match with him in

Rickishi vs. Sean o' haire with rowdy roddy piper

An ok kind of match one you would expect on Sunday night heat

WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH

Kane & Rob van dam vs. The Dudley boys with chief Morley as the guest ref

An average match for a raw card

Women's championship match

Jazz vs. Trish stratus

Boring to say the least and I hate teddy long

Rey mysterio vs. The big show

A funny match if your me and hate rey mysterio  you will love what big show does to rey mysterio absolutely hilarious

Six man tag match

Kevin nash,shawn michales,booker t vs. triple h,ric flair,chris jericho

A good match but weak in places very sloppy ending that sets the tone for judgement day and bad blood in witch triple h and Kevin nash go at it and all so for shawn michales and ric flair who face each other at bad blood take away jericho for this mtach and add batista and take away booker t for this match and add undertaker

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH

Brook lesnar vs. john cena

I didn't care who won this match as I hate both wrestlers john cena  can't rap very annoying match were you knew lesnar wasn't goin to lose to cena 4 weeks after wrestle mania we don't need wannabees like john cena is the mix of smack down or raw he is nobody talking about he grew up on the streets so what who cares and all this thuga nomics rubbish use  proper words were you don't have to use spell check let cena have his 5 mins of glory then let him be the first match on Sunday night heat

THE MAIN EVENT

THE ROCK VS GOLDBERG

The rock should have won this match the only reason there is Goldberg is because eric bishoff wanted a stone cold look a like for wcw wcw is a complete shambles the rock should have won this match the rock has beaten Hogan,triple h,undertaker,stone cold,mankind,kurt angle,the big show,booker t the best there is

And who has Goldberg beaten sting and jeff jaret lol please wwe don't let Goldberg back there are farbetter wrestlers in the wwe for example Shelton Benjamin  watching wwe  in 2003 was like I was watching wcw nitro I don't wana see the likes of booker t or Goldberg or Kevin nash or hulk Hogan or scot steiner or rey mysterio or eddie gurero his dead lol good the rock is far greater than any wcw wrestler the rock is simply the best there is in the bussiness

Overall BACKLASH 2003 I GIVE IT 3/5 FOR THE EVEN AND 4/5 FOR THE DVD WITH LOTS OF EXTRAS
