In this age of excessively violent films filled with inappropriate scenes and language, Sky High is a nice alternative.  This film will appeal to viewers for a number of reasons.  It does a good job of showing some of the anxieties and problems that are faced by typical high school students, even though these are not typical teens.  The film is just campy enough to be funny, but not to totally make fun of itself.

The highlight of the film for me (and probably for many other viewers) is the casting of Lynda Carter as Principal Powers.  She possesses the power of a comet and makes an entrance that gives a clever nod to her Wonder Woman days.  Lynda's last line near the end of the film also gives a more obvious nod to her TV role.  She plays the role with great style and "power".

The remainder of the cast is very good as well and produces a quality film that will provide great entertainment for people of all ages.  See it today.

I hear there is a possiblity of a sequel and maybe a TV series.  Let's hope so.
