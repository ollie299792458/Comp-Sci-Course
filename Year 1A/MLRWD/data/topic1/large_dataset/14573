He has the power to hear everything women are saying. Finally?a man is listening." Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt star in this romantic comedy about a male chauvinist pig (Gibson as Nick Marshall) given the opportunity to read women's minds. Hunt is Darcy Maguire, an advertising executive with a rotten reputation who gets hired as the new Creative Director - a position Nick was already uncorking the champagne to celebrate landing. Nick is as politically incorrect as they come. He insults women, tells offensive chauvinistic jokes, and generally goes out of his way to offend the opposite sex. Passed over for a promotion and determined to undermine his new female boss's efforts, Nick schemes to outshine and outwit (that sounds a bit ?Survivor?-ish) Darcy, hoping to send her back into the ranks of the unemployed. Mel Gibson's take on Nick as both a throwback to men of the 1940's, and as the enlightened man of the current millennium, is right on target. He plays both angles of Nick's personality with good humor and style. Gibson carries the film with Hunt and the rest of the cast seeming to enjoy being along for the ride. Not that Hunt, Mark Feuerstein (as sidekick and co-worker, Morgan), and Alan Alda as the head honcho of the advertising firm, aren't competent in their roles; it's more that their roles seem to be overshadowed by Mel's presence. The only co-star who seems to rival Mel's presence is Marisa Tomei. Tomei portrays a coffee shop clerk, and constant object of Mel's attention. Tomei brings a bubbly, effervescent life to her character and the chemistry between she and Mel is enjoyable to witness. Overall, What Women Want is a bit predictable, a bit corny, but worthwhile viewing - especially if you're a Mel Gibson fan.But all in all its a fun affair.Must get it!
