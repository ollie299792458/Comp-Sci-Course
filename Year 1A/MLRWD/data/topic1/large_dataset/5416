George Michael's "Live In London" embodies everything that's great about this man and his music.  The song selection is fantastic, as it covers all phases of George's career, from the Wham stuff to his latest solo works.  George's voice sounds just as it did 20 years ago and in my opinion it's even better on this concert.  Smooth as silk.  He makes it seem so effortless, even when he's doing his dance moves on the faster songs.  The man moves so well it's hard to believe he has steel rods in his back.

The visuals are very captivating, from elaborate lasers and bizarre images to more subtle backdrops for the ballads.  There are also many different camera angles so there is never a dull moment for the viewer.  The crowd is so into it, George has the audience in an absolute frenzy and with good reason.

The audio quality is very good but is slightly bass-heavy.  Everything comes through loud and clear but the bass is very prominent.  If there was a lack of treble this would present a problem, but there are plenty of highs so this doesn't detract from the listening experience.  Just be sure to remove any glass objects from your wall unit!

To think this is GM's first live DVD is hard to believe.  I am so thankful that he decided to do one and that the product is of such high quality.  His band is incredible and so are the backing vocalists.  A really talented bunch that bring out the most in all these classic tracks.  If you want to see and hear George Michael at his very best, you must get this.  A triumph.
