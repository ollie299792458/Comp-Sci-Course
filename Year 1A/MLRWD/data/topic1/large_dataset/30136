Rattle &amp; Hum has captured something that most concert/music videos do not.  You experience the music, but also feel as though You know the guys by the film's end.  The cinematography is incredible, making great use of  black and white film to capture the haunting yet chilling image of The  Edge's  shadowy silhouette against the concert lights, which was made all  the more powerful by the Wizard of Oz appearace of color at the show's  climax at Tempe's Sun Devil Stadium.  
The most captivating moment of the  film was Sunday Bloody, which was prefaced by a somber Bono speaking about  the never ending struggle in Ireland, on the same day of a bombing where  people died.  Halfway through the song, he breaks into a powerful political  tirade and plea that not only gripes Your heart, but it also caught the  attention of the IRA, who were none too pleased...
Play this on a  surround sound system, strong sub-woofer, and enjoy the true artistry that  is missing in today's lifeless, mechanical "music."
