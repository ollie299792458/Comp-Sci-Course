Not everyone is going to like this film. If your main objective is entertainment you will probably be bored. I watched it without any exposure to its trailer or any idea at all what it was about and I think that is why it had a big impact on me. I am glad this was the case because it truly was like being led down a blind alley and then being smacked in the face with a reality I did not see coming at all. Personally, I don't tend to run ahead in my mind when I watch a film because I like to focus on every nuance I can and absorb it that way. I don't tend to make up my mind until I have all the facts. Reminds me of the moment in the movie, "A Beautiful Mind" when it becomes apparent the character is schizophrenic and not dealing with reality. I love surprises like that. This movie also reminded me of another film, "Doubt", though fictional, which left each viewer with an impression distinctly their own and created much interesting conversations afterward. Unfortunately, the more you know about this type of film before you see it, the less likely you will probably appreciate it. I loved it and it hung in my mind for a long time. I particularly liked pondering the definition of a "catfish" as applied to the story. I also like watching it again with someone new to the film and seeing their reaction. Creates some great conversations, all of which were no doubt some of the film maker's objectives.
