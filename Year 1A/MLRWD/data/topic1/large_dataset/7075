I have read the book and then I just was compelled to see the movie. The adaptation from book to film is very good. And I mean Veeeeeery good. I was amazed at the way the plot was developed in the screen. Even though I'm no film maker, I think it was quite a difficult book to turn into a screentext. Probably the presence of Dan Brown helped and the directorial talen of Ron Howard was no small thing either. Hanks and Tautou deliver the strength of their characters and Reno's role is simply delightful to watch. All in all, a very tight production, deserving (I think), some nominations for the BIG Academy Awards.

On another side, I've read a lot of reviews posted here by people that seem to have lost the real meaning of what they are criticizing. This is just a work of fiction (both the movie and the book, of course), and as such, a SUPERB work of fiction. Who cares if Phillip's gospel was written in Arameic, Copt, or English, for that matter?. It is just a literary license, useful to tell a story. Who cares if the Nicea Council was held to determine Jesus' divinity, to unify concepts between ancien christians or whatever?. Again, it's just a literary "trick" to tell a story. And Brown uses these (as well as others) brilliantly. The way that he combines symbology, bigotry and criminal investigation is simply great.

I think that if someone is too dogmatic and narrow minded, you should not get close to something that, even being fiction, could threaten your closely held beliefs. After all, the role of education is to take an empty mind and turn it into an open mind.
