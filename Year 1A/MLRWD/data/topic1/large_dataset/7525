I remember watching 'Perfect Strangers' every Friday night as part of the TGIF lineup... I think I was about 8-9 years old at the time.  Even though I didn't understand all of the content of the show, I still thought it was entertaining, interesting, and really funny.  Comic sitcoms have really "evolved" since the late 80's, early 90's.  I suppose some of the changes are for the better but I must admit, I really miss some of the shows I grew up watching-- for example, 'Growing Pains,' 'The Facts of Life'  and 'Just the 10 of us' (wow, I really feel like I'm dating myself!).

This DVD is great and I think the episodes are the non-syndicated versions (but don't quote me on it).  There are a couple of special features but not really... I was hoping for actor commentary on some of the episodes and maybe some current interviews of the actors, reminiscing about the experience on the show, etc.

That being said, I'm just grateful that Warner Bros. released the first two seasons and I'm hoping that they will go further and continue to do so.
