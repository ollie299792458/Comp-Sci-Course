I first saw 'On Her Majety's Secret Service' while I was a teenager in the 70s. I had always been very curious about it, having seen the record soundtrack in stores, but never the film itself (either in theaters or on television) or hearing my friends speak of it. In the 1970s when a local theater ran it on a double bill with another Bond film (I think it was showing with 'Diamonds Are Forever') I was finally able to satisfy my curiosity. I was awestruck. Great story, great cast, fantastic stunts and breathtaking aerial cinematography. I tried to convince my friends that this was one of the best Bond films, but they all shrugged it off since Connery was absent. After a while I started to believe them, but some years later I caught it on ABC (I think it was the TV premiere) and quickly I was reassured that I had been right all along. This was among the handful of the truly great Bond films!!! I'll agree, though that had Connery been in the starring role, this would be unanimously regarded as THE greatest Bond film, but Lazenby is not bad as Bond, and in fact portrays 007 with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability which gives the story a lot of its heart. Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas give superb performances and the production is nearly flawless. Still, sadly, the Connery comparison persists making this probably the greatest 'but what if...' motion picture ever!!
