WOW!  After watching Cunning Stunts &amp; A year and a half in the life of...on DVD, I thought the boys had done it all.  I bought S &amp; M on CD last year and was amazed back then at how Metallica can take such a 'crazy'  idea of mixing their music with the backing of a Symphony Orchestra.  When  I got the DVD, I was even more amazed.  Seeing them all dressed smartly was  a big shock too!  They interact with the crowd as well as they always do,  they treat the crowd as if they're all personal friends.  Having seen them  live in Milton Keynes in '99, I can relate to how the crowd must have felt.  The sound is fantastic - 5.1 or 2.0 Band &amp; Orchestra or 2.0 Band or  2.0 Orchestra.  They way you can change to just listening to the Orchestra  or the band is a brilliant concept and you can see just how much backing  Metallica are actually getting.  I have given this DVD 5/5 because it is to  me, better than Cunning Stunts (altho I give that 5/5 as well!).  The wait  was definitely worth it.  To all Metallica fans, I suggest you get this  DVD.I know you'll all love it.  One thing tho, turn it up LOUD!
