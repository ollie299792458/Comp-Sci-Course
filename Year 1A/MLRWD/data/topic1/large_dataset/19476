So I will readily admit it--the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE, complete with the soundtrack song of "There's Got to be a Morning After" played a major part if my childhood mythology.  I saw it with my father at the tender age of six, and vividly recall walking outside the theater to be told that the ground was "icing up." That evening became the famous ice storm of 1972 (made even more famous by the movie, ICE STORM), and seeing the original film has assumed a sort of epic quality in my childhood recollections.

All that aside, as well as the fact that a ship turning upside down when you're only six is pretty heady stuff, this movie just fell flat for me.  I had hoped that something more than special effects would bring the original up to date.  What I found was a cast of characters that was too sweeping, and that this particular version owed a bit too much to the smash TITANIC.

Also, I just love Richard Dreyfus.  Just saw him again in JAWS in the past day or so while watching the DVD.  What's going on with him? He seemed very off to me, but more than that, this remake came off as downright empty.  I'm sorry to say it, too, because with many admirable actors populating the cast (Andre Braugher, Josh Lucas, Dreyfus), I'd thought this would be a powerful film.  Not so.  Apart from the moment when the massive tidal wave turns the cruise ship upside down, it was boring all the way through.

Wish I could recommend it, but alas, I just can't.  I say go find the original, turn the air conditioning way down low and imagine an ice storm.  Better yet? Rent THE ICE STORM, a far better film.  :)
