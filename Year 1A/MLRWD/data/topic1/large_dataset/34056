This is a hilarious action film in which Dolph Lundgren kills dozens, maybe hundreds, of henchmen while driving a Ferrari F40 through the desert dirt roads of the American Southwest.  He battles the world's worst marksmen, who deserve an award for the most ineffectual fighting skills ever known.  Meanwhile, Lundgren lands plunge after plunge of bullets into bad guys, causing them to dance in place as crimson clouds of blood erupt again and again.  This is not just killing, it is a tongue-in- cheek ballet.

Gnarled guts, bones sticking out, and blood-showers are the order of the day during the incorrigibly violent battle at the boss's headquarters.  In it, Dolph Lundgren murders almost every living thing within miles.  This movie has some of the most cartoonish simulated violence ever put to film.  It also contains baffling sexism and racism (Chinese portrayals).  The female lead is completely illogical and has no motives other to escort the un-charismatic Lundgren as he circles the desert aimlessly.  Overall this is a highly watchable film that nonetheless is campy and dated enough that no one today could take it seriously.
