The years before Churchill became the  leader  of Britain through the WWII, were interesting for an observer. Practically ostracized by political class we see how a man can survive without doing what he liked the most: to command.

Churchill here is displayed in the most ordinary, plain and because of that touching way I have ever seen. His frustration for being far from power makes him a bitter man and unbereable to live with. Albert Finney plays a wonderful Churchill. And if the real one was not like Finney, he should have been.

While Baldwin was sure that anything would be better to avoid another war, Churchill was aware of the threating that Europe was facing. But his vision does not make him the hero of the film. Quite the contrary here he is shown as a man avid of power, who uses anything to regain it again. Here is Ralph Wigram (played by Linus Roache) who is the real hero of the film.

But apart from the political point of view there is a nice love story between Churchill and his wife lady Clementine. And no one like Vanessa Redgrave to play her. Her distinction, manners and warmth make that this couple will be perfectly  real. We see a human Churchill, and I think is very interesting to show how this man, hunger for power had not real one in his own family. Too focused in politics is his wife who must deal with the boring problems of everydays life.

It is a well made film. Perfectly settled and with great performances.
