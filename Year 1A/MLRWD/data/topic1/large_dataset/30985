Julie Taymor has hit the ground running with this her first ambitious effort as a film director. In spite of some minor flaws, this ecclectic film based on the most popular play of Shakespeare's lifetime is a modern masterpiece. Taymor has found the thread that connects the grand guignol, blood and guts revenge tragedy of Titus Andronicus with our modern global decadence. Freely mixing images of modern Europe with Ancient Rome, Taymor reminds us that we may have far too much in common with the corrupt and amoral society presented in Shakespeare's first revenge tragedy.
Added to the visual beauty and intense imagery of Ms. Taymor's eye are a number of outstanding and outlandish performances. Anthony Hopkins is riveting in the title role. His quick descent into villany shows the true mark of most revenge tragedy heroes (Hamlet excepted). Jessica Lange rises nobly to the occasion in a role that is both exciting and challenging. If in an isolated moment or two she seems overwhelmed, the moment is short-lived as she both attracts and repels us as the evil antagonist, Tamora, Queen of the Amazons.
This most fascinating adaptation of early Shakespeare to film may very well be the best Shakespearean movie ever made.
