After seeing Kung Fu Panda<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OINK">Kung Fu Panda (+BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] and being wowed and surprised Dreamworks Animation could even make a movie and not pack it full of pop culture references. I thought Pixar might finally have some competition. As usual Wall-E<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWFI">Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] takes the cake.... but until I saw Bolt from Disney I don't know which movie ranks number 2 for the year. This movie has action that would rival Michael Bay and a dog and owner story that the producers of Marly and Me should have watched. Kids love it and Adults will more than love the story. This is twice in the last five years that Disney has released a picture that should have done better in theaters that are going to be classics at home. See Meet the Robinson's<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ROAK36">Meet the Robinsons [Blu-ray</a>] for the other. Mind you John Lassater of Pixar has his fingers all over this movie so you might say this is half Pixar but a 100% well worth the watch.
