Yes in heaven everything is fine!

I absolutely love this film, it is in my top 10 list at NO.2.

It has a deep and profound resonating tone of wit and strange mind bending imagination that I love.

Yes Mr Lynch owes much to German Surrealist movie makers and artists, but he brings something more to this genre that almost defies description.

This film is a living surrealist artwork and without disappearing into some artsy intellectual critique, I just say, watch this film, soak your dendrite's in this mire of dark dreamy nightmare's.

I don't really want to be so pretentious as to state that I understand Lynch's themes and ideas that are the genius that is Eraserhead....But I am compelled...

Eraserhead is partly an illusive lucid dark response to the hood placed over the father's head as he is dragged to the gallows that is responsibility of making and raising a baby.......

Fatherhood as nightmare without a manual....in the end in heaven everything may be fine, but life on earth is a nightmare....The rest is purely up to the eye of the beholder and there in lies the genius.

I loved the extra's on this dvd.

If you love David Lynch and love surreal mind melting cinema, this is for you.

This movie will stand and live on forever, it will never date.
