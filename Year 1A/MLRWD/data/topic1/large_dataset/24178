I virtually grew up on shows like The Waltons &amp; House on the Prairie, so when I found the Waltons on the DVD shelf in Wal-Mart, I just had to pick it up. Sure, I had just about all of the episodes on video...which as I look at them on the shelf, consists of 4 very high stacks of tapes, with some episodeic cavidies, low grade copies and some edit mistakes by the television stations when they re-aired them recently. I was reluctant when I picked up the copy, not sure if they would be of a poor grade or not...but when I got them home...not only were they the full length versions (50 minutes in comparison to the 40 - 45 minutes...depending on the stations) but they came up crystal clear in both picture and sound. 
And I agree that the kids of today can still learn a few things from these episodes, while the adults can be equally as entertained and educated. 
Of course these weren't meant to have an educational value to them, but they have dealt with a lot of issues like dealing with those who are different, substance abuse and even relationships of one form or another, while still sticking to the eras that the show was to take place (going from the depression, to WWII to the progression years 1950's in the follow-up movies).
While it is a long series to follow, it is well worth the investment. But I do agree with one person, if you shop around, you can find it cheaper than the price here...
