In a day and age where a mother of 3 would be shot for her own protection, they make a title called outrage and make it about gays in politics.

The outrage isn't about "obey or die", it's about gays. For a mother of 3 to continue her life after riding a moped without a helmet, she'd have to ignore a cops signal to stop. Then she'd have to respond to the violence initiated against here when she arrived home. Then she'd have to respond to the guns pulled on her after she resisted the pepper spray and tasers. Then she would be gunned down and the cops would call it "self defense" and "helmet laws are for your protection."

The outrage in this film isn't over our complete lack of freedom when it comes to anything less trivial than how many times we blink in a minute, it's about gays in politics.

I didn't bother to watch the rest of the film after I saw where it was going.

With all that's going on, we don't need to hear about gays or Snookie. If you make something about this, title and describe it that way so we don't waste our time.
