I just got done watching this movie, "No Holds Barred" on DVD today. The movie itself is just the fun 80s cheesy stuff that I remembered! However, there are some issues with the DVD release:

First, a bone to pick. HDTVs have been around for awhile. HDMI cables have been around for awhile. So why the hell does Amazon.com and DVD manufacterers 'claim' that the DVDs that they release is 'Subtitled' in English when it is only 'Closed Captioned'. There IS a difference! Closed Caption does NOT work over HDMI cables! I would not have bought the DVD if I had known that it was just 'Closed Captioned' instead of 'Subtitled'. Please quit misleading customers on the subtitle/ closed captioning issue.

Second, This is a cropped "pan & scan" that has been 'reformated' for the widescreen TV. Most of the time, you don't notice it, but there are several scenes where actors' faces and heads get chopped. Why can't they do in DVD what they do to old movied in Blu-Ray such as Wizard of Oz. They show the whole film in its' entirety with vertical black bars on the left and right of the screen. I would be just fine and happy with that. Please quit chopping the films.

Third, There is a wrestling scene in a cage that is missing from the DVD release. Please quit cutting scenes from re-released of movies.
