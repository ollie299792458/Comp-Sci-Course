I'm sure that everyone is familiar with the story of this episode of the Halloween set, and so I won't waste any time with this.  Suffice to say that I have to disagree with many of the people who slate this episode.  I think that it is a great chapter in the Halloween series - providing a small break from Mr Myers exploits and also providing far more scope for the series.  The great John Carpenter soundtrack adds to the atmosphere brilliantly, just like the original Halloween 1, but with a more 80's sounding electronic feel.  The story is more creative than the rest of the series and the level of acting is adequate.  The only gripe I have really are the quality of the DVD's themselves.  In the UK we are limited to two versions, both of which have next to nothing in terms of special features and one of the DVD's even has some parts cut out!  It is a shame really considering the features which are available on DVDs relating to other episodes in the series.  So I would have to say 5 out of 5 for the movie, but only 3 out of 5 for the DVD.  However, if you love the movie, you'll get the DVD anyway!  Enjoy!
