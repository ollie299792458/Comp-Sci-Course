When the owner of an egg farm grows impatient with the small profits her eggs are bringing, she and her husband decide to turn to the much more valuable chickens themselves, and begin converting their unassuming little farm into a much more lucrative chicken pie operation. The chickens, sensing that this can't possibly be good for their well being, heighten their attempts to escape.
One of the most eagerly anticipated films in the last few years, the debut feature from Nick Park (the creator of the beloved English claymation duo Wallace &amp; Gromit) delivers on all counts. No, Wallace &amp; Gromit themselves are not here, and this may be the film's only fault (along with a very slight feeling of claustrophobia), but there are plenty of new characters to meet and savor, mostly chickens (all good) and two humans (100% bad). From beginning to end, this little gem is filled with wisecracks, sight gags, and breathtaking action sequences including one nail-biting ride through the chicken pie machine very reminiscent of the final train chase of The Wrong Trousers. 
Those familiar with Park's work know to expect an incredible attention to detail, which is astoundingly impressive since Park and crew still do it the old-fashioned way, 24 photographs per second, the same method Wladislaw Starewicz employed at the turn of the century. This results in an animation that isn't as smooth as, say, that found in Toy Story 2 (your eyes will notice the slight jerkiness right from the start), though in the end it's more rewarding, like the appreciation of the difference in quality between an Oriental rug made by a human as opposed to one made by a machine.
