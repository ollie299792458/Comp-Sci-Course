Actually, it's about ironic personalities and expecting the unexpected. It's also about whether two people in a marriage can ever truly trust each other. 
In the scene with Domino as a hooker that lures Dr. Harford to her apartment, one does not ever buy that she is a prostitute. She's way too sweet and doesn't even want Harford's money when he offers it even without her services. The white bread college kids as homophobic tough guys is completely incongruous. And Milich casually offering his daughter's services is surreal and disturbing. Expect the unexpected. 
The characters are typical Kubrick and are three dimensional and real. The casting was brilliant as was the acting. And the irony's so thick you can cut it with a knife. 
Dr. and Mrs. Harford's marital insecurities strike a raw nerve. I think we've all been there. And it's all the more painful to watch because the characters are brutally honest in expressing their considerations of infidelity toward the other. But it's entirely enthralling. 
This is a great Kubrick film. It does him justice as his last.
