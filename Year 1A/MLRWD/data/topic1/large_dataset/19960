First, I must mention that this is more of a review of the Blu-ray release than the movie itself.  If you like Adam Sandler and enjoy his slapstick humor, you'll love this movie.  Also, I normally only double-dip from DVD to Blu-ray for action films, or movies I consider to be classics.  However, the DVD version I had for The Waterboy was not in anamorphic widescreen, and as a result, I had to use a stretch mode on my TV to get it to fill up the screen - this looked horrible.

Thus, I opted to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. I have to say, this release was impressive.  The colors on the players' uniforms pop, and the soundtrack is awesome in DTS!  There's a lot of bass from the heavy body slams of Bobby Boucher when he tackles the other football players, and the roars of the crowds during the Bourbon Bowl scenes will literally engulf you.  There are a number of things you might notice which you may not have noticed before.  There's MUCH more visible detail in the shots in the bayous.  Also, I never realized that Farmer Fran had nipple rings!  I just about rolled on the floor laughing when I saw this.

Why only 4 stars?
My only reason for docking a star here is that, when you rewind or fast-forward during the movie, there's an annoying still clip of the chapter that appears just above the timeline.  This may be a minor nuisance to some, but it annoyed me just enough.

All said though, this release is certainly worth the upgrade - highly recommend!
