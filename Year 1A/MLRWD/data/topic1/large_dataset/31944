I am a "Treasure" fanatic. Loved #1 and enjoyed #2. Worth buying and having, #2 lacks the pace and unpredictability of the original; I wanted to see them steal more things - but that's just me! I can recommend this as a great family pic and a worthy second feature when shown after the original. Plan to serve the chips, dips and wine during #2. Awwwww, that wasn't fair of me. However, Nick Cage is looking his age - I think it's the too dark hair dye. (Always go lighter when you're older). He looks like an aging Vegas lounge lizard. Everyone else looks fine although Justin Bartha is much more appealing with his stubble; which never appears in the film even after they've been climbing and discovering things for extended periods of time. Finally, I appreciate Amazon's discounting some of their Blu Rays! When will the industry catch up????? These prices are too high, the extras only so-so and the extra time enabled by Blu-Ray isn't used optimally. Visually - It's great! Audio - Superb. Despite my comments; If you loved #1 - buy #2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
