I am a HUGE eagles fan, in fact I was turning my friends on to them when nobody ever heard of them, and I must say, if you are an Eagles fan...don't pass this DVD up! I am a big collector of live DVD concerts, and this technically, visually, and audibly, is as good as it gets...your ears will tingle! To me also...Don Felder is one of the most under-rated guitar players there is...he is absolutely brilliant here and makes it look effortless! His playing will blow you away! As good as Joe Walsh is, it is my impression that he is the sideman here to Don (sorry Joe, I love ya man, but I calls it as I sees it). But I totally agree with S.D.'s review...this would be a perfect DVD , if it were not for the obnoxious ego of Don Henley! Sure..the man has talent to spare, but on this DVD as well as on his "Inside Job" solo DVD, the man appears to have gotten so full of himself, it's almost sickening. It is rumoured that it was his self-engratiating ego which was the cause of the Eagles break-up to begin with. It apparently was Glen Frey who ,(also, who in my opinion, is a real class act...he's wonderful here on piano and singing Tequila Sunrise), finally got sick of Henley's ego, and wasn't afraid to say so, which led to the break-up, according to what I've heard and read. In Don Henley's own words, the real reason for this "Hell Freezes Over" tour was because,.."There's a hell of alot of money to be made.." , so not only is he an egotist,..he's a GREEDY egotist(at least he was honest about it), and his attitude shows through here. Hence,..my rating of four. That having been said, this group performance is tight and top-notch, and well worth the investment.
