When I was in grade school me and my girlfriends spent hours popping popcorn and watching this movie over and over. Just the other day I rented it again, and was still taken with the meaning of the movie. and yet again it touched myheart. This is one of those movies that when it ends and the credits are rolling you're like "Wow!". I even have to say that before these stars (Matt Damon, Brendan Fraiser, Ben Affleck etc..) got big, I was waiting for the credits to see who played who. They are all very talented actors, and portray this movie to make you understand that being Jewish was an issue in life back then, as being black is an issue now. It shows that being a friend has nothing to do with what your religion is, it's the person that you are inside. I remember whaen they were all in the room trying to figure out the verdict for who cheated and Chris O'Donnel said "But he was still a good guy." That shows you something. All the movies coming out lately are stupid and pointless. This movie on my eyes is a true classic.
