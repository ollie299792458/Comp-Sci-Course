This is a must have for any Western fan, and for that matter any fan of American cinema. One of the original "good man with a gun"  Westerns, this film is sure to impress. 
The movie pulls on underlying  sexual and romantic tension between the family and the gunslinger Shane. As  the the boy says in the the end, "we want you shane" and it's  true, we all want shane for his stoic and skillful power. Who else could  tame those bad guys like shane.
Two great scenes: watch for the scene  when shane meets his adversary played by Jack Palance. They are both  gunslingers one on the side of the good family and one on the side of the  evil ranchers. But they admire and respect each other like no two  characters in the movie. The director does a wonderful job of showing this  when he plays it out like it is a romantic meeting. Shane looks, Palance  looks as if he is Bogart staring at Bergman when he sees shane. Watch as  they both admire eachother equipment . . . guns.
the other great scene is  at the end when Shane says to the rancher "your time has passed"  and the rancher shoots right back "what about you gunslinger" and  it's true. The west was going to be populated by the Joe Starks of the  whorls not the Shane's. That is the beautiful tragedy of Shane. Shane is as  out of place as the men he fights and he too is destined to die right with  them. This is why we admire him and why the entire stark family wants him.  A great movie.
