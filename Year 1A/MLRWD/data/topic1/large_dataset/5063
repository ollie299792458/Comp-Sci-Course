The fans of the Pat Metheny Group have been waiting for this DVD a long time.  There have been questions about The Way Up DVD every week for the past several months on the Pat Metheny message boards.  After the long wait, we were not disappointed.

The DVD takes you on an incredible musical journey.  Pat Metheny is flawless in his execution.  His solo in part 3 is very nice.  He uses several guitars during the piece, including his trust Ibanez, synth guitar, and a couple of different acoustics.  There is one section where he plays a 12 string with an e-Bow and a slide.  I have never seen a guitar player do that. Lyle Mays is amazing.  There are several great shots of his fingers at work.  One spot that stood is when he starts playing some incredible runs on the synth that is sitting on top of his piano.  Steve Rodby plays some of the best upright bass I have heard in a while.  He also deserves some kudos for being a part of the DVD production.  Antonio Sanchez is truly a gifted drummer.  He is the driving force behind this work of art.  There is one part where he plays bass.  Another first, I have never seen a drummer playing bass at the drum set, Coung Vu is one of the most innovative musicians to today.  He gets sounds out of his trumpet that provide textual accents to The Way Up.  Gregoire Maret play harmonica beautifully.  His solo will take you to another place.  Nando Lauria provides guitar support for Metheny.  He also plays other instruments and sings.  His performance is the most spirited.  Watch him as plays the shakers.

The interview with Pat Metheny is also very nice.  He explains a lot of why he chose a piece like this.

The DVD is a must have for any person who loves to be taken on a musical journey.  This is one unforgettable journey.
