This is still one of my favorite films of all time and the film that sparked my interest in cinema as more than just a passing interest.

The movie begins half hearted and detached, like the characters themselves, and culminates into an emotional downpour that climaxes during the campfire scene, which to this day is some of the most intense acting I have experienced (River).  The two characters (River and Keanu) move from being detached emotionally and sexually, perverse, to intimate and close, to once again, detached and separate.  The movie leaves you with an overwhelming feeling of despair over the things in life which lead us away from all that is pure and intimate (power/social status and money).  This pattern of association then dissociation embodied in the character Keanu plays is offset by the purity of River's character who stays true to his sense of self, and ultimately suffers, and possibly disappears from existence at the conclusion of the film.  The schism inherent in the American aristocracy is exploited in full depth.  The wealthy lie with the poor as it conveniences their need, but turn their backs in fair weather.  Deep political satire in Shakespearean jest, as true today as it ever was...

"Have a nice day."
