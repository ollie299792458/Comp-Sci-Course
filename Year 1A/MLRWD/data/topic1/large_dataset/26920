This is no exaggeration. The film contains the caliber of humor one only finds with Allen, amid a drama of philosophical questions ......  Landau is a weatlhy optometrist off rendezvouing with a slightly  psychotic/emotionally needy Anjelica Houston. Stop. Oh no, Landau's  conscious has gotten the best of him (after two years), and he is ready to  let go.  However, someone else is not and she is prepared to expose every  ugly secret hidden in this man's closet to Everyone, including his loving  wife and friends.
cant let this happen....
What shall I do?
Listen to  the rabbi, or my seedy brother who can "take care of the  problem"?
Don't worry Woody fans, he is in here too. And he is a  genius at interplaying the stories to a full overly satisfying  conclusion.
Woody is unhappy (who would have guessed?) in life and  marriage, until he meets a producer (Mia Farrow) on the documentary he is  working on.  One that is following the life of his slimey Hollywood -type  brother-in-law (Alan Alda).
You would not believe what people get away  with in this film.......And do You Believe that God is watching?
