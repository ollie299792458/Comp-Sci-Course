We don't have movie stars anymore; we have "actors."  If nothing else, the Guns of Navarone proves this point, as no less than the talents of Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, and David Niven bring  Alistair MacLean's gripping novel to life.  The result is one of those  old-fashioned, sweeping adventures that never sacrifices character for  empty-headed action sequences or expensive but ultimately pointless special  effects.  Peck leads a rag-tag group of commandos to destroy a German  fortress whose giant cannon threaten the English Navy.  Like all such  cinematic missions, however, there is a traitor in the group threatening  their success, as well as a series of setbacks from the Germans and Mother  Nature.  There's never any real question about whether or not the mission  will succeed, only who will be left when it's all over, and verbal sparring  by Peck and Niven adds to the tension (perhaps the best scene in the film  occurs when Niven challenges Peck to execute the traitor).  Young  audiences, particularly those spoon-fed on the palp generated over the last  10 years, will probably scoff at the film's unhurried pace and tame action  sequences, but the real action occurs inside the characters' heads and  hearts.  A must-see for anyone looking for a thinking person's action  movie.
