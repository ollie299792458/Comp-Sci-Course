"I'm saying that Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies anymore. "  Season 4 was chock full of funny one liners and witty pop culture references, but that didn't seem to be enough for a lot of people.  This was actually one of my favorite seasons.  I love the funny half of Buffy that is sometimes hidden beneath all the killing and darkness of the show.  I loved Riley too and I don't understand you people who didn't like him.  He was a good person with a hot bod who simply wanted to do what was right. What more could you ask for?? I guess most people need drama in their love lives though.  Buffy sure seemed to.  Also some claim that this season doesn't have much of a story arch or whatever, but hello Willow becomes a lesbian, Tara enters the picture bringing lots of magic, Xander and Anya hook up, Spike becomes more involved with the gang whether he wants to or not, and many other things go on if you read between the lines, such as Buffy realizing even though she's the Slayer her powers can't help her with everything, like college.  The Scoobies did drift apart throughout the season, but that happens in life and in the end the original four (Buffy, Willow, Giles, and Xander) come together and remember to love, appreciate, and help each other, as they did when they battled Adam.
