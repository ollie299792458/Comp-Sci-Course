I gave this a 2 star only because it's Marvel's better animated movies. There are NO stories here. All that Hulk does in both movies is gets captured, gets angry, and smashes things. Ok action, but no plot. If you just want mindless violence with no substance than you may like it. Its nice to see Wolverine cut loose and there is plenty of blood in them, but thats all you're going to get. The animation is choppy and a bit too bright, mainly in the Wolverine section.
 I must say, Marvel has lost ALL my respect. They are much better to sticking with live action movies than animation. Animation is DC's area of expertise. I felt their movies have great story telling along with great action. Superman: Doomsday was terrific if you see it as its own movie and not like the comic book. Justice League: The New Frontier is a masterpiece. Enough said. Batman: Gothem Knights is NOT an action movie, but has wonderful animation and a powerful story that really dives inside his mind and how he becomes the Batman.
 If Marvel wants to gain my respect again they need to take lessons from the masters. At least make an amazing X-Men animated movie thats not JUST action.
