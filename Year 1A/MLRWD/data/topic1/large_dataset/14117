In spite of a story that is, ultimately, formulaic; there is very much to like in this movie and it is that rare film I enjoy revisiting from time to time.

Why? Since I read the book first, it never has been about the who-done-it for me.

The highlights are Connery's performance and the wonderful atmospherics. I judge a historic book or film successful if it gives me a believable sense of how people in that time and place experienced their world. At that, this film succeeds very well.

In part, this is because we see everything through the eyes of a teenage boy (Christian Slater), who is recalling the events as a very old man. There is a wonderful scene early in the film, when Connery and Slater's characters first arrive at the abbey, where we get a feeling for both the wonder and terror Slater's character experiences as he sees the Abbey's majestic chapel as well as its parade of horribles for the first time.

This film is a masterful adaptation of the book. I can't imagine how it could have been done better. However, as with many movie adaptations of popular novels, there are small details you will miss if you haven't read the book.

For example, Brother William and virtually every other character has a history, which is known in whole or part by some or all of the other characters. For 14th century monastics, it's a small world.

The movie is still perfectly understandable without the viewer knowing that history, but the movie respects those viewers who have read the book by making the characters act in a way that is consistent with their backstory.
