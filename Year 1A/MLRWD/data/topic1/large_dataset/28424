Director Martin Scorsese reteams with screenwriter Nicholas Pil-
eggi for this examination of the rise and fall of a Las Vegas ca-
sino run by a slick mafia loan shark (Robert De Niro) and his violent hair trigger partner (Joe Pesci). Although the film is very good and Sharon Stone has good moments with her character, this film is not as excellent as GOODFELLAS (My all time favorite
mob movie) and GOODFELLAS is superior to this film and way better
than CASINO. The first flaw of CASINO is it should've been made by Warner Brothers, which made two other Scorsese mob pictures
MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS and if their ever was a collection of
Scorsese films they can add this to those films. Another flaw is
CASINO is not as enthralling and stylish like GOODFELLAS was. Another problem is Joe Pesci's character isn't as wonderful as his Tommy Devito in GOODFELLAS. Despite all this, it is still enjoyable to watch and it's screenplay provides all good details.
I am a real real big big Scorsese fan and has enjoyed all his movies and although CASINO is not my favorite Scorsese film to watch, it is still a good movie even though it is not a timeless
classic like GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, and MEAN STREETS, which are
better films. However I do like this one even though it is not a
masterpiece like GOODFELLAS was and GOODFELLAS is a way better movie than CASINO.
