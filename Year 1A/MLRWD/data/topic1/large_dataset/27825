At first, I saw this as a butchering of Oscar Wilde's original masterpiece, but the main difference is the sex.

There is so much of it in this film. The film Dorian will have sex with anything that walks and talks, and things get weird very fast. There was nothing in the book that ever mentioned bondage, unusual fetish, or orgies. There is also the fact that it is implied that Dorian sleeps with Basil, which is highly controversial and can be debated in several different ways. In the novel, it can be ascertained that Basil has homosexual feelings for Dorian. These, however, come out in an expression of love rather than lust. In the film, they do the deed and that's that. This was my primary issue with the film.

My other issues with the film are based primarily on personal expectations that were not met. While I think they did an excellent job casting Basil and Lord Henry, I never pictured Dorian as a brunette with brown eyes or Sybil to have flaming red hair. That's another thing,

Sybil. She seemed extremely devoid of character. Blank. I didn't understand her character, or her relationship with Dorian in the film. They also left out the scene I find most powerful, the scene where Sybil is weeping at Dorian's feet.

I appreciate the thematic elements and the creative license taken by the directors, but I probably would have liked the film more if I hadn't read the book.
