I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....

The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.

OK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.

Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.
