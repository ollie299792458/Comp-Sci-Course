Scorsese's "Goodfellas" is a long movie that feels short, thanks to memorable characters, a blazing soundtrack, and expert pacing that only the director is capable of pulling off. The screenplay is so good, that watching episodes of the Sopranos evoke great memories of this film. In fact, any Italian mafia flick that came out after Goodfellas borrows (or steals) at least a little bit from Scorsese and Pileggi. Ray Liotta's narration is perfect. It is as good as Dreyfuss' wonderul narration in "Stand By Me" and is peppered with comedy, poignant emotion, and heart. 
"Goodfellas" practically made Pesci's career with his explosive performance as Tommy DeVito. Here, Pesci forever silences the theory that short, little guys can't be tough. Robert DeNiro shines equally as the Irishman Jimmy Conway with his famous "Little Bit" scene. 
The supporting cast of characters is top notch in the tradition of Scorsese with Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Frank Vincent creating memorable performances. If you haven't seen Goodfellas, buy it! It changed the way Gangster films were made, as it added a little comedy to the gritty criminal subject matter.
