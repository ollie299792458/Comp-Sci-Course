If you want blood, gore, and mayhem... don't buy this movie.
If you want action, thrills, and mystery... don't buy this movie.

If you want a horror movie disguised as a simple tale of survival after the bomb is dropped, this is the film for you.

This movie is so commonly overlooked that I simply couldn't stand it anymore.  It's one of the best I've ever seen - not because of special effects, big named actors, or any of that: it's one of the best because it tells such a real story that is so frightening it could keep you up at night.

These days, we don't have to worry much about nuclear war - at least not as much as we once did - but the story told is so compelling that it deserves to be watched.  It stands proudly next to The Day After in a tie for the best nuclear holocaust film of all time.  It is utterly brilliant.

This film proves that, if done right, you don't need a bunch of fancy effects or Hollywood superstars to make a good movie.
