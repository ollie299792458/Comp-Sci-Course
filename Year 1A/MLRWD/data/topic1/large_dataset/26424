I actually love this movie!  I tend to like movies about high school when they bring back memories of my own teen years, and this movie is very remniscent of the atmosphere at my high school.  The pressure on students to conform to a specific interpretation of Christianity is very familiar, and - in a very satisfying way - "SAVED!" takes this issue and runs with it.  The movie is clever, funny, and for me, quite cathartic.

The acting is outstanding.  My favorite performances are not from the two lead actresses - even though they are both great.  I like Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's real-life daughter)best. She plays the lone Jewish classmate that everyone wants to "save".  The scene where she is pretending to speak in tongues is worth the price of the DVD.  Macaulay Culkin does a very convincing job playing a free thinker who doesn't accept the company line.  Hopefully, for Macaulay this is a successful step back into starring movie roles.  Finally, I adored (sublimely sexy) Patrick Fugit (from "Almost Famous") because of the way his character balances the whole movie.  His love is pointedly pure and free of judgement.

My bottom line for this movie....  If you like coming of age comedies, and you are not a very sensitive member of the religious right, you will like it.  If you have been a victim of overzealous evangelicals, you will love it.  If the word "backslidden" really cracks you up, "Saved!" may be your favorite movie this year!
