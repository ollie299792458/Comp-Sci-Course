I buy movies with digital copies intentionally and even though I'm not a big UltraViolet fan, I can still download the movies and watch on my many trips away from home when I don't always have internet to stream.  Flixster's website has given me problems redeeming the code for this and upon sending a "help ticket" asking for an iTunes compatible version because of website problems, I was simply told that WB Flixster will only do UltraViolet on this movie.

They did not resolve the problem in the way I had asked and hoped for but more problematic is that they did not even comment on the actual problem of their website not allowing me to redeem the movie in the first place.  Disappointing outcome from WB and Flixster, especially after Clash of the Titans was a Mac and WIndows compatible download.

AS for the movie, it's not great and the first was better but it really depends on what you like.  I was only wanting some good special effects and action sequences so plot was not as important for this particular movie.
