Alice Cooper's latest DVD, "Live at Montreux 2005" is nicely filmed from multiple camera angles, giving viewers a real you-are-there, vicarious concert-going experience. If you can't see Cooper and his excellent band live, this is the next best thing.

All the hits are here: "I'm Eighteen," "Under My Wheels," "School's Out," "Poison," "Billion Dollar Babies," and more -- 27 songs in all. The concert also represents Cooper's later work fairly well, with several cuts off "The Eyes of Alice Cooper" and "Dirty Diamonds" albums.

However, as a live document of what the veteran shock rocker does best, this pales in comparison to "Brutally Live" from several years back, which featured a frantic Alice pelting out his hits and a generous sampling of tunes from the then-new "Brutal Planet."

This DVD features some of the same theatrics (guillotine, whip-cracking offspring Calico on "Go to Hell" and Nurse Calico on "Ballad of Dwight Fry"), so viewers who own the previous DVD may feel they're watching a repeat.

Still, "Montreux 2005" is worth having for the inclusion of many tunes from "Welcome To My Nightmare," especially "The Awakening" and "Steven," which haven't made it to DVD before. And Cooper's band is still one of the tightest sounding around, knocking off hit after hit with barely a pause between. Of course, Alice himself sounds great on everything from ballads ("I Never Cry") to all-out rockers ("Lost in America," "No More Mr. Nice Guy").

One oversight: Nowhere on the DVD or the accompanying liner notes are songwriting credits given, denying members of the original Alice Cooper group the recognition they deserve for helping create a body of classic material.

As an extra bonus, a CD is included with 19 of the concert's songs.

For the price, this is a great piece of entertainment. For Cooper completists and fanatics, it's essential.
