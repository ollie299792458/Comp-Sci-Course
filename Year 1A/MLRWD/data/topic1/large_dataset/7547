If you don't know what Farscape's about, Amazon's plot synopsis will give you an idea much better than I could. Here's what makes Farscape Season 1 special:
- Irreverent humor. Farscape's unique among sci-fi shows in that its hero is himself a sci-fi fan. Seeing Ben Browder's John Crichton toss off references to Star Wars, Star Trek and other classic sci-fi tales is funny. Seeing his alien crewmates' puzzled reactions is even funnier.
- Unpredictability. Like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Farscape gleefully takes all the worn-out stereotypes of its genre and blows them to pieces. If you're used to sci-fi where the good guys never make mistakes, and you always know how the show will end well before the third act, get ready for something very different.
- An unconventional hero. In later seasons, tragic and fairly nasty experiences will lead John Crichton to adopt a draw-your-gun-first, ask-later viewpoint. In Season 1 he's still full of wonder and scientific curiosity, and he's prone to think his way out of a crisis rather than relying on firepower.
- An equally unusual crew dynamic. Later seasons see the crew getting along more or less harmoniously. Season 1 allows new viewers the genuine treat of watching a group of irritable and potentially dangerous protagonists forced to work together to save their own lives. Moya's crew members don't always like or trust one another, and it makes for satisfying and intriguing entertainment.
If you've ever wished that someone would apply Buffy's signature mix of humor, darkness and intelligence to space opera; if you've ever wondered what Star Trek would be like without that gigantic stick up its port nacelle; or if you're simply curious to see what the company that brought you The Muppet Show can do with science fiction... Farscape will thrill and entertain you tremendously.
