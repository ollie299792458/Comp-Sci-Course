I'll skip the actual movie review because most people ordering probably already know what it is about. I just want to touch on a few highlights on the blu-ray version.

First off, my wife and I did a comparison between an upconverted DVD played on a Harman Kardon DVD-38 and the blu-ray played on our PS3. The DVD picture quality was adiquate although grainy. The blu-ray transfer was much clearer and in comparison to the upconverted DVD showed much more detail than you would think would be there. While it isn't a "reference quality" transfer, it was still an improvement.

The audio was nicely done in transfer, but some of the background music was not there. Most noteably when Louis walked in on Beta breathing under the covers going through his transformation. On the DVD, there are horns building in anticipation over the sound effects, but on the blu-ray, it was just the sound effects.

All in all, I'm very happy with this release and have already retired the DVD from my collection.
