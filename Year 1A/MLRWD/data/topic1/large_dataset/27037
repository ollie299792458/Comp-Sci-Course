There are 20,000 things I like about this movie. For one, the casting is PERFECT. James Mason IS Captain Nemo. When he looks at an enemy frigate, you can see the UTTER HATRED burning in his eyes and the wicked snarl on his lips. This is one of the most believable performances I've seen. Also, I love the part where he plays TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR by BACH. This is my favorite classical tune and it fits very nicely into the film, setting a dark mood. The film starts off in just the right place, showing the "monster" sinking a frigate. It literally starts off with a bang. Soon after, a professor and his side-kick and a harpoonist set out to sea to discover the truth about this "sea monster." When their own ship gets sunk, the truth is discovered, but the story has only begun . . . . Throughout this movie you can see all sorts of different underwater creatures. At times you almost feel like you are watching a documentary, but this is mostly due to a very Disney influence. One part that would make a good poster is where it shows the Nautilus sinking just a few dozen yards in front of a frigate. You'll know the part when you see it. Then there's the part with the squid, which looks VERY realistic. For the 1950's, they get an A+. I doubt computer graphics could do better. This is one of the few movies that PROVES that you don't have to have amazing special effects to make your movie good. Mostly what makes this movie good is the acting and storyline. This is an excellent film for ALL AGES. If you want to see a good book-to-screen translation, then start with this movie. It deserves nothing less than 5 stars.
