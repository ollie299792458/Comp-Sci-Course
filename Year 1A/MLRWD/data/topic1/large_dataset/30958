I have always liked "The Green Berets".  And to think, The Duke did all that with only one lung!  Sure, there will always be the arguments about whether this was an honest rendering of the war.  All I can say is that you should read Robin Moore's "The Green Berets", from which the title and the idea of the journalist on the scene came from, and Captain Roger H. C. Donlon's book "Outpost of Freedom" which gave us the Camp A-107 battle model.  There are always two sides to every story and this one is told very well!

Whoever took this film from master to DVD made two blunders.  When they tried to keep it in letter box, the studio somehow managed to "squeeze" the left side so that anyone over there will have a slimmer head.  Secondly, you won't find it anywhere on the case and only in very small print, visible with a flashlight,on the disc, but the movie is split front and back.
Usually that is the kind of thing a viewer likes to be aware of going in.  On the other hand, this might be a case of getting what you pay for.
