As a Japanese person, I watched this movie with much skepticism. I expected many stereotypes etc.
I was pleasantly surprised.
I thought it was an intesting twist how it took a "outsider" to convince the young emperor to make the stand he made at the end. Even Katsumoto wasn't able to do that. I think the emperor was reminded of the Samurai Spirit, ironically by a Westerner.
The scene near the end, with the new machine guns from America, depicts with new beginning of modern Japan. It was sad to see how easily the Samurai was defeated. 1 by 1 like bowling pins, these greate warriors went down. It's as though they saved the "best" for last. So to me, those machine guns symbolized the modernization.
I thought Katsumoto's character was great but thought Cruise's character was needed to complete the story.
The "Seppuku", or suicide, is not an act of cowardice. It is an act of honor. It was considered the honorable way to die. It depicts the deepest dedication of the Samurai. You see this in the modern world today. Maybe not to this type of extreme. Sacrifice oneself for the love of country isn't so far fetched an idea.
I think this world could use a little bid of that code of honor...
