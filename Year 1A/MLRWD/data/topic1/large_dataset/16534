If this new animated Clone Wars movie is to kick start a series that bridges the gap between episodes 2 and 3, then there are already some major continuity flaws. First of all, assuming the feature film happens right after episode 2, the main characters (Anakin and Obi Wan) already have their Episode 3 hairstyles, which is not believable. How did Obi Wan lose his mullet so quickly? How did Anakin's hair get so long so fast? Their hair should progress into these new styles over the 3 year period, not overnight. Secondly, Anakin is no longer a Padawan and now has a Padawan of his own. Excuse me? The story doesn't even deal with the issue of facing the trials or being promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight. Again, it just sort of happens overnight. Thirdly, Grievous comes right out (in the TV series, not the feature) with no real exposition. Asajj Ventress is in the feature, and has had prior run ins with Anakin and Obi Wan, based on the dialogue exchange in the film. When did this happen? As far as I'm concerned, the cartoon micro-series from 2003/2005 was superior in taking it's time with logical plot / character development, especially season 2 which led directly into Episode III. By itself, though, this new clone wars is very entertaining and well done.
