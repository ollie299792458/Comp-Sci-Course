How could I not like a movie with this talented cast, especially Diane Keaton and the other talented actors who served up this unrealistic piece of fluff showing lives of the seemingly over privileged? Notwithstanding the stereotypical Hollywood-of-old depiction, it was still somewhat entertaining despite making me wonder how all of these "average, every day folks" could be living such upscale lives (considering their clothing, cars, homes and environs), in view of their modest occupations. I don't recall if Keaton's was ever stated, but it was hard to believe that a young caterer, a psychologist, a music teacher, and all the other twenty-somethings could afford such lifestyles. For example, how many humble, single dad, music teachers could handle the cost of digs on the canals of L.A.'s Venice district, or the elaborately furnished loft of the young caterer? It reminded me of a cartoon I once saw as a child satirizing how Hollywood used to characterize the average American worker coming home to his humble, lavishly furnished mansion, and being greeted at the door by his faithful butler. Personally, I prefer the cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style of Woody Alan to the mythical glitz of Hollywood.
