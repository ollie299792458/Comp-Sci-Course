The Magnificent Ambersons, still in its 88-minute form is absolutely superb.  As a Welles-ophile, I placed his mane in a random search, and came up with this Warner Bros. spokesman on a live chat from some film website:

Question: Thanks first of all for the excellent catalogue 2-disc special editions we've been seeing. Now, what is the status on The Magnificent Ambersons?

[Warner] We're still looking for better materials on AMBERSONS. We waited for KONG and KANE and it was worth it. It will be worth it for the AMBERSONS, and yes,we will release JOURNEY INTO FEAR when we do AMBERSONS.

Thus, one of the great films of all time might just see home release after all.  I, personally would pay the extra for a single-edition now, and certainly still purchase the potential two-disc edition when it's released.  The fact of the matter is that Welles is finally receiving the notice and respect he always deserved.  I know any film fan hoped for a Criterion edition of Ambersons, but this new "Complete Mr. Arkadin" surely can rank as being greatly anticipated.  The fantastic critic Jonathan Rosenbaum is completing his "Discovering Orson Welles" right now, which should be just as delightful.  Surely Ambersons released in its original form would the be Coup de' gras for Welles lovers, and my personal anticipation combined with just a questionable little rumor allows for a great amount of excitment to stir.  Here's to hope!
