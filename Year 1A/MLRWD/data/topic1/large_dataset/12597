I had seen this movie several times on IFC. It is an AWESOME movie. My wife had also seen it previously and loved it. HOWEVER, we bought the DVD, and the entire beginning of the movie is MISSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They cut the beginning off when they sent it to DVD!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE %^$^&%$!!!!!

What you miss by not seeing the ACTUAL beginning of the movie is the death of David's dad, his mother being taken away, and the time he spent in the labor camp. You miss the part that really gives the show it's roots. Without it, the show is good. With it, the show is AMAZING. I cannot understand why the h*ll they cut out the beginning of the movie!!!!!!!!!!????????????? How very frustrating!!!!!

 If you have seen the DVD version and it didn't have all of the labor camp issues at the biggining (going by memory, about 30 minutes worth), you need to find one that wasn't hacked to death for DVD, or set your DVR to record it. If you liked the movie as-is, then you will most likely LOVE it when you see it in its entirety. It is so much more touching when you see everything that took place, not just bits and pieces of memories that they show throughout this version.
