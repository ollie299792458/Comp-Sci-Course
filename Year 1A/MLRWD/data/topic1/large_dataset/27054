From the previews you would expect the majority of this movie to be based around suspense & horror. As usual, the previews are misleading. The majority of the movie follows a couple who have moved back to the wife's hometown for a short while. The wife is now a famous actress married to a well known writer. They then hire the wife's ex-boyfriend & group of redneck friends to repair storm damage done to the barn roof. The town is small, southern, loves their high school football, everyone knows everyone & there seems to be only one cop in town. Most of the movie spends its time building towards the ending & allowing you to get to know the characters which is important. If you don't understand the dynamic between the characters, the end will make little sense. Finally we come to the ending, this is where the suspense, horror & action begins. It doesn't last very long but it does end the movie with a bang. I have not seen the original version of this movie so I can't compare it. Overall, it was an interesting psychological thriller. For fans of Alexander Skarsg√•rd, you won't be disappointed. He plays the typical bad boy and the part was perfect for him! Overall, glad I didn't go see it in the theater but worth watching.
