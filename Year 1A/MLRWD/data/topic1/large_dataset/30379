I was expecting this movie to be like Barber Shop. Boy, I was wrong! I didn't even enjoy the movie and told a friend of mine to think twice about going to see it. The movie is so sexist that it's not even funny. The men, especially Black men,  were portrayed negatively througout the movie. There was not one single decent Black man. Not ONE. They were shown as liars,  control freaks, cheaters, ex-cons, down lows,  sissies, abusers, as well as disrespectful. Outside of the barber shop there was always this same group of thuggish Black men chilling on the sidewalk day in and day out. Didn't any of them have jobs? Gina's love interest, Joe, wasn't even portrayed in a positive light. Yeah, he was buff and into the arts and stuff, but he was effiminate, too much of a softy. The women, on the other hand,  were shown too much as being strong, desirable, industrious,  independent achievers. Yeah, sure.

And  you can't forget the racism. Lynn (the white stylist) gets no love or respect from the black hair stylists.  Why? Simply because she's being herself. To get them to respect her, she has to  style her hair in those hideous extraterrestrial weave styles, twist her neck, finger snap, and be sassy. Nonsense like this happens all the time among younger Blacks.. If you want to prove how Black you are, all you gotta do is speak in slang all the time, listen to rap/hip-hop, wear cornrows, wear your pants hanging off your butt if your a guy, prance around half-naked and shake your behind if you're a woman, and blame the White man for everything.  I'll pass on that, thank you very much.

Anyway, this movie reeked and it was worse than "Waiting to Exhale." It's full of nonsense, too predictable,  and it puts bad ideas into women's heads. I can't support Black movies if they're going to be dumb like "Beauty Shop." The only message this movie gives is that good things always happen and all of your problems will be solved-- if you're in  Hollywood.
