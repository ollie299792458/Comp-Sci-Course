I freely admit that I attended this film in the theatre with some rather low expectations - such as that it would serve only as brain- and eye-candy.  Instead, what I got was a swashbuckling adventure tale the likes of which has not been seen since Errol Flynn.  Antonio Banderas is the likeable bandit who is chosen by Anthony Hopkins (seen here as the "original" Zorro, met by Banderas' character as a little boy) to serve as his replacement.  Catherine Zeta-Jones absolutely sizzles as the romantic female lead (the "original" Zorro's daughter, kidnapped as a baby and reared by her father's sworn enemy) - a strong, intelligent woman who knows her way around both sword and bullship.  The chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Banderas is wonderful to watch.  We see Banderas' Zorro grow as a swordsman, moving from "The pointy end goes into the other fellow" to a rather skilled fencer (Banderas was taking fencing lessons during the filming, so what the audience sees is an accurate view of his skills).  We see Hopkins' de la Vega work through his own issues of hatred.  This is a brilliant, gripping adventure film.  Not to be missed.
