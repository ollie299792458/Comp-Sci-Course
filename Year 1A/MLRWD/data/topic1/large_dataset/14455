"Merlin" with Sam Neill comes close, but in the end it's "The 10th Kingdom" that takes the prize.
This is due in part to Simon Moore's excellent script.  Although it's more than 400 minutes long, never once does "The 10th Kingdom" get boring or lag in anyway.  The bit near the end with the singing magic mushrooms is funny beyond all reason.
And this is also due in part to the superb acting.  Rutger Hauer is chilling as the predatory Huntsman, while Dianne West is ice cold as The Queen.  Ed O'Neill brings just the right mix of evil and idiocy to his role of Relish the Troll King, while Hugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett are hilarious as his children Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell.  Daniel Lapaine is very good as both Prince Wendell and the canine impostor, Kimberly Williams gives a great performance as Virginia Lewis, and Scott Cohen almost steals the show as Wolf.
The one who DOES steal the show--at least, to me anyway--was John Larroquette as Tony Lewis.  His sarcastic asides and continual flipping between optimism and pessimism make him possibly the best realized character, and John Larroquette does a magnificent job portraying him.
All in all, I HIGHLY recommend "The 10th Kingdom."  Just be sure to make plenty of time, because once you start, you won't want to stop.
