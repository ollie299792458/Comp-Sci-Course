Endless Eight is indeed a masterpiece.  I noticed the same things our fellow reviewer did: how the creators played around with the different iterations of the loop.  It's particularly awesome how they play with the repetitions for the sake of humor.  Sometimes the characters assume convoluted poses for the sake of being dramatic and deliver their lines differently for each episode.  On one of the last episodes of Endless Eight, Asahina Mikuru even unintelligibly babbles her lines at one point, clearly playing with the fact that we will know what she's saying even if we do not understand it.

I will admit that Endless Eight is one of those things where people either "get it" or "don't get it".  It is true that the same resources invested in Endless Eight could have been used for other purposes.  However, the same people that cry over Endless Eight are the same people that complain about lack of innovation in anime.  Yet once innovative storytelling and character development hit them squarely in the face, they go on a rampage about how the creators didn't respect fans' insatiable desire for clich&eacute;s.

What Kyoto animation has achieved with the Endless Eight arc (as they also did with the non-chronological airing of the first season) is an anime series that constantly defies expectations and surprises you in countless ways, shattering conventions and shunning clich&eacute;s.  I know another series that did that.  Maybe other people have heard of it?  It's called Evangelion.

Aside from Endless Eight, this season includes the animated adaptation of the novel "The Sigh of Suzumiya Haruhi" (available in English from Little Brown Press).  I had read the novel before watching the adaptation, and I can say the adaptation is amazing.  The climax of the story is a showcase of storyboarding and art directing genius that elevates the original scene from the novel to a truly awe-inspiring moment.

Fully recommended 5/5.
