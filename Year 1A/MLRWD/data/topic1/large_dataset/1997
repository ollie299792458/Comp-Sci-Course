Rare is a movie that completely holds your attention for 2 1/2 hours but Sleepers is that movie.  Played out by an exceptional ensemble cast (Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Renfro), it tells the tale of four young Hell's Kitchen boys who after pulling a seamingly harmless prank, are sent to a juvenile facility where they face unspeakable horrors at the hands of ther wardens.  This trauma follows 2 of the boys into adulthood where they enter a life of crime. When they take their revenge on a particularly sadistic guard, it's up to the other boys, along with a childhood gal pal and a loving priest to save them. Every performance in this movie makes an indelible impression but the standouts are Deniro as Father Bobby, Frank Medrano as neighborhhod shopowner Fatman, Minnie Driver as Carol and Geoffrey Wigdor as young John.  I watch this movie every November(it feels like a Fall time movie) and it never fails to amaze me.  It is tense, heartwrenching, touching and at times funny.  However the final 5 minutes always hit me where it hurts.  When I think of how those kids were robbed of a normal life it sickens me.  Sleepers is a phenomenal film that will leave a deep impression.
