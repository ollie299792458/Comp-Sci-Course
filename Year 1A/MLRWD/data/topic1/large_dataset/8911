I thought this was an excellent movie especially with it being an older one.  Usually I look at old horror movies like this one as being boring and lacking good technical effects.  This movie is really interesting though and I love the characters in it and the good cinematography.
  While some parts are cheesy (when they keep on doing close-ups of the faces, or the old lady with the annoying voice) most of the movie does a good job of being funny when it's supposed to be, and being serious when it should be serious.  The filmmaker has done a good job also with the special effects of the machine (at the end) and with the lighting all throughout the movie.  I thought the part with the blind man was really excellent with portraying emotions because it made me feel really sad for both Frankenstein and the man.
  I am usually against horror movies, but this is definitely one of the best that I've seen because it combines laughter, horror, and emotions all into one movie. It was an overall great movie.
