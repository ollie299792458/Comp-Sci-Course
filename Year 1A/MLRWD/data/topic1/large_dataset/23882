I'm not a golfer, nor am I a huge hockey fan.  Truth be told, I'm not really all that big into Adam Sandler.  But I love this movie!!  It's a comic masterpiece that combines satire with sarcastic humor and the occasional "cheap shot" giggle.

Sandler plays a hockey star wannabe whose Grandma is being harrassed by the IRS.  After ten years of not paying her taxes because she "had no money", her house is being repossessed as well as all her belongings.  Sandler, who works as a construction worker and tries out for hockey teams in his spare time, jumps in to save her.  But, being down and out himself, he finds he must make money (over $250,000) FAST.

Sandler can hardly stand on skates and hockey really isn't his bag, no matter how badly he wishes it was.  But he has a wicked shot...which he uses on the golf course to get into a competition which will allow the winner to join the PGA.

The story progresses from there.  The parts that really caught my attention were Happy's fiery temper.  He is most hilarious when he's poetically insulting fellow golfers ("why don't I just go make some things out of clay or eat some hay...I just may") or beating the snot out of inanimate objects ("you're gonna DIE clown!") or having the snot beat out of HIM by gameshow hosts.

This movie has all the ingredients of a typical 90s Gen X comedy -- a love story, cheer for the underdog, wacky humor.  I think even teens of today will enjoy its humor, and this movie, although some of the language and humor is suggestive, is lacking nudity and gross violence.  So I think it's safe for most families.  Enjoy!!!
