As a kid, I considered Tasmania about as far from home as I could get if I wanted to run away. Decades later, this movie pretty much confirmed that notion - at least in terms of the island's incredible moonscape geography and musical spoken language. Small town bigotry and violence, however, are not far. These miseries appear to be the same everywhere and ultimately do more damage to everything in their purview than a gun.
The Hunter won't win any big awards, but it was well written and acted, beautifully photographed, conceived as both gloriously beautiful and downright creepy in feel. The score was a bit over the top, and (SPOILER) the sought-after animal was indeed killed which surprised me, but the hunter was right: if he were to have left it alive, others would come after it.
So we suspend disbelief that the Tasmanian Tiger was the absolute last of its kind, mourn the deaths of all who died in greedy quest of its DNA, and either find the movie slow and boring or enjoy the acting, cinematography, and story. I'm of the latter mind.
