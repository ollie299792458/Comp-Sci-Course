The story and action was actually amusing and it could have been a great family flick... however certain violent aspects left this film a rent only and non purchase item for our family. For about the same reason Speed Racer won't ever come home with us- unneccesary violence. Children and adults alike could have enjoyed this film without several parts that almost left me thinking.. huh.. "is this a Saw movie for school age kids?" One website even wrote "Think of it as Harry Potter meets Percy Jackson meets Twilight meets Independence Day meets The X-Files meets World Wrestling Entertainment." -Reviewer Paul Asay. If only they would have taken the bits out that pushed it over the edge with the violence such as the beginning scene and the part where the evil alien tortures the human in a way.. I'll again say is fit for Saw like movies. Also where the janitor is missing and a pool of blood is being pushed around by his floor buffer/waxer/mop thing. Subtle hints are all we need to get the point of the story movie guys.. really... look at Spider Man.. it's rated PG-13 and most of it my two year old and 8 year old could watch without me worrying a bit. Number four on the other hand I'd have to edit and cover eyes and sit diligently so they don't wake up with nightmares.... it's really too bad.. other than the gruesome-ness.. it was cute.
