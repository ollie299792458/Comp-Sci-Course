Disclaimer: I loved Mamma Mia!

I was excited about this movie based on the music/era alone. I wasn't disappointed.

It's silly, funny, ridiculous, over-the-top, and goofy. And it's an absolute blast.

I was incredibly skeptical of Tom Cruise in this movie. But you know what? He.Was.Awesome. Made the movie for me (along with Hey Man LOL)

Can you believe I didn't know Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were in it? Both of them were terrific as well, and did not disappoint.

I'm not overly familiar with Julianne Hough, outside of the Footloose remake, and I've never heard of Diego Boneta, but he was cute and I thought he did a good job.

I really liked this movie, so much so that I went back a week+ later and saw it again. I can't wait to buy it, so hurry up and release it, New Line Cinema!

Don't go into this expecting Oscar-worthy performances; you'll be disappointed. But if you go expecting fun and laughs? You're good. People need to chill out and not think every movie should be some life-changing experience. Sometimes stuff can be so bad it's great, and this is one of those things. Love it!
