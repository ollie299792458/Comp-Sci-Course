It has been two years and many movies since this movie came out, but I keep coming back to Far from Heaven as a movie of substance and very fine acting. The story itself is static and engaging; the multi-dimensional story keeps one's interest and engages the emotions meaningfully.

One story line is Dennis Quaid's character's emerging homosexuality and its effect on his wife, himself, and their marriage.Another aspect is His wife's (Julianne Moore) relationship with their gardener (Dennis Haysbert). Racial prejudice and tension are laced throughout the film; racist violence erupts when a few schoolboys hurt the gardener's young daughter, taunting her about her daddy's "white girlfriend." Moore's and Haysbert's characters innocently begin a casual relationship which begins to blossom into deeper feeling; this is where the movie soared, the characters beautifully and effectively conveying that the heart is color blind. I loved watching Miss Moore's character, especially, as she was a fine person with a pure heart, and it was refreshing to experience that innocence and goodness.

The ending wasn't happy, but it was realistic. Whatever relationship the two main characters had or wanted to have, was constrained by the social mores of the times, by the limitations society put on interactions between the races, spec., between blacks and whites, even in New England, where the story takes place. Miss Moore's character watches the gardener leave on a traIn at the end, and her expression at their farewell is a magnificent piece of acting, speaking volumes without a word being uttered.

This movie truly moved me and was thought provoking, with well-drawn, complex characters. Adult language and situations existed but were kept to a minimum, thus (for me) enabling the story to develop well without these kinds of distractions.
