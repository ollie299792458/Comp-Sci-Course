This one was on television when I was just eight or ten years old. I haven't seen it in a long time but I can still remember nearly scene. It starts off with Boris, introducing himself and telling me about Ghosts  sitting next to me in the cinema.(Why not?) Then "Wurdelak"  begins, a classic vampire tale, settled in eastern Europe ( I think so  because the name "Wurdelak" comes from there ). It has a great  atmosphere and the design and the photography are all wonderful. "The  Waterdrop" is a Ghost Story about a Nurse that got the bad idea of  stealing a ring from the corpse of a dead Spiritualist. I had nightmares  for the next half year - and now I got some questions: who's the person  that created the mask on the dead woman's face ? why hasn't he won an oscar  for one of the scariest designs ever? who can tell me this? However, this  one really got me hiding under my bed. "The Telephone" is why I  haven't rated this one with 5 stars. It isn't as scary and creepy as the  two others, maybe they should have started the movie with this story. It  isn't about ghosts, there aren't any supernatural beings in there, it could  have been on "X-Factor" or something like that. Anyway, If you  dig Horror Movies than check it out - really good stuff.
