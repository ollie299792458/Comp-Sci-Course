First off, Clive...what can I say?  His acting is ALWAYS top notch and extremely believable. I have followed and collected ALL of his works including his various BBC Television series, UK films, the US releases and even have added The Hire short films in my collection. He acts with every fiber of his being and has the ability to draw you in using all 5 of your senses.  Brilliant and highly underated British actor!

There are a few questions I truly expected to have answered that weren't and that is the only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars.  However, the storyline is VERY fast-paced, rich and multi-dimensional and makes you ponder just how close we are to the fictional representation of society we see on the screen.

Man is self-destructing on many levels i.e. socially, economically, emotionally, physically and spiritually. I think this film covers all areas and hits you hard in making you consider YOUR individual contribution to society's demise.

I think the marketing and comparisons to heavy sci-fi thrillers such as Blade Runner is sorely misleading and may have contributed to some  viewer's disappointment.  This movie is more social commentary thriller than sci-fi action/thriller with a subtle message thrown in. This is in your face and makes you brainstorm the possible causes that resulted in the infertility of mankind to produce innocence literally and metaphorically.
