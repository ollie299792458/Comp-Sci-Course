I did not find any real flaws with the quality of the video.  It streamed very well.  I have been very pleased with all of my Amazon Video on Demand purchases.  It is cool to be able to watch retro TV in a new format.  It looks very good considering the age of the footage.  If you are a real Dallas fan and you want to know all of the facts as you follow the new Dallas series, this is a season that you won't want to miss.  This season is a pivotal point in the series.  Jock Ewing (played by the late Jim Davis) does not return during this season.  The story reveals how the writers take him out of the show.  In the show, they keep him alive up until Episode 13 in January 1982 by allowing the viewers to believe that he is doing work for the government in South America.  Sadly, it was due to the real life death of Jim Davis (April 26, 1981).  Out of respect for Davis, they allowed the character to die with him instead of replacing him.  The whole dynamic of the show begins to change as a result.  It is still a great show; however, you never see the show the same after that point.  The entire series just seems to build on the storyline as it progresses.  Of course it has a few hits and misses like everything else, but overall it is a great watch.  You won't regret your purchase if you were a former Dallas fan or if you are just getting started with the new Dallas series!  Either way, you will definitely get your money's worth here!  :)
