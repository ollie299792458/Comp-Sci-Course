My son had very little interest in potty training and he would run away and hide whenever you asked him if he wanted to go potty. Since stickers, m&m's and ice promises of ice cream weren't enought to motivate him I thought I'd give a DVD a try. Boy am I glad I did!! My son immediately asked to watch it again once he saw it, and by the third time was dancing and singing along and responding to the narrator. He loves the Baby or Big Kid game and I think that is what really made him want to give the potty a try. I saw that some reviewers were concerned with the princess skit at the end of the show but was just as interested as the rest of the show. Remember, kids this age don't look at gender specific things quite the same way we adults do. And, the results can't be beat!!I am proud to say that after one week of watch the DVD we are now on day 3 of no diapers and going strong!! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it does not encourage the kids to tell their parents when they have to go potty and since he still needs help with his pants this is important. But, we've addressed it together and so far is not an issue.
