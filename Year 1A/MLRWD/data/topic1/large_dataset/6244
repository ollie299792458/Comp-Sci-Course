This is the first time I have tried ellen Barratts workouts and I have to say I have been very surprised at how much I love it.  I have been exercising to Turbo Jam and Joyce Vedral but I was finding that I wasnt feeling anything but tired after the workouts.  Surprisingly I felt muscle ache the next day and that I had really had a great workout.  I love the flow and elegance plus the fact that they are barefoot.  The music I loved as it seemed quite soothing and different to anything I had worked out to before.  I really worked up a sweat and was drenched so dont be fooled into thinking this is easy for those off days when you dont want to work too hard.  Ont the other hand this is not going to kill you and you will be able to go about your day without feeling worn out like I do with turbo jam and turbo fire.  I have been working out since I was a teenager continually so I am in very good shape and have kept off the middle age weight gain because of this and happy to say that ellen Barratt is just great and will add a new dimension to your repetoire.  A much kinder gentler dimension.  Ellen has a great personality and is easy to listen to.  I highly recommend!
