Wow..."A League of Their Own" was by far the best movie I have ever seen.  For any softball player out there from child to adulthood there is something in this movie for you.  The casting was done very well with the comedy of Madonna and Geena Davis.  These women along with all the others showed the transition these women made and the trouble they went through to do the thing they loved.

In reflection of what was said prior on here I agree with the fact that there were many differences between the movie and the actual progression of Women's Professional Baseball League.  Even though they did stray somewhat from the actual series of events, they managed to capture what happened in a way that is enjoyable to watch yet gave a real sense of the sport.

Overall the movie is one that can not go without being seen.  Whether or not you are a softball player, a baseball fan, or nothing at all there is something in this movie for you.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever truly loved a sport.
