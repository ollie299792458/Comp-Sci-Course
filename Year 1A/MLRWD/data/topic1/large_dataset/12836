Smallville can get addicting if you watch it enough, but its hard to shake the dirty feeling it leaves you with.  You know its bad, even awful at times, but you want to see what happens anyway.  The fact that it doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out compels me to give it two stars, but that's pushing it.

So where to start?  For one, the entire production is cheesy without being self-aware, ala Buffy.  The acting is hamfisted by just about everyone, especially Lana, whom I want to take a baseball bat to every time I hear her whine about how Clark won't be honest with her.  At least she tries though.  What Clark does can't even qualify as acting.  This man makes Keanu Reeves look expressive.  He flits from scene to scene with a blank look on his face halfheartedly delivering generic lines.  His emotional scenes showcase his especially sad deer-in-the-headlights look, like some big dumb baby that not sure how its supposed to act, and can only manage a confused, vaguely constipated expression.

If all the episodes seem similar, thats because they are.  Every one starts out with some new misterious baddie getting superpowers from evil kryptonite/evil corporate research/evil mystical powers which he inevitably uses for evil.  He causes just enough havoc to force Clark to heroicly save the day.  Then the episode ends with some sickeningly saccharine emotional scene in the barn where Clark's family pats him on the head and says what a good boy he is.  Like I said earlier, it makes you feel dirty just watching it.
