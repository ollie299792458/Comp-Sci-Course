One of the most vivid and wonderful memories of my childhood, I first went to see The Red Balloon (1956) at the cinema as a ten year old boy in April, 1957. Over fifty years later, this morning, I received this Criterion / Janus DVD from amazon.com and it's worth every penny. Superbly and lovingly restored, obviously from the original negative, there isn't a mark on it anywhere and the image is crystal clear. We fans of The Red Balloon have been waiting for a release like this for years. I'd have said it looks like a new film, but no modern film has Technicolor as lovely as this.

Forget about that terrible quality Korean import DVD that people have had to put up with for so long. This is the version to go for and when you see it, you'll see just how wonderful the film looked originally to those 1950's cinema audiences of long ago. Pascal Lamorisse is totally enchanting. He reminds me of myself as a five or six years old boy and I can identify with him only too well. This is, without the slightest doubt, the best children's film of all time. It is totally beautiful and highly recommended. It is also very touching and may make you cry, no matter how young or old you are. Five Stars! David Rayner in Stoke-on-Trent, England, UK.
