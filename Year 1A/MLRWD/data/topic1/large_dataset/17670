Well, I purchased this item as a Christmas gift to myself and I must say this product is almost perfect. Item box is beautiful, well armed and solid, the details are amazing. The book quality paper, photos and additional stuff are simply breathtaking and incredible. The case of the 3 blurays is the correct way all these special editions must be, not foam, nor carton. I think that The Personal Journal of Charlton Heston is the synthesis of a master, the words of one of the best actors in the history and one of the best materials I've seen. Is amazing how this book or diary is given to the owner.

Why almost a perfect score?, well, I live in Mexico and is so sad that a huge item like this DOES NOT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL AUDIO FEATURE IN LATINO SPANISH. Once again, Amazon should specify that the dubbing in "spanish" is spanish from Spain, and this absolutely ruins the film if the viewer picks this language to watch the movie. However, the original audio in english is amazing, and that's the way to watch a movie, in its original language. That's why I think this item deserves almost a perfect score.

Thanks.
