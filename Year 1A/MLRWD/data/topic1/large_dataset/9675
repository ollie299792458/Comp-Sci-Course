Am I the only chosen one?  Com'on America stop lying, Ali's character was terrible, unconvincing, and downright unjustable to the greatest boxer of all time. The fight scenes which were supposed to be high points in the movie appeard to be low budget acting in addition to poor sound editing. The tough, straught, fearsom fighter I learned about growing up was portrayed as a 'milk it' fighter in the movie who wore his opponents out by lying on the ropes.  The only emotional times in the movie I found was Malcom X's parts.  Ordinary Van Peebles doesn't fit the character, but his truly great acting abilities become more convincing throughout the movie. I wanted to see if Van Peebles would shift the movie matter to Malcom X, and he perfectly did that with only two three sentence parts by using emotion.  When he was nervous about asking Ali to go to Africa, when he spoke about his frustrations about the girls in the church bombings(which I found an emotional high point in the movie, that Smith correctly misunderstands-more human nature between a boxer and a person of high muslim statute),when he began to be shut out of his religious community up to his assatination.  Its at that point you feel a sense of sick low and confusion for the rest of the movie.  Now, tell me about an Ali fight that we havn't seen.  Tell me something about this movie that we haven't known about for almost half a century.  Usually when we watch a very good documenarative movie, they usually show the traits that kept a person to be so great.  I read in a book a long time ago, that when Ali was little he had just missed his school bus, so he ran to school and beat the bus.  When did he start fighting?, what things made him the unordinary fighter or ordinary fighter before he became the greatest?  If I was Ali, I wouldn't have it.  But what ya gonna do, the deal was already done.
