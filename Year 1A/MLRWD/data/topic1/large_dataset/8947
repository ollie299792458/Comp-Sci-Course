Road to Perdition is a very good drama, documenting a father and son's six-week rampage across America, being chased by an assassin.
Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, hit man for an important businessman until his son witnesses him commit murder. Hanks is very well suited to this role, even if 'gangster' isn't a word you often associate him with in films. He is wonderfully heartless and unemotional, not flinching as he kills men in cold blood. Hanks manages to murder so many people on his own, even the Terminator would be jealous! It is a very good drama, combining your typical mafia movie with big-budget Hollywood quality, and coming out on top.
Now, why is it the modern Godfather you ask? Characters and their attitudes. Hanks' son is a character similar to that of Michael Corleone in the Godfather, the child who didn't want a life of crime, but is forced into one. As with Michael, he finds that this life is his destiny and becomes on eof the best in the business. Hanks is brilliant in a role he deserved an Oscar nomination for, playing the Vito Corleone-like mentor teaching his son the ways of the mobster. He is convincing in this manner, showing that this life was the one he chose, but hadn't wanted for his children.
