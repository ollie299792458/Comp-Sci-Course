"Monsters Inc" is the most amazing movies I have ever seen (next to Shrek, GREAT MOVIE!).  It is both suited to the subtle adult humor as well as child oriented slapstick.  The characters are both very identifiable as well as limited by human like conditions.  Thus the audience can feel empathy for the Mike and Sully despite the fact that one is covered in blue hair and the other is a Cyclopes.
  The plot is the movie is well developed for both the ADD attention span of today's youths and adults.  There is plenty of action for the youngsters, while also having more than enough non-clich&eacute; meat for the adults to chew on.
  "Monsters Inc" also both all its viewers to remember what it was like to be a child; to wonder what hiding in the closet and what lurks under the bed.  The writers and Pixar effectively play off this instinct and build it into a fanciful world where the roles are switched and monsters are scared of humans.
  Though the implications of some scene might slightly be pushing the bar on PG, this movie is suitable for every age group: kids, teens, young adults, adults, and older folk.
  I give it an A+, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I think every American home deserves a copy of this fine Hollywood flick.  Get it today!
