"King of Texas" was based upon the play King Lear written by one of the world's best-known playwrights, Shakespeare. This movie was at it's best placed within a more "modern" setting compared to plays, pre-Christianity days. Taking place in Texas, the movie begins by the Lear family celebrating one of the few years Texas claimed its independence from the US. The story continues with introducing such familiar characters parallel to their counterparts such as the three sisters, Claudia (Cordelia), Rebecca (Regan), and Susanna (Goneril). The rancher Lear asks his daughters, as in the play, which one loves him the best, and as a reward each daughter is to receive a portion of his ranch. Needless to say, Rebecca and Susanna, the two daughters who least love their father, exaggerate their feelings toward him, where as Claudia, who truly loves her father, will not participate in their "games." She is turned out for this, leaving the two evil daughters to manipulate the situation even further for their own success. Of course, as in every Shakespearean play, everyone gets punished in the end for their wrong doings.
 Over all, I believed the movie to be very well written and performed and followed Shakespeare's play, King Lear almost exactly.
