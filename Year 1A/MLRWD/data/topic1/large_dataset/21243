Cradle Will Rock, released in 1999, is a film about finding a balance between art and politics, as well as artists fighting in what they believe is right.  Artists are influenced by issues in everyday life, which in this movie is dealing with unions, the government, and the Great Depression.  The film tried to show that even though we are all tempted by different types of prostitution or exploitation, we all can remain pure by standing in what we believe in and stand against the evil vices we encounter.  During a time of struggle, the artists in the movie (actors, painters, ventriloquists, etc.) stood up for what they believed in.  They spoke the truth of the corruption in politics and society.  This message is deep, yet I don't think the movie as a whole did a good job of tying it all together at the end to really portray this strong message.

Basically there were too many plots and sub plots interwoven in this film.  There isn't a main protagonist and you don't get to connect on a personal level with any of the characters because there are so many of them.  Also, this film is very confusing and hard to follow.  Not a must see hit.  It's a waste of 132 minutes.
