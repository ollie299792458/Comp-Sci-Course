If you love classic comedies, "Cannonball Run" is a must own, especially for all of the celebrities that take part in it.  But, don't get the 2001 release which is only in DD 2.0 and that annoying clipper case.  A brand-new 2009 DVD was released recently with 5.1 audio, superior picture and a fantastic audio commentary with director Hal Needham and producer Albert Ruddy.  You learn so many fun facts about the film from it.  For example, Burt and Dom's ambulance was a real race vehicle used by Hal and Brock Yates for one of the five real Cannonball Run races before the film was made where they raced it from Darion, Kentucky to Long Beach, California.  It held 90 gallons of gasoline and they would get up to 145 MPH at times.  A lot of the situations and characters in the movie were based on real events and people from the races.  Burt, Dom, Jack Elam and Farrah's characters were all based on Hal and Brock, and a doctor and his wife that road with them during a race to make it seem like a legit ambulance if pulled over.  One of the best audio commentaries I've heard in awhile and very funny.  If you just want the commentary by itself, write me and I'll share it.  Don't miss this movie if you have never seen it.
