I have never liked Yoga.  I am Type A and would rather go for a run than do useless breathing and twisting my body into a pencil. I have hated each and every yoga class I have ever tried. But, with too much stress in my life (and tight muscles from said running), I decided to try this DVD. I love Bethenny's sense of humor and if I have to do it, let me do it with her.

I have to say, I love it! It's easy, beginners yoga (with subtitles to explain the name and what good the position does for you e.g. tones butt, thigh-burner) and Bethenny makes it doable.  It's as though she says everything I am thinking in my head (e.g. when I wish I were done, she is complaining about it too!! Almost as if one of my friends were there with me!)

And what really has sold me is that by doing this 2-3 times a week, I am seeing results. And..I am feeling more relaxed and my muscles are a little less tight. I have made it a point to get up early and do this tape to keep me in a calm state throughout my hectic work day (and previously nothing has ever gotten me out of bed earlier than necessary.)

So for me, a hater of all things yoga, to be a fan it's because of the easy, results-driven workout and Bethenny's commentary! My only question is...when is she going to put out another one?!!
