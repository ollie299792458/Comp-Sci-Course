What more can be said about this groundbreaking, controversial series? All In The Family evolved into one of TV's most successful series, and rightfully so.
During the first season, it is clear that Jean Stapleton's character, Edith, was not as developed as the others. Toward the end of the first season, however, Stapleton had turned Edith into the vibrant character that continued for the duration.
It is great to have an entire season, in chronological order, on one reasonably priced DVD set. Years ago, I purchased VHS tapes of the show, which grouped shows together by topic. As many other reviewers have noted, there is no extra material on these DVD's, and that is disappointing. I hope this changes when the second season is released! It would be great to see some outtakes!!!
Picture quality and sound are very good, although not outstanding. There really is not much difference between the DVD and VHS quality; however the DVD's undoubtedly will last longer, take less storage space, and are economical!
