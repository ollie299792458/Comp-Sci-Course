I liked this nineteenth Bond flick which had a good cast- Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Dame Judie Dench, the late, great Desmond Llewelyn, John Cleese, and Robbie Coltrane.  But the list stops there.  Why, oh why did they pick Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist of all  things!  She even challenges Talisa Soto(LICENSE TO KILL)as worst Bond  girl.  I would have liked to have seen Denise and Sophie exchange roles.  Then they would have been much better suited for each other.
The opening  sequence involving the boat chase was excellent!, as was the introduction  to "R".  As Skiing sequences go in Bond movies, this one was OK,  but my fave is still where this film gets its title- ON HER MAJESTY'S  SECRET SERVICE.
I was glad to see Coltrane back- and loved the leg joke  he did on Bond later on!  Carlyle turned out a good performance too, but  wasn't in the movie as much as I thought he would be.  he turned out to be  more of a pawn to Elektra.
The BMW seemed to be there just for show this  time, and was only used once for gadgets, which is, lets face it, what we  want to see.
As for the DVD extras, I liked the explanations of the  stunts, similar to the "Follow the white rabbit" on The Matrix  DVD, and the Making of TWINE could have been a little longer, IMHO.  The  other Makings of... were much better made.  Anything by Shirley Manson and  garbage is always welcome by me!  Two things- One is no English  subtitles(same as on the majority of The James Bond Gift Set 2).  This gets  to me because when I have the commentary option on, I like to know what's  going on in the movie, and subtitles is the only way.  Secondly- as it is  with all Bond DVDs, there are no bios on the main characters.  I think this  would make a great addition.
All in all, a great film, but we shall miss  you, Desmond...
