There's not much I can add to the previous reviews except to agree with the strong recommendations to buy this historic Blu-Ray.  I was raised on le Sacre (would ask my mother to play the "dinosaur sequence" that I knew from Fantasia) and then later discovered the rich power and beauty of the Firebird suite.  The complete Firebird Ballet compared to the suite seemed to be loaded with filler music of limited interest. Now with the entire work displayed as a driver for the dance, it all comes completely alive and I will no longer be satisfied with the suite alone.  The choreography to the Rite of Spring appears tame today after so many decades of modern dance have gone under the bridge but as a historic document this achievement is monumental.  This version of Le Sacre is stellar, perhaps I have never heard it sound so ominous and menacing.  Oddly, I still believe that Disney, despite raping the score, developed a powerful set of visual images that can be appreciated for helping new generations get in touch with this remarkable music.  One small quibble about the filming; occasional clips are too close and hence confusing, Fred Astaire was a master at keeping the camera still and just far enough away to let the dancers show all their movements in a coherent perspective.
