It's about time that this show about time was released on DVD! It was critically acclaimed during its run and it quickly became a fan favorite. It had everything, including a fascinating premise, wonderful writing, great scores, terrific performances by its 'regular' cast (Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell) as well as by the weekly guests. In fact, some early performances by some who became 'names' can be found in various episodes (Teri Hatcher guests in 'Star Crossed' and Jason Priestley in 'Camikazi Kid', just two of the episodes in this set). Performances by folks like Jennifer Aniston and a host of others can be viewed in future sets (which hopefully will be available sooner rather than later!). 
Fortunately, the set allows everyone to once again view the episodes, not only in their entirety (unlike the syndicut versions that have been shown on various cable stations over the years), but with the original opening narrations and graphics. Boy, do they deliver!
The 20 minute 'Kiss with History' interview with Scott Bakula, Dean Stockwell and Don Bellisario is both amusing and informative and a definite 'don't miss'. Of course, more behind the scenes extras such as bloopers, full episode commentary or more interviews (Deborah Pratt would probably be a wonderful source for great stories!) would have fit the bill but one can only hope that we'll get to see more in future sets.
Be advised, that although the box claims that the sound is monoaural, it most definitely is stereo.
While some may balk at the pricing, when you consider the cost per episode, it's more than worth it. Besides, who doesn't purchase from a store with the sale circular from another store in hand not only to get the better price, but a refund on the difference as well!!
