If you're reading through reviews on the Amazon product page, you are probably familiar with the riotously funny sitcom Modern Family.  The show has been discussed and lauded by more eloquent souls than I, but I would like to comment on the quality of the Blu-Ray, for those interested.

Modern Family was filmed using very high quality cameras in the 16:9 aspect ratio which lends intself perfectly to a Blu-Ray transfer.  For a television show, the quality is simply stunning (for comparison's sake, it blows The Office: Season 5 out of the water).  Colors are very realistic and buck the trend of over-saturation while still offering plenty of "pop."  With few exceptions, detail is crisp and contrast is again excellent.  Audio quality and clarity is equally as impressive, although being an ensemble comedy, don't expect much from the rear channels.

The extra features consist of roughly 20-30 minutes (per disc, three discs total) of additional family interviews not aired in the episodes as well as some deleted scenes.  I would have liked one or more "making of" type interviews with the cast and crew, but the included extras will suffice.  Unfortunately, the quality of the deleted scenes varies wildly between each cut.  The video disparity is understandable and does not bother me, but the audio volume changes quite dramatically between one scene and the next, which is a bit annoying.

Despite any negative comments, what's most important about Blu-Ray is being able to enjoy great films and shows (like this one) in the highest quality possible and believe me when I say you will absolutely floored by the pristine picture offered by this transfer.  If you enjoy Modern Family, Season 1 on Blu-Ray is a must-have.
