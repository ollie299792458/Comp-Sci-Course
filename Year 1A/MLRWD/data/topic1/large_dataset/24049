I was fortunate enough to catch the free screening of tarnation when Jonathan Caouette was the judge of the Ann Arbor Film Festival in Michigan. I was completely blown away by the film. Tarnation is the first film that I have ever seen where I truly felt i was watching someone's life unfold on screen.Tarnation is not simply the true story of a son's undying love for his mentally damaged mother, but it is a invitation into the life and history of Jonathan. Tarnation allows the audience to follow the film makers real life through the filmmakers eyes, from childhood to adulthood. The experience was additionally amazing considering Jonathan Caouette held a long question and answer session after the film, giving us an even deeper look into his life and his creation. I was at times disturbed and at other times touched while watching the film. Yet, the film was completely captavating from start to finish. Also, the music selection is great, and the more or less avant garde editing style simply adds to the original and mesmorizing nature of the film. I highly recommend Tarnation
