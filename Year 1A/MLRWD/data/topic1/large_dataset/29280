The Grudge is quite a creepy little thriller. As I prgressed into this movie, I thought it would be a decent movie. The opening was totally unexpected and you'll ask yourself "why". Sooner in this movie you will find the answers to the beginning. But later on you will find yourself asking more questions, than getting answers. The film is quite confusing and you have to pay close attention. The movie switches from the past to the present without you noticing it at times. Its a very tricky little film. Also pay close to little details you may notice they will help you understand the ending better. This is a film that should be watched twice. After I walked out of the theather, I was questioning myself. I did not understand the film, neither did my friends. Later on, I thought about the film again and thought I pretty much understood it now. Then when it came out on DVD, I bought it and watched it again. After I watched it the 2nd time, I fully understood it. I realized I missed things from the 1st time I watched it. So if you wanna figure out the mystery to this film, you got to pay close attention to it. Overall, it was pretty creepy, but not quite scary.
