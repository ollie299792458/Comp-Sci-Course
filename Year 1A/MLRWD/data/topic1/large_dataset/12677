HBO was a huge treat for us kids back in the 80's.  I used to watch this version of Jack & the Beanstalk all the time (I also loved watching The Pirate Movie, among many others).  The animation was fun, the storyline was both fun and trippy, and I loved the music.  I just watched it last night and all those great memories came flooding back.  My favorite parts? 1. When the vine grows and grows 2. The dreariness of the castle that fit perfectly with its takeover by Hecuba 3. Jack's song and dance when he brings home some of the riches he has found 4. The harps retelling of how Hecuba drained the life out of the kingdom 5. Hecuba cutting out the guests for the wedding and last but not least, when light finally lit the kingdom all over again.  I did cringe when Jack was being beaten with the broom by his mom though...I had forgotten that part.  All in all, a great entertainment feast for all. Some scenes might be too scary for youngsters but if they're playing today's video games, they can handle this.  Nostalgia is what made me search and search for this movie and it gleefully made me a tween again!
