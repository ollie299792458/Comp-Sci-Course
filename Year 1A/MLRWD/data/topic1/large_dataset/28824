Comparisons to "The Name of the Rose" are inevitable, and for my part, this movie falls just below "Rose". Still, I would recommend this movie for anyone interested in moving beyond the typical exploding car movie and/or the inane stories that pass for romantic comedies these days.

I very much enjoyed the acting and some of the scenes felt like they were shot with a handcam, giving one the feel of "real life" coverage. (Alas that there was something about these scenes that made me pay more attention to the cinemaphotgraphy and less to the story ...).

Previous reviewer's comments about anachronistic languages and/or customs are accurate, but I doubt that there has been a movie made in the past 20 years that would completely pass the non-anachronistic test (if nothing else, one would claim that the language of the script wasn't period ... and if a movie DID use period language, then people would complain that they couldn't understand it! All of which places directors in a rather lose/lose scenario...)

All in all, a good movie.
