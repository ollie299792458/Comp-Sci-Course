I saw this movie in 1978 with my brother(He took me)at the South Park Drive In.If the murders depicted in this movie were to take place in REAL LIFE it would be HORRIBLE.Thankfully they just happen in the movie Not in Real life.This movie is condemned because of the nail gun murder scene,but if you watch the interview with Kelly Nichols(The nail gun vctim),she and Cameron Mitchell had a good time filming the sequence.While this picture is no OSCAR contender,the acting of Pamelyn Ferdin as a teenager(She was 19 in real life)bound and gagged by Cameron Mitchell's character is very realistic for the situation her character was in.I have to say courtesy of this movie I admire Pamelyn Ferdin as an actress and as an animal rights activist.I looked up her website.For a laugh watch the scene where Cameron Mitchell brings dinner and a lollipop to Pamelyn Ferdin.LO,double L I POP spells lollipop.I gave this movie 5 stars but A MAKING OF"THE TOOLBOX MURDERS"and A Behind the scenes look at THE TOOLBOX MURDERS"would have been nice.Watch for Anetea Corsaut(Helen Crump on Andy Griffith)as Pamela's Mother.I suggest to watch the Kelly Nichols interview,to help you NOT TO TAKE this movie seriously,her talk is amusing and she had a GOOD time filming her demise with a nail gun.
