RED DAWN illustrious protrays what could of happened had Russia attcaked during the Cold War.  This movie is tangible in that Russia could have joined forces with Cuba to attack the U.S. but the fact that a group of tennagers leading a gurrela type warfare is unbelievable.  The cast which includes future big screen movie stars are Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Gray.  Sheen, Thompson, and Gray make-up part of the lackadaisial gurrela group who nickname themselves the Wolverines.  The group is led by Swayzw, who does a proficient job at leading them.  Though the acting is suppressed in some scenes, especially towards the end, it is rejuvenated during the battle scenes and emotionl ones.  The plot of the movie shows how the Wolverines fight back to quell the enemines, though they are sizable smaller than the behemoth invadiers.  The allusions made in the movie about Afghanistan give comparsion to present day Iraq.  Even with its outdated special effects the full extent of scenes are not tarnished and get the point across.  Overall it is a decent movie and is great for any war buff so I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.
