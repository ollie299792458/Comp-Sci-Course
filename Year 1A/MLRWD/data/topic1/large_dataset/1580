You have to dig deep in the reviews previous to this to discover any with significant quibbles with MOTHER AND CHILD. Most mention the acting, which I agree is quite suitable for the film and story. At one point, within perhaps 10 seconds, Annette Bening's face undergoes a gamut of emotions like nothing I have ever seen -- all of which were taken from some deep place within. I've enjoyed Bening before, but never to the degree I did in this film. Naomi Watts was quite amazing as well. I was struck by the similarities of this particular mother and child, despite their never having had a chance to actually interact. One thing I believe is missing from most of the other reviews is the extreme intelligence of the script. Rodrigo Garcia deserves much praise for writing a story which is dead on for the emotions needed. He is a good example of what any scenarist/director should aim for. Near the end of the film (no spoiler, so read on), Bening gives a little mirthful laugh which seems quite out of context. When it is revealed what the laugh is about, and the subtle yet direct way in that revealing--well wow, what a moment! Yes, the film is luminous.
