This is another 1960's film designed to subvert american values

and culture.  Liberals, most notibly Warren Beatty, were

involved in the production of it.  The message of the film is

that crime and violence against society is a great lifestyle.

Criminals are heroic figures while the police are an evil force

out to stop the "fun" of young people.

Liberals made films like this in the 1960s as part of an assault

by media on the foundations of freedom.  Their attempts to build

communism had largely failed after the death of the socialist

Franklin Roosevelt.  And after the movement collapsed in the

1950s, many of them took to promoting drugs and crime among the

young.  The idea being that America could be prepared for

revolution if its young were turned into criminals running wild

rioting in the streets.  This film was the real inspiration for

criminals like the weather underground, the SLA, the

Baider-Meinhoff gang in germany and numerous red brigade death

squads in europe.

The formula of the film was to pick two attractive leads and

then sell violence and crime for two hours in a slick advertising

package.  Subvert the idea of love into a love of death and

make violent death an inevitable thing.

Better yet, package up the violence so that its "better than

real life".  People say this film is more "realistic" in its

violence than previous hollywood films.  Not true.  There isn't

anything real about it because real violence is ugly and boring.

The film doesn't capture realism.  It creates a new language of

stylized attractive violence for film.

Beatty revealed his true "colors" years later when he made the

openly pro-communist film "Reds".  But he was working hard for

the cause when this film was made.
