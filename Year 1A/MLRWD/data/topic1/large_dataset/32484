When I mention to people that Bullitt is one of my favorite movies, the common response is, "Oh, you mean the one with the Mustang and the car chase, right?".  Well, yes, that is the movie that I am talking about.  However, I think that although the car chase is at least one of the best ever, there is still the rest of the movie.  I don't think that the car chase should be the sole basis for determining Bullitt's status as a classic.  I think that more importantly, it has a very complex plot.  In an age when theaters are overrun by cheesy Steven Seagal movies with comical plots, Bullitt is an intelligent action flick.  The various twists and character development make for a movie that is worthy of repeated viewing.  Additionally, good acting separates the keepers from the rejects when we are forced to sit through the likes of Chuck Norris and others.  Of course, the car chase is what Bullitt is infamous for, but just keep in mind that the rest of the movie has other qualities as well.
