Many others have noted the unique place of these films in exploitation and Japanese cinema, and how fun they are.  I rented the original DVDs and watched them with the excellent Animeigo subtitles.  Unfortunately, these are the English versions, dubbed only, which is doubly frustrating for the hard-of-hearing (as far as I can tell no subtitles are available in English either).
As explained on their website:

"Because Shogun Assassin was created by editing together LW&C 1 and 2, there are only 5 Shogun Assassin films: Shogun Assassin (LW&C 1 and 2), Shogun Assassin 2: Lightning Swords of Death (LW&C 3) and Shogun Assassin 3-5 (LW&C 4-6).

Our release of the Shogun Assassin films uses the same high-quality masters as the LW&C films. In the case of Shogun Assassin, we took the original film and replaced each cut with the corresponding one from the HD masters.

All the Shogun Assassin films are English-language only; there is no Japanese soundtrack or subtitles. "

All that being said, while I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of the original Japanese and soundtrack, the picture is superb.  The dubbing is not that bad either, but the liner notes are accessed through "special features" rather than as an integral part of the subtitles as usual.  For compactness and picture clarity, this set gets a near excellent, but for those who would prefer original language and soundtrack, for now the only option is to stick with the DVD set, as Animeigo explains they aren't keen to do many blu ray due to the cost involved and the limited market.  Let's hope this will change for them, as I really love the way they do their subtitles.  I also hope all those who usually comment on foreign language films how they hate subtitles will make this a sold-out set, but somehow I doubt these usually vocal critics will step up to the plate.
