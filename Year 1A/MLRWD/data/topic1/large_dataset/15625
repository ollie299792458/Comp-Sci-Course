MAN...is it long. You'd think they would finally end this, but it keeps going..not only that..the supposive "ending" really left me like "huh?" Besides that there are many interesting things about this anime that will surely get your attention. To the dog eared Inuyasha all the way to the lecherous Monk Miroku they will make you laugh, cry, etc. It truly is a great piece of work, but...the english dubs don't do it justice. They aren't very convincing in several situations and will have you like "what did he/she say?" Even though they are bad..they still maintain the humor, which is a big plus. Also, there is no avoiding battles..every time there is one between usually, Inuyasha and some demon. It's repetitive, but it doesn't really take away from the story. Sometimes they can be quite amusing (like when Inuyasha "fights" the monkey God's sprites hehe) or dramatic (when he fights against Goshinki and "loses" something..wink wink) or sad (poor Kikyo)..either way it's fun and enjoyable. I never get bored and that's why Inuyasha is what it is. So go ahead and buy it, unless you don't like the idea of school girl running around with a demon...than think about it. I highly recommend..but like I said..that ending and the dubs..ehhh. So I'll give it a 4. Enjoy.
