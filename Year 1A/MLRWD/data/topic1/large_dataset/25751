...to appreciate the film that is "The Company Of Wolves".  I first saw this film in the 80's and was a little drawn back by the storytelling structure of the movie.  However, I have come to appreciate this film as quite possibly one of the best Werewolf movies ever produced.  Sarah Patterson (in one of her only roles) shines as the young girl with delusional fantasies.  The story is about her, not about werewolves.  It is about her own metamorphosis from a girl and into a young woman.  This is not your bright and cheerful fairy-tale.  This is a dark and sexualy motivated take on the classic tale of "Little Red Riding Hood".  There is no other film quite like "The Company Of Wolves", with the exception of "Ginger Snaps" which is much more more contemporary than surreal.  Neil Jordan has crafted a visually astonishing film that takes you on a metaphorical journey through a young girl's mind.  What a trip!  Angela Lansbury is perfect for the role of the Grandmother.  It's a plus to have David Warner in it as well.
