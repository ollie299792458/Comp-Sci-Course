Tom Hanks is really good in this heartwarming and sometimes emotional adventure movie with some comedy. Where he ends up in a tragic plane crash from the south pacific ocean. Suddenly he gets flown away in a rubber boat out to sea from the terrible rain storm and lands on a deserted tropical island. Hanks really knows and finds out what's going on? That there is no one there to help him but he's all alone by himself. So he must learn on how to survive without nobody else coming to save Hanks. But except only the skills thru his own knowledge and learns to think in a desperate situation for survival. I like one part when his best friend all covered by Hanks injured red blood on this volleyball which he calls and names it "Wilson". While still being stranded on that island by opening a few delivery packages from the plane disaster he escaped out of. And another scene in this movie I loved where he starts hearing strange noises from the island coming from somewhere but it turns out just to be coconuts falling by a palm trees he notices!
