The first big budget Batman film with Michael Keaton was a very well done film and, if you don't own a copy, by all means the blu ray is worth picking up. The movie has held up well since its 1989 release --- but this blu ray release of it was very obviously a rush job. The video transfer is alright and looks nice and sharp - but the sound mix is abysmal...the sound mix here does NOT take advantage of a 5.1 speaker set-up. 99% of the sound is right out of your front right and left speakers. Don't come in expecting a nice surround sound to pull you in - you're going to be sorely disappointed. Additionally, there's not really a main menu...no chapter selection option, no set-up options for sound or video optimizations. Go to the menu and you pretty much are given options for the additional special features. Overall, this is just an 'okay' version of this film (the sound quality is really a big let down), and given the quality of today's home theater setups - is a bit of a disappointment. However, having said that - it's a great film, and if you don't have a copy - this is still your best bet.
