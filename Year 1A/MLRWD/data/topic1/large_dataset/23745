I know people really like the idea of havng all the seasons on DVD, but does everyone know that Season 5 has been available on iTunes for more than a year. I downloaded the episodes I wanted quite a while ago.

Personally, I'm more concerned about the quality of the DVD content. One some of the previous releases, I noticed that the episodes had been pooly edited-  they were chopped up for the original syndication. It would be great to have the broadcast airings included with the Complete Series box set. At least then, you'd be gettng something different than with the seasons already released. I downloaded the Season 5 premiere and it was cut from the original 3-hour "Night with the Angels" special into 3 individual episodes with no special opening sequence; like the other seasons, there was special intro for the season 5 premiere and key scenes were cut from the episode.

Plus I hate that there are still no extras besides the Angels forever featurette. If they didn't want to include any cast interviews, how about some episode promo's from the series run
