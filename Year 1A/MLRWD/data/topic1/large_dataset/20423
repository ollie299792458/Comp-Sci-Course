Carnivale is such an amazing show.  I ran out immediately and bought the $100 season one as soon as it became available and watched the entire season in one sitting on a Sunday morning prior to the premier of season two.  Delving into the first season like this opened up some mysteries to me, and unlocked some clues that I had the luxury of being validated in the first episode of season two.

Season Two answered a lot of these burning questions, it raised the stakes of the looming confrontation, it threw in some intriguing twists, and finally gave us an amazing pay-off at the end.  The problem is, is that there is still so much more of the story that needs to be told and this fascinating saga is no where near completed.

One of the biggest mistakes HBO has ever made was to cancel this series in the heart of its story-telling.  Since they've done that, I have done everything in my power to distance myself from their programming.  How can the company expect a decent amount in DVD sales when the price they decide to charge is obscene?  Most consumers immediately realize that they can take their $100 and turn around and buy a 24 episode season of some hit show, and at LEAST three full length feature movies for the same price.  Especially in this world of pirated and downloadable media; it appears that HBO is rather naive and making some bad business decisions on bogus data.

Regardless of HBO, I will definitely be purchasing this long awaited Season Two of Carnivale on 7/18/2006 and preparing myself for another marathon of watching the enthralling saga play out one final time.
