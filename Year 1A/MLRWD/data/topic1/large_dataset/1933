Whether you love or hate this movie -- for it tends to polarize people --  depends largely on how much you believe in its central tenet: mankind is destined to leave the Earth to colonize other parts of the universe. Just to be perfectly clear, we are not talking about a brief space voyage and return to Earth, but irrevokably leaving our cradle. Those that grew up on "Star Trek" and "2001" are very familiar with this theme; but this movie was the pioneer. The special effects are of course dated, but I found a certain charm in them anyway.
Oh, yes -- there is one more noteworthy thing: the spaceship (actually a space-ark) is guided down a long incline before being redirected to a more vertical path at launch. There is actually some merit to this scheme. Because rockets are extremely inefficient when standing still or moving slowly, is is highly desirable to get as fast as possible through this fuel-robbing phase. This principle of "launch assist" has been used in practice, but never on large vehicles. (The thinking is that the added complexity and risk are not worth it for large vehicles.)
