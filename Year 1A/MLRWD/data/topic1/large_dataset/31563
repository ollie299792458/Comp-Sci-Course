If you liked the original TV series, you'll love the movie.  It is just as wonderfully and ridiculously cheesy as the original TV series.  I ordered this to watch with my two sons.  They are 4 and 6 and they loved this movie. I mean there's good guys, bad guys, the bat-mobile (which rocks), nutty fight scenes (POW!) and bat-gadgets galore!  What's there not to love about this movie?  The best cheesy scene ever in the history of movies is in this movie; Batman and Robin flying the bat-helicopter (of course) over the ocean.  Robin flies the bat-copter while batman climbs down a rope ladder to drop down on their target yacht.  But, suddenly the yacht disappears as it was an illusion and a trick!  The next thing you know, Batman is dipped into the ocean for a moment.  He is lifted up out of the water WITH A SHARK ON HIS LEG!  Holy Yikes Batman!  The shark is this big rubber fake; that is hilariously fake.  Robin sees Batman's predicament and climbs down the ladder to help Batman.  Now I don't want to give away the end of the scene.  But, let's just say it continues the whole bat-cheese thing beautifully.  If you are a person who gets tongue in cheek humor and dry wit, you'll love this movie.  If you are looking for a more serious realistic superhero movie, then get one of the modern ones.  The cheese factor in the old Batman and Robin TV series (and this movie) was intentional, and it was genius.  I love the shark scene every time I watch it.
