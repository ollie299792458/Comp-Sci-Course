Holy horror shows, what an abysmal flick. If you think you might enjoy 100+ minutes of guys either getting hit in the head or crotch by flying objects, this movie might very well be for you. For me, and I suspect for anyone with half a brain, it gets old pretty dang quickly.  Stiller's once promising comic acting career seems to be waning as he once agains saddles up to a role that is bound to leave teenaged boys laughing hysterically while leaving the rest of the audience wincing at this enormously hideous movie.  Vince Vaughn's so-called understated performance is almost comatose, can you say "Dead man Acting"?  I suppose it's not entirely his fault, the script is bad, so horrifyingly bad, that it's hard to blame each and every actor in this movie for giving what will no doubt(hopefully, for their sake) be their worst performance ever turned in on the silver screen.

I watched this movie with 7 other people who, like me, enjoy a good comedy, and the unanimous conclusion was that Dodgeball was awful, a complete dud.  The biggest puzzle about Dodgeball is the commercial success it seems to be having both at the box office and on the rental shelves. Go ahead, while desperately seeking a few laughs, you may very well shell out your hard earned cash for this pathetic comedy, but mark my words, the joke will be on you.
