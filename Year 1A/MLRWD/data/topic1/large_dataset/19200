Miyazaki is being treated with much more respect in the Western world thanks to gifts like "Princess Mononoke" and "Spirited Away" - both were released in America with minimal success and a strong fanbase.

My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro) follows two young girls as they move into a new home with their father. They help him around the house, and soon discover that they can see what other's can't. They see Totoro. What is a Totoro? I hope you watch for yourself to find out. Like most of Miyazaki's work, this movie is rooted in Shintoism; a religion consisting of over 8 million gods. These spirits are characterized and appear childish, but the films depth shines through the shoddy marketing if you give it a chance.

It's a great movie, for kids & adults and I'm very glad it's getting a DVD. However, I'm pretty disappointed in the DVD. It's got a sticker proudly saying that it's a two disc edition, but that second disc, like "Nausicaa", is the storyboard. Only the storyboard. I'm not sure even the director would watch the ENTIRE storyboard of this film. Basically, the second disc is worthless. The "Behind the Microphone" is nice, but runs less than 10 minutes and tells nothing that we don't know about Miyazaki from other halfassed "documentaries" on various Miyazaki DVD's.

The film is great, and highly recommended. I just can't get behind this DVD. It's nice to see it released, but with nothing to look forward to besides the Japanese language track, it's pretty embarrassing. In Japan, most Ghibli films get proper respect (Princess Mononoke got a 3 disc box set! Come on!), but it seems that another company will have to get ahold of these rights before we see Miyazaki immortalized with those big three letters.
