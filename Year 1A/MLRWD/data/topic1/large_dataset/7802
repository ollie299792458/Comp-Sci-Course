Anastasia has to be the first movie i've seen in a LONG time from disney/atlantis in the animation genre. Being close to sixteen yrs old, there isn't alot of free time to sit down and watch animated films, what with uni and studys and all, but, in my opinion, anyone wanting to see a beautifully made movie should see 'Anastasia'.
  Sure, the movie might not be historically accurate, but if it were, it would take away alot of the beauty element of the movie. and sure, it may have drawbacks, but that's to be expected....everyone has different taste in movies and films, and so everyone will view the film in a different way.
  In my own personal opinion, i found the movie to be one of the greatest achievements of animation technology. Based around young Anya, it is a movie about self-discovery, personal beliefs and the desire to reach a goal, no matter how impossible.
Although it has been five years since the movie made it's debut screening, i consider it a classical piece of animation achievement.
  With its attractive storyline, superbly drawn and animated characters and beautifully performed songs, i would recommomend anyone, in any age group, to watch this movie. if the movie itself doesn't entice you to enjoying the film, then the music certainly will.
