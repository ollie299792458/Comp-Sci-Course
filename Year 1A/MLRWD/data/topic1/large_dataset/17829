To me, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is without doubt one of the best Science Fiction movies ever made.
Under its seemingly simple premise, it takes us on a wonderful journey: the story of a man faced with something more formidable than him, and his relentless, unwavering drive to get the answers he seeks, whatever the cost to him.
Richard Dreyfuss is the symbol of our humanity: fragile, slightly immature, drowned in his own problems, unable to face them, overwhelmed by what happens to him, but uncontrollably driven toward this unknown that touched him one night and changed his life forever.
The other important role is that of Fran√ßois Truffaut (the famous French director) who plays the role of the scientist who attempts to understand what the aliens are doing and prepares first contact. This is the only role that Truffaut ever accepted in a Foreign film.
What I like best about the movie is its positive message: it's not the military that were chosen to get on the alien ship, but the simple guy, the only true representative of humanity.
Get this DVD, there are hours of goodies on both discs, and I especially liked the bits about the music, by John Williams. This is without doubt the best and richest score he made for any Spielberg movie.
To those who complain that they don;t get to see the inside of the mother ship, they should know that Speilberg never intended us to see that. It was forced upon him to shoot these sequences for the previous special edition of the movie. There is no need to see the inside of the ship, we know it's formidable and here, imagination takes over.
