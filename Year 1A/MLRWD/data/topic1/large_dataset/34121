THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN HISTORY. THE LINES THAT RAMBO SAYS ARE ALL CLASSICS THAT CAN BE USED IN EVERYDAY LIFE. LIKE WHEN HE SAYS, "WHAT'S IT DO?"  "IT TURNS BLUE."  ALSO WHEN HE RAMBO  SAYS TO THE COLONEL, "YOU SEE A LOT." I LIKE IT WHEN THE KID ASK  HOW MANY DAYS WALK IT IT TO ARIZONA, "OH ABOUT 2 YEARS". THE  VILENCE ON THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT EVEN FOR KIDS AND HILLARIOUS. IT ISN'T  REALLY GORY BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY DESTRUCTION AND JUST SHOOTING.  IT'S FUNNY  WHEN THE GUY GETS ELECTRICUTED. ALSO WHEN THE GUY GETS BLOWN UP. THE CAVE  SCENE'S INCREDIBLE. IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, I REALLY LIKE RAMBO 3,  IT'S FAST PACED AND LITTERALLY MOVES. THE ACTION IS VERY GOOD AND THERE'S A  LOT OF SHOOTING AND EXPLOSIONS FOR YOU GUN FANS. THIS IS THE BEST RAMBO  MOVIE. UNFORTUATELY, THERE ARE NO MORE AFTER THIS WONDERFUL CLASSIC. (I  WISH THEY DIDN'T MAKE SO MANY DAMN ROCKY MOVIES. THESE ARE MUCH BETTER). IF  YOU DON'T OWN THIS MOVIE YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON ONE OF THE GREATEST LIFE  EXPERIENCES. THE END CREDIT SONG IS ALSO EXCELLENTG. ENJOY!
