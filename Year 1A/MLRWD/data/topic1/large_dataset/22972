Like many, I was somewhat skeptical about this film upon its first release. I skipped it in the theaters in lieu of more "fall appropriate" titles like "L.A. Confidential" and "Good Will Hunting" and while both of those were very well made, they did not hold a candle to this film. Mark Wahlberg makes us forget about that whole Marky Mark fiasco of the early nineties with a sheer volcanic starring debut. As the sometimes naive pawn of the industry Dirk Diggler, he runs the gauntlet of emotions, from a particularly heart breaking confrontation with his mother at the beginning to a terrible and hilarious session at a recording studio, Wahlberg showed us that he is far from a flash in the pan. Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds shine as the patriarch and mother of this broken yet lovable extended family. Heather Graham is effective as the lovable yet dim Rollergirl,and PTA regulars John C. Reilly and Phillip Seymour Hoffman prove yet again that they are the two most underrated actors in the business by turning in pitch perfect performances as Dirk's co-star and assistant. Hoffman is very moving in the New Year's Eve sequence. The script crackles with dialogue that can be both tragic and uproariously funny all at the same time. The only thing I had trouble believing upon my first viewing was that it was written by a 26-year old. Every detail of 70's so-called "fashion sense" is present and the direction is staggering. A brilliant movie that probably cannot be praised enough, so I'll end it like this. I loved this movie.
