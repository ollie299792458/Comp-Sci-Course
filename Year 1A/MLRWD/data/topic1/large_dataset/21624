Bruno Mattei's zombie film Hell of the Living Dead(Zombie Creeping Flesh, Night of the Zombies, Virus) eats the sanity out of it's viewers. Hell of the Living Dead is known for it's gore, inserted stock footage, and soundtrack lifted from other movies. Those infamous characteristics are why people love it or hate it.

Hell of the Living Dead is about an accident at a chemical plant which brings the dead back to life. Meanwhile, domestic terrorists hold a building hostage to get the government to stop it's WMD manufacturing and chemical weapon research. A SWAT team comes in and kills the terrorists. The SWAT team go to Papa New Guinea and meet an athropologist and her cameraman who were attacked by zombies. They are desperate to escape the madness.

The movie is a ripoff of Dawn of the Dead. It has the same score as Dawn of the Dead and the SWAT team are wearing the same suits from Dawn of the Dawn. There is also stock footage inserted so Mattei would save for the budget. The stock footage is of animals and natives. Some of the footage is disturbing showing burial rites and field dressing. Those scenes were probably lifted from mondo films. The stock footage gets annoying. The gore is over-the-top. Plentiful of prolonged feasting and some gore from the stock footage. The gore is out-dated to today's standards but watch out for the stock footage and one of the ending scenes.

Hell of the Living Dead is not the greatest movie but it's not the worst. It's fun and all because of the cheesiness but it's only for those who like cult classics and gore. This movie is also paired with Mattei's Rats on Anchor Bay which is now out of print. Bruno Mattei will remind you as the Ed Wood of Italian horror.
