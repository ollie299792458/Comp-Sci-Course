The thing about this movie was,

it tried too hard to be scary.

I personally do not think this movie was as good as the first one. It was horribly disgusting and gruesome, which explains why it was rated R ( and i'm only 15 by the way, haha). Definitely more blood and more cruelty. But that kinda takes the scariness out of it. In fact, it makes you want to puke more compared to scariness.

The ending was kind of lame, actually. I found it pretty predictable. And kind of impossible, too.

You also never find out what happened to Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Did he make it or not?

That's something I really really want to know.

And there is just one thing I cannot get out of my head.

The woman who later gets both her hands caught while she was trying to get the antedote,

why couldn't she get the antidote from outside?

that even seems easier.

why did she have to stick her hands into those two holes?

i mean, it's just stupid. Even someone who's almost lost their conciousness would have the instinct to get the antedote from the outside, which was perfectly reachable.

oh yeah. and Daniel is hot.

have a good time watching this movie, but I really don't think it's as good as the first. Oh yeah, and it's kind  of disturbing, so I'd reccomend it for only die-hard horror movie fans.
