This is the Holy of Holies of BAD CINEMA, the pristine junk that Ed Wood would have produced if someone had given him a blank check to make a musical. Since Ed never made it to the musical scene, we have to settle for the contributions of two of Ed's equals in tacky tastelessness, yes the Cannon Boyz themselves, Menahem Golan and Youram Globus.

This cinematic canker sore MUST be "scene" to be believed. Especially the parts where Vladek Sheybal, (yes, Col Kronsteen and Dr Jackson from UFO) sings. Well, I guess Telly Savalas was too busy doing Vegas gigs to appear in this hyperventilated hokeyfest. Let's just say that Alice Cooper has nothing to fear from this guy.

As for the "ending". it is a pastiche of Grand gruyere as the incredible Mr. Topps, played by Joss Ackland, all of a sudden appears in a suit that makes him look like a pimp on Sesame Street, complete with a funky cheesy negative of an AMC Ambassador that all of a sudden has thousands of hippies walking into it for their ride to meet Mr. Xenu.

Truly the Holy of Holies of BAD CINEMA. It MUST be "Scene" to be believed!
