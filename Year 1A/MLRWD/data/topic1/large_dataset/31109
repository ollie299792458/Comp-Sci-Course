I have been a huge fan of this film since I was a kid. I remember staying up nights watching it with my little brother. We wore out the VHS from so many viewings. The DVD release brought back these memories when it was released and so does the Blu-ray release.

The video itself is superb and vibrant. Sharp image with dark blacks and beautiful colors. I have never seen it look so good. The audio is a whole different story. 2 channel sound does not do this title justice. The music and even dialog are too soft and lacking presence. In this day and age of digital sound and fully remastered titles, I thought for sure this film would get such treatment.

My final complaint comes from the lack of special features. Being a huge fan and owning the VHS and DVD release, stating that special feature is 3 alternate endings is nothing new. This has been available since its first VHS release. Sure the only difference is you can have it picked randomly or shown with all 3, but again this is nothing new. New interviews or some type of commentary or even a trivia would have been an improvement.

In the end this is still a fine release and is recommended. If you or your kids haven't seen this, it s a treat for the whole family. Fine video and average audio can't stop this from being a must own for fans of this classic film.
