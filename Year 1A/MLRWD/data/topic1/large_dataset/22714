The 5th season of Charmed of the now defunct WB show is both classy and trashy all at the same time. The producers make important choices that enchance the girls lives, such as carrer changes and promotions, look out for Phoebe's colum making her a huge star, and Paige finding her magical calling. They also introduce new and exciting mythical creatures such as mermaids, fairytales, and gypsies into the show. However, the writers also make 3  collasal mistakes which forever damage the show. Getting rid of Cole in its landmark 5th episode, after embarassingly enough reducing him to an insane man starving for love is a bad choice. Phoebe never agai nregained the kind of chemistry she had with Cole no many how many actors the writers threw her together with. Plus, Cole's precense in the show is astounding. Not many actors can come into a show in the 3rd season and command the show in the stellar way this fine character did.  Furthermore,  creating an endless parade of various love interests for Phoebe who towards the end of the season becomes a caricature of the once brazen and sexy self she used to be is another huge mistake.

The final mistake is Piper's pregnacy. The show never did recover from the constant and almost insane attention given to Piper's child which in real life would be neccessary, but in a show about 3 brazen, comic, and strong women completley takes away the desire to see these three as the Charmed ones, which is replaced by the vacant stare of the maternal ones.
The 5th season is both good and bad, sad and triumphant, but believe me this is really the last Charmed season to buy, during the next 3 seasons the Charmed producers take full advantage of not being cancelled by their network and come up with indescribable fluff that can only be enjoyed by someone who isnt used to the power of 3 back in the good ole days.
