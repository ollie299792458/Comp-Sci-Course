The Tiny Toons are back ! ('Bout time.) And this brand-new DVD is basically a redistribution of the direct-to-video movie release "How I Spent My Vacation". In it, your favorite cast of zany characters are all set for one crazy summer once the school bell rings. And frankly, it's obviously one ridiculous adventure after another.

First off, Babs Bunny attempts to spend her summer vacation catching some rays, until her plans are all wet (literally) no thanks to her boyfriend Buster. Pretty soon it's an all-out squirt gun war up until all of Acme Acres is totally submerged, sending our conejo couple (and Byron the Basset Hound) on a rollicking river raft adventure fraught with hillbilly possums, Southern-belle alligators, and Superman (Wait, what ?). Elsewhere, Plucky Duck decides to tag along with his good pal Hamton J. Pig on a family road trip to Happy World Land theme park. Plucky putting up with Hamton and his family is one thing, but then things get worse when they pick up a psycho hitchhiker along for the ride ! Other stories include Elmyra visiting a drive-through safari park where even the wild animals there don't take too kindly to her affections, Fifi La Fume dating the skunk hunk of her dreams (and of her nightmares), Dizzy Devil coping with his shedding hair, and Shirley the Loon being forced to see a summer blockbuster flick with the annoying Fowl Mouth.

It seems like a long summer for our friends, but still it's a fun movie that you'll enjoy. So anyway, this DVD seems not all there so to speak, but at least it's quite an opener for season two - whenever that comes out. So stay Tiny Tooned for new details coming soon !
