This is the version I show throughout the book, revealing bits and pieces to the students as we go chapter by chapter.  The credits, done in a slide-show fashion, do a great job of contextualizing the opening situation for students (although some explanation may be needed).  Although they largely do not like black and white, students do like this movie and have reported to me that it helps them understand the book better.

One unexpected bonus is the commentary track.  When we were done with the book, I replayed several scenes with the commentary: the casting of Piggy, how the night dancing scene was lit, the pig's head and how they rigged it, and how they did the rock scene with Piggy.  One or two of the people contributing are rather soft-spoken or don't enunciate well, so you may have to "translate" to the students, or play it again, but the trivia is interesting!

Students tend to be amused when you point out to them that Ralph's voice changes from high to low frequently (thanks to his voice changing between the actual filming and additional dialogue recording).  Do beware: there is some brief rear and nearly-frontal nudity toward the end (when Jack's tribe whips a boy, and when Piggy talks to the few boys at Ralph's camp before they all go to confront Jack).  You can fast-forward through that.
