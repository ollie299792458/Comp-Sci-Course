I thought "Citizen Kane" was well acted and well written and produced.  It is a glimpse into the life of "a big American", as Thompson's boss Rawlston pointed out, but ultimately it is a story of how consumed we can become by our own demons if we allow them to overtake us.  Kane could be seen as a hypocrite--championing the workingman and fighting for his interests, while at the same time employing the tactics of those he rails against (the rich, privileged, and powerful).  But at heart, he is just a man looking for love and acceptance (from friends, family--particularly his mother, who sent him away at 10 years of age--and the people).  And because it never works out for him, he takes his losses in the most personal way, until finally he is consumed by it and it takes its toll on him (symbolized by the Rosebud sled being consumed once and for all by the flames of the furnace).  Rosebud was, indeed, something he lost--his link to his childhood and it would forever have an impact on him.

We had to watch this movie for an English class in college, and I've been intrigued by it ever since--perhaps because, deep down, there's a little Charlie Kane in all of us.
