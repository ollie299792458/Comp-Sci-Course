Besides the fact that it seems like we have 'the world is going to end' movies every year, I still think that this approach is fantastic.  "Knowing" takes you on a mystery adventure.  It's not predictable and it's certainly not one of those movies you watch when you don't function.

"Knowing" makes you think.

Nicholas Cage is fantastic in this movie as a father who's just trying to survive after his wife's death and dealing with his son who has a hearing impairment.  He looks like a madman half the time and then is a hero.  We follow the journey of a girl who left a "drawing" in a time capsule that's given to Cage's son in the movie, and it takes them to the girl's daughter and granddaughter.

After some misunderstandings, they are able to work together to follow the clues that have led to every major disaster in history and a few more that are coming to uncover what is coming.

The death of everyone else.

But the movie doesn't just end with the world exploding and everyone dying.

"Knowing" is beautiful and funny and chilling.  It has beautiful special effects and a magnificient storyline.  Truly, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and makes you cry.
