Tim Burton, the director of this movie, is a really twisted filmmaker. He has made some films that were meant for kids in the past that were really creepy. Just look at the 2 Batman films he made. Those movies were so darkly violent and twisted that they came very close to the R-rating. But this time Paramount put their trust in Burton to do this R-rated flick and let it totally rip. The result, unfortunately, is not exactly what I'd hoped for. The movie's look is absolutely amazing, the most stunningly beautiful Burton film to date (and that's saying something). But what disturbs me is the complicated plot, which this movie didn't need, and some lacklustre performances. The movie is definitely spooky and even humorous at points, but some of the acting is below par, especially Christina Ricci. Casper van Dien is as mediocre as he usually is, Christopher Walken is wasted in a microscopic role, and so are Ian McDiarmid and Michael Gough. 
But, focusing on the movie, it's definitely worth watching once. So rent it first and, if you like it, then buy it!
