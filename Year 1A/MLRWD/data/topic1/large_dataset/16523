I figured I would watch this movie on a Lark...We all know the jokes about rocky and infinite sequels.

The days leading up before I saw the movie, I would chant "Rocky, Rocky" to my girlfriend (not a fan).  I was all but prepared for the comic spoofs I was going to make afterward...but then something happened.

As I watched the movie all jokes feel aside when I realized that this was the best Rocky ever! There was a depth and maturity to this movie, probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years. There was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture. One can almost see themselves in Philly, going up to Rocky and shaking his hand. This character is that real.

When you watch this final installment, you will realize why you originally were drawn to the Rocky movies and character 30 years ago. Rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit. And he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans.

Check out this Movie.
