I highly recommend "Transameria" as a very good movie, about a human being seeking to be true to herself, which is a universal theme, as well as being a breakthrough film about transsexuals. As a person who believes there should be greater tolerance among humanity, I enjoyed the film.  Hopefully this movie will help increase wider public acceptance of transgendered persons, especially transssexuals, in the United States and elsewhere.

  I thought Felicity Huffman, played a generally credible pre-operative male to female transsexual. I was a little concerned Bree, her character, would postpone or cancel having sex reassignment surgery because of the contact with her son. I was glad she remained true to herself. Her rebellious, alienated son seemed to be a generally plausible character and I was glad there was some ambiguity in their relationship in the ending, instead of a typical Hollywood happy ending, which would have seemed unrealistic given the storyline.

  My only quibble with this otherwise very fine film is I wish the directors could have found a real male to female transsexual to play the role of Bree. This would have made her character seem even more believable.
