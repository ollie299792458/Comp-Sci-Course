A sympathetic portrayal of a leading Nazi, made in the 1950's?

It would require a brave studio, a brilliant script and a serious leading actor.
Fortunately, this thoughtful, interesting biopic has them all.

The first time we see the main character, he is a good distance away, deliberately
so, in the North African desert. Is this not the beauty of great acting? Even with this
distance shot, it is immediately apparent, simply from stance. `That's Rommel'.
Not James Mason, you understand, but Rommel.

We follow the Field Marshall from battle to his home, from the office of his supreme leader to the shores of France. Finally, to his suicide - it's that or face trial by Hitler for treason. And he is sympathetically played. There are some interesting super imposition shots of the actors over genuine footage, and of course, sets, props costumes etc are all totally authentic. The film looks and sounds great.

Jessica Tandy is totally convincing as Mrs Rommel and the entire cast is high quality.

There are even some laughs.
Particularly considering when this film was made, it is human, occasionally charming and
a thoroughly enjoyable watch.
