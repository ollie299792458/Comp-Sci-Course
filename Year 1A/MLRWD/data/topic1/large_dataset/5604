Three stars is a bit of a gift to give The Bone Collector, and if I could give it two and a half I most likely would.  My mother, the queen of all that is paranoid, highly recommended I see this film- and being that Mother's Day is coming up in a few months I figured, "Why not?" My mother told me that after seeing this movie she thought she would never set foot in a cab again! Spooky! So, I stood at the movie store for a few minutes playing around with the box.  On the box I see Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington, two of my favorites, and at first I think "There's a strange pair" but I was intrigued nonetheless.  
The Bone Collector is by no means an insult to intelligence or even one of the worst movies ever made (if you think so, try sitting through Hollow Man).  It's a film that has a lot of holes and absolutely ridiculous choices in casting.  I think both the actors are brilliant, but their agents should have known better than pitching them this script.  For example, I just don't look at Jolie and think "By jove! That girl would be great in the role of a tough as nails rookie cop! Get that girl on the phone."  
The poor casting is only magnified by a less than astounding script.  I never quite believed murders like this could take place, nor did I suspend my disbelief enough to think the murderer would be who the murderer was in the script.  In fact, when the murderer is unmasked, prepare yourself for campy disappointment. 
However, this film isn't all bad.  While the plot may be a bit unbelievable, the story is interesting enough to capture your attention.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film to a friend, but I also wouldn't scream if I had to see it again.  In the end though, I am left analyzing more of the film's faults and forgetting the moments that I enjoyed.  Thanks a lot Mom!
