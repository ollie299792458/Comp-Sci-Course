I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!  I'm not one to like musicals, but this is one of the few exceptions I have.  This should have been AFI's #1.  My favorite number has to be Good Mornin'.  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds make dancing look easy.  They look like they're actually having fun making the film.  The work that went into it doesn't even show on screen.  It looks like they just made up the moves as they went along.  Donald O'Connor gives a brilliant performance in Make 'Em Laugh.  Story has it that he was in bed for 3 days recuperating after he filmed that scene--no wonder.  But he also made it look effortless.  I wish they made films like this today.  Unfortunately, all the class has died with Hollywood's best stars.  I have to tape these old films off TV or buy them.  I wish I had seen this one in the theater.  But in 1952, my parents were only kids.  Sometimes I hate being only 21.  I don't have any memories of going to the theater and seeing a really great film.  I must have watched this film a million times. If you haven't seen it, get some popcorn, get the kids (they'll love it-at least my 8 year old niece does) and WATCH IT!!!!!
