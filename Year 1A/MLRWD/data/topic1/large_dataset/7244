The Film Crew's debut effort has some belly laughs and lots of chuckles, and it's great to see this team back in action.  However, the choice of film is odd -- it's very dreary and monotonous, and even at this short running length seems too long.

The skits that bookend the film (and the "Lunch Break") are cute, but they don't really hit their mark comedically.  Here's an idea for the next episodes: Why not have Bill, Mike, and Kevin -- three very clever, funny people who know a lot about film and who have a lot to say -- just chat about the movie, unscripted?  I bet the laughs would be more genuine.

I like the basic premise of this project: the Film Crew provides commentary tracks for any DVD that does not yet have one. But I think the idea would be better executed if the Crew started out actually doing real commentary, gradually slipping into out-and-out mocking.  It's familiar terrain for MST3K fans for the guys to start riffing from the first frame of the film, but wouldn't it be funnier for that riffing to arise out of disdain for the movie than out of habit?
