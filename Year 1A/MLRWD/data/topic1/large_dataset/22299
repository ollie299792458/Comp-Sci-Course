"The Final Cut", is a great movie. A type of underdog movies that goes unnoticed by the general public, but is greatly appreciated once one discovers it. I believe Robin Williams is a talented serious actor, and does very well in dramatic thrillers.

The movie is a little somber and may move slow to some, but it is an intelligently written piece that will hold your attention. This futuristic piece tells the story of Robin Williams character (Alan Hacman), who is a professional "cutter" (cutter - someone who creates a eulogy-type film highlighting the better side of the deceased lives, cutting out the bad parts in that person's life). Robin's character, Alan is very good as a "cutter" and is very much in demand by many. Many that are powerful and who would not want their secrets to be exposed to the public after their death. Alan (Robin Williams) is hired to create a eulogy-film for a very powerful man, who had secrets to hide.

Alan (Robin Williams) character is a loner, and reminds one of a funeral director. I was captivated by this intense dark thriller that explored the dark side of human nature and how far one will go to obtain information and power.

I agree, with Amazon's description. If you liked movies such as, Gattica, you will enjoy this movie.
