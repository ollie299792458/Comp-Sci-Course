My grown sons were shocked that their mom really liked this movie.  Besides being tightly written and extremely well acted by every cast member,  I think the violence of the film is redeemed by it's social commentary.

Yes, there is increasing evidence that "criminal minds" have a genetic basis.  However crime is often family and culturally determined.  In some communities it is difficult to escape and complicated by drug dependence, parental abandonment and bonds with bad mentors.  Criminals both in and out of prison are as likely to watch this movie as anything else outside the porn genre.  The film is bringing an important commentary to that audience as well.

The car chases and gunfights in the streets of Boston were the only stretch.  Hard to believe for anyone who has driven in the congestion and narrow streets.  Foot chases, better.

I greatly admire the Novelist and Mr. Affleck, the assembled actors  AND...I wish I could personally apologize to Mr. Affleck for that really weird interviewer from Time Magazine's 10 Questions.  I thought I was watching an SNL sketch.
