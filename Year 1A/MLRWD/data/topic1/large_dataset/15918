This Korean Special Edition of Malena is the version you've been looking for! The original film, uncut, uncensored - as it was meant to be... and as it was originally released in Italy. This is a two-disc edition.

Disc #1 contains the film in Italian - with three options for subtitles: "English"... "Korean"... or "None".

Disc #2 contains special features.

I have not tried to watch the film with Korean subtitles... so I don't know if that setting results in a blurred/censored movie - but I can confirm that when watched with the English subtitles the film presented is indeed FULL and UNCUT. All of the "controversial" scenes which were omitted from the American releases are there, and the film runs at just under 104-minutes (the "cut" American versions run at around 90-minutes). The scenes are presented without any form of censorship - no blurring or black boxes.

Personally, having seen both the "Cut" and "Uncut" versions of the film, I cannot understand why the scenes were cut for American audiences. There really isn't anything "bad" or "more perverse" about the scenes that were cut... especially when you take into account what was shown in the cut version.

This is such an amazing film... extremely well done... and a beautiful story. And, in my opinion, this Uncut/Uncensored version is the only way to watch it. It's the "complete" experience!
