I have treasured this movie for years. I own the vhs version, but rarely want to take the time and trouble ( all that rewinding) to get it out. With the new and used option at Amazon it is very simple to find your favorites at great prices with just a few clicks of a button. Who can imagine those three hansome guys posing as women? Hard to believe but they do it well. Even with those bulging muscles they all are great at portraying elegant "Drag Queens". This movie is wonderful, funny, and setimental. I never tire of watching it. At the time this movie came out there seemed to be an era of "Drag Queen" movies. This one, by far, is the best. The others are entertaining as well however; I believe this one tops them all. While watching you can Laugh, cry, and relate to the personal growth of each of the characters as they try to help "the little boy in drag" reach "her" true potential. These amazing "career girls" also give the entire tired and dowdy town a great makeover. I would highley recommend this movie to anyone for a great evening's entertainment.
