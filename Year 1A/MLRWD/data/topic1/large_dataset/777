Several plotlines unfold in this movie.  All are built around the theme of knowing what happened when outside an event.  To understand the parallels being drawn when you first watch the film I respectfully suggest focusing on just two of the plotlines.  Juxtapose the main plotline, the perspectives that two native Canadians (one of Turkish descent, the other of Armenian descent) bring to the filming in the present day of a movie about the liquidation by Turks of some number of Armenians and what came before it, with the death of a man and how that death is viewed by that man's wife and daughter.  The daughter says the man was essentially driven to death by the wife, the wife says the man died by accident.  The moment of the death is depicted in a flashback from a third-person perspective.  At the crucial moment, however, the camera pans away and back and we don't know why the man is dead, only that he is dead.  As a result both wife and daughter have plausible arguments, but we (and they) will never know the "truth".  Just as the film within the film is an attempt to tell but one side's "truth", so do both Canadians, ethnic Turk and ethnic Armenian, adopt positions that suit their ancestral identity and take as their starting point the events that suit their argument, but they will never know the "truth".  And meantime two people who are both human beings distance themselves from each other because they cannot live with ambiguity about the past (a past they never experienced to boot).  And so: Armenians and Turks are dead.  Bosnians and Serbs are dead.  Jewish Semites and Arab Semites are dead.  Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants are dead.  Shall we in this "New World" add to those dead or shall we affirm that we are all one race, the human race.  That is the question that Egoyan answers in the affirmative and why I enjoyed this brilliant effort that is at least as deserving of acclaim as Rashomon.
