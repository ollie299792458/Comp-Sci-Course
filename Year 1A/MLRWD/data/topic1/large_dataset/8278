It is odd that reviewers of "Hollywood Ending," Woody Allen's most recent film, should have remarked on elements hard to accept, on its anti-Hollywood/successful film stance, and its surprise pro-Europe conclusion, without adding up these elements and finding the total: Fellini.  The hint is clear from the start, a director who is unable to make the film!  Shades of "8 1/2"!  Moreover both directors (Guido is Fellini's, played of course by Marcello Mastroianni) have an ex-wife (estranged or divorced) portrayed with "feminine charms" minimized (Fellini made Anouk Aimee cut her hair short and wear heavy rimmed glasses).  Each wife re-enters her husband's life at a crucial, challenged  moment of his creativity.  Both men have a "companion" ("mistress" seems more appropriate for 1962) who is in or near the set.  Both men feel their film threatened by critics and potential reviewers, both are reminded frequently of the high cost of their film folly, neither "has a script" in the sense of knowing where the film is going.  Guido in "8 1/2" has more personal history, but Fellini clearly conveys the idea of the crippling effect of "blindness" to others, and the need to be open to, and accepting of, ALL that one has experienced in life; Allen's film limits this reconciliation with one's experience to the wayward son.  In both cases the contents of the film-to-be-made are rigourously excluded, though in both the audience gets a glimpse...a spaceship in one, a family quarrel in the other.  To take this film as "right from life," New York's or Allen's, robs it of wonderful resonances.  There  is also, I'd suggest, a reminiscence of "After the Fox," where the Peter Sellers character also makes a movie without a plot....
