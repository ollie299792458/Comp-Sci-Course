For those particularly attuned to the horror genre and market, this movie was anticipated with a rarely seen enthusiasm, which obviously is a good and bad thing.  Sales were high on the release date, I'm sure, but the anticipation created that unfortunately high expectation with which viewers will evaluate the movie.  I'm no exception, but offer the previous statement as a baseline to explain my review. So, as the story makes clear, this movie is told in a tales of the crypt vignette-like way, but with 4 or so stories that intertwine set on Halloween night. A few random observations:  The movie does a very good job of capturing Halloween night ambiance; I'm a particularly rabid fan of anything Halloween, and have been known to pour more energy into celebrating Halloween than Xmas.  I can easily get sucked into an otherwise horrible film if it has fun ambiance (e.g., Hallows End), and this movie certainly has good ambiance. Second, I think, contrary to popular opinion, the vignette style of the film detracted from the story.  Rather than having the normal movie length to develop characters and tell a story, that was all attempted in the span of about 20 minutes.  This resulted in several of the potentially very juicy vignettes feeling abrupt and not fully developed.  Third, the Blu Ray quality was not outstanding.  I've seen quite a range from Pirates (amazing blu ray) to Patriot (not so much), and I'd give this one a picture quality of about 3/5, with 5 being best.  Its good, just not as good as it could be.  Fourth, irrespective of the negative foregoing, the last scene is especially good.  Anyone familiar with the Orphanage will note the parallel character.  It, as in the character and its costume, had some cheese elements, but overall the scene was a great ending.  So all in all, my recommendation is to free yourself of any preconceived expectations going into the film, and you'll likely enjoy it much more.
