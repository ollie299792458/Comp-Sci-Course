I bought all five former box sets a year ago, and have watched them multiple times, but I would always watch some episodes feeling cheated.  The Adventures, and The Return box set (roughly the first 24 episodes, and two full films) were in bad shape: it looked like they were transferred to DVD from an old VHS someone had in their basement, and it sounded like it too.  The picture was grainy, and on some episodes the audio warbled.
This box set is what I was waiting for: I got in the mail from MPI yesterday, and have checked out some of the worse looking episodes from the old set...and they look marvelous.  MPI transferred all of the episodes from the original negative, and cleaned up the menus: every single episode and film, cleaned up, and on 12 discs, and in two, high quality cases with a wonderful, heavy duty, cardboard slipcase.  It even comes with a booklet which has information about every episode: an summary of the story, plus behind the scenes information about the making of.  This is the box set I wanted to buy a year ago, and this is the set MPI should have released in the first place.  But better late than never.  Fantastic: anyone who is a fan should buy it, and anyone who has the first five box sets should sell them, and buy this.  It is, truly, the Complete Granada Series.
