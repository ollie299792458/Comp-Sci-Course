One of my favorite movie taglines of all time is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305181926">The Ghost and the Darkness</a>:  Only the most incrediable parts of this story are true.  You could say that only the most touching parts of Paper Heart are true.

I think the thing that hurts this "hybrid documentary" premise more than anything is the recognizability of Michael Cera.  As soon as he shows up you're taken out of the movie.  He's great, but it's hard to keep going with the premise of the movie when he's there.  It would have been more transparent if his "character" was played by an unknown actor.

But forget about all that.  Forget about the oddball premsie.  This movie is great.  The interview sections are filled with poignant and funny tidbits from various people talking about their love lives.  Old married couples, gay couples, recently met couples.  The smartest thing about the film is that it avoids cynicism.  Even Yi's character, who is setup as a 23-year-old who, although it is never articulated, seems to reject the picture of love that is presented by popular culture, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118DQXI">Tristan und Isolde</a> up to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316015849">Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)</a>.  She's looking for something authentic, which she doesn't see in romantic comedies or epic poetry.  She talks to a lot of people who's continuing theme is just how great it is to be with someone.  There isn't much talk about the usual lovey-dovey stuff, flowers, hearts, feelings.  Instead, most of the talk focues upon companionship.

It's just nicer to go through all the crappy stuff in life with someone who shares it with you.

Yi's character finds her own kind of love with Cera, although she is loathe to admit it.  She wants a transformative experience, a sky-parting, doves in the air moment, the kind of thing that happens in the romantic comedies she rejects.  But that doesn't happen.  Instead, she finds someone who makes her happy.  Imagine that.

Special mention should be made of Jake Johnson who plays the playful and long-suffering director Nicholas Jasenovec, and the real Nicholas Jasenovec who directs the film with a graceful and beautiful style that seems like it could be a documentary film, if it was a really beautifully observed documentary film.  Cera & Yi also contributed a large amount of the music to the film, not only the ear-bleedingly bad <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IFHY86">Magic Perfume</a> but also a large part of the understated and haunting score.
