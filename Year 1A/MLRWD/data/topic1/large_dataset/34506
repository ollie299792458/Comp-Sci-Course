This is a very good action flick set in the early 80's.  The sets are well done and the period costume design is close enough to make me nostalgic.  Of course, this is a 2011 film done using modern equipment that makes actual 80's film quality pale significantly by comparison.

As a period piece set in the early 80's this Killer Elite (no relation to the 70's film with the same name) is a winner.  This is a fun film with a good amount of action and even some SAS action.

For some real SAS action from the early 80's one cannot do better than the 1982 film Who Dares Wins  -aka-  The Final Option.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0065IZJ1G">Who Dares Wins (1982) ( The Final Option ) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - Australia </a>]

Who Dares Wins features many actual SAS chaps and featured a great many scenes shot in actual SAS training facilities.  Fun stuff.

To my mind, 2011's Killer Elite and 1982's Who Dares Wins make a great double feature.

An important point: Blu Ray does not have the same regional encoding as DVD's.

Cheers,
