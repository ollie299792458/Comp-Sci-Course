The Graduate was ranked #7 in AFI's 100 Greatest movies. It was ranked #9 in AFI's 100 Funniest movies. I agree with both ranking. The Graduate is a funny and important film. The performance of Bancroft and Hoffman and Mike Nichol's direction helped the film. Dustin Hoffman portrayed a bright, but naive graduate student. Anne Bancroft as the seductive and icily feline Mrs. Robinson. Nichol's odd angles, jittery editing, and evocative wide-screen photography helped boost the artistic quality of the movie. The script was written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham. The script was simple. You could give it to ten different writers and the results will be interesting. The originality of the script and the performance helped boost the comedy level.
  The picture quality and the sound quality of the DVD was good for a 1967 movies. The interview with Dustin Hoffman and the making of the movie documentary was interesting and resourceful. The extras of the DVD was great but not excellent. I bought this movie at a price of 17.00(new). You can't expect too much at that price. I'm hoping that a Criterion Edition will be released for THE GRADUATE.

Conclusion: THE GRADUATE is one of the most influential and important movie of all time. The movie portrayed a confused, cut off, and trapped man trying to figure out what he is going to do with his future.  I recommend this movie to everybody who loves comedy and great movies.
