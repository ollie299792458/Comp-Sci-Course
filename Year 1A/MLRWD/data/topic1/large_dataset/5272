After watching CS Lewis' The Tales of Narnia and The Unfinished Life: Jennifer Lopez, Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman, I was kept awake by this 3rd heavy weight! Suddenly we were surrounded by Academy Award winners Ralph Fiennes, the Redgrave sisters, legendary producer, Ismail Merchant and director, James Ivory. The stunning Russian Countess, Sofia Belinskaya played amazingly artistcally by Natasha Richardson and her lovely daughter Kayta, captured our hearts, also those of Fiennes, his Japanese Spy friend, Matsuda and all others...

We both were immersed into the inner life of conflicting social life  of the Russian immigrants, the Jewish friend Fienstein and the Japanese Matusda. Their combined dreamlike operation of the White Countess Bar, Dancing, "Girls for hire" with their new styled Centerpiece as Hostess became the treat of Shanghai! That soon began a change into the setting of the Japanese Invasion because of turmoil of Social & Political Revolution. The uniquely different racial actors, Fiennes, Natasha, and Fienstein became united and resurrected into the same refuge boat to Macao.

Other overtones of Resurrection were quick flashbacks & flashes to the tragic loss of Diplomat Todd Jackson's daughter and his blindness! Altogether make quite a spell-binding, mysterious, artistically produced and acted movie. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood, "Barbara377" (Fayetteville GA United States)
