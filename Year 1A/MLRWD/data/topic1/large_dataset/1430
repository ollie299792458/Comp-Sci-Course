This film isn't for everyone, but for those who are open to it, they will find a film that tackles a question most of us would rather not answer.

What happens when what you've been taught to believe stands in stark contrast to who you are?  This is a difficult question to answer under the best of circumstances, but add religion and you might want to start running for the hills now.

Aaron is a good Mormon boy who loves his religion and is faithful to it.  So much so that he hides who he really is because of it.  That is until he meets the outwardly superficial and beautiful Christian. Christian is a party boy who collects conquests like other people collect stamps.  From the outside looking in these two are opposites.

What brings them together is a bet Christian makes with his friends. From this bet a bond forms between the two men.  Christian is made to question the life style he's been living and Aaron is made to question his place in his religion once he has started to accept his sexuality.  Both men have to face their demons and have to find their way out the other side of their own very personal hell.
