The dialogue is all a bunch of doublespeak.

None of the characters are remotely realistic, there's no human nature found in any of them.  Instead the script reads like socrates dialogue, with the viewer being spoonfed completely ridiculous notions.

The two main integretists simply come off as hippie idealists, what an irony.  At the same time every single reference to socialist ideas is simply argued with talking points constructed using only straw man arguments, black and white reasoning, and absurd oversimplification.

You seriously have to be retarded to take Ayn Rand seriously as a 'philosopher'.  She must have been a total idiot to think ANYTHING in this script made sense.

Oh and bonus points for the weak female that must be subjugated and dominated by the male.

As an aside, I waited far too long to expose myself to anything Ayn Rand.  I had always read about how all these dumb neo-cons looked up to her and her work.  There's nothing resembling intellect or even common sense here.  Just excuse after excuse for why people shouldn't have to help anyone else but themselves.  Pathetic.
