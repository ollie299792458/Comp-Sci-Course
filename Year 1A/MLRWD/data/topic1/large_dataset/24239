While it has been stated over and over again, it is absolutely true that you should see this documentary without knowing very much about it beforehand. That said, I found this documentary to be one of the most horrifying and beautiful story ever documented on film. I fell in love with the Bagby's while watching this story, and found myself in complete awe watching their love, courage, and strength of character throughout the evolution of this film.

 What this film so perfectly shows, is the best and worst of humanity at the same time. I was staggered, horrified, humbled, murderously angry, and finally, grateful to have watched this moving tribute to a man so many, many people loved. This film actually caused such an internal debate over if I should recommend it to my friend's and family. On the one hand, I felt that as many people as possible should watch this film if only to honor the life of a truly good man. While on the other hand, I knew, beyond any doubt, that watching this film is to have your heart torn out of your chest leaving a gaping wound.

 I am a first responder, so I wouldn't consider myself very thin-skinned at all. You learn quickly to develop coping skills to deal with some of the more tragic scenes you may be exposed to. Yet, with all of the things witnessed through the years, there are moments in this films that had me crying... Not a tear or two, but genuine crying...

 So, to solve the dilemma I have recommended it, but with a clear warning that it will leave you emotionally drained. You must watch it only when you have an entire day free afterward. I promise, you will be left completely drained and useless for hours afterward. I will close with the wish that I could let the Bagby's know just how much I respect and look up to them. They epitomize real strength and courage during times of utter and complete grief. I am truly in awe of them both.
