Although this was a remake of sorts, it also combined the paranoia element of the orginal short story to creat one of the greatest character pieces in film history.  The fact that its cast in only about a dozen actors is an element of its genius.  I originally saw this when I was 9 years old, and the kennel scene was probably the most disturbing thing I had seen up to that point in my life.  It stayed with me for years (that's how powerful this movie was).  You also can't mention this movie without the stellar male cast; Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, et all made up of some of the finest character actors of the 1980s.  In my opinion, this was the high point of the Russell/Carpenter collaboration.  Although Escape From New York & Big Trouble in Little China were fun romps, this goes down as their timeless masterpiece.  I hear they're remaking this movie, as with all John Carpenter films, but nothing will ever hold a candle to this cast, this story, the production design, the superb FX from Rob Botin, and of course the masterful direction of John Carpenter.  Do yourself a favor this Halloween, and buy this movie.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
