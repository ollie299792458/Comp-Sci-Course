I wasn't even born when "Civilization" was broadcast in 1969-70, but as a college student in the late 1990's, my Art History class and I viewed this excellent series as part of our classroom lectures.  I found it a supurb presentation of every epoch of Western Art from the so called "Dark Ages" of the 5th century A.D., through the glories of the Gothic ,renaissance and Baroque periods, up until our own modern period.
Each era of Art History along the journey of Western man was beautifully presented by the late art historian, the great Sir Kenneth Clark.  He was infinitly more knowledgable about art , and presented the series not in a dull, irritating monologue, but in a lively and enthusiastic manner that drew each of us in class into a deeper appreciation of Western Art.
When I saw this series for sale on Amazon, I had to buy it, because I remembered the magnificent presentations from my college days.  I'm happy to have it in my dvd collection.  It's something I take great pride in owning, and anyone who loves art should buy this series and give it pride of place in their own collections!!
