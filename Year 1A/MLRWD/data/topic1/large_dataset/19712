Three types of people should see this film.  Anybody interested in religion. Anybody interested in great cinema.  Anybody interest in Western Civilization.
But if don't fit into either of these three categories, there are still reasons for watching this masterpiece.  It's an epic, it's seminal, it features two of the greatest actors in movie history (Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner) and one of movie's greatest directors of all time (Cecil DeMille), all of whom perform magnificently, and it's a great story to boot. Watch it, you'll enjoy it! But even if you don't, it's still a good three hours spent, as you'll probably soak up a little culture along the way.
In all honesty, you can't go wrong watching this movie.  There are just certain movies that everybody should watch (e.g., Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, 2001) because they make up such a large part of the society's Jungian collective unconscious, just like there are certain books everyone should read (e.g., Iliad, Republic, Divine Commedy).  This is one of those movies, and it is well done at that.
