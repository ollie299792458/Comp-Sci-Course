Film about population & resource control in a future post-war setting.

Cool retro-futuristic sets; definitely 70's style fashion and decor. Great actors, they're all easy to identify with and are believable in their roles. I can put this movie on frequently and enjoy it every time; there aren't any lulls in the plot or "unnecessary fluff." I haven't read the book, from what I hear the movie leaves out/changes details- But if you haven't read the book, you obviously aren't going to miss it and it's still very enjoyable. It makes you want to read the book afterward to hear more about the world of Logan's Run.

I've heard this film compared to "The Island," which I have also seen. I really think Island is more like "Coma" with Michael Douglas.

Logan's Run is mainly about population/resource control out of necessity to maintain humanity, while "The Island" and "Coma" are about Money/Greed by showing how far people will go to live longer and what business'll do to make it possible for those that can afford it.

In Island & Coma, the motivation for keeping the 'secluded world of clones' is not for survival as much as the chase for immortality and the resultant immoral lengths people take to attain it.

Logan's Run is about the chase of truth and freedom, to escape from their isolated dome world to discover a deserted, isolated earth. Though they are killed at 30, it is humane in contrast to the mutilation of those in Coma/Island.
