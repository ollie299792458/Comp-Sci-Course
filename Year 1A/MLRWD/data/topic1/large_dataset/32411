Honestly, I would give this film negative stars if I could!!  This movie made me angry.  I literally sat in the movie theatre shaking my head throughout the entire film muttering to myself, "That's wrong... that's wrong.... that's wrong..."
The changes that the director made to this film were totally unnecessary.  As someone who ADORES these books, here are just a few of the things that bothered me.
1.  Why does Annabeth have brown hair?  *seriously, how hard is it to find a blonde actress?*
2.  Where was Clarisse?  She's a huge part of the books.
3.  Why did they have to make Riptide a clicker pen?
4.  Chiron's flanks were supposed to be white... why did they make him have brown horse hair?
5.  They wasted the first part of the movie with showing him in the water.  We find out quick enough who his dad is.
6.  Grover is supposed to have long curly hair to cover his horns.
7.  The Hydra was in the 2nd book... not the first
8.  The whole fight scene with Luke was just horrid.  The scene in the book would have been so much more effective.
9.  The search for the pearls?  Not in the book at all.... wasted time and missed out on great details in the book (like the mattress store scene)
10.  Persephone had nothing to do with his time in Hades.
11.  Hades isn't supposed to look like Hell.  It's not the same place as Christians think of.

As you can see, I have severe issues with this film.. I read this series to my students each year and they LOVE the books.... it's sad that such great books were disrespected by such a poorly made film.
