This film documents events which took place in a way that no other film ever has.  The six moon landings are lumped into what seems like one mission; there are no scientific facts given about how many megatons of thrust there were, how long the dynamic calculations took to compute with 60s technology, or for that matter any facts you could not easily look up on wikipedia like the majority of documentaries provide.  This film provides insight that you cannot find anywhere else unless you know the astronauts personally.  The narration represents pure emotion spoken from the astronauts themselves--they explain their anxiety, experience, and how heart dropping every facet of the mission was.

The footage is like non-other--I'm sure all of the other reviews talk about this, but I must agree.  It is just beautiful.  The music works so perfectly for each scene.  Brian Eno's soundscapes work so well for this documentary.  Whether it be his uplifting motivational sounding floaty ambiance for the space walk and weightless scenes, or the dark brooding drones which are played during the moon rover shots.

I love this movie, I bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it.  Buy it-- you'll want to watch it again.  Whenever you are browsing over your dvd collection and see this one, you will want to watch it again, or at least say, "I need to watch this again!"

If you are strictly looking for a technical documentary loaded with facts about engineering, the materials of the space craft, the mechanisms for thrust, landing, earth approach, etc., etc., then this dvd is not for you--but if you want to view a documentary like non other made that will captivate you emotionally and present beautiful images of another world, then just buy it!
