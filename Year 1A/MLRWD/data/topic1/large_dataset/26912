"While You Were Sleeping" has become one of my very favorite movies, so easy to watch, or to relax and fall asleep to. So nice.  It has no violence.  It does have intelligent humor, and loving family relationships, and deep friendships, and understanding and acceptance.  And welcoming hearts.  It is happy and funny and romantic and touching, and not slow or tedious.  The actors in this film are absolutely perfect for

their roles, and their work is so good, so right-on, that, as you

watch it, THEY ARE those characters.  You will fall in love with

them, and you will probably want to see more of their lives, as

a family, and as friends.

Right now, this is my favorite Sandra Bullock film, and my favorite for Bill Pullman, too.  Darling, gentlemanly.  Loved him.

And, I was so happy to get to experience the wonderful work of such fine character actors as Glynis Johns, Jack Warden, Peter

Boyle, and Micole Mercurio.  They were all just outstanding.  And, of course, there was the handsome Peter Gallagher, and the amazing and gorgeous and funny Ally Walker.  I also loved Ally's starring work in another of my favorite movies, "If You Believe", which, I believe, was a Lifetime Movie Original.

There are also other characters who really add to the fun, and

actors whose work you will appreciate.

"While You Were Sleeping" is one of those movies of which I have to own at least three DVDs, so I have one for each area of my house, where I have a DVD player. You just can't go wrong, with

this one, for yourself, and as gifts.
