The 7th and final season of The Shield wrapped up the series in a very unpredictable way, and kept viewers on the edges of their seats waiting for the next event <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020TS5EM">The Shield: Season Seven - The Final Act</a>in the ongoing saga of The Barn's denizens-the good, bad and ugly! The way that Vic Mackey both shows his true stripes and betrays the Strike Team in the end was both unexpected and genius, and his punishment(after much contemplation on my part) both deserved and fitting! The suprising thing is how much I ended up caring for Dutch and Wyms, and enjoyed Mackey getting his due! Kudos to a great cast and writing team!
 The DVD includes commentary and deleted scenes that greatly add to the production-one which I will watch over and over again! If for no other reason, get this set for the Emmy award acting of Michael Chiklis-he made Vic Mackey the best amoral character since William Petersen's portrayal of Chance in "To Live and Die in L.A."
