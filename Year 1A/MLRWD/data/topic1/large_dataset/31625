For some reason the video quality sucks on the whole thing.  Even the still shots inserted in the History of Iron maiden is very grainy.  I could pull out my old Maiden photo book (forgot the name) and scan it at 150 dpi and come up with a better resolution of the same shots than what they show on the video.  (what is up???)  The live after death video is very grainy!
I own the original VHS and it is better quality than this DVD.  If I made a real time copy of VHS using a DVD recorder it would be better than this DVD version.  All other videos are even worse! Rock in Rio is shaky, choppy and grainy.  Behind the iron curtain is ok and Ello texas is a GEM.  A little disappointed with the Live after death video.  The sound is great through out.  Some how I get the feeling they didn't put the effort into this DVD as they did with the History of IRon maiden 1.  I think they are touring too much and don't have time to even do a quality control check on the product before it is released.  And also this DVD costs about $5 more than the History of Iron Maiden vol 1.  Man, I am a die hard maiden fan but I do have the balls to call it like it is!!
