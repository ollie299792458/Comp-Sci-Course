The special effects are good, as is the underlying concept, the mutation that makes them superheroes also makes them outcasts. But the storyline is somewhat simple. What really holds this film together are four great performances.
Hugh Jackman is perfect as the powerful Wolverine, the loner who only joins the X-men so as to save his beloved Rogue.  Oscar winner Anna Paquin is beautiful and heartbreaking as the tragic Rogue, denied the ability to ever touch anyone without killing them. Paquin and Jackman's scenes together are truly touching.  And Patrick Stewart's verbal duels with Ian McKellen are masterful. This is actually a very intelligent film. Not great art, but definitely great fun.
The home release also includes deleted scenes that everyone agrees should never have been deleted in the first place. The scenes flesh out the characters and add much needed background info. You'll also want to see Hugh Jackman's screen test with Anna Paquin. Supposedly, his chemistry with Paquin is what convinced director Bryan Singer to cast him in the movie.
