I saw this movie on TV when I was about 6 years old and it scared the hell out of me.  Horror movies haven't really scared me in a long time but I  still think this one is way cool.  The premise of this film is completely  absurd, yet wildly original.  I almost want to call it surrealistic.  Vincent Price is at his very best in this one as he switches from being the  kind, gentle voice of reason to the witty, sarcastic, vengeful husband of a  cheating, cold-hearted woman, and the calmly deranged doctor who is  obsessed with the phenomenon of being scared to death.  Price makes the  many facets of his character's personality blend  smoothly, giving him the  quality of a very subtle madman.  Fans of Vincent Price know exactly what  I'm talking about because nobody can do this as well as he could.  There's  something about the combination of William Castle and Vincent Price that  really clicks.  My two favorite Price films are this one and House on  Haunted Hill, which were both directed by Castle.  It's a shame they didn't  work together in more films.  I really can't say enough about Vincent Price  or this movie.  If you're into this kind of stuff, you need to have this  one in your collection.  You will want to watch it again and again.
