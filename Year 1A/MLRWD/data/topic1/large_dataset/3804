The weird thing about this movie is that I disliked it more out of frustration then quality (which is still poor ... don't get the wrong idea).  I actually liked that idea the each movie that comes out would have  it's own unique spin.  Sometimes I find that the problem with sequels is  that the whole movie seems forced in a way.  So going into the movie, for  a moment or two, I'm feeling this sequel has the potential to be better  than the first Crow. Unfortunately everyone on this movie seemed to just  drop the ball and after the first twenty minutes any momentum Goyer's story  had gained disintegrates into same revenge-o-rama that was found in the  first movie. And for all his luscious command of texture, Pope cut his  teeth making music videos - and it shows. He pads the now-uneventful story  with at least three. There's the "Just Discovered I'm The Crow and I  Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle" video. There's the "Here's L.A. By  Night, Sort of Looks Like Blade Runner" video (a perennial hit with  many sci-fi directors). And there's the "I Want To Fall in Love With  You But I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle Instead" video. Despite the  fact that the soundtrack includes music by Hole, Filter, Bush, White  Zombie, Seven Mary Three, P.J. Harvey and N.Y. Loose, these sequences are  cotton wadding for the mind.  The movie, in the end, is even less - and  that's a pity. The first Crow was undone by circumstances beyond anyone's  control. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce, and around whom it was hoped they could  build a series) was accidentally shot to death during a stunt, and the film  released was pasted together from the action sequences, which were most of  what they'd managed to film. Here, with Perez - visually, a virtual double  for Lee- they had an opportunity to give a fascinating idea for a franchise  a proper launch, and they've blown it.
