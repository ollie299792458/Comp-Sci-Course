This was such a great show... well-casted except for the ugly redheaded daughter.  They should have made the daughter look like Lucy Ewing.  The show was missing a hot a$$ until Ana Alicia showed up.  Also, I loved Jane Wyman in her part but it was kind of awkhard to have two men racing for her affections.  If they were going to have a man hot for Angela Channing, the actress who played Chase's mother would have been better in the role.  Notwithstanding that, Jane was perfect as Angela.

I'm glad the mystery finally was "revealed" about Chase's father because if I had to listen to yet another "I'll tell what I know about Jason's death", I would have screamed!  LOL!  Still not sure how Angela didn't face a charge of some kind.

Emma Channing belongs locked in a sealed room with only Chai-Li to go in there.  Talk about a basket case.  And am I the only person who thinks Jason molested Emma...?  I know, huh?

And I'm sorry but there is no way Lance and the Agretti girl wouldn't have been attracted to one another.  Maybe Ana Alicia should have been the daughter of Chase and Maggie and the ugly redhead been the Agretti girl.  It would have made more sense to see why Lance was NOT attracted to her.  Lorenzo and Ana were a gorgeous couple.

On a racial note, I hated every time Lance called Vickie's Latino boyfriend "picker".  That sounded so racist.  And isn't Lorenzo Lamas a Latino too?  What was so different about him opposed to the other Mexicans on the show?  LOL!
