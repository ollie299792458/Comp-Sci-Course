Reviewer coming from someone who never read the book:

Movie starts out pretty good actually. The tension and suspense fit the mood of the movie, with an attempted suicide, a car accident, and some haunted childhood flashbacks. You kinda want to know about these guys and their mysterious past. The part with Jason Lee on the toilet was inventive and exciting, and you feel like you will be in a great ride of a movie.

Then the horror begins, the horror being how terrible and unwatchable this movie turns into. It's just so crappy a plot and the acting is so dumb. Morgan Freeman looks so bored and just a waste of supreme talent. Jonesy talking to himself in a British accent is just laughable, and I actually cringed when it happened, almost embarrassed for the actor (who is a pretty decent actor outside this movie).

If only the movie continued on from the potential beginning, this would have been a decent watchable horror thriller. Like focus on the 4 guys in the cabin and their haunted past, while fighting a couple aliens with their powers or something, and just forgot about the rest.

OH WELL!
