The main problem with making a movie from this book is that the entire all-enveloping theme is that you remove yourself from the world of sight and find out how people and life are at their core, especially in an unexpected and horrific situation. This can be a little distracting when you're simply sitting and staring at it with your own presumably intact sight. Alot of impact of the metaphor and "symbolism" (if you can call it that without images?) delivered by Saramago's book relies on the fact that the characters can't see each other. For example, they introduce themselves by their jobs because their names are meaningless without faces to represent them. You can forget nuances like this while looking at the faces of the actors and assigning them identity as soon as they enter a scene.

Alot of the criticism obviously sprouts from a misunderstanding of the story. Why did the movie end this way? Because the book did. Why didn't they explain the blindness? Because it was written specifically to get you to focus on themes underscoring the surface plot and events. Why this, why that? The book, the book, the book. If anything, the director should be applauded for developing such a worthy shooting style and choosing scenes which were worthy efforts towards reimagining emotions and notions from the book. The colors were bland and washed out, the scenes were bare with very little musical score to speak of... all, if you were really paying attention, purposely brought about the same sense of desolation in the viewer that the characters must have been feeling. I'm sorry this wasn't a Sci-Fi Hollywood thrill ride, but it really shouldn't be and wasn't meant to be. Shame on you for suggesting such.
