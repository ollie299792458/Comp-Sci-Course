I'm quit the fan of found footage horror films, and I was very pleased with Grave Encounters. The film builds the atmosphere very well, by allowing the supernatural events to start small and then grow as the night continues. The characters are well established, and I found the obvious jab at Paranormal State very amusing (I especially found the main actors channeling of Ryan Buell's self-important airs was spot on, as was the "off camera" hoaxing.)

There are some flaws. A few of the special effects fail, but generally they do a very good job of keeping the over the top special effects to a minimal to avoid them looking too cheesy.  Part of the ending is clich&eacute;, and didn't really need to be part of the film. It's scary enough to think of a doctor experimenting on his patients unscrupulously for science.  The added "surprise" motivation ( I won't go into it to spoil the end) is just cheesy.

The actors are very convincing however, and I very much liked how the movies messes with time, and physical space, and the idea that less is more in what you see.  While it's not a perfect horror film, it's one of the better in the found footage genre.
