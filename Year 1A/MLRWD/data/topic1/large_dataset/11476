"Requiem for a Dream" is arguably the most horrific and shocking American film I have ever seen. It is brutal, honest, and sadly depressing, and I didn't expect anything more when I first saw it. Saying that "Requiem for a Dream" is over-the-top and exaggerated is like saying that an orange isn't a fruit. It is not exaggerated, but instead a fast-edited, well-directed masterpiece directed by Darren Aronofsky. The story concerns a lady named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) who lives in Coney Island and is sometimes visited by her junkie son Harry (Jared Leto). She subscribes to diet pills after being selected as a guest on her favorite TV show. However, her addiction to the pills gets stronger as her son, his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) all become victims of drugs.

 Burstyn gives probably her best performance to date, same for Leto and Connelly in a very good performance. Wayans gives his first dramatic role and possibly also his best. Darren Aronofsky gives an outstanding direction, the editing is wonderful, and the music is one of the best movie themes I have heard in a while. Very powerful and horrific, "Requiem for a Dream" is one of the 50 best films of all time. If "Requiem for a Dream" can't teach you to stay out of the influence of drugs, then what can?
