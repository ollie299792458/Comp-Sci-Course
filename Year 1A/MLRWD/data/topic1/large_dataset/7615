Upon hearing the movie's plot from a friend and the Twilight overnight sensation star Kristen Stewart, I really thought this is just another teenage flick. Although there are some cheeky scenes, it is still better than I expected.
The plot is very simple. James(Eisenberg) plays a typical high school graduate who has good grades and has a bright future. He dreams of going to the Big Apple and studying there. But he's broke. He ended up getting a job at a theme park called Adventureland. It kinda looks like a crappy job with kids vomiting, adults cheating for their kids and obnoxious teens on group dates. But when he finally meets his dream girl in co-worker Em (Stewart), everything changed. It isn't a typical teenage love story because there are some twists and conflicts like a secret love affair. (Spoiler, sorry.) Considering this is from Director Greg Mottola, this lacks hilarious scenes like those in Superbad or Knocked Up. But thanks to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who play the couple who runs the park, there are laugh-worthy scenes. There's also a tinge of indie vibe in this film with all those music (especially the music!), the lines and their clothes (that Games, Games, Games gray t-shirt).
The thing that impresses me most about this whole movie are both the performances of Eisenberg and Stewart. They fit the characters perfectly. They're so believable. You'll wonder if Eisenberg's really that awkward in real-life and Stewart showed she was just another confused kid.
It wasn't that outstanding or Oscar-worthy but what's important is that it entertained. If you liked Juno, you will definitely dig this.
