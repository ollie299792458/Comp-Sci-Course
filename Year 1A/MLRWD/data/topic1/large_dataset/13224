This film was infamous for years and years for being one of the most controversial ever. But why? The film is filled with cold blooded killings, but only one happens in any graphic nature. The sound quality of it is very poor, you can constantly hear the crew shufferling their feet off screen and. Much of the camera work has been underlit or lit very badly so the actors disaper into the darkness or are parshally bathed in a nasty orange tungston light as well as being out of focas at times.
There is a solid story in this movie, but the troubble is its hidden beneith the Bad camera work and crappy sound job. It also feels like there where big chunks missing from the final edit. 
Able ferra made this film over a couple of years, Directing and acting in it himself (under the name Jimmy Lane), and to his credit the actings not to bad, i mean his not Marlon Brando or any thing but he is passable. 
As an acivement Driller Killer has to be praised, because although i do not enjoy the film it did get able ferra into the limelight and he did got on to make some great films like King of new york and Ms. 45. But as film i would say aviod Driller Killer and watch King of new york.
