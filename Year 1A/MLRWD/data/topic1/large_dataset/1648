Don't get me wrong - I'm an avid fan. I love the story lines that The Krip develops, and I love the overall story arc. I'm confident that this will continue to be a "kick a$$" series. However, I was more than a little disappointed by the extras this season...

I loved the introduction of the background pieces for some of the episodes. I also felt that while the Gag reel was necessarily shorter (less material with fewer episodes of high jinks to draw from), it still had some great content. I was also very pleased that "Bobby" received the necessary limelight.

But when all was said and done, I didn't feel it was filled with the love that the first two season packs contained. Specifically...
No Episode Narrations - I love those.
The Impala piece was short and not a little clunky.
Overall it just felt a little underdone. I'm assuming another affect of the shortened season.

Now, despite my little moanfest, this is an awesome series, with fabulous cast and crew, with amazing fans. Each episode stands on its own and deserves absolute support (although I hope I never succumb to mind washed slave like devotion). I will continue to purchase each and every series, and no doubt continue to play them until they are unplayable and I need to purchase new sets. Just like the first two seasons.
