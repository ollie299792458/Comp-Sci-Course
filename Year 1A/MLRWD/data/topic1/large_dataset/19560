Very funny, and a good place to start for a new Mystery Science Theater viewer.

This was a schlocky 60's teen film where caveman Eegah(a desert sulfur spring serving as his fountain of youth) falls head over heels for Roxie, the teen heroine.  (Personally, I thought Roxie was rather skankish, probably pushing 30, and I thought one of the Bots made a good remark about her being "shaped funny" during her bikini scene).

Teen hero played by dorky Arch Hall Jr. is lampooned mercilessily and justifiably by the MST3K crew.  Speaking of dork -- Roxie's dad is played by real life father Arch Hall Sr.  The apple didn't fall far from the tree in that family.

Lots of delightfully wierd stuff . . . the caveman has his mummified dead family propped up in the cave . . . Dad basically hands his daughter over to the pawing, hormone gushing neanderthal . . . and how about the uncomfortably inappropriate scene where Roxie sings to her Dad while shaving him!  YIKES!! I found myself trying to see what he was doing with his hands!

The Bots were also on their game during the commercial breaks. They set up a machine to transform Joel's face to look like Arch Hall Jr.  And Tom Servo freezes Crow down to absolute zero . . . and he disintegrates.
