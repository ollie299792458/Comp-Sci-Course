Joe Kingman (Dwayne Johnson) is a successful quarterback who has it all, fame, money, friends, his own restaurant, nice home, fun cars and an ex-wife he hasn't seen in seven years.  His success has led him down the path of selfishness and ego mania. Joe and his teammate friends make fun of the one guy who goes home to his family rather than party and go wild with them; but there are times when he reminds them that at the end of the day they go home alone and beyond material things they really have nothing.

Late one night a 7-year-old beautiful little girl, named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis), shows up at Joe's door and tells him she's the daughter he and his ex-wife shared, even though her mother never told him about her.  There are a few secrets and non-truths she's keeping to herself though.

Unsure what to do with this new found information he calls his manager, Stella Peck (Kyra Sedgwick), to take care of the situation.  Stella proves to not be kid friendly and seems more confused than Joe.  Perhaps the most surprising point of this movie is that I was expecting him to treat Peyton hard and cold, but he uses patience, except for a few uncontrollable moments.

Time goes by and Peyton changes Joe's views on family, ballet, little girls and the fact that life's not all being number one; she actually humbles him.  Even his teammates gain a new found appreciation for things that aren't always so masculine.  Stella, on the other hand, has Joe's career interest in mind and unwittingly causes Peyton to make the choice of doing what's best for the quarterback who has become Number 1 in her life and returning to the life she had before the late night arrival that took her from being unknown to being the center of Joe's world.

They are love stories intertwined but they aren't with who you might think they are. This movie is heartwarming, funny, surprising, loving, family oriented and one of those movies I know I'll watch more than once.
