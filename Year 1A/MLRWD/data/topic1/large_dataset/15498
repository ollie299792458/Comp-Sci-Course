My take on Hard Candy is different from most. I see it as an exploitation movie, and a terrific one at that. If you think about it, HC is a much more sophisticated take on what Hershell Gordon Lewis was turning out 40 years ago. (Interesting that Lewis is referenced in Ellen Page's Juno).

As soon as I saw Jeff "tasting" the chocolate on Hayley's trembling lips, I knew this was not a movie to be taken seriously.

There's no "message" HC. It is not a "teaching moment." It just uses pedophilia to amp up what is essentially a movie about an exciting showdown.

The movie is about verbal sparring (the comparison to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is right on), mind control, psychological terror and suspense. He insists on his innocence. She is determined to drag a confession out of him. The tables keep turning.

The "castration scene," I thought, was pretty funny (and I'm a guy). Another funny scene is "tasered" Jeff coming at her with a knife. On his knees.

The end seems solemn, but is really a joke. Listen carefully to the last two words Hayley speaks. Cracked me up.

I chuckled all the way through HC. Maybe I'm just a sick pup.
