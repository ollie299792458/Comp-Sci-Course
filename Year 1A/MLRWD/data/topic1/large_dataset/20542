My feeling is that most people who buy this set will do so because they either () want to complete their 'Ape' collections, or (b) have fond memories of the show. I've read reviews that suggest that, relative to the remainder of the 'Ape' collection, this TV series is a poor cousin, rated just above the animated TV series. The most credible criticism is, having taken away any clear goal of the characters, we're left with a bit of  pointless meandering.
The astronauts from the future suggest that they had 'west' or 'south' with no real clear purpose, save for their 'escape of the week' from the resident baddies, General Urko, and/or Dr. Zaius. Thankfully they have the wonderful Roddy McDowall as Galen accompanying them along the way and lifting the tone of the show.
Whilst those complaints are valid, the show stands tall as an example of a fair translation to the small screen from the large. I can remember huddling around the set hanging to watch each episode. We have to remember this pre-dated  videos - the movies were only a big screen or repeated on TV experience - so these were a real thrill!
So for the purposes of nostalgia, this TV series is a rush. Admittedly, the DVD menus are a bit clunky and hesitant, but this trip into the distant future is an enjoyable trip back in time for a lot of us!
