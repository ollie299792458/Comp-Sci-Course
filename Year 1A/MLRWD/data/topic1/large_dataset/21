Despite the legend, only 150 men were lost and Nolan bore a good part of the responsibility for pointing off in a general direction and refusing to give details of his instructions.  Victorian politics and aristocrat feuds bore the rest.

The first part of this film sets it remarkably well.  The convolutions of "Class" structure and arogance worked for years before this battle to lose the Light Brigade.

Hemmings' Nolan isn't nearly arrogant enough. And Raglan and Cardigan were worse than presented.

I personally enjoy reading about the intrigues of this battle and its unfortunate personalities.  The devil is in the details and this film details the wretched conditions of the unfortunate British grunt and the drudgery and distilled *filth* of War. Even the officers in this one were reduced to unwashed bodies and clothes for weeks. The Light Brigade went into battle looking like they'd already lost it.

The horses fared worse, 5000 remounts dying of neglect and starvation in a pen in the harbor before the battle. Several hundred more lost in the battle -- more than the number of men lost.

One of the better "eye witness" accounts of this Charge can be read in Anna Sewell's "Black Beauty" when old Captain -- a horse who survived -- gives his stablemates a blow by blow description.  Even the cavalry horses suffered from victimization by elitist arrogance.  This movie misses that. But given its grim subject matter, adding the slaughter of horses would make it unwatchable.

I like the layering in this film.  It "looks" right. But it feels terrible.
