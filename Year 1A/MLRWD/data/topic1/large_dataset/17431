A summer rental of a seaside villa on the Italian Riviera is the setting for two married couples to try to spend some quality time together and work out their respective issues.  Shary feels she is the intellectual superior to her husband Diego, while Francesca's insecurities drive Matteo crazy.  When Shary and Diego's handsome, college-age son, David (a swimsuit model) comes to spend time with his parents, it leads to further disagreements between his parents. But the real eye-opener is the fact that Matteo, who never felt completely comfortable in his marriage, finds himself irresistibly drawn to David, setting up a situation that will forever affect both couples.

This a very dark, emotional melodrama about compatibility and "keeping up appearances," which I found more than a bit forced and unnatural in places, A classic drama about an idyllic situation that turns into tragedy, beautifully photographed and capably acted, but occasionally tough to watch due to its emotional bite.  Soundtrack is (mostly) Italian, with subtitles in English.  DVD extras include only trailer and chapter stops.  I give this three stars out of five.
