I got this film's number. Read on if you're ready for some spoilers.

In this nifty genre-bending script (It's an action/horror/sci-fi plot with Earth Day subtext), the Spierig Bros' post-human world applies common vampire lore to a mass population. Interesting. Ethan Hawke plays a scientist in search of a cure, while the vampires in power merely want to uphold the status quo. Then, the humans show up (watch for a blatant disregard for the world's rules), and a delicate trust is formed. Great cinematography and excellent monster makeup from Weta sweetens the deal.
The overwhelming odds stack up quickly, and keep you watching through the middle 50 minutes, when the convoluted discovery of double-cures in Act III trips you up ("heeey - this is all MADE UP") and from there, the filmmakers wrap up the plot hastily in a skyscraper's lobby - just enough for a closed story, but not enough for a sequel. A new genre is introduced: zombie gorefest, and a new, underdeveloped villain gets a slow-mo death scene. The promises they seem to make (world-curing epidemic, fantastic flaming vampire cures) never really pan out, and the movie is the lesser for it.  A rare weak pick for Ethan Hawke, who's always interesting to watch. Willem Dafoe - of course!

A little disappointing, but I think I'll be looking out for the Spierig Brothers next film nonetheless.
