Battlestar Galactica: Razor

This episode has all the earmarks of the landmark series. Exceptional characterization. Tight writing. Non stop action. And the hint of what is to come...
"Razor" is an amazing episode. The story of power transfer aboard the Pegasus with the death of Commander Cain to Lee Adama is compelling, and the multi-layered plot lines interset at a single fine line...a razor sharp knife handed down from Cain to Kendra Shaw to Starbuck. Lee Adama, with his assumption of command of the Pegasus, struggles with the assignment. Choosing non-Pegasus officers will alienate the crew of the ship. Choosing Pegasus personel will ensure a less than peaceful transfer of power.

The son of Adama chose wisely. Kendra Shaw was both Cains' XO and a natural choice for Lee. Even with her checkered past and blind obedience to Cain, her experience and mental toughness were assets to the fleet. Survival in space could and did mean difficult choices. Killing for supplies, and abandonment of surivors brought both commendation and condemnation. Survivors tells tales where dead men cannot. Shaw survived sharper, more wise, and colder.
Her final test came when a bold plan to draw the cylons away (the old ones) from the fleet lead to one ship and a chilling prediction of the future of mankind. While Adama fought with Adama over deployment of nuclear weaons, Shaw learned and warned as she could. Her final revelation could not be delivered, and her final act was one of heroism and legacy.
This is such an important episode. Drawing viewers back and forth from past to present, the direction and plot lines fill in many gaps. The revelation that Adama was there at the armistice and witnessed the `birth`of the hybrid Cylons gives much clarity to his cynicism. The future collides with the past in `Razor``.
Give this episode an award already folks. It rocks!
