Watching The West Wing always gave me the sense that, flawed as our leaders may be, they have the country's best interest at heart, and they work incredibly hard. Everything we always loved about this series is there in the last season: the scripts, the cast, the acting. If the early seasons seemed to describe the Clinton Administration, the last season, almost eerily, presaged the presidential election of 2008. There's the little-known,  minority Democratic senator (Jimmy Smits), young and handsome,  campaigning against the Republican veteran (Alan Alda), decent but ruthless, who's too liberal for some in his party. Santos (Smits) chooses a seasoned politician for a running mate; Vinick (Alda) chooses a running mate from the evangelical right. To add to the sense of immediacy, there's even a debate between Alda and Smits that was filmed live. Aside from Smits and Alda, the cast is stunning: Kristin Cheoweth, Stockard Channing, Janeane Garafalo, Ron Silver, Marlee Matlin, Patricia Richardson, Lily Tomlin, Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, Bradley Whitford, and Martin Sheen. And, of course, the wonderful actor John Spencer, who unexpectedly died before the season was over. The way his real death was acknowledged in terms of his character remains incredibly moving. Finally, there's the the outstanding writing that creates suspense without violence and gives the feel of being inside the White House, the campaign plane, and the hotel rooms where decisions are made.
