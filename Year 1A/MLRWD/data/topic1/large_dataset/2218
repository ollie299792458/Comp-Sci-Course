...well, i'm not about to explain where that punch line came from but you'll get to hear in the first 15 minutes. it sets the stage for lot's o' sophomoric humor that's definitely NOT for the younger teens. there are also mild explicatives throughout.
what it does illustrate, IMHO, is how well jokes were written for the English version. there're a lot of over-the-top humor in El Hazard that have been adapted well into colloquial English plus the voice acting is quite good.
as noted by other reviewers, this DVD boxset contains the excellent OAV, El Hazard - the Alternate World and the fair made-for-TV series, EL Hazard2 - the Wanderers.
you'll notice right away that the OAV (disk 1&2) has consistantly good animation throughout while the TV series' (disk 3)animation goes from good to average. the story in the OAV is much tighter and centers around a highschool freshman, Makoto. he along with his teacher and two schoolmates, upon discovering ancient ruins underneath, of all places, their school, promptly gets transported to the land of El Hazard. once there, they are asked to help save the land of El Hazard from the opposing Bugrom forces -- needless to say, this involves the usual cross dressing, new found super powers, meeting alternate lifestyles and, of course, brief nudity. 
the TV series picks up right after the OAV and deals with a search for Makoto's teacher and running into another force that could destroy El Hazard and the resurgence of the Bugrom forces.
El Hazard is pretty unique, though the best way for me to describe it is that the story is more 'Tenchi' while the jokes more 'Ranma 1/2'... but very funny.
yeah, this boxset isn't cheap but if you've had a chance to see it, you'd be exempt from 'Fujisawa's Fists of Justice'!!!
