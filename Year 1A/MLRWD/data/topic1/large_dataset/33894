I remember feeling excited about this movie when I saw the previews.
Finally!  A movie about the oddness one would feel if travelling in
a usually hostile land.  When I saw "The Band" trailer, it seemed
hilarious.  An Egytian Band touches down in Israel with the intention
of playing at the opening of a cultural center.  Their egotistical
band leader gets them lost beyond help and they end up staying where
they are stranded in a small town where there are quirky but sleepy
characters.  The only problem is...it wasn't funny.  I found myself
wanting to laugh.  The movie gets heavy really fast.  The serousness
of these characters lives: an aging divorcee, an arguing young couple,
a social awkward young adult all bog down the storyline.  In the end
all you can manage to do is shake your head.  The only humor in the
movie, as the band tries in the beginning to make their way around
Israel, is the sense that you're the butt of the joke.  As an Egyptian-American, I was looking forward to this movie; in the end I regretted buying it.
