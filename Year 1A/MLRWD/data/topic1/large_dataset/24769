I figured Mystery, Alaska would be an okay movie, something to see with my wife on a Saturday night but nothing to write home about.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying Mystery, Alaska; it's actually  a very well-edited, well-written film which overcomes its cliches through  good acting and an unusual plotline.  
Anyone who has lived in a small  town and experienced small town sports will immediately find a soft spot  for this movie.  Much like the boys in Hoosiers, the heroes of Mystery,  Alaska are the over-achieving yet mysteriously talented local boys who play  an entirely different brand of hockey than the glitzy millionaires from New  York. Yet the millionaires don't get villified; the movie isn't about them  at all. This is a movie about community more than sports.  
One of the  most effective elements of the film is the opening credits. The stunning  visual imagery of a young man skating a frozen river in the middle of  nowhere is just plain cool, in my humble opinion!
Mystery, Alaska is a  movie about friendship and support in adversity, and how you can always  forgive one of your own when they set off for "bigger and better  things."  I would highly recommend Mystery, Alaska for anyone who  sometimes just wants to go home again.
