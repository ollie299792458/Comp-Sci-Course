After several years of pain-staking search for the accurate and non-deviating portrayal of the Bible, the Visual Bible people finally made one that is definitely worth owning!  Such fabulous attention to detail, and accuracy in the relaying of The Word, you will be moved forever!  If you are into glitz, glamour, and embellishment of the Truth, you will not like this, then again, you won't like the Bible either!  What Christ has done for us and why He came is spelled out in Matthew through the inspired writing of Matthew.  For some, reading Scripture is confusing or difficult.  To have several senses taking in The Word makes it stick with you and be moved by the Holy Spirit, as The Word should!  You will fall in love with Christ as you are supposed to as one of His lambs.  I have recommended this series to several friends and others who have been struggling to know Christ, and they have all said the same thing about how this has touched them.  Our church uses The Visual Bible Matthew in addition to our regular Bible studies.  Even children are able to remember passages and their context (which most people LOVE to take out and twist to suit their own needs when they do not understand not WANT to understand scripture as it is written) which will help them throught their lives to enable them to separate the "wheat from the chaff".  As a devoted Christian and mom of three children, I highly recommend The Visual Bible Matthew in any format you can get!  It is the best investment you can make for you, your family and anyone you share this with in the walk with Christ.
