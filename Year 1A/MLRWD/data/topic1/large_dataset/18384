The book 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' comes to life in full form in Mel Stuart's 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. From watching the special features, I beleive that this film was to promote a new candy bar. Kinda strange how a promotion could become the absoulute perfect film. With many talents in this movie, what could you not want in this movie?

=+= Plot =+=

I saw a number of 1 star reviews talking about how it was not close to the book at all. Yes, I was a little mad that it was way off, but hey they still got most of the parts. And besides, the lesson in this movie is more important then being close to the book. Also Harpor Gauff (I think that's his name) came up with the design for the Chocolate room. The way that the children were looking in awe was actually their real actions toward this new room. It was much better then the globbed hunk of junk that is the 2005 movie.

=+= Casting =+=

This cast was absoulutly incredible! Featureing Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, Nora Denney as Mrs.Tevee, Roy Kinnear as Mr.Salt, and Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. And Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, Julie Dawn Cole as Veruca Salt, Denise Nickerson as Violet Beauregarde, Paris Themmen as Mike Tevee, and Michael Bollner as Augustus Gloop. Absoulutly perfect cast.

=+= Music =+=

Anthony Newly came up with all the songs in this movie. Mel Stuart went to him and his two compainians to make the soundtrack. Sammy Davis Jr. did 'Candy Man'. Heres' a little fact for you. Sammy Davis Jr. wanted to do candy man and play the candy store man, but he was shot down (not literaly of course). Also they only used one song that was in Rohald Dahl's book, but the song is gone from my mind.

=+= Closing Statements =+=

Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is a classic film for our time. But, it was a box office disaster when it came out. It has now been 35 years scince it came out, but it it is still perfect. Looking for a good movie to watch on the couch? Then pick up this great family film, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'.
