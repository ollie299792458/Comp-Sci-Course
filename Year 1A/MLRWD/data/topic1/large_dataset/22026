This film has no structure.  It started out really kinda creepy, then it was apparant that this film was just your typical road movie/serial killer film.  There were one or two moments that were really creepy (FISH-BOY!), but then the film got into this weird path that totally pi**ed me off; what the heck was going on?  I shoulda turned it off sooner, but I figured it might be worth a few more minutes or so...the glossy tone of this film doesn't help, nor does the typical story-line or lack of structure.  I think if filmmakers can't keep their hands from typing b.s. like this that has no value to the viewer, then at least studios can keep their money off of it.  As for why this film got an average of three stars, I guess people just feel guilty if they say something negative, even if they have every right to.  I don't "earn" my $$ (I'm on disability), but for people who do, I think they CERTAINLY have a reason to shout about such mediocre films (and not in a good way) and get jaded like I am and avoid just about every "typical" looking movie.  If you're absolutely lacking any terror in your life, you may want to watch this film (as opposed to even more boring garbage like WRONG TURN), but if you've seen some REALLY scary films (like SCISSORS w/ Sharon Stone, or THE MIND SNATCHERS w/ Christopher Walken) that don't rely on typical plots, you'll HATE this film.  I know SCISSORS may not strike some as a horror film, but the bizzarre and psychotic nature of the fim SCARED me like few others have.  And isn't that what it's all about?
