Last week I watched Farenheit 451 for the first time on TV, and the film seemed remarkably prophetic. It's hard to believe this movie about a society that forbids all reading and burns all books was made 40 years ago.

We live in a frightening time, and although our firefighters don't set fire to books, we're already beginning to lose our sense of freedom and rationality. A few weeks ago, millions of Muslims took to the streets, burning books and everything in sight to protest against freedom of speech. And here in the U.S., the magazines that reproduced the cartoons have been removed from the shelves of many bookstores.

Visually, the film's modern living room with its huge flat-screen TV seems right on target. The mindless audience participation show that Linda watches each night could easily be a current reality program. And the picture-filled but wordless newspaper Montag "reads" looks like a new product for our post-literate age. Just last night, I heard the 911 Commission Report will soon be released in comic book format "for people who don't read books." Of course, chills went down my spine.
