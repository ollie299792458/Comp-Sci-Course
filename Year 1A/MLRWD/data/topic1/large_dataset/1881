I saw this when it came out and vividly remembered it for over 30 years, though when I saw it I did not know that Ridley Scott directed it.  To see it again was an extraordinary pleasure, the quality was so great that I was astounded.  This is an absolutely first rate film, a genuine masterpiece.

The plot of the film is about two men locked in a duel of mortal combat, the tail end of the aristocratic honor code as the modern age dawns with Napoleon.  Though an aristocrat, one man (Carradine) is rather civilized, given the task of hauling the other, an incorrigible brute, into prison for the murder by sword of a politician's relative.  After a silly insult, the result is an explosive hatred, with the macho aggressor (Keitel) imposing the fight and his own code on his adversary.  Carradine would like to stop the madness, but carries on for the sake of his reputation.  All of this is played out against a vivid historical backdrop, the Napoleonic Wars and the restoration, which are evoked with splendid intelligence and subtlety.

The action scenes - the fights - are of a bloody realism that I have rarely seen in an action film, but then, this is a historical drama of wonderful accuracy.  In a variety of contexts, you watch the men go at eachother with a blood lust, with a youthful energy that slips away before the viewer's eyes, with a growing sense of futility and emotional scars.  It is an extraordinary transformation.

The cinematography of the film is also second to none:  from the odd angles of provincial French architecture to the flourishes of the most Baroque aristocratic homes, you witness the men as they pursue their careers.  Truly a feast for the eyes, utterly mesmerizing, breathtaking.  Iconic images are a Ridley Scott hallmark.

Finally, the extras on the making of the film are very nice.  You get context with the usual hollywood fluff treatment.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  (Note:  I got this in Britain for approx $US8.)
