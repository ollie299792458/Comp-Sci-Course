I thought this movie was pretty good.  Lots and lots of explosions, over the top stunts, lots of gun play and martial arts action (Wu Jing is Awesome in the movie both in his martial arts and his evilness). If you like a Hong Kong, crime movie packed with action and more action from the opening scene until the credits roll and not a whole lot more then you will enjoy this movie.  The plot is easy to follow although not the most in depth plot ever devised, you won't have any trouble telling the good guys from the bad guys in this one, the acting is fair and the dialogue is pretty good although at times seems a little less than memorable. I think a better editing job would have kept the movie both shorter and tighter in delivery. I still think Dragon Dynasty did a slightly above average job with this movie release. I will keep the movie in my Asian film collection for the action alone and because you don't have to think too deeply while watching this particular movie and sometimes that's a good thing.  I also want to keep it because I love Wu Jing and Nicholas Tse. With the extra DVD video it comes with I give it 4 stars.
