It's useless to review the movie, as others have done it before me.  If you like it, you'll probably buy it anyway.

In any case, I was utterly disappointed with this DVD edition.  No inside booklet, no pictures, no DVDs with extras.  The only extras you get to see are the Director's and Producers' comments, 2 "how it was made" documentaries and 1 music video.

I always watch the movies with the comments, as directors usually have loads to tell about the scenes, how they manage to do this and that, and such.  After 15 minutes I stopped watching, as the track was quite a boring exchange between the director and the producers of how awesome this and that actor was, and how fortunate they were to have them.

The 2 documentaries were actually interesting, but very, very short.

The music video was just that, a music video with built-in movie scenes.

I ignore if they went far in creating the Blu-Ray edition, but certainly the DVD turned out short on everything we fans crave:  no interviews, not behind the scenes, not out-takes... Not even the B-rolls that are available on You Tube.  If you want extras, go there to watch them.

I just hope they'll release a special edition with time.  If not, it's obvious they are pushing so everybody switches to Blu-Ray format.
