Many critics hated this movie and because of that, I wanted to see it.  Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, a character who grew up obsessed with the idea that America's founding fathers had buried a treasure of unspeakable value and left cryptic clues as to it's location.  Due to a greedy member of his team, Gates has to play the role of reluctant hero and steal the Declaration of Independence before the bad guy does in order to protect it and the treasure he is seeking.

Raiders of the Lost Ark this is not.  There's not a lot of depth to the characters, some scenes feel rushed, and obviously the plot is, well, a little unrealistic.  Despite the flaws, though, this movie still takes you on a great adventure with early American history as the backdrop.  It's just a lot of fun.  Good chase scenes, lots of clues and intrigue and a few little twists to keep things moving - all without a single instance of profanity or nudity . . . hmm, I didn't know Hollywood could even do that anymore.  Absolutely entertaining and fun, I highly recommend this one.
