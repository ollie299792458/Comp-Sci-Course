This review is solely on the seller currently listed for this item, Mirmedia fulfilled by Amazon.  The Blu-ray I received had the following issues which made for an automatic return.  Barcode on outside was purposefully defaced with what looks like a razor blade.  They cut through the outside plastic cover and across the barcode.  Second, the clips to hold the disc trays inside the case were broken.  This meant the Bluray disc and Digital Copy Disc were just rattling around inside the case and any time you open the case you would need to prepare for these discs to immediately fall out.  Apparently the seller is rated high... so maybe this was just one mishap... but be careful when your order is fulfilled by these guys.

12/28: Update: Well I ordered a replacement for the above noted blu-ray from another "Fulfilled by Amazon" vendor called 'Best Deals FBA' on the website and 'Something Special LLC' on the invoice and packing slip.  This copy was almost or just as worse as the one noted above.  This one came... with 'NO' shrink wrapping... only the typical Blu-Ray Sticker on top of the case.  Also on the spine side of the case were actual holes on the top and bottom of the side.  After, seeing this I did not even bother to take the sticker off.

It seems strange that both copies of this movie appear to have been intentionally defaced by either the seller or their supplier. But, if that is what you are going to receive... they should at least note... "You will receive a blu-ray with a busted up case" instead of labeling it as 'new'.

Also, any illusions I had that Amazon would enforce some type of quality control, when it's a seller labeled as "Fulfilled by Amazon" have totally gone up in smoke.  At least they are good enough refunding... but going through the return hassle twice for the same product... that's a bit annoying.  From now on.. I am sticking to sold by Amazon only for blu-rays.
