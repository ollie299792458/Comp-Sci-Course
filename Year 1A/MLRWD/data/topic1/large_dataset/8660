Please note that my critique does not relate to the excellent picture staring Kevin Costner, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Dennis Hopper. It is not my intention to write another summary of the story line.

Maybe we are spoiled, but when we purchase a DVD, we expect to receive an uncut version. In fact, I have a 3 hours version of Waterworld on my VHS tape. This DVD offers mere 2 hours of the story! You can imagine how many of the scenes are missing: whopping 1/3 of the movie is cut off!!  Sure we will get to see a few scenes removed from syndication by censors. Sadly, its the American way. But the matter of fact is, that the disappointment about the missing 33% of the movie is great. The scenes which we have not seen on the TV screen contain the Mariner peeing into a bottle at the beginning, and later a glimpse of Jeanne Tripplehorn in nude, when she offers herself to the Mariner to save Enola. Harmless, I suspect that the entire planet saw these scenes in the TV anyway, except for the United States. Welcome to the world of cultural differences.

Furthermore, this DVD does not carry any stories behind the scenes, documentaries or interviews. I am sure that the publisher will than later release yet another Waterworld DVD, or maybe even 2 DVD version, called (say) "collectors edition," and will try to sell it to us as well.

If you have seen this movie, and maybe recorded it on tape, hold your breath, wait for the complete edition!
