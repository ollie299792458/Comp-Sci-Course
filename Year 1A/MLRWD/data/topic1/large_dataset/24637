I picked this up at Best Buy the other day. What a deal! These are very entertaining movies!

Tarantula is the quintisential giant bug movie. Featuring a young Clint Eastwood in a minor role. It's not quite as good as Them but better than The Deadly Mantis or Monster from Green Hell.

Incredible Shrinking Man is great entertainment with fun special effects and lots of oversized props, with a great script by Richard Matheson.

Monolith Monsters has some slow parts but is a pretty creative threat for a movie from the 50's.

Monster on the Campus is an extremely silly movie about a professor devolving into an ape-man after getting an infection from an irradiated coelocanth.

The Mole People is also silly, about some explorers who become captives in an underground civilization which never looks like more than a large room. But The Mole People are some of the coolest and most immitated monsters in movie history.

I prefer sets like this as opposed to releasing each movie seperately, since I think the average person who would buy one of these movies on its own would also be interested in at least a couple of the others. The prints on each of these look very good. As far as extras go you only get the theatrical trailer for each movie. But as nice as extras are a lot of the time for movies like these the commentary tracks and documentaries don't really add a lot to the movie, unless the commentator is either well informed or at least really clever like Joe Bob Briggs or the Mystery Science Theater guys. Anyway, I love this set. I hope to see more sets like this, maybe a volume two from Universal with some of their other movies or similar sets with movies from AIP, Fox, and Paramount.
