For those that have not seen this film and are fans of the gangster/crime genre should see it at least once. I predict that most of the people that will be reading this already know how violent, contraversial, quotable, and great this film really is; so the majority of the review is about the DVD itself. First off, the dust sleeve the DVD comes in is beautifully designed. You'll probably try your hardest not to get any smudges or fingerprints on it...which is pretty easy to do. It is odd that there is no booklet with even a scene selection index. Even the cheapest DVD's I own have some sort of printed out scene selection index. Needless to say, this is a small gripe but I would have rather have had I nice booklet than  an ad for DefJam Recordings stuffed in. Most of the extra features are fairly well done. All the documentary features give some good insight into how the movie came about and the censor problems they had to overcome. Although, even Pacino wouldn't give up the secret of what he really snorted in the movie. Even the number of deleted scenes are good. Although not all of them are that exciting it is nice to see before and after "action!" is called. The biggest blemish on the DVD is the DefJams Origins of a Hip-Hop Classic. In my opinion, it sort of cheapens the movie. Yes, most rappers lives of excess are reflected in this movie but...so what! I don't need to know what P.Diddy thinks of this movie. It is just another marketing ploy in my eyes. The widescreen version of the movie looks and sounds beautiful otherwise. If you have a previous widescreen version of the film on DVD it may not be worth your while to get this version since the extras aren't too essential. For those of us that love the movie and never had a good widescreen presentation of it should definately get this version.
