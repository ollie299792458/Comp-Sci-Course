This, Paul Schrader's directoral debut, is a funny and some-times hard-hitting drama of three Detroit auto-workers who have to deal with the problems of money, friends, family, future,and much more while working on "the line". 
The three main characters (Pryor, Kietel and Kotto) in a desperate need for cash, decide to rip off their own union and steal from the union safe. But instead of finding money, they find an incriminating ledger and from here they have to struggle with the rights and wrongs of what to do, where to turn and whether or not their friendship can sustain these dillema's.
The film contains stand-out performances from all three of the leads, which is not surprising having read that Schrader promised each one of them top billing to bind them to a contract and then told 'em it was equal top billing afterwards, obviously causing them to try and act the pants off each other. There is also a good level of detail in their day-to-day lives making the three seem like real characters and not just ciphers for the script. There are some really funny scenes ("What about my locker!!" , the robbery , visit from the IRS etc.), as well as some great drama (the three-way conversation after the party, Kotto and the killers etc).
Overall, this is a low-key film with some high-ground ideas that even now ring pretty true. While I enjoyed most of this film there was a bit that reminded me a little bit too much of "Mean Streets" and the ending seemed somewhat forced, though it still ended the film on the right note. As was said elsewhere, definately worth checking out at least once.
