I am a huge Survivor fan, and I relish in things such as delete scenes, uncut exit interviews, commentaries, and other bonus material. This set is the pinnacle of each of those things. There are deleted scenes on every disc, all 14 uncut exit interviews are included, commentaries on more than half of the episodes, and the seventh disc includes a plethora of bonuses that are far and away more than we've gotten on any of the other box sets. Even the America's Tribal Council live special is included. So why am I giving this only a four star rating? There's an episode missing. Given it's a recap episode and most of the scenes from it are featured in other episodes or deleted scenes, but still it makes for an incomplete watchthrough for hardcore completists such as myself. All of the other seasons that had recap episodes have had those episodes included on their respective box sets, so the exclusion of this one is rather bizarre, especially since there was an extra disc dedicated solely to bonus features. If you're a huge Survivor fan, and especially if this is one of your favorite seasons, buy this set. There's almost no chance that there will ever be an updated release featuring the recap episode, and the special features on this set will definitely satisfy your cure for more things Survivor. Missing episode aside, this is how these sets should be done.
