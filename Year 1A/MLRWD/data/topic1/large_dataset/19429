Exquisite, hypnotic, achingly beautiful and utterly enticing, Broken Sky puts the rise and fall of a relationship under the microscope, depicting with blistering accuracy the pain of unrequited love, rejection and loss.

There's barely any dialogue - proof indeed that actions speak louder than words - with most of the action played out in body language: stolen glances and intense sex are the language of this piece. The BFI (http://www.llgff.org.uk/films_details.php?FilmID=106401) says it's a "masterful exercise in visual storytelling" and it isn't wrong. The two leads, Jon&aacute;s (Miguel Angel Hoppe Canto) and Gerardo (Fernando Arroyo) as two students, are thoroughly engaging, and just so happen to be very, very easy on the eye - even if Jon&aacute;s bares an uncanny resemblance to Jason out of Coronation Street.

If there's one flaw it's the duration, an ailment modern cinema suffers acutely from - at more than two hours and eighteen minutes this one tests the patience, and my reaction might well have been considerably less favourable had I been trapped in a cinema for that long. But here we have quantity and quality, and that's rare. Broken Sky is nothing less than stunning - if at the end of the film you don't feel the impact of the flashback to what really happened on the dancefloor, then you haven't really loved and lost...
