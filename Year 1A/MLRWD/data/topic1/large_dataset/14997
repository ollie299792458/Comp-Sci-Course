Mazes and Monsters.... Tom Hanks 5 STAR PERFORMANCE

Mazes and Monsters is probably one of the most underated films of all time.  It has everything in it that you could want: an emotional love story, intriguing characters, Gorvilles, action, adventure, and a holy man that the world has never seen or known of before..... PARDEAUX.  Tom Hanks pours all his raw acting strength out in this one, it's so well acted I am not sure if he really is Robbie or Pardeaux, or Tom Hanks for that fact.  His friends are truly individuals, from the makeout king to that kid thats always wearing a different hat.  (SPOILER ALERT) I was a little disappointed that Robbie didn't get the girl in the end.

If you have not seen this I beleive you will be thoroughly entertained, this movie also shines light on the greatness and diversity of Role Playing games, and the adventures you could have, now don't get me wrong I'm Not (SPOILER ALERT) advocating the slaughter of muggers by pretending their gorville's but I beleive a lot of the world's prolems would just go away if we pretended we were fantasty characters.
