Take Cube 1 and 2, combine them, and you get this movie. It's better than the second but not as good as the first. The genius aspect of the original Cube was how the story could be debated by and left people wondering and gathering their own conclusions while at the same time remaining a very interesting and not hard to understand movie. This movie however supposedly happens before Cube and creates a story for you to attempt to explain Cube.

In Cube Zero one of the lower end cube operators begins to wonder and ask the wrong questions. The more he learns the more he questions the cube, and eventually ends up inside of it. The whole story of the movie is served to you with a silver spoon and while it's fun while watching, after the movie ends you forget it as if you never seen it. Definitely does not have the impact effect of Cube after seeing it.

Even though lacking the genius of the original Cube this movie does have quite an interesting story, lots of neat special effects, and awesome traps just waiting to claim their victims. In my opinion it's definitely worth watching, especially if you have seen the first 2 of the series.
