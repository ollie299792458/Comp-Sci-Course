When I was a tween (before the term was even coined) I fell in love with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. In the intervening years, most of what I watched was forgotten. Bless Fox for cleaning up these classics and putting them out on the shelf for us! I purchased and watched avidly the first and second seasons. So many wonderful memories, so much fun! I had been reminded that the third season would be so much inferior, but I bought the first volume anyway. And while the preponderance was monster mayhem, I found most shows to be well worth watching!
I think there are several reasons that I have continued to enjoy this series whereas I gave up on Allen's other show, Lost in Space. The main reason, like other reviewers have said, is the fact that the actors played it straight, or were allowed to play it straight. Despite how nutty the plots became, Basehart, Hedison and company played it serious.
Some of my all time favorites are in this set and I feel these are every bit as good as the winners from the previous years. Day of Evil was fantastic with Basehart able to play the two roles to perfection. Day the World Ended, Death Watch, even Werewolf was played evenly and well. My only real problem episode was Deadly Waters and that's mainly because I have a military background. Stan would have been courtmartialed for his whiney insolence and cowardice in the real world.
All in all, I only have a few minor complaints with this volume of the series.... Double sided DVD's, splitting the season into two sets, (and charging more) and not continuing the series with season four. Hopefully within the not too distant future, I won't be whining about my last complaint.
