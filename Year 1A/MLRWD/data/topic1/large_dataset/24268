And no, I'm not completely averse to "chick flicks".  Stupid premise, sloppy pacing, jaw-droppingly inept dialogue, no sign of intelligent life here. Why should I care? I saw it on a first- and last - date with someone so amazing looking that she would have had to commit an unspeakably offensive act in order to cool my ardor.  Taking a shine to this movie was that act.

None other than Albert Brooks seconds that emotion: "Toward the last six months before I met my wife, I sort of gave up on even attempting mental communication with new women. I went with this one woman to see While You Were Sleeping-that movie with Sandra Bullock. In the car on the way home, she said to me, 'I think that's the funniest movie I've ever seen.' And I really debated whether just to drive off Mulholland and kill ourselves right then or to drop her off first and take eight sleeping pills."

Also worth noting while collating reasons to shun this film:  Sandra Bullock always looks vaguely like she needs a bath.
