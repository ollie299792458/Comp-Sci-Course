I had the opportunity recently here in Germany to watch Potemkin in the big cinema with live music - played by a combo from Berlin (violin, drummer, bass and piano), that had written a new score for the film. They showed a restored version with the original russian subtitles. I had seen the film before in offside university cinemas with canned music and on tape, but I never realized what an impact the film can have. It simply blows your mind. The live music turned the film into a totally different expierence. Now I can unterstand why the film caused such turmoil back in the Twenties in Europe. It was banned repeatedly. The governments were afraid of it's impact, as well they should have been. Can you say that of any film today? The original music by Edmund Meisel - who by the way set new standards for film scores with his music for Potemkin - combined with the film genius of Eisenstein to create a film that transcended the normal cinema. It just didn't comment about politics, it created politics. I consider myself a pacifist - but while experiencing the film I had the feeling I ought to stand up, get out a red flag and blow up the next Townhall. The film - with the right music - can have that much of an impact. I was literally shaking during the "Odessa steps" sequence, largley due to the pounding music that accompanied the slaughter of the cossaks on the civilians.
I've never had that deep of an expierence in the cinema before with the possible exception of Kubrick's "2001" and Alexandro Jodorowsky's "El Topo", but I was high both times then. With Potemkin and the right music you don't need any help.
What I mean to say - Find the chance to experience the film the way it was meant to be expierenced. Full screen, the original version und live music. And by that I don't mean a single piano. It's got to be more. The movie will rip you out of the chair. Then you will realize what a masterpiece Eisenstein created.
