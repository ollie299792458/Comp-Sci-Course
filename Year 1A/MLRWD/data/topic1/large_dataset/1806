I saw the movie in the theater and could not wait to see the DVD released.  I'm prejudiced in favor of the music and if I was rating this for people with taste similar to mine, I would have given it a 5.  I gave it a 4 because this movie might not be for everyone if they don't like Cole Porter's music.  If they were not familiar with it, I think they would grow to love it.

Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd played very sensitive parts and exhibited lots of real human feelings.  At times, what they went through was heartbreaking because of her intense love for him and his need to be with men sometimes.  It is a real love story and one that is presented a little differently from the ordinary.  I liked that about it.  They loved each other but there were problems on both sides.

The movie will surprise you when it begins!  That will be your cue to know that this is not going to be your average love story but instead, an innovative, technically interesting movie that has some of the most beautiful music ever written woven through it.  Buy it, enjoy it, treasure it, cry with it, share it; that's what I plan to do!
