I'll get the nit out of the way: I found Stewart's narration a little annoying.  His voice had a note of smugness in it that grated on my ears.  BUT...The story is undeniably compelling and dramatic, the underwater photography as stunning as anything you'll see in "Blue Planet," and everything is in service of a crucial ecological cause.  Ever since the late Steven Erwin hit the scene with his "Crocodile Hunter" persona, nature films have seemed to go out of their way to exclaim that this or that large and scary animal is "beautiful" or "gorgeous," or by crikey, in some way less frightening than it really is for being, in fact, magnificent.  I see no contradiction.  Sharks are in fact essential to the health of the oceans, and they occupy a vital niche in the world's most important ecosystems.  'Nuff said, frankly.  No effort to convince me that most sharks are handsome or cuddly is going to work.  But it is impossible not to admire how supremely they have become adapted to their environment, over eons of deep time.  That honing is evident in the grace of some, the unique features of others, and the range and success of many.  All of which is now threatened by the species that fancies itself intelligent.  The blind forces of evolution have produced an astonishing creature that the ruthless intellect of humans now threatens to extinguish.  Stewart captures the obscenity and injustice of this state of affairs very powerfully in "Sharkwater," making it one of few must-see documentaries.
