When I first saw this movie on TV as an eight year old kid, it did something to me - changed me forever. I saw what men can do when they are determined and resolute, no matter the cost. This film, along with the 300 Spartans, insured I would serve in the military when I grew up. And I did. That's how intense a film it is, and what a film can do to an impressionable child.

Others have written reviews covering all aspects of this movie, but what cinched it for me was the final scene with Sgt. Bill Dane standing in his own freshly dug grave, his rifle stuck inverted in the mound at the head of the grave with his name, rank, and serial number written on a scrap of paper; wounded, dirty, and exhausted behind a water-cooled M1917 30.06 belt-fed machine gun, his Thompson subgun in his hands and his response to the final Japanese assault screaming defiantly, "We're still here! We'll always be here!" as he empties his Thompson and then mans the M1917, traversing it back and forth at the advancing enemy, the camera zooming in on the muzzle flashes as the epilogue scrolls up the screen; "And so died the heroes of Bataan..."

Powerful stuff even in this age of CGI and cinematic technowizardry.
