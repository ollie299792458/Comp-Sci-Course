This movie would have been a masterpiece if "Logans Run" and of course, "Clonus" was never made. This movie was stolen right from those films ideas! It was just a lot better thanks to new computers.

The writer had a brilliant idea for the plot and it made me think if someday something like this could possibly happen! Humans are cloned and grown, much faster than a normal human of course. The reason is so if anything would happen to the people who paid for the clones, they could take any part from them!

For what the clones know, the world ended and they were lucky enough to be saved. They even find more "survivors" every day too. They live in a huge building, their shelter from the poisonous air outside of their sanctuary.

The clones have a "lottery" that "randomly" selects lucky people to go to "the island"..sorry for the quotations. When they do they get to go to the last paradise on earth. In reality their being sliced up for one of the clones owner...say they needed a new heart. They even brutally do it without even numbing them sometimes!

So the escape begins with two induviduals! Also, they will find out that they like to touch eachother, which they were required to keep their perimeter before!

There is so many amazing things that I love about this movie. In my opinion this was one of the most origonal movies ever made. It is well acted and has amazing special effects and lots of action and chasing.

Well worth owning :-)
