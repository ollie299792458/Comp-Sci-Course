This giddy, beautiful movie about mourning and the re-establishment of one's life has always struck me as one of the most beautiful pictures ever made.  Alan Rickman stars as a ghost who returns to his newly widowed, deeply mourning wife -- a wife who is completely possessed by her loss -- and proceeds to fill her with all the joys she felt with him while he was alive.  But ultimately she must make a choice between the opportunity for a budding romance with a living man and her memories of a man who, as a ghost, is slowly but surely becoming a pain.  And so, this nagging question:  did the ghost deliberately return, planning to become a pain, so as to spur her to appreciate the life that is around her?  There is a beautiful scene where Rickman's character tells of parents in a park given new reasons to closely hug their children...  This movie is completely beautiful.  (Did I use the word 'beautiful' enough?)
By the way, the format is not wide screen because it was originally filmed for British television.
