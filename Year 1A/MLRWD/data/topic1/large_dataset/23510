When I first stuck my first DVD copy of this film into my DVD player, I honestly wasn't expecting much. Many of the primary actors were people I was unfamiliar with or only peripherally aware of. The ones I was familiar with had a lot of 'hit-or-miss' stretches in their filmographies. And the director had made a couple flicks I thought were decent and another couple I didn't care for.

To be brutally honest, I bought it just because it was supposed to be noir-ish and because Kim Basinger is pretty easy on the eyes.

What played out in front of me onscreen turned out to be the most enjoyable film I had seen in years. Every aspect of the film just blew me away. Brilliant performances, sure-handed direction, incredible sets and production values... and a story that got me running out to buy every James Ellroy book I could find.

Within a month, I watched the film probably 6 or 7 times... partly to see if the impact was just a result of it exceeding my modest initial expectations and partly because I just kept thinking about it.

Now, years later, I still can't keep from raving about what a great film it is every time it comes up in conversation. If none of the primary cast or director Curtis Hanson had ever made another film, I'd still remember each and every one of them. Instead, it proved a springboard for the careers of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, brought Kim Basinger back into the limelight and reminded every die-hard movie fan why we still love the art form, regardless of how many block-buster sequels and how much formulaic schlock gets foisted upon us by Hollywood bean-counters.

Oh, and the Blu-Ray looks and sounds incredible, by the way. But you already knew that.

If I had to trim my movie collection down to a handful of "desert island discs" this would absolutely be one of them. No hesitation, no second thoughts. I cannot recommend this one highly enough.
