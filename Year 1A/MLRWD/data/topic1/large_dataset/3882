Utterly unwatchable nonsense.

This is a film that looks like it was put together in the Bizzaro world, like a split-level home built from clapboard, milk cartons and used furniture crates. Nicholson reprises his role in "The Shining" by portraying himself as a basket case, a routine he uses in about 99% of his roles.

"The Witches of Eastwick" is based on the book by John Updike, but whatever Updike originally wanted to say about the differences between the sexes is upstaged by the hammy Nicholson, who should have been relegated to being the caterer for the shooting location.

It's also difficult to believe that the talented Cher, the same person who made "Moonstruck" such a great film, would have had anything to do with this mess.

"The Witches of Eastwick" bombed at the box office after word of mouth killed it. It's not a film that will be dredged up from time to time because it was once popular; it wasn't. However, it is a film that will probably appeal to worshipers of Cher or Nicholson, or some obscure Hollywood mutual admiration society.

At this point, a used VHS edition of "The Witches of Eastwick" is selling for about $1.00 on amazon, but even that's too much to pay for this dog.
