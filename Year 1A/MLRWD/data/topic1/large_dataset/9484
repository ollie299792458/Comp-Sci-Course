You can read the other customer reviews to see why this movie is so fantastic, rich in costumes, scenery, acting, drama, etc. My only qualm is that I have actually studied the life and person of Queen Elizabeth I and she never needed anyone's help to "become" strong nor was it ever CONFIRMED that she was or was NOT a virgin. Believe it or not, this young woman, when her life was in danger by her own sister and otherwise, was savy in politics and in what she should and shouldn't say and how she should or shouldn't act. This is not to say she was cold-hearted - she did at times let certain Earl's play with her heart-strings, but she cut them (and whoever she had to) off in order to stay the great monarch that she was...ALONE. I understand that it makes the movie more interesting to make her this vunerable "ruling with her heart" girl who GROWS INTO the strong Queen we've all heard about. But to be honest - she already was that smart and didn't need the help of all of those men to BECOME that way.

Other than that little complaint - the movie is utterly WONDERFUL. Her coronation scene looks like a famous painting of the Queen COME TO LIFE. They even included her favorite "scandalous" dance - the Volta! I recommend this movie to everyone, but please give this woman credit for being strong from the very beginning despite her age - she deserves it!
