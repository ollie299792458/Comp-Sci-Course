One of my favorite elements of this movie is how this princess is portrayed.  My daugter who is 4 is absolutely obsessed with princesses!  I find Anastasia to be the most independent of all the major animated princesses, (all others being Disney princesses).  In Anastasia, there is actually a development of a relationship with the love interest, (Beauty and the Beast being the other notable example).  Also, though Anastasia is a princess, she ultimately decides that being one isn't the end all, be all of happiness.  I don't have a complete aversion to the other princesses.  But the theme of falling in love at first sight with almost exclusively princes gets old to me.  Not that everyone doesn't need to be saved from time to time by a "knight in shining armor", metaphorically speaking.  But I find it a refreshing interpretation that it come from an imperfect person that one actually knows more than a few hours.

The animation and music are great, too.  My only one real hesitation is with Rasputin.  He's a little on the gross side.  My daughter would obviously be more grossed out than an older child.  Nonetheless, as an adult, he still kind of gets to me.
