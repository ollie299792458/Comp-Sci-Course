After seeing the previews of this movie in the theatres and on television, I really wanted to see it.  But I unfortunately was never able to catch it in the theatre.  I recently found it on sale at a local store and snatched it up.  Although it was one of the more entertaining movies I've seen recently, it also wasn't quite as good as I had hoped it would be. The previews had been very misleading about the story line.  I, like another reviewer was disappointed when I finally saw "the beast".  After so much mysterious, mystical ambiance going on, I thought "the beast" was just too obvious.  
The dubbing - The version I bought was dubbed in English which I think I prefer to subtitles because I just miss too much of a movie reading them. It was a little disconcerting that you could see lips moving that were speaking english and yet hearing another voice that sounded like it was clearly not theirs. Why did they dub the voices of the actors that were already speaking english??  I think Mark Dacascos' dubbing in particular was really bad.  
Alright, it IS a martial arts/horror type movie, which are usually cheesy and don't seem as though they would go well together, but they surprisingly do in this movie.  I don't usually like "fight" scenes but these were so well choreographed and graceful that I actually played them over several times before going on to the next scene.  
I saw the version that I think has the most cut out of it.  More should really have been left in because at times I caught myself wondering why someone was doing something.  After reading about all the alternate versions I found out what the missing scenes were and then everything made total sense.  
But all in all, this is a movie that will keep your attention and you will want to watch again soon.
