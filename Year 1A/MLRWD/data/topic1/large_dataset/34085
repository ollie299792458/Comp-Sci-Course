First and foremost, these films are based on my favorite author's works. Robert Ludlum was great!

Now, about the Bourne Ultimatum; it has nothing to do with the book. None of the movies really did except for the character, Jason Bourne. Yet, as with so many movies, if you view the movie as a separate work, you can enjoy the book and movie separately.

I am not a big Matt Damon fan, but he was very good as Bourne. Sulking, confused, and deadly. I believe he must have worked hard on his action sequences. Kudos for the physical work you put in, Matt.

Action is the real theme of this movie. I believe that at least 90% of the filming was done with hand-held cameras. Shaky! The initial effect is to effectively create a feeling of panicked and hectic action. After a while it really wears on your nerves. I would like to focus at some point. Parts of the story line are blurred because of the jittery camera.

The car chase through New York was done the old-fashioned way. I understand that they shut down the streets and really did it, no miniatures or models. You know, like McQueen did in "Bullitt". Great job!

The ending actually is more the ending of the first book. Again, no objections. I have seperated the movies and books.

I could go on, but I'm not trying to sell anybody anything. If you like action, see "The Bourne Ultimatum". My 15 year-old son really likes it, too. I'm glad we have another thing we can share as father and son.
