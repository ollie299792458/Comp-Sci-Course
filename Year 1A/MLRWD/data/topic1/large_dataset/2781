If you have seen some of Michael Douglas'es other movies, such as "Romancing the stone" and "The jewel of Nile" -- well, "The Game" is an action-adventure movie, similar to those. But this time, the adventure happens in a city environment - in San Francisco. The "game" is organized by a company called "Consumer Recreation Services", who make your life more "FUN".

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The reason is that the things which happen to Van Orton (the banker played by Michael Douglas) have happened to me as well - in some way or another. Perhaps they have happened to you too. For example, you visit some company, and at your next visit - the company is gone. Or sometimes, you may experience that someone is draining your bank account without your knowledge. Or, a waitress splashes food and drinks on your suit.

I definitely recommend this movie, because it is captivating to watch. For example, the house in which the banker Van Orton lives, is large and luxurious. It is nice to imagine yourself in the interior of this house. The "waitress" than ruins the banker's suit is very beautiful. I would say that Michael Douglas definitely has a taste for luxirious living and beautiful women - this shows in most of his movies. Enjoy this film and participate emotionally in the blurred line between game and real life.
