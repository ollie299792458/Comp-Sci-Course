I found this performance bizarre; the whole production seemed strange.  It was not an avant-garde one, but done with a pretense for historical accuracy.  Yet the costumes of the chorus suggested something totally different from 17century Moscow. Were they Polish or Ukrainian?  Someone did not seem to do their homework.
I actually liked Marusin as Prince Golitzyn.  I think he had squillo and also he acted quite well.  Paata Burchuladze seems to always play the same role, no matter whether he is in this opera or in Don Giovanni.  The singing is good, though.  I must admit that only main roles that are either Russians or Bulgarian Ghiaurov, sing intelligibly, although Ghiaurov happenned to have a heavier accent that I would have thought.  But for me as a native Russian speaker, the singing of the chorus and other's smaller roles were a real disappointment as I could not understand a word and had to resort to subtitles and it was a real distraction. I wonder if Italians have the same feeling when they listen to their opera performed by foreign singers...In any case, it's a satisfactory performance but I think the complexity of the work was not resolved here, and the beauty of this opera was not fully conveyed.  It looked rather Wagnerian to me but it is not and I believe it had to be done with more respect to its Russion origin, or be totally devoid of place and time to become an avant-garde production.
