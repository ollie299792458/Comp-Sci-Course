This DVD has Ashly, Maksim, and Kym from Dancing with the Stars more or less leading an aerobic dance workout on the Dancing with the Stars stage that does not require a partner.  The first section is Paso Doble and it seems to be more aerobic than dance, but that is to be expected as this is a workout DVD, not a dance one.  Maksim leads this routine and out of all the dances, this is the easiest to follow, even though it does go fairly quickly.  Ashly then takes over with the cha cha and goes super fast.  However, after repeating the DVD several times, one should be able to get it.  Kym then leads the samba, which involves a lot of bouncing.  Then all 3 take turns leading a jive routine, and one should probably be in fairly good shape already before attempting this routine.  There is also a bonus challenge where Maksim, Kym, and Ashly basically improvise a routine and goof off a little.  Note: Although some cool dance moves can be learned from this DVD, it is not an instructional dance video, it is a workout video, so if you're looking for an instructional dance video, look elsewhere.  There isn't much in the way of extras, just trailers for Denise Austin DVDs, Healthy Eating tips from SlimFast featuring Tysonia from season 3, and credits.  I was hoping there would be more insight into behind the scenes at Dancing with the Stars, but unfortunately there is not.  All in all a good DVD, but probably too fast for most untrained dancers.
