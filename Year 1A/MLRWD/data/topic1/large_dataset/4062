This movie depicts the irrational fear the US had of it's former ally, The Soviet Union. You'll remember that the Soviets paid a dear price in lost population during WWII. They believed they had a claim to the spoils following that debacle. They, in fact, had more claim to spoils of war than the US because it cost them more. The US government,needing an enemy to focus it's mistrust and inherent hate upon, chose Communism and the Soviets. The "cold war' was fueled in it's entirety by US paranoia. WE fueled the arms race, WE fueled the Moon race. In order to protect us from a percieved threat, millions of words of US propaganda were churned out. This movie depicts some of the fear this country fomented with it's irrational fear of Communism.If you're paying attention, the Russians, in general, have suffered a decline in every econmic area you care to examine since dropping so-called Communism in favor of Capitalism, which has created the poor, and welfare rolls. WATCH THIS MOVIE TO GET A SENSE OF THE PARANOIA THAT PREVADED POST WAR AMERICA.
