Want to know how Chinese think about it? I'm a typical Shanghaiese living in Shanghai forever, guess my voice counts. Everybody loves the movie here, including myself. Simple as the story is, it is beautifully done -- the rhythm of the story, the use of Chinese elements and the kung fu moves.

None of us complained that the movie was not China enough, 'coz nobody expected for that. How could you expect an English speaking panda to be Chinese? If dreamworks ever tried to make *real* Chinese characters, I think they failed on this, badly. All characters in the movie are very American, they were just in Chinese outfits. But still, Po is such a cute lovable panda, and Shifu and Wugui are also impressive. "The Five" are a little bit weak. The worse is the bad guy - I cannot even recall his name - it's no personality, just a bad guy.

I was also very happy to see lots of Chinese elements too. Although they were used in a little bit exaggerated way (for example, the building style, and the outfits of regular people in the valley), it's relatively better than other *fake* Chinese movies, especially the music.
