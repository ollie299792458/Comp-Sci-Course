How Quentin Tarantino managed to pull off such an awsome cast for his first film is beyond me; Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Tim Roth (just to name a few) are all great actors.
Reservoir Dogs is about a group of thieves who rob a jewellery store, but all does not go to plan, as the police already seemed to know about it. Is there a rat in this group of theives? Did one of them inform the police? The style Tarantino uses is clever. He often goes back in time, to the time of the robbery and beyond, which sometimes shows us the background of the characters.
Reservoir Dogs catches your attention from the opening scene and doesn't stop untill the end. At the start Mr Brown (Tarantino himself) explains to his fellow theives why Madonna's song "Like A Virgin" has it's unusual name, the conversation then changes into why Mr Pink doesn't like to tip waitresses. That's just an example of a lot of the very entertaining dialouge throughout the film.
We all know how good an actor Harvey Keitel is, and Reservoir Dogs is no exeption. He plays a great Mr White, and one of his buddies, Mr Orange (Tim Roth), is equally cool. Mr Pink is entertaining - him being so anxious and paraniod is great, Steve Busemi suits this role to the bone. Micheal Madeson is great, he plays Mr Blonde, a cruel and brutal man who has a sick sence of humour, although I had to laugh when he danced to his favorite song. 
Reservoir Dogs has a great ending as well. If you are the person who can get past the layer of rough language and violence in a film, Reservoir Dogs will keep you watching to the end, then leave you thinking 'That was a good movie...'
