I love this workout.  The 45 minute workout itself is divided into 3 dance sections: club, latin and jive.  You can play the entire 45 minute workout or in 25 minute express segments.  There is also an audio option which allows you to enjoy louder music.

The workout starts out with fast marching and Alison quickly moves into the first dance patterns.  I feel she gives a lot of clear cuing as well as "taking it from the top" - after a few attempts at this dvd, I was "dancing" through the entire workout.

The camera work is good in that you're not ever left wondering what the instructor and participants are doing with their arms or feet.

I'm not a dancer but managed to follow Alison's instruction quite well.  Once you learn the patterns, you can focus on moving with the music (i.e. dancing) and enjoy the workout.  I have done advanced workouts for 20 years and found that once I really learned the steps, I was sweating and making my heart rate goals for the full workout.

There are no weights used in this workout nor is there traditional ab work.  If you hold yourself properly, you'll work your core however.

I only hope that Alison Davis and Lisa Wheeler connect on another project - the choreography in this workout was so much fun.  And the music, particularly the more ambient stuff, was very well-suited for the movements.

Well done Firm!
