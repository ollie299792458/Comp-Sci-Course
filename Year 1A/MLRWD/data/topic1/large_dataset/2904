I remember exactly were I was when I heard DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. It was my freshman year of high school and some upper classmates were doing a project on culture from each decades in the 20th century and one kid was pumping music from the 70s into the hallways. I caught the very end of "Speak To Me" that leads into "Breathe". I wanted to stay right there and listen to the rest of the album but, sadly, had to go to class. About a week later I bought the album and haven't looked back since. Of course I had heard "Time" and "Money" on the radio before but never in the confines of the album.
This DVD is what I have been waiting for. I've read many books about Pink Floyd and love when band members recount the process of recording these songs so this documentary is made for me. Every one of the band members has a great respect for the time in which the album was made. Many of them perform bits of the songs right there and then for the cameras. Fabulous technical information and insight is brought to the album.
I've taken one star off the rating because of one disapointment and one wish-they-did. Although the packaging states "track by track" two of these were not mentioned anywhere: "Speak To Me" (I could understand this one because it's basically effects) and "Any Colour You Like". Also, although the bonus features almost double the documentary, this would have been a great place to put an early (then called ECLIPSE) DARK SIDE OF THE MOON live performance. I know they had the footage, bits and pieces are presented throughout the documentary.
