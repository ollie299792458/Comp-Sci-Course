I have been a fan of westerns (and movies dealing with "historical" America) all my life.  Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid" is the most realistic, yet beautifully poetic western ever made.  Few people acknowledge the historical accuracy of this film.  I have read the historical accounts of "the Kid's" last days, and most scenes- and some of the dialogue- are taken directly from history.  Yet the true magic of this film comes from the heartbreakingly beautiful sense of melancholy that permeates the film, from the exquisite cinematography of the New Mexican landscape, right through the characters, who realize that the American frontier has at last bumped up against the Pacific Ocean. The wild and wooly times, and the people who lived through them, are fading fast with the light of day.  The veteran western actors in the film, one and all, give the most heartfelt performances of their careers, sensing as they did, that the golden days of the genre they'd loved and nurtured were as doomed as the characters they portrayed.  Add to that one of the most haunting soundtracks ever recorded (and one of Bob Dylans finest works), and you end up with a true American classic.  Peckinpah's masterpiece.  You can close your eyes and smell a New Mexican afternoon thunderstorm, gunpowder, horses...

Just make sure your watching the "Director's Cut", and not the studio butchery. Also, cast your vote with the studio to get this great film lovingly adapted to DVD.
