First off, let me say that I have read all of Clancy's fiction.  I think I have read Sum of All Fears at least 3 times over the years.  As far as the movie goes, I thought it was a good action movie, but could have been better without Affleck.  He has never had the intensity that Harrison Ford brought to the role.  The other major actors were wonderfull, Morgan Freeman is always a powerful actor.  The storyline varies from the book in many ways, but as we all know, movies can never equal the depth of a long book.  Some stuff that bugs me:  Jack Ryan isn't married yet, but this did take place after Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games (but a couple of books before he's President)... Ben Affleck as a boyfriend is never a good idea.  The role was changed to suit Affleck, it should have been the other way around.  Unhappily I can understand that Ford or Baldwin might be too old for the part, but Affleck is too young...  Perhaps someone from "Thirteen Days" would have been better.  To conclude, it is still worth seeing as an action movie, but not as good as Red October.  Try to ignore Affleck's naivete...
