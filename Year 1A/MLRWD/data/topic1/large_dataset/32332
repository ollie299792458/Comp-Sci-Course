This film deals pretty openly with subjects that were still sort of taboo in 1958 -- rape and revenge killings.
Briefly, the plot revolves around Peck's Jim Douglass role. He's a rancher who has been dogedly hunting down four very bad men who could've raped and killed his wife. He finds them in jail 100 miles away from his ranch ... Not to give too much away, but the movie turns into a 90 minute chase and morality play. Great acting from Peck, Stephen Boyd, Henry Silva, Lee Van Cleef and Albert Salmi (who was the "bad guy" in more 60s and 70s tv shows than are probably listed online).
What strikes me most of all, is that from looking at this film, you can see it clearly had an influence on Sergio Leone almost a decade later when he made his Western triology starring Clint Eastwood.
There's the lone gunman against the world theme, along with revenge killing (not really done all that much in westerns before) and almost directly taken from The Bravados is the watch-with-a-picture. Peck holds out a watch with a picture of his dead wife to, Lee Van Cleef (and the rest of the bad guys) as a sort of guilt weapon. In 1965's "For a Few Dollars More" Van Cleef plays very much the same type of role as Colonel Mortimer having chased a man who performed almost the same act on his family.
This film gets an A for production and script. It's a little hokey at the end with Peck talking to a priest, but at least the acting and scenery are interesting.
It's a good film. Well worth a Saturday afternoon viewing.
