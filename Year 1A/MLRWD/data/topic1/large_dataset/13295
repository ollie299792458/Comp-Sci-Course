'The Pianist' is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman. I saw the DVD version after I had seen the movie in theaters 4 times, and after reading the book twice. The book was written immediately after the war, and it has a lot of detail that is unique. It is one man's perspective, and his lack of bitterness is remarkable. Roman Polanski has retained the honesty and the detached observation of Szpilman while making the movie. As far as the movie was concerned, the DVD did not add to what I had already experienced.  For me, the movie made a deep emotional impact, and the book is very inspiring. I liked 'The Pianist' even more than Schindler's list.  It goes straight to the heart, possibly because of the truth and the directness in it.  
Adrien Brody- as Szpilman- is brilliant, and fully deserving of his Oscar. He is in nearly every scene, and he expresses so much without any words! Polanski and screenplay writer Ron Harwood have stayed very close to the book, at times including an entire scene, with dialogues and details from the book. 
The DVD has, on the other side, interviews with Polanski, Brody, Harwood, and Thomas Kreschman (he played the German officer in the movie). It shows what went into the making of this great film. The German archives have footage of the Jews being taken to the train, etc. They were used in creating some of the scenes. Some things came from Polanski's childhood experiences- the Jewish police says to Szpilman, after saving his life, "Don't run!"- it came from Polanski's own experience. What kept Szpilman alive after he lost his entire family was his love for music. The DVD has a clip of the real Szpilman playing Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor- the music he played before and after the bombing of the radio station. If only he had lived to see this movie!
 I would highly recommend the movie 'The Pianist', and particularly the DVD version for the extra material that comes with it.
