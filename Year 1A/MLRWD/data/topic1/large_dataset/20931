Go buy this movie.  Trust everyone on this.  This movie is one of those instant classics that appeal to people of all ages.  For the kids you have the amazing animation and fairy tail characters.  For adults there is a wonderful story, fantastic characters, and of course those wonderful allusions (made famous in the Simpsons and Toy Story 1+2) that just go right over kids heads but will have you rolling with laughter.
Then animation and attention to detail in this film are nothing short of breathtaking.  There are many times you will forget you are watching a computer-animated movie.  The characters are all brilliant but the Gingerbread Man and Eddie Murphy as the talking Donkey absolutely steal every scene they are in.  If you loved the Toy Stories, or you are breathing, or you even have an ounce of a sense of humor then this movie is absolutely a must have. 
The DVD version comes with 2 Disks.  Disk one is a Standard TV width.  Disk 2 is the real treasure for those with HDTV and surround sound system as it sports anamorphic widescreen (put your TV on full mode and if fills the entire screen without any sort of distortion) and a wonderful DTS soundtrack in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  There is also the usual assortment of DVD goodies spread over both disks.  One of the more interesting goodies is a Magic Mirror version of The Magic 8 ball.  Should you buy this DVD?  It is decidedly so.
