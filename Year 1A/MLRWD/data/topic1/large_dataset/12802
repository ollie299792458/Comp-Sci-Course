I loved this film. The depiction of the young Prince John was historically as well as clinically accurate. He was an epilectic child and certainly showed signs of genuine Aspergers Syndrome. The touching relationship between the prince and his beloved Nanny Lalla Bill was extraordinary. This was a woman who devoted her entire being to the care and love and education of this young boy. She quickly realized his penchant for music and nurtured it in a way that he was able to emotionally grow and feel joy through his music. She was so proud of his achievents, even though they were gained with baby steps. The mores and values of the Edwardian years were certainly portrayed accurately by the writer and director of this film. They managed to intertwine a very complicated family history and struggle of the Sax-Coburg-Gotha family and their relationship with the Romonov's including the downfall and murder of many family members. King George V's relationship with the Tsar was brought to bare and the eventual assassination of the russian royal family was a heartbreak. The effect that this war had on the royal family and on Prince John in particular was artistically written and brought to the screen in this brilliant and touching film. I highly recommend it.
