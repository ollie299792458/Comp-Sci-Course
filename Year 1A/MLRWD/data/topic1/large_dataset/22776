Well, I liked this movie.  Nia Vardalos adds a lot of clean, relatable, everywoman charm to her characters and her movies.  This charm that was bursting from the seams of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is still evident through "I Hate Valentines Day." Nia has slicked up her image and wardrobe for this character, choosing her wardrobe colors from the palette of Valentine colors and spring blossoms. But Genevieve still has that practical Nia sense of humor which she shared with Toula, which shows in such lines as, "One armed dresses are just wrong--one arm's warm...Oh! the other arm's cold!" But the best part of all is that she is reunited with her "MBFGW" costar, John Corbett, with whom she still has the undeniable chemistry which made that film so believable. Fans of MBFGW will find something to like here.  The film's limited budget contributed largely to the its flaws, but the chemistry and charm of the leads keeps the film afloat, and makes it worth at least the cost of a rental.  However I am buying it for my collection, because though I like Nia Vardalos, and I like John Corbett, I love Nia and John together!
