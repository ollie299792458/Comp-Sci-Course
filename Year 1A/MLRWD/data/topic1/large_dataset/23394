This movie is about the rekationship between shamed movie director, James Whale, and his hired landscaper.  Whale was the director of both "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein" whose career lost traction after his homosexuality became common knowledge in Hollywood.  Sir Ian McKellan plays Whale as a sly, manipulative, middle-aged man dealing with the end of his creative life.  Brendan Fraser is the straight gardener that is a fan of Whale's "Frankenstein" films and sees a world that he would not have experienced if he had not met the director.  Fraser gives a strong performance as a young man trying to find himself, and is not always comfortable with Whales' attempts to manipulate him.  Wish Fraser would take on my roles like this because he shows a different side of himself than he does when he takes on his usual lighter roles.  Lynn Redgrave is also wonderful as Whale's housekeeper.  She disapproves of her employer's lifestyle yet loves him unconditionally.

McKellan and Redgrave both received Academy Awards for their roles.  I would have liked to see Fraser nominated as well.

This is a film that would be of interest to film buffs, fans that like good acting and for those who like their films with physcological overtones.
