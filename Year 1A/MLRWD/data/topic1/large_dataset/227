*Commentary with Robert Towne and David Fincher-- Towne and Fincher offer unique insights into this classic film.

*Water and Power (HD)-- In this three-part documentary, Robert Towne visits sites along the original Los Angeles Aqueduct for the first time.  He is informed of the social and environmental impacts and given insight into the major issues around the creation and ongoing operation of the aqueduct.

*The Aqueduct (HD)-- The City of Los Angeles completed the 233-mile gravity-fed aqueduct from the Owens Valley in 1913, under the leadership of a self-taught engineer named William Mulholland. L.A. Department of Water and Power representatives along with Catherine Mulholland, granddaughter of the engineer, discuss the development of the aqueduct and its contribution to the growth of the nation's second-largest city.

*The Aftermath (HD)-- For decades a large rural community was desiccated under the management of water rights by the City of Los Angeles over a vast area of the Owens Valley.  Legal victories beginning in the 1970's lead to successful reductions in environmental damages and the restoration of some natural habitats.  Historians, local ranchers and activists discuss the up-to-date impacts of the aqueduct and struggle to maintain a stable environment and community.

*The River & Beyond (HD)-- Prior to the building of the first aqueduct a century ago Los Angeles relied solely on its own local water supply: the Los Angeles River and its aquifer.  Today the river as a water resource is largely forgotten. Currently there are plans to re-develop the river to reduce L.A.'s dependence on imported water, reducing the environmental impact on distant communities, while creating parks and open spaces for the city.

*Chinatown: An Appreciation-- In this featurette, prominent filmmakers express their personal admiration for the film: Steven Soderbergh - Director ( Traffic), James Newton Howard - Composer ( The Dark Knight), Kimberly Peirce - Writer/Director ( Boys Don't Cry), and Roger Deakins - Cinematographer ( No Country For Old Men).
