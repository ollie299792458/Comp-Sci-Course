I have always enjoyed watching this movie, and am thrilled beyond words that MGM came out of a self induced coma to re-master & release this movie to DVD format. Judy is truly at the top of her game in this picture, and Fred couldn't be more debonair.  It has been said that whenever Judy is paired with a dance partner no matter who it is, all eyes are always on Judy. I also want to give a most memorable mention to the late & immortal Ann Miller for her searing dance routine in the number "Shaking the Blues Away". Once you see this movie, you'll understand why Ann Miller was known, and coined as the "Bullet Tap" Queen.

For fans of hidden `Easter Egg's' on DVD's, one will not have search far for a special treat on disc 2 that isn't hidden, but in plain sight. I didn't even know it existed and couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear! The number is called "Mr. Monotony" and Judy don's a short, sexy, and sleek tux ensemble complete with matching fedora. Let me tell you when I watched this number for the very first time, I nearly fell out of my chair and thought it was having a deja-vu experience. In the movie she did with Gene Kelly called 'Summer Stock', she donned a similar outfit and performed a different musical number altogether. That performance was simply spectacular. I am unclear if 'Mr. Monotony' was supposed to be used in Easter Parade and am puzzled why MGM decided to cut it out of the film. Whatever the reason, I am truly grateful that this short clip still exists. This little gem of a performance makes owning this movie all the more valuable.
