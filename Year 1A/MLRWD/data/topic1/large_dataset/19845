I barely own any gay movies mainly due to the bad quality and bad acting, and let's face it we all want to look at beautiful people instead of what we are generally forced to look at in these movies. Those of you who are sick of gay movies meaning butch characters will enjoy this one.

Not only does Saving face star 2 beautiful people in Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen, but the storyline is both heartwarming and frankly quite hysterical. Director Alice Wu has done an amazing job of portraying the Asian community in a funny light, while still addressing the deeper themes and issues they face. The relationship between Wil (Michelle Krusiec) and Vivien (Lynn Chen) is one many people can relate to and they do a great job of portraying the feeling in their relationship.

Don't be put off by the subtitles!!! The scenes between Wil and Vivien are in English. I think the changes in language actually play a very important role in distinguishing between the lives of Wil and Vivien and that of their more traditional families.

Every now and then a movie comes along that I could watch a hundred times (I'm getting there!), and this is one of them.
