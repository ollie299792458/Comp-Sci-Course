Orwell's 1984 is a masterpiece of dystopian literature. A truly frightening look at a world that very well could have been and may still be yet to come. Michael Radford's movie is a nearly perfect adaptation, so much so that if you haven't read the book, it would probably help in understanding the complex nature of this movie. If you have read the book, you are in for a treat as the movie literally brings to life a perfect window view of the world described by Orwell. 
The movie, along with the book, is a bleak look at a world dominated by the ultimate extreme of totalitarian regimes. Every aspect of people's daily life is controlled and monitored by the ever present INGSOC (English Socialist Party) and its masthead, Big Brother. The story is set in a decimated but recognizable London and revolves around the central character of Winston Smith. The basic premise is the will of one man to maintain his humanity against the overwhelming force of an inhuman system. I will avoid saying more about the story except to warn that if you are looking for light entertainment, this movie is not for you. 
In short, this movie is brilliant in it own right, with riveting performances by both Richard Burton and William Hurt. The sets, cinematography and direction bring to life a fictional world in such perfect detail that I have no doubt that Orwell himself would have been astonished. Not since BladeRunner has a world been so convincingly portrayed in a movie. This movies imagery will haunt you and its story will stun you. 1984 is mesmerizing, terribly disturbing and utterly believable.
