Written in India roughly 2,000 years ago, the Mahabharata is one of the world's great religious texts. It also may be the most outlandish soap opera ever, replete with gods siring mortals, polygamy, compulsive gambling, unrequited love, and a family feud on an awesome scale.

At its heart, the epic poem of 100,000 verses tells the tale of two warring sets of royal cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who each seek to rule the kingdom. Around that rivalry is woven a wealth of philosophy, myth and history -- a virual encyclopedia of ancient Indian culture. Just one small part of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, the book that Hare Krishnas used to try to sell in airports around the world; it is a long discussion between the wise god Krishna and the soul-searching archer Arjuna (a Pandava), as the latter reluctantly prepares to enter into battle with his cousins.

This six-hour adaptation of the Mahabharata has been crafted by two great film talents: screenwriter Jean Claude Carriere ("The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie") and director Peter Brook ("Marat-Sade"). They emphasize the universality of the mythic tale, and set it on a dream-like stage whose timeless backdrops are fog and mist, rocky slopes and reed thickets, and candlelit rooms. The movie's superb cast is drawn from every continent and racial group, thus adding a rather transcendent touch, as well as eliminating the thorny problem of the Indian caste system with one stroke.

"The Mahabbarata" is both a compelling story and an enlightening spiritual journey, whether or not you've ever dipped a toe into the Ganges. It is not packed with filmic excitement, as it has the pacing and feel of a play (and indeed was adapted from Brook and Carriere's 1985 stage version), but it is full of marvelous acting, dialogue, music and cinematography. So sit back with some Darjeeling tea, and enjoy the interplay of gods and men.
