I have no idea what you get when you mix House MD with Mr. Bean, but it's not Black Adder! I'm going to save all of you about 3 hours of your life that I spent and will never get back; skip Black Adder one. Black Adder 2, 3, and 4 are all great, Black Adder 1 is bad. I won't say anything further about that horrible piece of trash. Howewver if you exclude season one, Black Adder's 2, 3, and 4 are the best thing Rowan Atkinson has ever been in. Not to take away from Mr. Bean or the Thin Blue Line, both are great shows with their own style, but I prefer an intelligent Rowan A. to the idiotic fussy characters he played in those series. Black Adder as a series is not the normal "follow the characters through a storied set of events" type of sit-com (I read another review where the reviewer called it a Brit-com. I liked that and laughed out loud). Black Adder follows the sorted history of the Adder family.... well that's not right. It follows one fictional character through factual events... no that's not right either. It travels through history making fun of famous British figures using a character named Black Adder. Yeah, I think that describes it pretty well. The stories involve a character named Baldric. Baldric is the supreme example of a person who is slobby and stupid. Series 2 surrounds the period of Queen Elizabeth the mad. Series 3 is about the time of King George the stupid (King George is played by Hugh Laurie...you know, the guy from House MD). Series 4 revovles around World War 1, in the trenches of WW1 that is. In this special edittion you also get some bonus features like outakes and deleted scenes. You will also get the Black Adder movie. The movie was so-so, just reliving the past 4 series. In closing it's a great overall buy.
