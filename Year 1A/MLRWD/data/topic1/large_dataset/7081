Sure, Stir of Echoes got the shaft because it was released around the same time as the Sixth Sense. However, the very notion that this film was great and would have been a box office smash if not for that unfortunate coincedence.. Well, that's really quite scary.
Granted, some parts were ok, at times even good, but there were a number of distractions. Kevin Bacon's son wasn't exactly easy on the eyes (I hope I don't have to elaborate this, because I don't want to offend anyone). It was also sort of surreal how he (the son) always commented on the dead people around them as if, "hey, everything is going to be ok". It's interesting for one person in a movie to be able to see dead people. Several people.. no. Especially if some small child is completely ok with it, and the father is going batty.
The son didn't even play any sort of purpose in the whole film. He just sort of screwed everything up. Kevin Bacon was definitely shortchanged here, as his performance would have seemed a lot better if not for the kid. Why drag the focus off of how frightening and mysterious it is? I swear I hated the presence of that kid in the movie long before the credits rolled by.
Also, the ending was, well, way too predictable. In a psychological thriller, I want to be surprised. I don't want to be yawning, looking at my watch, or looking for the bathroom because I could care less. See? No comparisons to that "other movie", though I'm sure you could make some yourself. This "film" is just horrible, thanks to a few mindless screw-ups.
