"The Promise" is one of the 3 best movies that I have ever seen, the other two being "Bichunmoo" and "The Restless."  It has an excellent story-line and plot structure one of the best that I have seen. Unlike the other two movies that I just mentioned it has a happy ending, which makes it very good in my opinion. The cinemetography is also very well put together making the move both visually and mentally appealing.

This is also one of the few movies that I have ever seen which seems to portray longevity as a positive feature.  Most movies condemn it as evil or something to that effect which always struck me as insane and stupid and turned me off from lots of movies like "Aeon Flux" among others.

More than one of the other reviewers on here has said they disliked it or couldn't follow it, but weren't reading the subtitles.  That is entirely understandable.  In most movies, in order to understand the plot, you must listen to what the actors are saying.  There really is no other way.  That being said, the plot is complex, which is one of the reasons that I like it so much.  Most movies of the past few years are very simplistic and, therefore, in my opinion boring and unsophisticated.  This one is not, which makes it much superior to them.
