Pontypool is an excellent, claustrophobic, intelligent horror film. It feels like H.G. Welles and Orson Welles meet William S. Burroughs via George Romero. Everything about the film is top-notch, especially the acting and cinematography. I recommend to those looking for something fresh, original, bizarre, and most importantly: substance over style. The story is what matters here. There is almost no blood, not even much violence. Most of the action takes place through outside reports, but it's all so tense and nerve-racking that you'll find yourself not caring that you can't see the action. I watched this film with three other people, and all of them were dead silent for almost all of the film's running time, completely focused and sitting on the edge of their seats.
  If there is one thing I MUST point out, it's that this film is not about zombies. Those looking for a movie about zombies could potentially be sorely disappointed. The fact that a quote from a critic, on the very packaging of the DVD, claims that Pontypool is "one of the 25 best zombie movies of all time" enrages me. Define zombies. Zombies= the living dead. The people in this movie are not corpses. They have not been brought back from death. They are infected by a virus. This is not the same thing as being a zombie (yes, that means 28 Days Later isn't about zombies either). Rent it first, with the right expectations, and you will probably love Pontypool.
