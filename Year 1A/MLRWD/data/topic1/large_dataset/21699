I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway.  This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death.  The dreams are in between dreams and reality.  It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions.  In one, he's dead.  In another, he's alive. They are chronological. They each seem so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track.  As you expect, she goes through "am I nuts?" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation.  Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it?  Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?

I found it a very interesting movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Sandra did a great job.  And the movie leaves you thinking. . . I also loved the ending.
