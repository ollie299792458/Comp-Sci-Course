This was a cynical hero, but still with a sense of right and wrong, who had learned how to survive and thrive in a dog eat dog world. By smarts, gun skills, and an aloof cavalier regard for killing those who deserved it...he perseveres. After 50 years of cinematic goody goody two shoes cowboy heroes...this was an eye popping fresh concept. Also for me one of the treats were the sets. Interiors, exteriors, the props...all looked real, not the usual hollywood fakey. Like they had gone back in time and filmed at a real location. The Ennio Morricone music turned the story situations into high drama, that somehow made things mean more than guys shooting each other on a dusty street. All the actors "looked" like their characters...making scenes and the eventual deserved outcomes for them all that more enjoyable. Gian Maria Volont&egrave; makes a great villian, energetic, deadly, simultaneously attractive and repulsive. Also for me this take on "Yojimbo" is very Italian, with bigger than life operatic bad guys and an myth-like good guy. Very enjoyable. The DVD is crisp and clear. A must have for any of us middle aged futs who saw it back when it was released originally.
