First of all what a great set of concert videos these are. Any fan

of Rush would certainly add these to there Rush collection.

Having read some of the nastier reviews on the quality of the video

and the sound remixing, I hope to add my input to help put things

in some better perspective. These were shot back when hi-definition

tv's were only in someones dreams. They were meant to be played back on a traditional television with standard resolution. I have the luxury of owing a 50" dlp samsung and a 27" panasonic television. Playing back on my panasonic you can tell these have

been restored because of the clarity of the shadow detail and overall picture quality is quite vivid. Watching on my samsung

picture quality is still okay but it is not as crisp in sharpness

and you will experience some graininess to  the video portion.

These were not filmed in Hi-Def so if you own a hi-def television

you might be a little disappointed but not totally.

The sound re-mixing on all 3 of these dvd's were to my satisfaction. I have a surround sound setup for watching on my samsung tv and the mixes sounded very good. Especially the DTS mix. I have just a regular stereo along side my panasonic tv and

the PCM stereo mix on everything was great.

Having said all that what ever type of system you have to play back these dvd's, the show is the thing and these guys Rock!!
