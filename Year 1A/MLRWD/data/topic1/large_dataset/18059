This was not only a great movie but an entertaining story from the first frame until the last. This would be a great movie to see while Tony Blair is running around the U.S. pushing sales of his just released memoirs. The movie is fiction of course but it draws on recent headlines involving Great Britain and its ties to the U.S. but more specifically the British PM and his ties to George W. Bush, and the runup to the Iraq war. That is the backdrop of the movie but it is really a story about average people getting caught up in extraordinary events. As others have said this is a movie that Hitchcock could have made. Think "Foreign Correspondent, North By Northwest, or The Man Who Knew Too Much". It helps that the movie was based on a well written book by Robert Harris, a first rate author of popular fiction, who collaborated with Roman Polanski in developing the screen play. This is a political thriller that has a lot of ironic humor in it. The dialogue is pitch perfect, the cinematography is well crafted, the actors superb; they fit into their characters like a nice leather glove. This was one of my favorite movies of the year.
