I really like veggie tales and i really enjoyed this movie. it has good clean fun with a faith based point of view that most children's marketing seems to lack. I will give the criticism, however, that exposing children only to veggie tales and not to the bible can be detrimental in the long run. Hopefully as they grow older though they will be able to find more depth in the stories offered in the bible.

I grew up in the 80s with Psalty the singing song book which is the only thing that i think can be comparable in quality and entertainment in terms of Christian children's entertainment. Unfortunately those audio tapes are out of print!! While Veggie Tales aren't as good as Psalty, they are the next best thing!

The other thing is that I read in Christianity Today that one of the sub-corporations of Disney set Big Idea Ministries back finanically. In the making of this movie since they did not meet ridiculous deadlines Big Idea was forced to pay a heafty fine to Disney, in the process they had to file for bankruptcy and lay off the majority of their staff! So I went out and purchased the Jonah movie at my local Christian Bookstore, which i rarely shop at because of my personal theology, just to support their ministries!! I would encourage everyone to do the same!!
