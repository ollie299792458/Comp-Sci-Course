I know this movie was not a blockbuster at the theatre BUT that is a real shame because a lot of folks missed out. I saw an interview with Director Peter Berg where he explained that he used this movie as a tribute to our veterans and the men and women currently serving. Knowing that before I watched the movie probably helped me to view some scenes differently. Where I might have thought a scene was lame or corny I instead thought the scene was awesomely corny!

I watched this movie with my 21yr old son. By the end we were both cheering and laughing at how, even though this is in no way an award winning film, it had just become a favorite! This movie is the best kind of entertainment! Total escapism that leaves you feeling happy when its done. That doesn't happen often these days! So if your looking to escape for a couple of hours and you can leave your expectations "at the door" then this is the film for you.

I didn't give this film 5 stars for flawless directing, Oscar winning acting, or extraordinary writing. I gave it 5 stars for being true, honest entertainment that is uplifting, and fun, and exciting, and left me in the best mood I've been in for years after watching a movie!
