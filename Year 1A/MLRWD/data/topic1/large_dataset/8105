The acting, directing, and writing are superb, especially De Mornay's performance of vengeful malevolence as the character Payton . I've never seen her act this well. The story becomes scarrier by the moment, and you keep wondering what she will do next to destroy Claire (Annabella Sciorra), the person she turns her revenge on for causing her husband to commit suicide and herself to miscarriage from the shock. The suspense keeps escalating. The writer has deftly planted the clues that will enable annabelle to finally figure out that her nanny (De Mornay)is the personification of pure evil.

I would have given this film five stars if the writer had established a believable background for Peyton so that Claire and her husband Michael would have had a solid basis for hiring her as a nanny for their young daughter and the coming baby. No matter how charming a nanny is, anyone who reads and watches the news, or views some of the Dateline and CBS news mysteries, knows that first impressions can often be misleading. 99.9% of  persons would have asked Peyton for some checkable references--people who could vouch for her character and ability to care for children--and then checked them. But this was not done, setting the rest of the story on an unbelievable foundation. The writer should have had Peyton establish some kind of a reputation--even if done with a false resume and false letters of reccomendation and a few sympathetic friends to back her up.

Notwithstanding, I highly reccommend this thriller.
