I think this is a really good acted out movie. I like the screenplay, the music, the chemistry between the actors, the whole bit, except several scenes in which they go overboard. I don't think it was just another remake of a classic movie, I think (other then a few scenes)that it was put together really good!! Deniro's portayal of Ex-con Max Cady, was very good and scary, and funny at times. Nick Nolte was great as the lawyer Sam Bowden, as well as Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis' performances as the wife and daughter. I also liked how Scorsese put the original actors (Mitchum and Peck) from the original film in cameo scenes. Basically giving credit where credit is due, I think. I remember when this came out, my parents thought it was so horrible, and said I wasn't going to see that.....but I did anyway!! The story takes place in the summer, which also creates a great warm southern mood for the film, especially the ending hearing the night sounds during the credits. I liked the ending showdown, contrary to other opinions, but the original ending is just as good. They are both great films in my opinion. I haven't seen these two DVD'S yet.....but I will....VERY soon!! I know they will be good. In This particular remake, Marty really pushes the actors to they're limit......Pure Scorsese!!
