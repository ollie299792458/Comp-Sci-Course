I saw it in the theater over 30 years ago. I bought the VHS.  I bought the DVD. Finally the Blu-ray version of the Blues Brothers arrived the other day and I watched the theatrical version of my favorite movie last night on my ten-foot screen with audiophile sound.  There is no comparison between the Blu-ray and the previous versions.  With the large screen, the deficiencies of the DVD are really apparent. The The Blu-ray picture is so crisp and colorful that one can readily see where the camera was originally slightly out of focus.

There has been lively discussion in these reviews regarding the sound quality, some people being disappointed that the DTS soundtrack is compressed or "lossy".  Played through an OPPO BDP-93 on my 7.1 system, the sound was excellent--about as good as one can expect from a 30 year old movie.  I can vouch for the fact that it is true stereo and possibly a 4-track original.  The surround effect of Carrie Fisher shooting at the escaping car right after the tunnel sequence was spectacular. I've found that the difference in quality between "lossy" and lossless formats is negligable if the sampling rate is reasonably high, especially for non-classical source materials. To my ears, the difference can be most readily heard in complex high-frequency passages involving violins or cymbals, especially on digital radio or satellite radio where low sampling rates prevail.

I haven't had time to view the extended version or any of the other information on the disk, so I can't comment beyond the theatrical version.  I don't see how any subsequent version could be significantly improved, either visually or sonically.  I highly recommend the Blu-ray Blues Brothers!
