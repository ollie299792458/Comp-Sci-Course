Batman Returns is a very dark and entertaining film. Danny Devito and Michael Keaton make good adversaries as the penguin and Batman.  This movie takes the darkness that was present in the first movie and turns it on turbo with even the music being so dark.  It was a great shame that this was to be the last great batman movie until Begins but it doesnt dissappoint.  The movie opens with a disturbing sequence of the penguins parents dumping their child into the sewer.  Then the credits roll with the entertaining Elman score and the movie picks up 33 years later.  And it is an action packed ride, with a major attack by penguins circus,  and a nice catwoman sequence as she destroys christopher walkens store,  battles between batman and catwoman create sexual tension between the two baddies and it is wierd to see them out of their costumes becoming a couple while they are trying to kill each other without knowing.  And a destructive sequence with the batmobile is a highlight but the major highlight is the finale as the penguin releases his penguins with missiles on their back and sends them to destroy gotham city.  All of this makes Batman Returns feel like a good sequel because it is bigger and better than the original. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good action flick.
