Any sequel bears a heavy burden to match up against its older brother but MIBII turns out to be more of a "red-headed stepchild".  It must take one of the records for shortest movie of all time (or nearly so)...at 1 hour and 17 minutes (I timed it, a bit of a compulsive habit I have) it had the effect of making it feel like I had set there for 2 and a half hours...not because it was good, it was just that uninteresting.
I was hoping for a bit more originality in plots rather than finding out yet again, the plot device that everyone was searching for was a charm-size object attached to something.
The movie seemed so disjointed, almost as if the director and editor didn't bother to show up to the final cut.  The movie didn't "snap" like the first one, probably because of the lack of flow.
It is sad as well when Johnny Knoxville's character is more interesting and funny than either of the main characters.
I was entertained enough by the effects, but left with a sour taste in my mouth.  I was very disappointed in not being able to come the next day and tell my friends what a good movie it was...rather I had to say not to set your expectations higher than what you would expect from a low-budget, uninteresting thriller starred by has-been actors...thats what this movie felt like.
One can only hope that a MIBIII might be that bright sibling we had hopee to see in this movie.
