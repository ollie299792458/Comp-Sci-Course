This is my favorite movie!  Paul Sheldon (brilliantly played by James Caan) is in a horrible auto accident.  Annie Wilkes (even MORE brilliantly played by kathy Bates) "saves" him from dying.  Meanwhile, the rest of the world thinks he is dead.  Ironically, Annie is Pauls "Number one Fan"
Annie seems like the perfect nurse; cheerful, pleasant, great cook; until she finishes reading her newest Paul Sheldon book which kills of her favorite character, Misery Chastain.  Annie throws a rage, saying Paul is "not good".  She then leaves.
Annie is back the next day, cheerful as ever.
Kathy Bates deservedly won an oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes.  She goes from giggly happy woman to a monster in 0.0034 seconds.  She is one of the scariest figures thought up by Stephen King, the one who wrote the book the movie is based on.  This is scarier than other movies because it can really happen.  
I recommend this movie to anyone.  I love it.  It is full of suspense, horror, and twisted plot characteristics.  A great movie to watch!
