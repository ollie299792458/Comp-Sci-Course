As you can see from my rating, I also feel that this is an excellent movie.  I just wanted to clear up one fact from a previous review so as to give two excellent Maori actors their dues.  Temuera Morrison played Jake "the Muss" Heke in OWW.  Ironically, it was this critically acclaimed performance which brought him to the attention of Hollywood where he was later to play alongside Pamela Anderson in "Barbed Wire", Marlon Brando in "The Island of Dr. Moreau", he was also a main character in "Speed 2" and more recently as Jango Fett in the Star Wars prequels.

Not to take away from Tem's incredible performance in OWW, but the contrast of the "somewhat soft son in 'Whale Rider'", doesn't work because that part was played by another talented Maori actor - Cliff Curtis.  He also had a role in OWW; that of Uncle Bully.  His performance has also led to a career in Hollywood playing various minorities - the drug dealing hispanic in "Bringing Out the Dead", the Central American terrorist in "Collateral Damage", and plenty of Middle Eastern characters ("Three Kings", "The Majestic", etc.)

It's a pity that a wider audience isn't given the opportunity to see these guys in roles that really showcase their acting chops.  Still, at least they have careers (such as they are).  There are plenty of talented actors out there whose closest shot at fame has been being a waiter in Hollywood.
