This film is very good in some respects, and very poor in others. Firstly the bad: the music is much to intrusive (kind of like Orff's Carmina Burana on steroids). I wouldn't mind so much but it also intrudes over dialog, and there's not enough quiet time to take in the ambience or background noises of Rome or the Vatican. Secondly, some of the physics is nonsensical - antimatter is possibly a viable method of STORING energy, but energy cannot be created from nowhere, so the atomic collider that made it must have had one hell of a power supply! Thirdly, the leading lady (Zurer playing Vetra) seems to be both a medical doctor and an atomic physicist and a biologist (an unusual combination), and also seems to be knowledgeable about the history of science, and yet she is able to contribute very little, other than as a vehicle for listening to Langdon's "miraculously" correct explanations. The power cycling idea was an interesting plot twist, but why so long a black-out on each region? Finally, the pace of the film is often too frenetic - a "by-the-numbers" scheduling dictated by on-the-hour deaths, and the ability to predict precisely when a battery will run out (something that even battery designers would have a hard time doing!).

The good: I liked some of the photography, and the image quality of the Blue-ray disk is superb. I always enjoy watching Tom Hanks, and the film has enough puzzles and detail to support multiple viewings (I doubt anyone would spot all the clues - even after seeing it twice). The eclectic mix of particle physics, history, present-day Vatican protocols, and power politics makes for an interesting entertainment.
