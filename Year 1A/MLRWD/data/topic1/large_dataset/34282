Finally Bottle Rocket is now on Criterion and Blu-ray simultaneously. The film that introduced Wes Anderson and his clan to the world.The transfer looks absolutely amazing. All the extras are great too, including deleted scenes, and the original short. The best part though is the very relaxed and candid commentary by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. The two sit and chat and they are so relaxed with one another you eventually feel you are just sitting there with them watching the film. Several times i wished i could just chime in and add my two cents to the mix. Sometimes I feel filmmakers need a fans perspective to add to the depth these commentaries have. Now with every film getting a commentary many get lost in the mix. Still It was fans who enjoyed such commentaries on laserdisc that made DVDs what they are today.

This disc is also on DVD but for that extra bit of quality the Blu-Ray is worth it. Get a PS3 and this disc and you will be set. Now all we need is a Wes Anderson Blu-Ray collection with all his films. I am sure Rushmore, Tenebaums, Life Aquatic and Darjerling will all look spectacular when they come out.

Thanks Wes, Owen and the people at Criterion.
