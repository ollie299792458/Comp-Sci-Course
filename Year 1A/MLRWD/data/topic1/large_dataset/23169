For those fans of Wayne's The Alamo, the wide screen director's cut is the only version to own. Film reconstructors have included the original overture, intermission, and end themes. For those only familiar with the  shorter version Alamo shown repeatedly over the decades this version offers  a significantly different feel. Watch for these "new" scenes:  -the deadly conclusion of the raid to obtain gunpowder from the chuch at  Bexar -Travis' complete speech to Dickenson on his feelings for the  defenders -Crockett's night with the Senora -the Senora's brief scene with  a young actress playing a fleeing Bexar woman, this actress was latered  murdered during the filming of the Alamo by her boyfriend  -scenes showing  the deaths of the Tennessee characters Scotty and the Parson -the Birthday  party for the Dickenson child -Crockett's prayer scene following the death  of  the Parson -the extended "last night" philosophical  discussion amongst the Alamo defenders, that almost results in a fight  -Bonhams original report to Travis -the "other" Crockett death  scene, slightly different from the one usually shown In addition to a few  other scenes, note the extensive use of crucifix iconography throughout the  film, especially with the Bowie character and Crockett prayer  scene...although criticised for being overblown and historically inaccurate  , the director's cut Alamo is a powerful, visually stunning piece of work  viewed 40 years later.
