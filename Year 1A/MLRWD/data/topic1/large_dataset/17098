Once again Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Forrest Gump) proves that he is perhaps the best actor of the last 50 years with a tour-de-force that takes him around the world in 1500 days.  
The movie begins with Chuck Noland (Hanks) going to Moscow to teach the FedEx way to the Russians.  He leaves his girlfriend Helen Hunt (Twister, As Good as it Gets) with a promise to return for New Year's.  It will be four years before he sees her again. 
After surviving a plane crash the movie follows Hanks attempts to cope with life alone.  He befriends a volley ball, whose death is perhaps the only time I have cried over an inanimate object in a movie.  But that shows you how wrapped up you become in the film without realizing it.
Although the film is just under two and a half hours it goes by quickly. 
Collateral material is excellent.  This is the kind of information I really like to see.  Director Robert Zemeckis  (Forrest Gump, Romancing the Stone) tells the story of the "real" Wilson, a volleyball that floated to shore as he was researching the movie.  A good part on the creation of the plane crash and lots of footage of Tom Hanks just clowning around with the cast, crew and locals on the set in Russia, where very few people know the talented actor.
