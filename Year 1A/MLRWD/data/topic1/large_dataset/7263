This movie is what Machete should have been. Non stop fun from start to finish. there is almost never a dull moment, it starts and doesn't stop skate raping your face until the credits roll. The director of this film made a fake trailer for the release of The Film Grindhouse (A Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino double feature experience chuck full of fake trailers) he would later go on to win the contest, and then several years later he got the opportunity to make his first feature,Hobo With a Shotgun. That is our dream, and he did it. He made a movie with all his friends, and its a damn fine movie. The guy even put up his own money to make this movie, he gave up his paychecks from the movie... that's heart, that's dedication, that's love. You simply don't see that anymore. You know, people always watch old films from the 70's and 80's and they say "They just don't make movies like this anymore." well guess what, the do! Hobo With a Shotgun is a breath of fresh air, Its a beautiful homage to the films we all love.

Thank you Jason Eisener for making this film. I love it, and I will support anything you do from here on out.
