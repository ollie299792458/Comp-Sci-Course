If you have ever found yourself attracted to a bipolar person check out Paula's sidekick played by Zooey Deschanel.  I agree with the other reviewers she is the funniest thing in the movie.  But her character also made me see "bipolar" differently.  Sure, some of them are impossible and this was only a movie, but they have a bad rap in a society that over emphasizes politically correct under-reaction.  Zooey is Jungian complete.  She is not dominated by one way or another of reacting to something.  She will see and express both pleasure and annoyance at the advances of her suitor.  And by the end of the movie, they seem to be having the most fun compared to the lead couple who turn out to be boringly traditional after all.

But I disagree that the main point of the relationship between Paula and Tripp is that it's based initially on deception and falls into that category.  This would have been cleared up rather easily.  The subtext here is that Paula's entry into the relationship is based on her own past unreliable experiences with men and she tries to substitute a financial relationship for a personal one, like an exotic dancer or an escort.  She's a glorified escort by another name.  She goes to bed with her clients and does this for money, for crying out loud, how can you gloss over that?  :D

This is an exaggerated case, of course.  Most women in that situation just get bitter and become casual users of men, not actual escorts.  I think the movie manages to explore this issue, its causes, and its cures (which seem to involve seeing the whole context of friends and family), while staying light and funny.  We aren't even aware we've been sociologically educated.  That's a big achievement.  With that plus the wonderful bipolar subplot I had to give this movie 5 stars!
