Gee, how many times have I seen "Raising Arizona?" I unwrapped the dvd version the other day which I found for five bucks somewhere and (cue bluegrass 9th symphony), I pushed "play", sat down and I was off to the races like a warthog from hell. Yeah, I sat through the whole thing--again--for the umpteenth time. Either I'm an idiot, the Coens are geniuses or...oh well, just admit the Coens are geniuses.

  Every time I see a young man with one of those "do-rags" (or whatever you call them) on their head I can't help but say to myself "son, you got a panty on yer head..." I haven't gotten cut yet because I try not to say it where they can hear it. My take on it is if somebody is stupid enough to wear something on their head which emulates a prisoner working for $1 a day in the hot prison laundry they deserve to be told "son, you've got a panty on your head." (My wife gets her way on this one.)

  Excellent humor with the right touch of sentimentality and you've got one heckuva movie.

  Let's see...by my estimation Nathan Jr. should be in college by now--and twenty more years from now I'm sure we'll still be watching "Raising Arizona."  Surely by then they'll be studying the movie in the greatest film schools in the world. I suppose the Coens will get into heaven just on the basis of their making this movie. I can see St. Peter now standing in front of heaven some day, looking in his "Book of Life and saying: "Coen...Coen...let's see...Coen...oh! You are one of the guys who made 'Raising Arizona' aren't you?!...Oh, man, you get an automatic entrance into heaven. That's one of the "Big Man's" favorite movies."
