The Asylum cashes in on the theatrical release of Alex Aja's PIRANHA 3D with their own trashy Mockbuster, MEGA PIRANHA. A US agent must head into the Amazon in order to stop a genetically-engineered breed of man-eating piranha from reaching the Florida coast! Never mind what is wrong with the film. Like any other Asylum release, every single aspect of MEGA PIRANHA is absolutely terrible. What sets this one apart is that it is actually entertaining. The amount of over-the-top action that Eric Forsberg crams into the film is absurd, and as illogical and improbable as the scenes may be, they are always filled with laughs. The only thing more ridiculous than a helicopter shooting missiles at baby piranhas or huge 25-foot piranhas mindlessly launching themselves at buildings is watching the lead bicycle kick the giant fish in the face as they launch themselves at him from the water. Acting this poor can't be intentional. Paul Logan and 80's teen idol Tiffany can only act on a single emotion, but each of their performances are hilarious in their own uniquely awful ways. No written description can properly illustrate MEGA PIRANHA's on-screen insanity, so this one must be seen to believe!
