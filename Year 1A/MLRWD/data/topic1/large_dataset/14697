I'm a western movie lover.  This was a movie that really scratched that itch.  Tommy Lee Jones is terrific and shows once again what a fine actor he really is.  Julio Cedillo, as Melquiades Estrada, is an excellent actor and also, ladies, very  handsome.  All in all, it is really an excellent movie.

The tale is one of deep friendship between two people that come from different worlds.....and the border that divides two countries as well as peoples' souls.  It is a story of loyalty and dedication in the face of adversity.  The scenery is excellent and the content is amazingly accurate, i.e. capturing the area of wilderness that lies in Texas and in Mexico.

It is a bit harsh at times, being that Tommy Lee Jones literally has his buddy dug up, after he is murdered, and then carts him back to his home in Mexico to be buried, all the while dragging with him an obnoxious and disgusting border patrol agent. You get over the harshness rather quickly, though, as you come to understand the principles behind the man and his actions.

Highly recommended, the movie takes you away from present day societal craziness for a while, and plunks you into present day rural craziness for a while.  It was great.
