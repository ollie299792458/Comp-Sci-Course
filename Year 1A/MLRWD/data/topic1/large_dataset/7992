This is a good, not perfect, movie. Lots of special effects, great acting, solid direction. Only one swear word that I noticed.

Children under ten might be alarmed at some of the moments. There was one spot that did creep me out a bit.
This is what I'd give this movie:  5 is the best...

Acting: 4.5
Direction:  3.5
Special Effects: 4.0 (I thought that the Golden Gate effect looked fake)
Story: 5.0
Total 4.5

Stick around for the end of the credits. I have read that this is the final film. However, I'm not sure that it will be.

There are a few new heroes and villains. Juggernaut is the best of the new bunch. He is pretty much unstoppable. It is neat-o to see him running through walls and people. I would love to see him as a villain again.

Watch out for a spoiler coming! Stop here and you won't read it.

Spoiler Alert: Last chance to stop reading if you need to! Here it comes: people die in this movie. Don't go into this movie expecting things to end perfectly happy. If you know this going in, you might enjoy the movie more. Your favorite character(s) might even get killed off. Who knows? That is something that I enjoyed about this movie.. I couldn't have told you exactly how it would end going in.

OK, thanks for reading this review. Go get popcorn!
