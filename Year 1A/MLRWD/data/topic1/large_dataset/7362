I find it ironic that the cartoons that I loved as a kid come with a disclaimer on the back of the box stating that this set is "intended for the adult collector and may not be suitable for children."  I don't think, as a child I understood the "black face" jokes.  And I've never attempted to bash my cats over the head with shovels, either.  From what I have found elswhere on the world wide web, the Tom and Jerry cartoons will never me remastered since the original negatives were destroyed in a fire decades ago.  This is as good as it gets (and they look much better than on our TV of twenty-five years ago).  I've noticed that Mammy's voice in a couple of episodes sounds a little different than in others, but the accent is still there (these may have been the only copies left, I don't know).  Because of the "accidental" inclusion of edited cartoons on the original set, Warners did their best to make sure that the episodes in this set are unedited.  It looks like they did a pretty good job.  They even include a commentary/introduction to disc 2 by Whoopi Goldberg to expain the presence of Mammy and her importance to Tom and Jerry.  She includes a PC segment of how these cartoons were wrong to include stereotypes then and now.  However, folks, remember these cartoons are a reflection of the time period.  This set is wonderful and as a long-time fan of Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry, I am ecstatic over its release.  Thank you, Warners.
