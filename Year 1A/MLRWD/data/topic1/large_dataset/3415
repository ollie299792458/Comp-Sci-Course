I'm closely related to Bellflower's director so you'd think I'd know a lot about it, but while I saw it and commented on it along the way ,the final film was a complete mystery and surprise to me. This title is not yet available on DVD but I saw it at Sundance in a preview screening. I entered the theater in Park City with a mixture of trepidation and hope and with no pre-formed bias. That is, I'd already rehearsed in my head how to act if I hated it. While there are often small differences between previews and final releases they are probably small, so I think that what I saw is close to the eventual DVD release. The first part of the film feels like a brutally accurate portrayal of 20-something LA life in the large bohemian population of wannabe and soon-to-be artists and actors here. A switch is flipped at the halfway point that takes the train completely off the tracks. I left the screening with the profound feeling that I had witnessed a small but seismic shift in the language of the cinema. Whether you will love it or hate it (not too likely) I think you will be glad that you saw it and own it. The visual language and dramatic structure are strikingly fresh. Watch it.
