I can understand some of the gripes about it lacking any video/audio enhancements and lack of special features but for those interested in content- It's a good buy.  It's a must for any X-Men fan, whether it's of the comics or the movies.  The great thing about this show is that it appeals to kids, adults and those in between.  It's great to watch it when you're older and (for example) you finally realize what some of the things Gambit said to Rogue really meant.

  Some aspects of it might be dated but it will appeal to kids of this generation because the stories and voice acting were great. It wasn't as censored (like Spiderman) and it was as true to the comic books as possible;  Especially the Dark Phoenix Saga in Season 3, which was almost quoted word for word. It's sad that they don't have special features but any X-Men fan should support it.  I just got the dvds today and for those who are looking at the page and haven't read the other reviews, they fixed some of the annoying animation errors during the first run and they're unedited. I read that it even features Storm's original voice (i'm going to find out right now).  I'm especially excited that 'Days of The Future Past' is on it, considering that they refuse to show it on tv.

 Long story short, you can't go wrong.
