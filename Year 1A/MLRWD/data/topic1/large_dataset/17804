When i first heard about this movie 6 months ago, I had little hope. It is directed by Anthony Hickox who has directed some really bad movies. The premise was originally to be about mutants being on a sub and Steven fighting them off. But they changed it to a more logical plot(very happy they did). Submerged stars Steven Seagal, and Vinnie Jones. They are the most important actors in this film. Basically Steven is a independent agent who has his own private crew and they take out the bad guys. He is called upon to deal with a scientest who created a mind controlling drug and has used it to take out the US Ambassador. Steven and the others know that something else is going to down and they must hurry and stop it!

Submerged is better then Out for a Kill, Belly of the Beast, Out of Reach and Into the Sun(which we all thought would be good). Into the Sun had a budget of $35million. This one had only $15million. But the ACTION WAS GREAT! There were 5 times more action then Into The Sun. The plot was better and so were the characters. I was happy to see such good actors. The CGI werent tops. but they got the job done. There is a good amount of action to keep the fans pleased. I know I was. Submerged is rated "R" for Strong Violence and Language. Probably the best movie he has made since Exit Wounds. In my opinion only, if this movie has a bigger budget and more known actors, this could have been Under Seige 3! It was that good. Sit back and enjoy!
