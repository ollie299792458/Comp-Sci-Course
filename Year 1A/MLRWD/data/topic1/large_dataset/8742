Being a person who enjoys not viewing a show on television but instead waits for it to come on dvd, I couldn't have been more pleased with this delightful show. Being a fan of David Boreanaz I thought I would give this show a try. I'm not normally a fan of crime shows but as I stated a had an interest in the cast. While I enjoyed Boreanaz in it as I knew I would I fell in love with Emily Deschanel's character. She plays one of the most interesting people on television today.

The banter that goes on between these two main characters is a joy to watch. I'll even say that the two of them may have the best chemistry on tv. Boreanaz plays tough as nails but nice guy in the inside  Agent Seely Booth, and Deschanel plays Dr Temperance Brennan a forensic anthropologist. Booth who works for the FBI investigates the murders that occur and Brennan determines the cause of death and uncovers clues based on the bones.

Each episode plays as a stand alone but the character dynamics build throughout the season and really is a joy to watch. As I said I'm not a huge fan of crime dramas but if for nothing else I deeply enjoyed the cast of this excellent show. And also loved the crime aspect as it is done differently than other crime solving shows.

I highly suggest this wonderful show. If you appreciate character relationships than you will love this show.
