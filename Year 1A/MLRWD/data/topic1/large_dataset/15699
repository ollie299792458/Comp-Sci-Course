Three fine actors playing against type...

Bogart's usual hard-boiled unflappable tough guy is nowhere in evidence here.  In his place we see a lonely, damaged man, falling apart before our eyes.  In the courtroom scene, you want to slap your hand over Commander Queeg's mouth to stop his pitiful descent.

In my opinion, Van Johnson was often given roles that didn't ask much of him as an actor. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of his romantic comedies.  In The Caine Mutiny though, he shows that he was capable of far more range than he was usually called on to portray.  We see Lt. Maryk really struggling, first to support (at least half-heartedly) a new commander, while his crewmates chafe at the change in discipline, and then having to make a possibly career-ending choice to go against Queeg to save the ship.

Fred MacMurray is completely dispicable as the self-serving coward, Lt. Keefer.  Who knew you could hate Fred MacMurray???

Jose Ferrer is often singled out for praise in this movie, but I felt like he was chewing up the scenery a lot of the time, perhaps because his character isn't properly developed and we don't really understand his motivations. I haven't read it, but I understand Lt. Greenwald is more three-dimensional in the book.
