This Arrow blu-ray of Dario Argento's Phenomena is excellent. I first watched Creepers (the US title for Phenomena) on the old Media Entertainment video. I remember enjoying it at a young age and the memories of the film always stuck with me.  The atmosphere in this movie is dream-like.  Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance as Jennifer Corvino.  I really liked Daria Nicolodi's performance as Ms. Bruckner, and I wish she had more screen time.  I recommend this film to everyone.  The combination of the night scenes, the Fohn wind in Switzerland, and that awesome theme music in beginning "Valley" makes this one unique movie you will not forget.  It is great to finally be able to watch it uncut.
The bluray picture quality is excellent. I have heard negative things about it, but when I put it in the blu-ray player I see a BEAUTIFUL image. This is the best transfer of the movie I have seen.  It doesn't have that gritty, fade, washed out look. The audio was excellent too.  I enjoyed the extras, such as the "making of" documentary. I just wish it came with the original theatrical trailer and some more extras from the time it was made in the 80s. The packaging was nice and I could tell much thought went into designing it.  Highly recommended.  I rate this 5 stars, excellent film plus excellent quality release!
