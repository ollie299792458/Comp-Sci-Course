If you are looking for a great time you need not look any further than your local video store. The sequel to Jack Frost is as good as it gets! Let's say for example somebody walked up to me on the street and asked,"What is the best movie you have ever seen?" I would have to reply with out a doubt, "Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman." I mean I'm sure Ken Caminiti would agree with me on this.....cause Jack is back and he's chillin' and killin' and icin' and slicin'. He makes a boring tropical paradise into one hell of a good time. Buckle your seatbelts ladies and gents because you are about to embark on the journey of a lifetime. James Bond movies are a thing of the past. Jack Frost is the future. I can't believe this movie didn't make it to theaters. I am still dreaming of that day when I will be able to see Jack up on the big screen dueling it out with sheriff Sam. Well, all I can say is that Michael Cooney is a genius and I hope he continues the series. Watch the credits to this movie, because it hopefully gives a hint of what is to come in the Frost series. If you do not remember anything I have just told you, remember this; Jack Frost is here and now, and will forever be. Do us all a favor and turn off your computer and head straight to Blockbuster, or better yet, order the DVD here at Amazon.com now.
