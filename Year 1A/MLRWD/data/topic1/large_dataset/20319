"Outland" is truly an enjoyable film.  Sean Connery does an excellent job portraying William O'Neil, a Federal Marshall sent to one of Jupiter's moons to provide security for the mining colony on this moon.  Several apparent suicides begin to occur while O'Neil is performing his tour, so he begins to launch his own investigation to uncover the truth behind these suicides.  O'Neil finds out that a new drug is being administered to the miners so they can produce more output, but the drug's side effects cause the miners to go crazy and kill themselves.  When the general manager of the mining operation realizes that O'Neil has found out about this drug, he dispatches two paid assassins to kill O'Neil.  The suspense in the film mounts as O'Neil prepares to fight while the assassins are being transported to the mining colony.  The movie features good special effects and performances by the main actors, Sean Connery and Peter Boyle.  I definitely recommend this film to any sci-fi or action film fan, as well as anyone looking for a good suspenseful movie.
