It seems counterintuitive to label a movie about a pig girl as beautiful, but that is exactly what it is.  The world that you are invited to enter in Penelope is visually stunning, whimsical, and decadent.  I found myself aching to be able to walk through this magical city, even though the only thing magical is Penelope herself.  Despite the premise, the story line is believable and real.  Every frame and line of this film shows the immense care and craftsmanship that was taken, from the writing to the acting.  It is both storytelling and moviemaking at its best.  While at first glance, the lesson or moral of this fable may seem trite, it is illustrated in a new and imaginative way, and is still a lesson that so many of us have yet to mastered for ourselves.  From the first viewing, Penelope worked its way into my top ten movies.  It is one that I will watch again and again, both when I am cozily happy on a rainy day and when I am sad and need to see the brighter, more hopeful side of life.  Perfectly crafted, perfectly acted, perfect.
