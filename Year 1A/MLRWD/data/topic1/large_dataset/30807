Buffy the vampire slayer has been and forever will be a groundbreaking television show. Many would be as i was intially put off by the title of the show. But on a whim I decided to watch the first season and before i knew it i was on season 7. This boxset provides all seven seasons containing all the features found on the initial single boxsets. But as a added bonus you get a nice booklet that briefly sums up all the episodes, a letter from joss whedon the creator , and a extra bonus disc filled with interesting new special features. But you must be wondering about the packaging well you would be glad to hear it is appealing and saves up more space than buying all seven boxsets but more importantly the seasons are conatined and displayed within a nice booklet form that keeps the disc from harm. In my experience i received mine in perfect condition not a dent on the box or a scratch on a disc. Now in my opinion if you are already a buffy fan you should only consider picking this up if you only have about three boxsets or less and are considering purchasing the rest. If you own more put serious consideration into the purchase for you would only be spending more money. As for the hardcore fans they will be picking this up no matter what. But for those of you who have never seen an episode and are simply interested in and looking for a action packed supernatural comedy filled with wit and a dash of drama look no further than buffy.This show will have you laughing and crying until the very end. What are you waiting for the buffyverse awaits!
