A masterpiece of a movie that I am just now appreciating,really for the first time. I remember my parents seeing this movie way back in 1969, and not really understanding any of it. It is a unique movie in so many ways, and it is easy to see why my parents were so confused.
Midnight Cowboy was also had it's own Mort Drucker movie spoof in an issue of Mad Magazine, so I familarized myself with the general story many years ago as a kid.
Later, I watched it on the late movie and it made very little sense because it was heavily edited.
Without re-describing the narrative thrust of it, this movie is an initiation into big city hustling, street prostitution, drug use, and just surviving on the streets of New York. Made years before the word "homeless" was an active part the American vocabulary, this movie is somewhat prolific in tone, and although it is set in the late sixties, it could be any following decade. If any kid thanks that hustling and panhandling in the streets of New York could be "romantic" or just wants to be in New York and living on the streets just to be there and away from home, needs to see this movie.
What makes this movie a masterpiece is the top quality acting, the use of flashbacks to maximum effect, and just the subtle way of showing us how any regular "Joe Buck" can be turned into a monster by their past, their present cicumstances, and their lack of hope. And yet, there is something wonderful in finding friendship even in the worst places.
Winner of the Academy Award for best picture of 1969, it certainly is a worthy mainstream film that also be considered as one of the best "art" films of all time as well.
I have not watched disc 2 yet, but still give this one 5 stars! The postcards included are the best movie PR postcards, ever!
Harry Nilsson, Rest in Peace!
