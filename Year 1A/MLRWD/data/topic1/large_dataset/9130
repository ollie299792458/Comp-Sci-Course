I bought this video to satisfy the pirate-longings of my four year old son, figuring that its year of release (1935) would mean it would be both fun and safe.  Happy to say that I'm two for two.  My son loves it, there is no scene I need to shield him from (believe it or not, even the torture scene is tame!), and his only complaint are the 'boring parts' where Flynn and de Havilland are talking and falling in love.

An added dimension of hilarity for me, a former USCG officer and square rigger sailor, are Hollywood's depictions of life at sea.  What a hoot!  Below deck areas, even for slaves, are enormous. Olivia de Havilland's cabin has a huge four poster bed!  Flynn's captain's cabin has these huge bay windows that open out to the sea.  Lots of details are just funny, like the little biddy cannons they use--we're a long way from Master and Commander.  In the climactic battle scene, Flynn's ship pretends to be French and attacks one of two real French ships that are bombarding Fort Royal.  He creams one ship, then turns the wheel to cause his ship to maneuver sideways over to the other French ship, which never noticed its comrade being attacked!  Then the British fleet comes in, and you can see the ships making way smartly as their sails are backing.

SO--let your kids have their fun while you have yours.
