All that has been said already to praise this film has been said. Suffice to say, this is also my favourite film. I am moved by the fact that so many people have givin this epic such a high rating, which it naturally deserves. Bravo! I write here briefly to address the 'missing footage' issue. It has been available, all but briefly, and was one of the last LaserDisc pressings in 1998. The missing 'My Home Town' (storyline previously pointed out by fellow reviewer Harris Fogel of Philadelphia PA) is complete and intact as chapter 40 side 4 (yep, it's a LONG movie!). Another reviewer also mentions a complete running time of 185 minutes, however the LaserDisc totals 178 minutes, therefore maybe still incomplete. I was unaware of this missing scene until my LaserDisc purchase in '98, and I cannot tell you my surprise and delite to see 'more' of my favourite film upon this disc's first viewing. It was like finding candy in a depleted candy shop! So, if your after the complete 'Lucky'of the draw - find a copy of this rare Laserdisc. What a wonderful way to farewell a format that had served us so well for so long. Enjoy!
