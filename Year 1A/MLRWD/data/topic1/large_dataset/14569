I have been a die hard Motley Crue fan for 22 years,i have seen them over a dozen times in concert,Motley Crue has taken the torch for best heavy metal and stage shows,after every tour they think "how can we do better next time?"and they hit a bullseye with this tour,i was at this concert that was filmed at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapid, Michigan,I was in the 4th row,I am 41 and the Crue made me feel like a teenager again,I couldn't talk for a week after the show,I am not kidding either,I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO LOVES HEAVY METAL AND STAGE SHOWS WITH PYROGRAPHICS to buy this DVD.

Tommy Lee does a heck of a drum solo,there fire breathing midgets,near naked female acrobats,Vince,Tommy,Nikki,and Micki really got it right this time,over 3 hours of Motley Crue tunes,enough pyrographics to light up a small town,the Crue driving thier Harley Davidson choppers on stage

the bottom line is-----EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED!

if you weren't a cruehead before this DVD,you will be after it.

I have gone all over Michigan never to miss a Motley Crue concert,then when I got 4th row and seen this show was being filmed just 20 minutes from my home,I felt like I hit the lottery,I have seen clips of the DVD and I saw myself several times(pretty cool)I also saw them previously in Detroit,then later in Detroit, seeing Motley Crue 3 times in 6 months is a dream,now I have that dream on DVD,they also played songs they usually don't like Glitter,Without You.go buy it hook it up and crank it up,you will love it
