This is the dvd you have been looking for if you have been frustrated in trying to learn to knit. I've sat beside two different people who have patiently tried to instruct me, and I've also taken a class, and I have a good book, but nothing compares with having a close up view of a knitter's hands right in front of you, in the same position as your hands, guiding you through the steps. This is just excellent and the instructor is very pleasant. The stop-and-start-whenever-you-want feature is also perfect for the beginning knitter, who needs to finish a row, or practice for several rows before moving on. It's also very easy to play a section again as often as you like through a menu that comes up on the screen after each new lesson. I originally bought it because I wanted to compare continental and english knitting, which is another real plus of this dvd and the way it is structured. I'm glad I read the other reviews on this site and bought this dvd - it's a must-have and the only one you'll need to get started, whichever style of knitting you feel comfortable with.
