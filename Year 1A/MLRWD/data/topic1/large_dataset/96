This was a well done movie but I did not like the actors' acting, except for the young revolutionary who becomes so disillusioned.  The action was done well, and the sets/settings were good especially considering the trouble they had filming.  But John Wu had a lot more trouble, and "Red Cliff" {international cut/2 parts} was incredible.  The Warlords seemed bored and straining to produce anger and fierceness.  I hate to descredit any Chinese filmmaking because those guys are getting truly masterful with their action and epics.  Goodness knows it's hard for them to get their money/backing for these movies--and it's so interesting to see Chinese history instead of having to read it from some dull old Brit in the last half century.  For good background writing on China and Korea, you still need to read Pearl Buck for the truth and a good yarn.  We have so little choice, you should still buy The Warlords--but also check out Curse of the Golden Flower and,definitely Red Cliff-the 2 part version.
