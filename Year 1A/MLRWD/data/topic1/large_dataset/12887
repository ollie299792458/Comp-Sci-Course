I was surprisingly pleased to somehow find this DVD set at my local Wal-Mart, a week before it's apparently supposed to be released. Judging from previous descriptions, I was expecting 3 discs of matches. The WWE pulls through again. The matches are part of the extra's. Here's how this set is set-up. Each disc contains 5 Superstars, each with a roughly 10 minute video biography, with some great clips from their past. Then there are 5 matches on each disc (6 on the 3rd disc actually). Then there are extra...extras, mainly interviews & promos. Of course, there are the hidden extras, which I haven't gotten to just yet.

Disc 1 features Bobby Heenan, JYD, Sgt. Slaughter, Greg Valentine, & Roddy Piper. None of the matches on disc 1 have been previously shown on another WWE DVD (Santana/Valentine is not the same match as shown in the Hall of Fame 2004 DVD).

Disc 2 features Jerry Lawler, Arn Anderson, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, & Ric Flair. Again, none of the matches on disc 2 have been previously shown on another DVD (the Flair/Rhodes match is from Starrcade 84, the match on Flair's DVD set is Starrcade 85).

Finally, disc 3 features Jimmy Snuka, Bob Orton, Iron Sheik, Paul Orndorff, & Hulk Hogan. This disc contains the only match with has previously been shown on another WWE DVD, which is Hogan/Iron Sheik.

This is another great DVD set, & I'd highly recommend it to any wrestling fan.

Check the May 12th review (Floyd) for the list of matches, with is accurate, just throw Valentine/Santana, which is a Lumberjack Match, on the list.
