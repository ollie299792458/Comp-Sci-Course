This movie a a stirring look into the life of a Russian Jewish family. From the practice of our shabbet, all the way to our Jewish wedding, this movie presents all our traditions and customs to the non-Jewish world.
Topol is brilliant in the role of Tevye, from the look all the way down to the accent. While it does leave out some of the tiny details that were given in the Broadway version of this play, it also adds so much more to an already great production. We could never imagine 'If I Were A Rich Man' without thinking of Tevye dancing up a storm of dust in his barn, or 'Sunrise, Sunset' without all the children and adults gathered around the wedding canopy. (This feat was impossible on the stage due to the fact that the actors would then block the view of the audience.)
~*~Facts~*~
At the beginning, after Tevye says, 'Like a fiddler on the roof', the screen cuts away to a shot of the fiddler standing on the roof. This person is NOT the actor seen in the rest of the film, but a very young version of the violinist Isaac Stern. I was watching the VHS version at a friend's house when I noticed the beginning was slightly different than the version that had been taped off of TV back in the 70's. While in the TV version you are able to recognize that this person is Isaac Stern, in the VHS version it looks like the regular actor. (I believe the DVD has information on this scene added as a bonus. Don't take my word for it though.) I've also been told that in the far off shot at the end of the movie, the man holding the violin under his arm following Tevye is, once again, young Isaac Stern.
This movie is something for the Jewish community to be proud of. I hope it inspires those who have wandered to come back to the traditions we have passed down for thousands of years. I hope it also helps the non-Jewish community to understand a little bit more about our traditions and why we so strictly keep to them.
