I saw it ONCE, in a theater, about 2 decades ago. That misspelling in the title is a pun ... of sorts.

And to this day: little bits of Fantastic Planet haunt me. I clearly remember scenes like the "bird" that punched a hole in the roof of the wild Om's nest and ate some of them, or the giant machines dancing on the moon .... Reading these reviews: more of it has flooded back. Like that scene with that Om stealing the teaching headset: like Prometheus bringing fire back to the rest of us.

And so, driven by snatches of beauty (encysted in memory), that seem like a waking dream I had, so long ago, I sought it out for purchase. I was an adult when I saw it: and it still has the power to intensely call itself to mind after all these years. And, recently, that with an urgency that the divine usually reserves for itself. I MUST see it again: some lesson it has, to impart to my (much older) self, calls to me from amongst its frames.

Truly, art in motion. I look forward to seeing it anew. I'm anticipating that it will be like the first time: a dream that sweeps me along with it. I predict you'll love it - or hate it: but it doesn't lend itself to being forgotten, either way.

Namaste!
