Again, a BD with minimal special features, all of which were available on the DVD release. I promise, not ranting this time. And I won't go into the plot. Put simply, if you haven't seen this movie and are a horror fan, you've done yourself a terrible disservice.

What presentation has going for it is incredible visual effects that breathe a life of their own in this BD format. The soundtrack is 5.1 (I still wish for a day where 7.1 is the industry standard), and there are a dozen plus languages for subtitles. The packaging itself is a small data book with interesting recollections, comments by some of the cast and crew (though nothing die-hard fans might not have known prior).

This BD release isn't made to do more than primp the appearance of the film, though it does so very nicely. Despite a lack of trimmings of terror and side dishes of special features, I do advise updating from the DVD to this BD based solely on the HD presentation.

Who's ready to get creeped out again? I'll bring the snacks.
