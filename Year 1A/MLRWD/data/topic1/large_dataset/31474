I don't know how many times I've read reviews of this movie that slammed it because "the Japanese version is better."  No, it isn't.  The Japanese version "different" and different is good.  Okay, the Japanese version deals with the social stigmatism of showing off in public and ballroom dancing is one target of their uptightness.  That's a great angle to tell a story from.

In the U.S., obviously, we don't have that kind of social convention.  We have a totally different outlook on such things, but they can run quite parallel to the Japanese way of life.  In the American version, John Clark has pretty much everything he could ask for.  A beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home and much more.  And he is bored out of his skull and has no idea why.  When he finds that he loves ballroom dancing and then is found out by his wife, he doesn't have to deal with the social implications of public displays as in the Japanese version, but the embarrassment and heartache of having to admit that his "perfect life" was missing something.

Though our society doesn't condemn you for wanting to dance, or more specifically, ballroom dance, you will find out how many morons there are around you that will assume that if you are a guy and you love to dance, you must be gay.  Link Peterson was absolutely correct in keeping his passion secret for as long as he did and he was dead right on about the reaction that would occur if the people in the office found out about it.

So I give this film five stars just because, as a dance movie, it has great dancing.  As a romance, it shows what can happen when secrets are kept and how much better off our relationships would be if we didn't try so hard to hide them.  Get this movie and enjoy a good story and quit worrying so much about how Japanese society is "this" and Japanese society is "that."
