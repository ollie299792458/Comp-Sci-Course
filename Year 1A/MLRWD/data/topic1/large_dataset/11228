The 2007 DVD release of "Outland" is one of the worst transfers to DVD I've seen.

I'm not an "A/V geek" who obsesses about his home theater system, has gold plated cables, etc. The problems with this DVD are obvious to even an untrained viewer.

I watched this using a projector, screen, and Dolby 5.1 sound.

The video transfer is inconsistent. Some scenes are acceptable, others are full of obvious encoding artifacts that are distracting to the eye. Some scenes are so bad that look like a bootleg copy.

The audio is another problem. The original film was shot with Sensurround, which was a short-lived audio format designed to provide intense low frequency sounds (rumbling, explosions, etc.).

There's nothing wrong with Sensurround, but it seems that in the transfer to Dolby 5.1, the bare minimum was done. The low frequency sounds are definitely cranked up to eleven, but the rest of the audio sounds like mono. So, the transition between action scenes and regular dialog is jarring.

The 1997 release of "Blade Runner" is famous for being a bad DVD transfer. The 2007 release of "Outland" is much worse, which is astonishing.

This DVD might look/sound ok on a smaller TV with stereo sound. As far as a home theater experience, it's almost unwatchable.
