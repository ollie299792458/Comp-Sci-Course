If, like me, you were a fan of the American martial arts movies of the

80s and early 90s,this is essential viewing. Gymkata is truly a cult

show. Sure, it's easy to dismiss this as cheesy crap but that's missing

the point- the cheesiness of these films was part of the whole

attraction. The action unfolds somewhere in Eastern Europe where

champion gymnast Jonathon Cabot undergoes intense martial arts training

and is entered into the mysterious " Game", a dangerous quest where

individuals must complete a tricky journey through woodlands and

villages whilst evading attack by killer ninjas and of course, each

other! The last man standing will win The Game. Suffice it to say there

are some great scenes in this cult classic especially the part in the "

Village of Crazies" and the fight scenes are fantastic. If you like

this sort of thing, "Gymkata" comes highly recommended. It can be

difficult to obtain; i tracked down a copy on VHS- don't know if it

ever came out on DVD- but it's well worth the hunt. Superb stuff!!
