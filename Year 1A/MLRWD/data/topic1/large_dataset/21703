What was I thinking??  I bought this censored PG13 version of the movie because colleagues had recommended it for high school Spanish classes. But the protagonist is a young man in his early twenties. Censor or no censor, there would logically be scenes which included alcohol, bad language, and sex-I have no one but myself to blame! After previewing, I threw the DVD away. Although this movie had an excellent message about immigration, adapting to US culture, exploitation of immigrant athletes, and the pressure to succeed that immigrant athletes face, I am certain that my students' focus would be on shallower themes.

When Miguel "Sugar" Santos returns to his town for the weekend, he and his girlfriend are shown standing behind a couch. There is no visible nudity, but there is no doubt what they are doing by their movements and their pulling clothes back on afterwards. Santos and his friends are shown drinking on several occasions, once to the point of vomiting the next morning. Upon arrival in the US, the young players are shown exploring the minifridge and the pay-per-view channels in the hotel room. Again, we don't see the porn movie, but we hear moaning sounds coming from the TV and see the guys all gathered around watching.

I thought about editing past the two indirect sex scenes, but with so many alcohol scenes and so much strong language as well, it just wasn't worth it.
