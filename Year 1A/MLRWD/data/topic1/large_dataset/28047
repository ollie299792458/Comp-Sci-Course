The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy is unique because of the mind of it's great creator, Douglas Adams. However, he would have been disappointed at this attempt of his "baby". The plot moved along so fast that unless you had seen/read/heard an earlier version, you would have been lost. What I hated the most was the fact that Douglas' jokes (which were so clearly shown in the original movie, the books, and the radio show) were almost non-existant. Although as a modern day movie it wasn't bad, as an addition the the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy collection it was pretty awful. However, I loved the fact that they included Marvin from the original movie and that they played the original Hitchiker's theme in the beginning. I thought that the dolphin beginning was fun, but didn't have anything to do with the actual movie. I probably would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if it had stuck to the original plot more, because though the new ideas were good, they weren't Douglas' and didn't fit with his idea of the book.

  In short, this movie is definitely not for people looking for another Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If you're willing to be flexible and enjoy the movie for itself rather than the original series, it's not bad. For people looking for Douglas Adams' work, watch the BBC's TV version - it's old, but true to the original. (And the extras are fantastic.)
