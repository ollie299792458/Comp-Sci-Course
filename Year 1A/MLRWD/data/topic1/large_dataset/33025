If you are looking for a touching and turbulent portrayal of the madness of artists in love, of a tempestuous relationship between two brilliant poets that destroyed one's life and reputation, then keep looking.  If you are looking for something to replace the Rocky Horror Picture Show for a good campy laugh, this is your movie.  The entire thing was beyond ridiculous.  There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Thewlis, no hint at what would have pulled these two together in an age when the very hint of such a relationship could have been, and in fact was, the ruin of the elder Paul Verlaine (Thewlis).  The anorexic appearance of both actors (and let's face it folks, when is the cinematic world going to get it that they must never let Thewlis remove his clothes on camera?)and the scene of intimacy between them bring to mind the words brutal, abusive, sadistic and horrific.  That having been said, be prepared to move quickly from being appalled to laughing riotously at all the wrong places.  From crawling around imitating goats (yes there were real goats there too) to the frequent frontal nudity displayed by DiCaprio and Thewlis, there are giggles aplenty.  I must admit this movie has some of my all time favorite lines.  Poet 1:  "Just shoot me."  Poet 2: "I can't you stupid **** you just blew a hole in my hand."  And lest we forget... Poet 1: "My wife has not been well."  Poet 2: "Perhaps thats because you keep setting her on fire."  Poet 1:  "I'll have  you know I haven't set my wife on fire since Thursday."  Bottom line folks this one is just too painful for words.  Even the actors admitted in interviews that instead of method acting they engaged in method drinking to get through the making of this movie.  According to those interviews they were well oiled each day of filming.  So much that Thewlis admitted he doesn't remember making the movie.  Now if only we could all forget he made it.
