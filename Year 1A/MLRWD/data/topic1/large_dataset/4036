I'm not sure if it's me or not but it seems to me on the eve of the release of "Evolution" that there seems to be a resurrgence of sci-fi comedys in the vein of "Ghostbusters", I.E. "Men In Black" and the reviewed movie here "Galaxy Quest".  I had missed the theatrical release of "Galaxy Quest" with little interest in the movie.  However I am a fan of the genre and when it came out on DVD in early May of 2000 I decided I would give it a chance and was pleasently surprised.  
Shows Like Star Trek and it's numerous offsprings have created a wealth of pop culture arguably as much if not more than "Star Wars"  and Galaxy Quest takes these items and runs with them.  The actors themselves as washed up have beens squelching off of a show which not only was cancelled 20 odd years ago but whose mainstream popularity long but died.  Its rather depressing.  However more than lively as the movie picks up with a plotline that would make any Star Trek Hack writer proud as the actors are confused for their characters by aliens who the actors mistake for fanatical fans.  I make it a bit more confusing than it actually is.  The characters are more than fleshed out in the beginning of the movie and are very likeable.
The only problem I have with this movie is that some of the jokes are a bit to much of an in joke...take for istance the "red shirt", which any Star Trek fan can tell you is a character without a last name who is expendable and who usually dies within the first few minutes of the show.  I found that bit hilarious however wondering if other family audiences , which this film is geared for, would understand it.  However with that being said I do belive the film acomplishes it's goals and hopefully more films like it will follow.
