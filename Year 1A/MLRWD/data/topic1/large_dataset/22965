A motion picture following in the not-so-illustrious filmmaking footsteps of such feature-length propaganda films as "John Q" and "The Life of David Gale", "Runaway Jury" was doomed to well-deserved obscurity by its awful script before the first scene was shot.
  I went into this movie with rather high expectations.  Though I have no love for John Grisham, I am very fond of John Cusack's work.  Unfortunately, not even his solid perfomance could save this movie.
  "Runaway Jury" suffers from a complete lack of originality (even after the producers changed the legal target of this film from big tobacco to gun control; presumably to avoid having to be compared with "The Insider").  Most average moviegoers will see the predictable plot "twists" a mile away.
  The plot and most of the characters (especially Gene Hackman's) become so farfetched that this movie might as well take place on the Starship Enterprise.  Still, even with the fantastic, the movie manages to drag on... and on... and on during its considerable middle stages. I started to wonder if it would ever end.
  Mercifully it did, and came to a "climax" so predictable and so (there's no other way to say this): Hollywood, that I was left with the intense feeling that I would have been better intellectually served by watching Pokemon.
  The agenda of the producers is so painfully clear throughout the movie that the characters might as well have been wearing sandwich boards spouting anti-gun slogans.  Even supporters of gun-control will be turned off by the constant self-serving nature of this picture, and offended by the lack of subtlety in which the writers have chosen to deliver the message.  They really do think we're stupid.
  Oh, and John Cusack, homey, this is strike two after "Identity".  Maybe you can get back with Steven Frears and JB and do a sequel to "High Fidelity" for redemption.  I just hope you got paid an awful lot to do this movie and didn't sign on because you liked the script.
