The movie Red Dawn stars upcoming actors such as Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen.  The movie takes place in Colorado and starts off at the town's high school.  Russian forces construe an attack on the school and explode onto the scene with mass gunfire.  A group of guys escape (including Swayze and Sheen) and hide up in the mountains.  There they contradict ideas of survival and go through many adventures.  After being suppressed in the mountains for several months, the guys lead an attack on the Russians.  The town has been tarnished and the townspeople are lackadaisical; nothing is the same.  Red Dawn somewhat expresses the harsh realities of war, but in a lame and outdated way.  A group of high school boys fighting against an entire army to avenge the deaths of hundreds is not very realistic.  This movie earns a rating of three stars due to the poorness of the storyline and acting.  However, there were some strong points to Red Dawn, such as the behemoth of gunfights and other traits of a traditional action movie.
