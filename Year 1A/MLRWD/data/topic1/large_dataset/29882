Perhaps Americans are simply ignorant of recent history, but still, I have a hard time believing that no one writing a review of this film has mentioned that Scott Spencer and Keith Gordon based the character of "Sarah" very closely on an actual person:  Ronni Moffitt, the young political activist killed in the car-bomb assassination of Chilean Orlando Letelier in 1976.  (agents of the Pinochet regime were convicted of the murders).  Some might say the particulars of Moffitt's life shouldn't really have much to do with the success or failure of Waking the Dead as a fictional dramatic work, and in a narrow sense, that's true.  But as the nature of this movie is the struggle of the higher duty of idealism vs. the earthly satisfaction of love, the real-life activism of Moffitt is relevant because of the way it "grounds" the idealism of Sarah.  As much as conservative believers in the supremacy of the self might want to think it absurd, there really were and are people who sacrific to make things better.  And the dramatic "path" of this movie is Fielding's slow back-and-forth realization, though the thickets of his lost love, of the ultimate importance of idealistic sacrific.  This is why the movie's final scene (don't worry -- I won't give it away here), which no one else has mentioned, is so crucially important.
  On the filmmaking details I have little to add.  Crudup and Connelly, superb in so many other films, are superb here.  Gordon's flashback-and-forward technique occasionally seems artsy but functions well enough in conveying the story.  Challenging and moving.
