I'm a WW2 Superman buff. In 1938 Superman first appeared in comics. In 1940, The Adventures of Superman premiered on radio. The show was on for eleven years, ten of those years starring Bud Collyer as Superman. For the entire eleven year run, with one or two possible episode exceptions, Joan Alexander played Lois Lane.  Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill are the first people to play Superman and Lois Lane live. At the beginning of the two serials, in the credits, the producers acknowledged that the serials are based of the radio show. In the Special Features of the discs, there is a history of the Superman serial that makes no reference to the old radio show. The historians acted as if there was just the comic and ten years later, in 1948, the first serial. One of the few parts of that documentary that was accurate, relevant and in context was Noel Neill's description of how she got the role. These serials were named after two of the most popular 1945 stories from the radio show; which ARE in public domain. Neither serial follows the original story, but both serials are fun. The 1950 serial shows an improvement in the special effects and one can see a glimpse of the effects of the Superman t.v. Series of the 50s. The only complaint about the serials I had was that I felt that Tommy Bond was too old to play Jimmy Olsen, but he did a good job anyway. If you like Superman, both of these serials are worth watching.
