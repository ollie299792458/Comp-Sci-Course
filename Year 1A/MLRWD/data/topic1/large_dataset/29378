The Good - The fight with the russian, Frank Castles neighbors are straight from a comic storyline, Tom Jane does a good job portraying the Punisher charactor and it was nice to see Roy Schieder working again even though his appearance was brief.

The Bad - The origin took to long to establish the charactors motivation and get action rolling. Speaking of action, I didn't think there was enough of it (the exception being the fight with the russian.) Explosions from a remote control establish the Punisher as a thinking hero, but for me were not as visually saticfying as good ol' kung fu or an over the top gun fight. Oh yeah, he also lit a fire that forms the image of the Punisher logo.

  I went to see this in the Theatre ( I am a fan of the Punisher comic ) with a group of friends and the general concensus was that the part of the group completely unfamiliar with the charactor really liked it(chics included) and the Punisher fans didn't think it was violent enough. I thought alot of the other reviewers rated this movie way to high, but keep in mind, my review of this movie is in the minority. Personally I liked the Dolph Lundgren movie more. The first Punisher (straight to video just like Citizen Kane!) was cheesy , yet the action moved so fast you didn't have to think about the script.

  I would like to see a sequel because I did like Tom Janes focused portrayal of Frank Castle. A sequal would have the origin out of the way and could right into some good old fashioned senseless violence.
