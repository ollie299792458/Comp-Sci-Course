Well, despite a few very minor errors, this is a great action movie. It's one of those movies that at times tends to keep you at the edge of your seat waiting on "how is the main character gonna evade his pursuers this time?" (hope i didn't give away much). The movie is great in the sense that it has lots of action for all those action-junkies like myself, and yet it still makes a lot of sense. It's not just one of those shoot-em-up and run-around-for-no-reason movies. The movie is suspenseful in a sense and has a great story, plus occasional comedy relief from no other than Owen Wilson. Some do consider Owen to be completely wrong for this part but he kind of has the right chemistry for the role. Plus, him and Gene Hackman kind of connect and depict in many ways a relationship between a "captain" and his "troop". Plus the movie is directed really well that it makes this film seem so much more realistic. (that maybe also have been caused by the fact that this movie really was shot in southeastern Europe and some of the cast were actual natives of these lands, not some americans trying their hardest to impersonate people of other nations.) Overall, a fun, exciting movie for the family, and it really does deserve the full five stars.
