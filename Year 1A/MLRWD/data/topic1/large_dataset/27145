Well it embraces the jingoism of the age and is now heavily cliched but these things aside it is a terrific piece of entertainment and has been a cultural phenomenon. The jingoism and the the fact that is a popcorn move aside I just wanted give a few comments about the quality of the new Digitally remastered edition. I also have the original region 1 release and now own the region 4 remastered one.  I have to say the difference definately warranted the new purchase. I tend to watch DvD's on my computer screen which will show up poor screen transfers better than the TV will. The new release has a great picture and is cleaned up immensly. The DvD menu is terrific and the sound is a ripper which is really what you want with something like this. I am not a big fan of DvD extras as I tend to watch them once and be done with it as I buy the Dvd's for the films but the extra's disk here is definately interesting and some time as definately gone into it's presentation. All in all a fantastic effort. If you are considering a purchase then this is a top notch DvD. Just make sure you are ordering the remastered one.
