This is a wonderful movie for anyone who has or had a dream.  Kevin Costner portrays small town Iowa farmer, Ray Kinsella, who hears a voice urging him to build a baseball field.  The townspeople think that he's crazy, but he knows its his destiny. His wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) supports him fully at first. Ray Liotta is excellent as Shoeless Joe Jackson, who one day shows up at Ray's baseball field.  Shoeless Joe is joined by numerous baseball players from the past, who just want to have the chance to play baseball again. 
 Ray heads out on a journey to track down writer in seclusion, Terry Mann (James Earl Jones). After a lot of hemming an hawing, Terry joins him on his qwest.  They next encounter Dr. Archibald "Moonlight" Graham, who is brilliantly portrayed by legendary actor Burt Lancaster.  Ray, Terry, and Dr. Graham all have a common interest, though.  They all yearn for the years past, what used to be...to have that second chance to fulfill their dreams.  
 **On a side note, this was one of Burt Lancaster's last screen roles before he passed away.  It was wonderful to see this accomplished actor in such a role, as the wise older physician who gave up his dreams in order to help others. This is a must see film for anyone who has not yet realized their dreams, or maybe you have - it'll bring back memories of those times.
