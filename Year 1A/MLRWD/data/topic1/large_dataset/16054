Unlike these other reviewers, I am not a walking encyclopedia on the Ubiquitous Sherlock Holmes.  I've only seen a few Sherlock Holmes movies and don't know all three names of Sherlock's creator or (gasp) I don't know what that weird looking pipe he smokes is called.  Nevertheless, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking kept me entertained & had my attention throughout the entire movie.

The most pleasant & unexpected treat was Rupert Everett.  I'd only seen him in a few mediocre movies and was skeptical about seeing his interpretation of Holmes.  Boy was I ever wrong to pre-judge!  I had NO IDEA.  Everett gave a five-star performance and shocked and surprised me.  I loved his Holmes.  I was sold on Everett as Holmes from the early scenes.  I completely forgot about Rupert and was completely absorbed in the character of Holmes.  Now that's great acting if you have me so entranced in the movie & the character that I forget about the actor!

Therefore, don't make the same assumptions I did and snicker at this movie before you watch it.  I'm also glad I never read some of these nit-picky reviews.

Just go and enjoy the movie by getting lost in this unique and BETTER interpretation of Sherlock Holmes!
