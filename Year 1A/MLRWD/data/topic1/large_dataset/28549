Like many, I was attracted to this movie because of the cast:  Colin Firth, Minnie Driver, Mary Steenburgen, Oliver Platt. . .and to some extent, Heather Graham.  Considering this stellar cast, I expected quite a bit.  It was fun in some areas, but full of gaps elsewhere--maybe those parts weren't that important in this movie, I don't know.  About the main characters:  I thought Colin Firth handled his role as well as he could.  He actually seems like a real person in this movie--emotional, heartbroken, spontaneous, fun--very far from Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice and Mark Darcy of the Bridget Jones series.  Minnie Driver plays Vera very well as an authoritative hoity-toity, almost to the point where she may be typecast.  My experience of Heather Graham is brief.  Her Mandy is rather mysterious in some ways; but to some degree, she brings out the fun in Colin Ware.

Granted, every one of them has done better work elsewhere, and are surely doing better work in future movies.  If you need substance, then you might check them out.  Yet, if it is enough for you to simply gaze at Colin, Minnie, and/or Heather, then this movie could be slightly more bearable.
