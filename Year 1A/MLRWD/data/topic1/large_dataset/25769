I watched "Fishing for Salmon in the Yemen" while on a long plane trip. I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it twice on the trip out and then once more on my trip home. The casting of the movie was outstanding, even the smaller characters contributed nicely. Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor play their roles to perfection and have wonderful chemistry together. Ms. Blunt is one of today's best young actresses and few can match her depth in romantic comedies. Ewan McGregor is equally adept and his character's transformation is the film's centerpiece. While Blunt and McGregor carry the movie, Kristin Scott Thomas provides the funniest moments.  She is hilarious as the hard driving press secretary for the British Prime Minister. Amr Waked plays his part to the tee as the mystical Sheik, though I wish there had been a little more development of his character and more depth to his back story. My only small criticism of the film was the overly complicated "Love Quadrangle" which included a military connection that never quite connected. That small criticism aside, I fully imagine this film will be on my most watched list for years to come.
