I live in Australia and I use Amazon alot for DVDs even though the Aussie dollar is 2:1. I find it amazing that Amazon (and the US) does not yet have West Wing on DVD.  
Looking primarily at Amazon, I was more than a bit sad about that because I think the series is fantastic.  Anyway, low and behold whilst wandering through my local (store), I found the full Series 1 (2 DVD boxed sets of 3 DVDs each/all 22 episodes on DVD for ... some odd Assie dollars.  
Fantastic - I'll get them I thought while I have the chance.  Not believxing my luck, I checked out the usually reliable US Amazon site to be informed (again) that "...the studio is not releasing..." WestWing just yet.  Well go figure because it is now occupying pride of place in my DVD library.  Interestingly, Amazon UK West Wing on DVD (albeit for a hell of a lot more money than my (store) locally (even with the postage).
I have spent literally thousand of dollars on Amazon DVDs (US) and up until now thought they were unbeatable in terms of movie range. I am dissapointed.  I am holding out for Series II (and III - which has not yet been aired in Australia).  Hopefully, Amazon will get back on the ball amd make these available to  audiences (including me) shortly. ...
