"Rain" is based on a short story by W. Sommerset Maugham. A very young and lovely Joan Crawford gives a wonderful performance as a former prostitute on the lamb. You see little of the later persona she created for herself here but she was perfectly suited to the part. She meets a powerful and opinionated preacher and his prudish wife on the island of Pago Pago in the Rainy season and by means of what most of which seems much like cruelty tries to convert her to his own religious beliefs and the consequences of that belief to her personal life. Other travelers also add to the plot with their observances and opinions of the relationship between "Sadie" (the prostitute) and the Preacher. I won't tell the story and ruin it for you but there's a lot more going on in this drama. The ending is profound indeed but the real story is found in the dialog and the actions, thoughts and feelings of the characters. A true piece of classic storytelling. The role of "Sadie" was also played prior to this version by the beautiful Gloria Swanson in "Sadie Thompson" but the Joan Crawford version really holds up even now. A remake of this would be wonderful if someone would do it. I love this book and for Joan Crawford fans this movie is a must. Well worth the price. You'll want to watch it over and over and you'll notice something new each time. I recorded the audio book version of  "Rain"
