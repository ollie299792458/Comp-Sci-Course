Stylish Italian horror master Dario Argento's well regarded latter day effort, distinguished by the fine acting of his daughter, Asia Argento, in  the lead role of a cop in an Italian anti-rape unit who falls prey not only  to a vicious attack by a psychopath, but also to the title syndrome, an  affliction which causes its victims to literally lose themselves in works  of art.
The one star rating is not for the film itself, however, but for  the quality of this VHS release.
Unfortunately, this new VHS version is  not only pan and scan, but worse yet, it's in the slow speed EP mode, which  produces noticably poor picture tracking, video noise, and very poor color  reproduction.  A director as visually brilliant as Argento deserves better  treatment for his films--a high quality SP letterbox release would serve  this film better.
Incidently, this film *was* originally released in SP  mode--this is the higher priced verson listed elsewhere on Amazon as a  special order.  Neither version is letterboxed--only the DVD is--but both  VHS releases are at least uncut, and the more expensive *other* VHS version  is at least in a decent quality SP mode, unlike this one.
