Life is Beautiful personifies hope. Skeptics have bashed itsimproper portrayal of humankind's most devastating era, while mostproclaim it "the best ever." While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you must realize that they are all right.
 Bengini's film is about a family he does not want to see destroyed. After he goes to all lengths to win the heart of his princess, why would he want to lose their child?  This is why he develops the point game - to keep his son from exposing himself to the guards...  Many argue that the movie too cynically portrays the events of the Holocaust.  While that may be a valid statment, it should be coupled with the fact that the movie portrays only one isolated family's struggle in both pre-Holucast Italy and occupied Italy.  The scene I found most unexpected is near the end ...  It really made me realize that the US played a huge effort in bringing peace and an end to this destruction of human life and culture. It was here that I realized this movie was really about an international struggle for peace and happiness.  This is where I cried.  All in all, I would reccomend this movie to anyone who can stomach seeing characters suffer emotional (and sometimes physical) pain and agony...  Because your stomach will be hurting from all the laughing.  END
