Im tired of the negative reviews of this DVD. The film is still brilliant and Michael Mann through and through. The THX master of the (un?) theatrical version is excellent and surpases even the halloween one. with the changing of scenes, this film now has a different tone because Will Graham seems a bit more humane and not so distant. My opinion is that this might have been a european version, im not sure but im still happy with the cut. I think that the restored love scene helps show this as well. As someone else mentioned this film definately has a brain behind it and also the soundtrack is brilliant and rates alongside Heat's soundtrack. Why do so many people say that its got cheesy music, I mean it did come out in the 1980's and that was the type of music that was out. Ever heard the soundtrack for 'To live and die in LA'.  The second disk is very interesting to me. They should have called it the TV version because thats what it is. The quality is not so great but adequate. Some of the swear words are missing and a few of the shots of photos are also removed. There are also some different takes. This version should definately be anamorphic though. It looks like a 4:3 version thats been cropped at the top and bottom.  My overall opinion is that the set is very good and im happy with it. The film is superior to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal is not even worth mentioning. Its amazing that Ridley Scott to this day still makes dodgy films.  Ive got good news for people who are unhappy with this DVD. Theres a new region 2 version of Manhunter coming out in may being released by Momentum pictures under (directors chair). They did a brilliant job on Angel Heart and they are basically the UK version of Criterion.
