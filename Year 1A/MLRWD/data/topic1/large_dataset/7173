Many believe either Season 3 or this season to be the best of the X-Files. Watching these seasons again, I find that this is a great season of X-Files, but not especially better than future seasons (except Season 9, I like that season, but you know what I'm talking about).
However, despite most people saying this season's weakest X-Files is "El Mundo Gira" I must ask them to once again view the suckety suckfest that was "The Field Where I Died". If you judge that episode by performances, it is one of the better episodes. Yes, what great acting in the absolute dumbest idea for an episode of X-Files ever conceived. So Mulder was a Jewish woman during the holocaust and Scully was his (her?) dad. Wow. Kind of puts a weird spin on their romantic relationship towards the end of the show. Also, who would've known that we could prove that reincarnation is real by simply asking a hynotized person to describe their past lives? Gee, I wonder why revelations in this episode were never brought up again in the series.
Anyway, sarcasm towards that immensely ill-conceived episode aside, Season 4 is a must buy, with great stand-alones, great mythology episodes, and especially great character development.
