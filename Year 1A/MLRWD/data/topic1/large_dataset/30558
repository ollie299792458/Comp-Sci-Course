This movie begins with Ana (America Ferrera), a high school senior who is about to
graduate. All of her classmates are going to college and her teacher (George Lopez)
strongly encourages Ana to attend college also. However, her family has set
different goals for Ana's life. Her mother, Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) feels that a
woman's role in life is to be beautiful (Carmen often criticizes Ana about her
weight), work hard, have children and take care of her husband. This is what Carmen
has done in here life and she expects Ana to do the same.
So Ana faces a dilemma many young women face: will she follow her desire to go to
college and a presumably bright future or will she stay home and help support her
family? 
I liked this movie for a couple of reasons: First of all, it was "real". It deals
with real issues that real people face (the decision of going to college, problems
with weight, conflicts with parents). Secondly, this film shows critiques
stereotypes about women. In my opinion, Carmen represents the stereotypical of what
a women should do in life (stay at home, raise the family, take care of the kids).
Ana represents what women have become: strong, educated, and independent. Also, the
film represents intersections of race, social &amp; economic class, and gender.
Throughout the movie, we see a Latino family struggling to get above the
stereotypes. In the movie, we even see Ana and her sister Estella looked down upon
by another Hispanic-American woman, due to social class.
