This movie chronicles the efforts of William Wilberforce to end the slave trade within the British Empire.  Emotionally stirring with stunning cinematography--the viewer is so caught up in the decades long struggle that the outcome almost seems in doubt.  The supporting cast is superb.  Albert Finney as John Newton--reformed slaver and penitent clergyman (the author of the hymn from which the movie derives its name).  Michael Gambon as Charles James Fox--the consummate British politician.  Toby Jones as the Duke of Clarence--who in life was able to crank out 10 illegitimate children but when he ascended to the throne in 1830 as William IV left no legitimate heirs forfeiting the crown to his niece Victoria. Benedict Cumberbatch as the over-zealous William Pitt the Younger (prime minister at 24).  The chief antagonist of Wilberforce in the House of Commons is the nefarious Banastre Tarleton (deftly portrayed by Ciaran Hinds).  Tarleton was the least popular officer in the British Army during the American Revolutionary War.  He was, no doubt, the inspiration for the fictional Colonel Tavington in Mel Gibson's "The Patriot".  Like Tavington, Tarleton commanded the British light cavalry at the Battle of Cowpens--but unlike his doppelganger, Tarleton survived the battle (only because Mel Gibson wasn't present to dispatch him) and after the war was elected to Parliament from Liverpool.
The movie not only chronicles the fight against slavery, but also gives the viewer a feel for the political environment in Britain from 1780 to roughly 1806--the disharmony following the American Revolution, the hysteria over the French Revolution, etc.
