"American Beauty" was excellent, but "Magnolia" was the Best Movie of the year.  With its complex story, Incredible acting, and awesome filmwork and direction, Paul Thomas Anderson PROVES that he is the  next Great film director.  Though the point of the movie is a little  unclear at the end (the theme is supposed to be about coincidences, but  that's not really how it seems to end), The movie is breathtaking and  amazing, as it weaves through the lives of very different people in the San  Fernando Valley.  After watching the movie again, I could not believe the  Academy gave Michael Caine the best supporting actor award, for a  perfromance that wasn't that great, overlooking the best performance of Tom  Cruise's carreer.  Julianne Moore was also amazing, with Philip Seymore  Hoffman, Jeremey Blackman, Phillip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, and Melora  Walters doing superb as well.  The other thing I also appreciate, is the  fact that the movie is 3 hours and 8 minutes long, but it doesn't seem to  be that way.  Though many would complain about the length, this is a movie  that is exciting through every single minute, and if a minute is lost,  that's how lost the movie would be at the end.  Though I don't agree with  the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson hates editing his films, this one  doesn't need to be shorter.  "The Green Mile" was long at the  same running time, but "Magnolia" is not.  The themes are really  deep, but that's why the movie is amazing.  They are deep, yet they're not,  because they are so real.  And through the twists of fate, the characters  all end up accomplaishing there goals or something, by the end.  "Magnolia" is one for your collection.
