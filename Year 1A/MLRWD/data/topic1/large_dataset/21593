This film is practically flawless within the confines of the film.  What I mean by that is In the film, you can believe everything that is happening.

This is one of those films (like LENNY and KUNDUN) where I'll double dip if a special edition came out.  The Criterion Collection just announced a release in August 2007 [...]

HOWEVER, for those of you who have seen the film...

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

Mamet plays with the notion that you never really know who anybody is.  Is he a small town gambler or a pawn in a game?  Which brings me to the poker game.  The poker game has, what, 5 or six players (I'm doing this by memory): Mike, Joey, George, and two or three other players.

Now, even though they leave after the "game" (as in poker) ends, are they part of the con?  What about the bartender?  You could even go as far as asking if anyone from that world isn't in on it.  And then you can ask, well what about Dr. Ford's friend, Dr. Littauer?

Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
