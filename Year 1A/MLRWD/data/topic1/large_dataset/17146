I own the digibook versions of the first two seasons of this show, and it makes me very disappointed that Lucasfilm has decided to release Season 3 only as a regular-case Blu-ray. Since they are not going to release this season with a digibook, I just sucked it up and bought it anyway. The reason I took off only one star for this and not two is because it's a perfectly fine set compared to any other show out there, and it does come with a nice enough slip cover, but it's hard not to be disappointed after being spoiled by the previous two digibook cases, so it still loses one star.

 Once I got over the fact that the case is about 20% less cool than the other season sets that I own, it's overall a very good release. The episodes in this season are a little confusing since they are in broadcast order instead of chronological order, and some of these episodes actually take place during Season 2! Even though the fanboys haven't yet figured out the correct viewing order for this season, the story arcs here are at least good, and there are some great cameos this season that the fans will love. Some famed characters from the movies make their animation debut, and even the titular heroes from the video game "Republic Commando" get an appearance. The transfer quality is top-notch as always, and if you've been collecting the show on Blu-Ray this is obviously a must buy.
