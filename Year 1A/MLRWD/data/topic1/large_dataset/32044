This is most definitely one of the best movies ever made.  To start, the cast was EXCELLENT. Perfect, every role was perfectly aligned to fit the actor... Gena Davis.. Rosie.. Madonna was fabulous... Tom... I mean the entire cast really did a great job. And the plot was excellent... during a time when all the men were off to war and it was up to the women to keep baseball alive these women came together and truly wowed everyone who looked in their direction.  It was quite empowering actually, it made you feel good to be a woman... it made you happy for these characters and it's easy to forget that its JUST a movie!  The beautiful thing about (some) movies is that they step outside the box and remind you of why we LOVE fiction so much, because it's so much like reality!  These actors/actresses really brougt Life into this script, these characters... I have to say that these are some of the best performances on screen... and it's not because there was some big bang or mega climax... it's almost the small things, the quality, the heart you see in each of these women... and the doubt you see in the men who don't believe they have a chance in hell... the realness of it... this film has Heart. That's what made a special place in our hearts for this film, the heart of the film itself, and that's what keeps it there.
