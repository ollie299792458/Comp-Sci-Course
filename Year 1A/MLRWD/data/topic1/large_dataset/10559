to my personal taste, mummy 1 was marvelous and mummy 2 was awesome. not only because of their scripts and the stories, but also due to the colors added to the characters by the actors and actresses. beautiful, cute, naive, yet determined Rachel Weisz, humorous and funny but a hardcore adventurer Brendan Fraser and a bit gutless but good-hearted John Hannah. these people were the main taste of the two movies of the series. now, the personality of Rachel Weisz, thus the color that she added to the movie was removed and a totally new and opposite, colorless, cold and hollow character was embedded for the same role, leading the result to a missing leg of the trivet, and a sour taste in the mouth.

the script is another disaster:
- for no reason, Jonathan runs a night club in China, which has almost no effect on the progress of the events.

- the story is totally monotonous, boring, perfunctory, a bit copycat smelling and includes no creativity or lacks new ideas that previous series did (like the rocket-boosted balloon-ship in Mummy 1 or a reincarnated lover who tries to resurrect her partner in Mummy 2).

- i also, did not understand why the evil general, who has the intention of serving the emperor to seize the whole world, has an "army" of a size less than a squadron, formed by less trained, dumb looking soldiers, living in tents settled in the middle of nowhere, with only armament of two motorcycles, one 4x4 vehicle and one AA-gun (because only this much equipment is needed in the coming scenes).

- the scene that rick and alex has a conversation to show off their knowledge on weapons, as a father - son conflict thing, is a complete rubbish, timeless and unnecessary. how can anyone imagine two characters wasting their time for such a conversation while they have to form a line of defense against the approaching enemy?

- the idea of destroying the tower holding the seat of the diamond which will pinpoint the hidden gates with explosives is a complete nonsense, because they do not need to destroy the whole tower, but only the seat. they can achieve this goal easily by firing some rounds at the seat itself.

i am not even commenting on the cheap ideas of Chinese soldier's uniforms inspired by German uniforms of WWII, or Hitler looking face of the terracota, yet alive emperor, just before he restores his broken shape.

my conclusion: this movie does not worth the money, it is not a part of Mummy series but it is a total killer of the reputation of the series itself. i cannot imagine a Mummy 4 after this failure.
