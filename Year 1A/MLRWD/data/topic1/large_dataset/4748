It was late night in the summer of 2003. Adult Swim was the start of it and one of the shows they aired was something that made me laugh so hard. There are only a few shows out there that truly made me laugh so much that I knew that show will be my favorite, maybe even forever. FLCL is one of those shows. When I learned there were DVDs out for U.S., I wanted to get them but then later found out that the price was too high and didn't want to get them with such a price. The fact that there were only 6 episodes in this anime series, I didn't think I should get it. Then a few years gone by and the dvds were becoming rare and the price got higher and higher when I thought it would become cheap in the future. I was totally wrong. The year is 2011 and still watch Adult Swim. Suddenly, I saw a commercial about FLCL and I thought it was just another advertising that Adult Swim would air the show again but it wasn't. It was a commercial telling me that FLCL is going to be on blu-ray and on DVD. I couldn't believe it and the feeling of interest of buying FLCL, once again came back to me. This time, I know that I need to get it this time for sure. Not knowing the aspect ratio of the blu-ray version, I didn't care much at all. All I know is that I finally have myself a copy of FLCL because it's one of the classic anime series that I truly like and was one of the anime series that has been in my list of must-have animes for a long time. First anime blu-ray to own as well. I'm happy about finally owning this anime and finally it's on blu-ray as well.
