Fiddler on the Roof is a cinematic masterpiece.  Originally a musical, this movie is an amazing adaptation that remains faithful to the original, while at the same time not making it seem "theatrical" to the point where it looks contrived.  The characters are played perfectly with Topol (who plays Tevye, the poor village milkman) taking the highest honors.
Fiddler on the Roof is simply a timeless story, even if it finds itself placed in czarist Russia. The story revolves around Tevye, a poor Jew living in Russia and his struggle to stay true to his faith (and ideals) in a world that is rapidly changing.  This film follows Tevye in his journey to meld his rich Jewish past with the modern world that surrounds him. His arguments with himself ("On the other hand,...") are priceless and allow us to relate with Tevye as he struggles with his heritage (the pogroms), his financial status ("If I Were a Rich Man") and his family (his daughters are entering marrying age).
Ths music is wonderful.  The songs are poignant and easily remembered.  I guarantee that you'll wind up singing/humming "Tradition" or "If I Were a Rich Man" days after watching the movie. The movie itself is humourous at times, and sorrowful the next and the storyline is deep, but is not a damning social commentary.  The cinematics are also extraordinary, with the film being shot "on location" in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
This is an ideal family movie, and I can remember watching (and loving) this movie at an early age.  I'm glad I purchased this movie for my DVD collection, as it will become one of my most watched (and sung to) films.  The box comes with only a single DVD, but is double-sided and contains additional footage, an additional song (cut at production) and a commentary on the movie itself.
