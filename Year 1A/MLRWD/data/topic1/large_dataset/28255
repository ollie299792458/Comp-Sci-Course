Ghost in the shell is unquestionably the best anime film i have seen to date.  The animation is brilliant, detailed and well crafted to lend the perfect futuristic feeling to the film. Montage scenes of the city lend to  the feeling of the film.  sound quality is also excellent, with  beautiful 5.1 channel dolby digital sound for the english tracks. if you  prefer subtitles, the japanese track is only 2 channel PCM, and looses  depth, but it is still very good.  finally, the film and it's message  come through clearly without dilluting the fun for someone who just wants  to watch an action packed film, while remaining something to think about in  an ever computerized world for those who choose to.  the only strange  part is motoko's constant nudity. although it isn't gratuitous, and is  necessary for some plot elements, it's still a little strange for an  american to see.  the only downer on the film is the limited character  development that takes place. i only really identified with motoko, not  with anyone else, and only then partially becuase of her aloof nature.  overall, this is a superb film for anime fans and film enthusiasts in  general. a must see.
