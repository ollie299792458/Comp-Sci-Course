There is a certain nuance which lurks underneath the reels of every Stanley Kubrick film, a revelation about the human condition that is haunting yet ultimately cannot be refuted.  The two faces of humanity - the  "awake face" and the "dream face" - are what surfaces  from the film and into the viewer's mind in Stanley Kubrick's final film.  Yet this film is also a journey of the conscience, a journey along the  lines of James Joyce or Fyodor Dostoyevsky in which the principal character  (in this film's case, Dr. Bill Harford, played with splendid reserve by Tom  Cruise) searches through the bowels of the world towards some truth that is  reached in any number of forms (the last line of the film is surely the  most clear cut example of this kind of revelation).  A plot summary  for this film would be useless.  Eyes Wide Shut is a film that must be  experienced, a film which, like a great work of art, must be savored and  mulled over for a good two or three viewings.  Generally, the story follows  the journey of a jealous doctor who, upon hearing his wife's revelation of  a fantasized affair, descends into the seedy, smokey, sexual underworld of  New York City where he meets a variety of characters, some as aids, others  tempters, all damned in one way or another.  The cinematography in this  film is lush and fluid, melding well with Kubrick's amazing usage of color  and setting.  The streets of New York (all a film set) are unbelievably  realistic, with crumbling shops and sidewalks hinting at the corruption  which lurks underneath the "waking world".  There should be no  confusion in the title of this film; "Eyes wide shut" seems to  signifiy a walking dream state and this film, though long but not  unbearably long, is exactly that: a dream state through which the viewer  must journey.  And with Stanley Kubrick as the tour guide, the trip is well  worth it.
