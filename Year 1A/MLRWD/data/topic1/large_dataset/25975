Eleven years after its release, I finally watched Chocolat. I laughed, I cried, and I cringed a little bit.

The premise is as human as it can be - how do people go about integrating someone different into their midst? Not so well, as it turns out. Juliet Binoche who plays the complex Vivanne is beyond stellar in her performance. Judi Dench - well, she's Judi Dench! Fabulous. Alfred Molina does a fantastic job at playing the highly unlikeable Comte and Mayor of the village, eventually showing his vulnerable side, and then finally giving in to it, becoming very likeable in the end. Lena Olin (playing Josephine) undergoes a similarly dramatic transformation under the loving acceptance (and chocolate) of Vivianne. Vivanne herself reveals more of her shadow self as the story unfolds, thus keeping her character interesting.

Of course I had heard about the uncannily steamy romance between Roux (Johnny Depp) and Vivianne (Juliette Binoche) and was anxiously awaiting this delicious morsel. Ah - however... Johnny Depp's character lacked the interesting intricacies of the other roles. But more importantly, his acting was tepid and his assumed accent was an abomination. It vacillated from Spanish-esque, French-esque, to Irish brogue, and sort of settled in the Irish range for the duration of the movie. Really? No language coaches? As the male romantic lead, he paled against Juliette Binoche.

Nonetheless, overall an entertaining and darling movie. Made me want to run out and get some really good chocolate.
