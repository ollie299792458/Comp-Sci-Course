Familiar story: a film that isn't as good as the book, in this case one by Michael Connelly (of the same title) and which I read a couple of years ago. I already knew that Connelly was far from happy that the lead role of retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb was played by Clint Eastwood, because he made that quite clear in the sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XE74N4">A Darkness More Than Night</a>, when McCaleb made some grumbling comments about it! It was rather odd - as if Connelly was doing a review of this film in his own later novel, and giving it a one-star thumbs down! That's arrogance for you...

The thing is, I agree with Connelly. His book was excellent and although Eastwood is obviously a Hollywood A-lister, he's the best part of 30 years older than the character in the book, which is a bit daft. But as he produced and directed this film, as he often does, he took the lead as well, a mistake in my view because he is so well-known that his tough-guy image was a distraction from the vulnerability of heart-transplant patient McCaleb. Of course most people seeing this film will not have read the book, so for them I would say that this is just a by-the-numbers thriller that felt as if it should have been a one-hour-long TV drama rather than a fully-fledged cinema release. If you're an Eastwood fan it will be a disappointment, and even more so if (like me) you're a fan of both the writer and leading man too. Very forgettable, but not actually bad, to be fair. I believe the book deserved something much better, with root-and-branch change of producer, writer, director and actors. It was worth being made into a film, but the people responsible have made rather a hash of it.
