The most recent release from Alex & Stephen Kendrick (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECADK">Flywheel</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KLQUS0">Facing the Giants</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KEHAFI">Fireproof</a>), "Courageous" recounts a group Sheriff's Deputies and their struggle in not only their day-to-day work lives, but also their relationships at home.  Convicted that he isn't living the life of the godly man that he should be, Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick) decides to draft what is essentially a Biblical code of conduct for his life.  He then enlists his three co-workers (and his handyman) to join in this faith commitment and better their lives together.  We then follow the quintet as they struggle through man-made trials (some of their own making) to be all that God had intended for them.

The story is heart-warming and family-friendly as they come.  The movie also lays down the gauntlet to men in a similar manner as "Fireproof" challenges married couples - are you going to continue in your secularized, fence-sitting, mediocre lives where we goto church once a week and "play Christian" or are you going to make the commitment to devote them to God?  A must-have for all Christian families!!!
