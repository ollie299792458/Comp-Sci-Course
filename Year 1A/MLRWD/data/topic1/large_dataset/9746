This film gave us such a tiny piece of Tolstoy's great life and work, and that piece at the very end of his life when he was physically and mentally spent -- what was the point?  What did we learn about him except that his marriage was not happy toward the end?

Even the things we do learn are suspect.  Did his wife really have a huge part in the creation of his novels or did she just make a few suggestions about what a woman might say? Were we to believe that Tolstoy was a hypocrite because he was affectionate with his aged wife and was a hearty eater?  The film also wants us to see the young secretary as a bit of a hypocrite and this seems based on the fact that he had an affair with the character Masha.  If a young man had entered the bed of a professed celibate and forced his attentions on her we would probably not be as sympathetic toward him as we are asked to be to Misha.  I found her extremely unlikeable.

Tolstoy is one of the greatest novelists and thinkers of all time and I feel that this movie trivializes him and his ideas. Even the repeated statement that he "abandoned his wife," seems overblown.  With his health failing, after collapsing under the strain of her hysterical scenes, he tells her that if she can't stop he will have to go where he can find peace and so he finally does. I wouldn't call that abandonment as much as a case of his wife forcing him to leave their home for his own health's sake. She was hardly left to fend for herself in a castle full of servants.
