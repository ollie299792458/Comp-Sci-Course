This top- notched cast does so wonderful you don't even know their acting. They get so much into their characters it looks like they were all having so much fun in this mockumentary brought to you by Christopher Guest.  
Corky St. Clare (Guest) is trying to get a cast together for his play  "Red, White and Blaine". The story of the 150 year old town named  Blaine, Missouri. St. Clare gets his cast together a dentist (Eugene Levy)  a travel agency couple (Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara) who have only been  out of Blaine once because of an "opperation", a white-trash  Dairy Queen worker (Parker Posey), and a trashy old man (Lewis Arquette).  Well, they are horrible. They are the worst actors you can ever imagine.  But Corky thinks they are amazing. Corky calls up a New York reviewer, Mort  Guffman, to come to the Missouri town to watch this bumbling cast. Hence,  the name "Waiting for Guffman."
The cast, as a said before, is  just amazing. The whole movie makes you just smile and feel good. Also  stars Bob Balaban, Matt Keeslar, and Brian Doyle-Murray. Also just some  pointless trivia here, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer  wrote the lyrics and music to this film. And Guest and Eugene Levy wrote  it. Oh, and of course Guest directed. GREAT film. This is one you CAN'T  miss out on. Especially if you, yourself, are an actor. You'll really  appreciate it.
