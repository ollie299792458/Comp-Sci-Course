Great casting first off. Since when was He-Man a friggin' Arian who could barely speak the English language? Masters of the Universe was a homoerotic, terrible attempt at bringing yet another cartoon character to life. The plot was something that I could have come up with when I was the age where my bowel movements weren't solidified because I was still eating Gerber's. Gwildor, comedic relief? The movie would have been a lot more entertaining if Teela brutally massacred and ate Gwildor or Man-at-Arms sexually molested Gwildor's alien, midget body. Now let's move on to Frank Langella as Skeletor. Remember the Commercials: "and Frank Langella IS Seletor." #1 Who in the hell is Frank Langella? #2 If I put a plastic bag over my head-cut holes in the eyes and put in fake dracula teeth-my Skeletor would have been more terrifying. Courtney Cox on the otherhand is worth talking about. If I sneezed into a bowl and then took a pen cap and picked a healthy ball of ear wax from my ear, whip it up into a blend and inject it into my pupil-that would provide me with more enjoyment. On the otherhand-Evil Lynn. Her performance was amazing! I have never been more moved or enthralled by a performance such as hers. Upon viewing the movie for the 30th time my wife was giving birth to our first child. She called me afterwards from the recovery room and I yelled at her for disturbing me during my viewing and told her I would call her back after MOTU was over. You know what happens next- my wife She-Ra and I named our first son - Evil Lynn. Great DVD!
