The film is excellent, and I am giving it five stars.

However, I have been informed in an e-mail newsletter:

"Please note - Peter still gets money from Last Unicorn movie sales ONLY through Conlan Press. That goes for this new Blu-ray edition, too. If you buy it anywhere else Peter gets nothing at all. Which really sucks when you consider that 1.8 million Last Unicorn DVDs have been sold in America since 2004, and only around 6,000 of those went through Conlan Press. None of the other copies earned a cent for Peter. So please encourage everyone you know to support him by buying the combo pack through Conlan Press, and nowhere else. Thanks!"

I don't know if this is also true of Amazon sales, but either way Amazon should address the issue directly and clarify this.  I am not comfortable putting something like this in an Amazon review - essentially a plug for another supplier - but I think it is important information.

EDITED AND UPDATED (2012):

Peter Beagle has come to an agreement on rights that is very satisfactory to all parties.  He is now in full ownership of the rights to this movie and gets properly paid for sales.  Disregard the above!
