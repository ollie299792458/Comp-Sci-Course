I bought this after getting it from the library. I liked it that much. And, no, I am not one of those huge David Tennant fans who are accused of liking this version just because it's starring  him. I have seen him in several of his Dr. Who episodes and in Harry Potter, but did not immediately recognize him when I borrowed the film. It was one of those cases of, "I know that I've seen this guy before! Where was it?" Patrick Stewart was the name that drew me, but I would have watched it in any case.

  The sets are plain and have a somewhat silent feel, as befits an adaptation that is supposed to have the feel of the play. It is also very dark in palate, an apt reflection of the characters and the atmosphere. The mirrors, as in the Branagh version, are a nice metaphorical touch.

  Patrick Stewart plays a very human and pitiable king, John Woodvine was superb as the player king, and the rest of the cast very good. But of course Tennant steals the show. Appropriate, as Hamlet and his plots, craziness, posing and ruminating is the centerpiece of the story. No one I have ever seen has played crazy as well as Tennant! His caustic, quirky performance of the `acting crazy' parts was the best and most believable I've seen yet. His serious Hamlet is also very good.

Highly recommended.
