When i watched this, i have realized how the media in u.s. sings the same tune as required by their majority shareholders - demonizing anyone/anything/any country which does not do what american corporations want.

I already had had known for some time that news media in america was tightly under leash, but i did not know that it was at this mind boggling level - even in soviet bloc you could find different commentaries and perspectives in television. Compared to even soviet tv, the harmony and obedience in u.s. media in chanting whatever tune their leashholders want, is above and beyond. You dont even find that kind of perfect obedience in military.

Anyway, i watched this, and has taken a real account of the events that transpired in south america. I known that chavez was liked by venezuelan people, but the events that happened during the coup against him and how he returned, is without equal in political history.

I was also very disturbed by the fact that the coup was not only supported and organized by u.s., but also similar tactics that were used in a lot of other cases were used to fool the public - like how the 'democratic opposition's men shot at crowds from rooftops, killing people, and then blaming them on chavez supporters. Mind boggling, despicable **** of inhumanity. No surprise that this comes from a country which has founded the organization 'gladio'. (you can learn what gladio is by googling word 'gladio' and then 'operation northwood'.

Anyway. i watched this because a friend made me. i wasnt normally going to watch it. but i was wrong. it was quite a good watch and informative and useful. and, inspiring.
