I've been saddened by the inaudible, grunting Batman in the recent movies. You'd need subtitles to follow along with what those guys are saying, and even then it needs interpreting. Batman: Under the Red Hood I rented on a whim, now I have every intention to own it.

The action is fantastic, some of the wildest pursuits and face crunching fights in Batman history. Aside from that it's very well drawn, great visuals on everything from the explosions to the background objects you'd probably not notice at first glance. The story is phenomenal from the start, beginning with a scene that is grueling and following up with loads of surprises with only a few expected occurrences. How it ends is probably the most exciting finish I've seen to date, with hatred and a plethora of other emotions fighting for dominance. On top of that, a certain someone who adds his signature wit throughout the movie brings moments where it's genuinely funny.

The choice of enemies in this one was the most impressive. Not to give too much away but seeing Black Mask play a major role was great. Ra's al Ghul plays an even bigger role, both characters that are rarely given the face time they deserve in Batman flicks. I don't want to reveal any details about the story itself but Red is the real deal. He proves throughout the movie he can go toe to toe with the Bat and hold up better than even the most seasoned villains (again, the pursuits are what really blow me away about this movie, he is not easily shadowed).

Renting this movie is a poor decision. You can buy it with confidence, you won't be disappointed. And if you are one of the handful who don't enjoy this movie, then riddle me this, what Batman have you been watching all these years? Because this is easily the best in years.
