This is a perfect release for someone like me--I saw the films in my teens and never paid the slightest bit of attention to them thereafter. I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals. The theatrical release on the bonus disc doesn't look too bad--especially at night in a dark room. I have a 26 -inch LCD: it looks fine if I leave it with bars on all four sides, and loses something when I zoom in.

I really enjoyed the commentary on the 2004 SE disc. Carrie had the most interesting things to say, and I was amazed at how much thought and effort the sound guy and the other one put into their work. Lucas was o.k.

Bottom line: If you bought the SE in 2004 and only want the theatrical if it looks great--don't buy this. Perhaps everything in the commentaries is well-known, too, to the real fans.

But if this is the first and last Star Wars purchase that you intend to make--then go for it. I loved seeing the orginal film (and sorry George, but I don't think it would have been half as good without the John Williams score), and I enjoyed the commentaries quite a bit.

One interesting bit of trivia--I think that other than Leia's, the only lines spoken by women in all three films are those of Aunt Beru in the first and a female diplomat of some sort in this one.  The commentaries continue the trend:  men spend lots of time on "we couldn't do what we wanted" to justify the changes and take up most of the time, while Carrie's interesting stories about the actual shooting of the film get the short shrift.  I didn't notice it so much on the first two--but she's given progressively less to do as time goes on in terms of commentary.  What a shame--she's pretty interesting.
