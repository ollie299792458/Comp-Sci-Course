I was fifteen years old and on the eve of starting my first high school football game. I couldn't sleep from nervousness.  So I went into the living room and flipped the television on.  I then saw the movie of my  life; the one film that would for the next 35 years (and beyond)haunt and  thrill me upon each and every viewing.
Jimmy Stewart was the best actor  ever to live.  And Kim Novack was and is a stunning beauty.  Neither had  been as good as they were together in this magnificent film, which I have  seen over and over.  
When I received a copy of the remastered,  widescreen version as a gift several years ago, I thought I was in movie  heaven. That is saying something from a person who aspires to become a  late-in-life movie critic, and who owns over 200 movies on video  tape.
One finds it difficult to limit a review of such a masterpiece as  "Vertigo" to 1000 words.  Mr. Hitchcock is at his all time best  with the work he did on this movie.  He went as far as to redefine  suspense.  He had the script changed from the original novel on which it  was based to add to that suspense.  
In the novel, the reader shares the  ignorance of Scottie by not knowing that Judy is in reality the Madeleine  that he knew. By making the viewer aware of that fact heightens the  viewer's level of suspense as, with each change that Scottie makes to Judy,  we wonder if, and when he will find out.  Then, we wonder what he will do  if he does.
The color, the story, the directing, the haunting music, all  make this the best movie ever made.
