Better than average movie with adventure and the usual theme of believe-in-the-magic-of-Christmas. The adventure does have scary moments.

This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times. It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.

One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.

If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.

One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude. As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc. I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance. I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining. But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.
