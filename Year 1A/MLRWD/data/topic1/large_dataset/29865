As a long time lover and collector of anime, I always try to get the best bang for my buck but also get the very best of the best even if it seems a little bit frivolous. This boxset is the perfect example of that.

Both movies "The End of Evangelion" and "Death & Rebirth" were released by MANGA entertainment (MANGA was able to swipe the rights from ADV for these)

This boxset includes Both movies, a mouse pad, and what looks like a small poster (Since my copy was used and under $60, I didn't receive the latter 2, so make sure if you want these you either buy it new OR ask the dealer selling used if the set they are selling has these included)

The 2 reasons I gave this set 5 stars are
1. It contains "The End of Evangelion" which is arguably the best anime film ever made
2. The box itself looks awesome, shiny, and is harder to find then both movies combined

My only gripes about both movies are that they were dubbed by MANGA and not ADV, While all of the main cast return, Toji Suzuhara,Fuyutsuki, Maya, and most notably Makoto Hyuga (Who goes from Matt Greenfield to essentially Shaquille o' Neal (Not really Shaq but thats the best way to describe it)these characters do not and it is an annoyance.

All in all, I recommend this set to anyone, whether your just looking for "End of Evangelion" or a hardcore Eva collector looking for the best (because used copy's of both movies are only like 5 dollars cheaper then the full set, so you might as well get this one).
