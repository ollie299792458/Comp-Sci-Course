Um! I want to get out of here spoken by actor Tom Skerrit who
plays Captain Dallas was ONE of the best scenes in HORROR film
history. You can really feel for Tom Skerrit for he is scared
and has every right to be. When you have a slender 9 1/2 ft.
tall alien after you....YOU BEST BE SCARED!  Alien is ONE of the
greatest HORROR (did I type HORROR? But this is SCI/FI...IS IT???)
films to be made. It really is a HALLOWEEN in space. The spaceship
is the MYERS house the crew are the teenagers and the big bad alien
Mike himself. I really loved how Director Ridley Scott built the
tension in this movie and gave us great character development as
well as SCARES.  This is one of the first TERROR movies to not show
the survivor girl not to be a whiney wimp.  If action is what you
crave than recommend ALIENS(HUH! Did Clint suggest a sequel??? Hey
Aliens is good for a ACTION movie)but if you like slow building
heart pounding TERROR! Than Alien is for you my friend. I will
def. give this a FRIGHTFUL watch this Oct.
