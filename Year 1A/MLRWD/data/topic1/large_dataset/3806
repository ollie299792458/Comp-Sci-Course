I'm a big fan of Blade 1 & 2....what happened in 3?!

The story line seemed sound enough and the characters were good. Except Ryan...I can't seem to picture him as anything but Van Wilder. His character was exceedingly annoying...it actually took away in many parts of the movie. Playing the tough smart butt...then turning sissy when Drake stabs him.

Blade seemed to have lost his privates before this movie. I loved the tough and arrogant-but-silent character he played in the first two movies. In this one, the only tough person seemed to be Abigal.

He loves his car...it gets trashed and he's not upset?

Whistler gets killed and he didn't put up much of a fight.

Maybe this movie should have been rewritten to make it a prequel to Blade 1.

They introduced many new fresh ideas to the movie. I thought the "Blood Farm" was very unique. The idea of making Vamp animals was cool. The new weapons were great...especially Blade's knife wire. The car chase was new for a Blade movie.

The music....ummmm... When did Blade become a movie about (no disrespect) being in the hood and gangsta rap?? The music was as slow as the action. Two or three of the songs were good. The angry-rapper music genre has overstayed it's welcome. It went out shortly after NWA's Compton.

I thought Jessica Biel had great potential for this movie. Her last fight started with a Neo move....then she threw a book at the baddie. A book!!!

Wesley was a little underpar for an action flick.

Ryan Reynolds was just annoying.

Parker was pretty cool for her part.

Dominic needed to be more threatening and less of a horror-movie-wannabe.

There are a lot of consistency flaws in this movie. It almost felt as if it was written in a rush or by people who love to be control freaks.

I could go on....but what's the point? I'm glad I only paid $9.00 for this movie.
