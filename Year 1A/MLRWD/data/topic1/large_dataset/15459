I took my little brother to Super Troopers in the theater in the perfect state of mind - low expectations - which I highly recommend.  I died laughing!  Then I went again with a buddy and I died laughing again.  I ended up seeing it again with him and his wife along with another couple and now it filters through random conversations we have.  Lines like "I can't pull over any further...I'm already pulled over", "It smells like sex in here", "that little guy... I wouldn't worry about that little guy" and "I want a liter of cola" - totally crack us up.  I bought the DVD the first day it came out (I only own one other DVD so this isn't a normal thing for me) and I've watched it again 3 times including last night, it's become one of those movies for me where I look forward to each scene and start laughing just thinking about it.
I'll have to say that I know a couple of people who saw Super Troopers and didn't like it. But I think it's more that they wouldn't like any movie in this "genre".  So in my perspective - if you like Office Space, Caddyshack, Airplane, you'll be down with Super Troopers.
