My family loves musicals. I have seen several, but I have yet to see this one on broadway. My grandmother is probably the reason for that, or my mother. One of them did not find the broadway show too good or interesting. So when I went to see this movie, I was a little iffy.

Right away in the movie you are thrown into "SEASONS OF LOVE," which was the class above mine's graduation song and then "RENT" the song. I was hooked from then on. I think Tracie Thoms has the most amazing voice and adding Rosario Dawson was a smart move. I have seen the two from the original cast and they were great, but it is probably because I have seen the movie that I prefer Tracie and Rosario.

I am glad they redid the music soundtrack into more modern music than leaving it as 80s. It may sound clich&eacute; but I do believe it reaches my generation better. Some people I know complain about it being too long of a movie in itself, but they love  the music by itself.

The 2-Disc is amazing. If you own it, watch Rent with the commentary on; it is hilarious. Watch the short movie about Johnathan Larson- it will make you teary eyed. Watch all the deleted scenes- my favorite song is in one of them. No matter how depressing the movie is, and believe me I know it is, it is still amazing.
