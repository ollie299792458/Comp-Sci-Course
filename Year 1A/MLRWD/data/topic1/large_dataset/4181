Who thought a 60s B-film by Roger Corman could be adapted into a successful Broadway musical? And who would have guessed that the said musical would be filmed to make a true `80s cult classic?
Surprisingly, almost everything about this film works. The plant himself looks pretty cool and his movements are realistic. He has several funny one-liners throughout the film, not to mention some memorable singing parts. His rough voice (which is oddly reminiscent of a black soul singer) was provided by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.
Whoever did the casting for this film was a true genius-Rick Moranis was born to play the nerdy florist Seymour, and Ellen Greene's lisp and high-pitched voice make her perfect for his romantic interest, Audrey. This film also features Steve Martin as a sadistic dentist and Bill Murray as his all-too willing patient. John Candy is hilarious as the talk show host ''Wink Wilkinson.''
And lest we forget the Greek chorus line which appears in several of the musical numbers-they're good enough to have their own musical. Heck, even the homeless bums who sing during ''Skid Row'' are talented.
The songs, which are all done in the style of earky 60s rock and roll, have catchy melodies and clever lyrics. (Seymour: I have so many strong reservations/Should I go and perform mutilations?) Stand out numbers include the darkly funny ''Dentist!'' and wonderfully over-the-top ''Suddenly, Seymour'' (who knew Rick Moranis could sing?)
I, for one, am glad they gave this film a happy ending (as opposed to the original version.) It somehow makes the rest of the film seem more good-natured and light-hearted.
