"White Christmas" is one of those movies that I've seen multiple times each Christmas season.  The DVD version of the movie is excellent -- especially the commentary track with Rosemary Clooney.  Her enjoyable anecdotes about the making of this classic are priceless.  I particularly love the story about when the King and Queen of Greece show up during filming.  She also sings along with the show.  It's like watching it with the dear woman in your living room.  This is equally special since she is no longer with us.

The movie itself is great and I love it because of the feelings it brings.  The story is kind of silly and trite and the songs don't advance the storyline.  Hey, when you've got great dancers and singers like Clooney, Crosby, and Kay -- who needs storyline advancement.  Plus, Irving Berlin's songs are top notch!

The movie is beatufiul and beautifully filmed.  If you've never seen this movie, but you're a fan of movie musicals, Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, or just love Christmas -- check this movie out!  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
