Although I had seen this film (a few years back), a preview (contained in another film recently watched) reminded me how much I wanted to own it. The film has quite a cast with Rhona Mitra (Underworld) taking the lead role as Major Sinclair, a rescued child from the original reaper virus outbreak, who lives up to her more than capable skills as a tough, get the job done military asset. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) plays the role of Dr. Kane, the foremost scientist who was researching a cure for this deadly disease which ultimately lead to the building and sealing of large barrier wall isolating Scotland from the rest of the population. Left to die, nearly 30 years later, Kane and many others survive only to be sought out once again by the British government in order to obtain any chance of a cure for the recently returned outbreak of the reaper virus on the English side of the wall. Major Sinclair and her crew (tasked to enter the long abandoned land outside the wall and obtain a cure) soon find themselves surrounded by marauders from a cannibalistic group of survivors. The rest you'll just have to see for yourself. Very entertaining film.
