I am not a movie geek. I want to make it clear. But more and more often, I found that American movies got dried out thier creativity and tend to boring to dead. This Korean movie is very exotic,at least to the eyes of people who are not Koreans. There is no "Korean traditional" stuff in it. But still, it is very exotic. The time in the movie is 2002 or 2003, so it is very modern. The motif of the movie, however, is very very universal. I will not leak the actual story, because it ruins your fun for the movie. But this one is gory but fresh, brutal but tender, sad but funny, and hidious but beautiful. I know it sounds strange. But that is true. I talked with my friends about this movie and found that many girls just don't like it, partially because they are not into the motif that the movie is based on. But most of guys love it. I personally think they like the "sexy" part of this movie. I mean it's not like XXX or red marked adult movie but still the hidden theme is very... well... lacy. Hope it triggers your interest.
