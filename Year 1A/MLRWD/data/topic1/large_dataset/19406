It's an amazing movie, about many different aspects of life. But what I noticed was the double bind between the owner of the cafe and her husband. He didn't do 'nothin' so his wife  yelled because somebody in the family has to do 'somethin'. She wept after he left, just before Jasmin the German lady limped into her life. And she's just left her German louse of a husband who had irritated her so much that she'd rather hitchhike than be in the same car with him.

The two men seemed to want to keep track of their mate, but not enough to address their 'issues': apparent lazienss and extreme sensitivity to his 'manhood' in one. But boorishness, and 'non-involvement' with their wives in both. Jasmin isn't the kind of lady that can  ignore something that needs cleaning up, fixing up, so she goes to work, cleaning up, and getting order out of chaos. They evolve into women who can do something themselves,

The scenes that showed the two twists (I think they are 'moebius twists', a ribbon twisted a half turn) that appearred in the sky and in pictures on the wall of Jasmin's room was a true mystical encounter to me.

The  music was haunting as long as it wasn't the clamoring of the son, who seemed equally non-involved with his mother's harsh living conditions. That made the screeching excusable. I wondered why men do what causes women to do what they hate most.

I loved the Jack Palance, he was really into the character. It's a classic movie.
