3.25 stars is more like my rating.
This is the most vacuous of the Kevin Smith movies I think.  It was made with way too much money and felt like a bad remake of an 80s movie at times.  There is just too much effort to make it palatable to the mainstream, which is the corporate machine messing with the talent of Kevin Smith.  But anyway....
I think the best part of this movie is Brodie (Jason Lee) and his shamelessly aggressive mannerisms at which he confronts his problems, often with radical consequences (you'd have to see the movie to understand what I mean).  Plus there is the whole Easter and Easter Bunny scenario, which is EXTREMELY dangerous in terms of laughability.  "The Easter Bunny has been here since two days after Christmas!"  Now who won't be able to snicker in concurrence with that fact of consumerism and holiday obsession?  Of course the BIG Easter-related laugh is a surprise!
There is quite a bit of crude and crass humor in certain spots in this movie; this may be one area where MALLRATS is ahead of its time.  Movies like SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and AMERICAN PIE are commonly seen as THE modern gross-out films.
While not nearly as moving as Smith's other gems, MALLRATS is nonetheless a great laugh if you're stuck in your teenage mentality.
