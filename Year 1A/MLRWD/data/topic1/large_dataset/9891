It seems the whole world is into Julia Child's cooking. Well, everybody I know anyway. At least the ones who cook. I'm ashamed to say that I've never owned any of her books, though I've snagged a recipe or two of hers off the internet. She was a fine cook. I got this book along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037571006X">The French Chef Cookbook</a> at an estate sale in Laguna Beach and I must say I've been overwhelmed by them. I've stayed up late, pouring through them, imagining the meals I haven't made yet, wishing there were more days in the week, month, year, so I could make and try them all.

This book came out four years before Julia passed away and it was an immediate success and it still is. Between Julia and Jacques you'll learn all you ever need to know about French cooking. If you love this book the way I do. If you master this book, then you'll be every bit as good a French chef as any out there. You don't have to go to Paris. You don't have to go to Le Cordon Bleu, all you need is this book. Let Julia and Jacques teach you.
