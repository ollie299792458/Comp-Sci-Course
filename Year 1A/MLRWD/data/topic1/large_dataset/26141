I'm an avid moviegoer, and usually, I like everything I see. I give movies the benefit of the doubt, even when they don't deserve them. When "Snatch" was released in the theaters, I knew I wanted to see it, but after rewatching it again on DVD, I knew why I loved it so much the first time. Although I haven't seen Ritchie's "Lock, Stock...", "Snatch" is one of the movies that simply carves a genre all its own. The entire collection of characters, setting, and dialogue is so believeable, yet so over-the-top, that you simply laugh when thinking about it. The English crime underworld is the main focus of the story, and Ritchie pulls it off in a satisfying crime caper gone terribly awry. Benecio Del Toro's Frankie Four-Fingers is presented hysterically in snippets of Las Vegas footage that will have you crying, and the rest of the characters, from the bumbling fools Sol and Vince to the evil Brick Top, are extremely memorable. Oh, and don't forget the dog.
If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, then Snatch should be right up your alley. Some may call it a rip off, but the story is unique on its own. The DVD's special features are pefect, and when you turn on "Pikey Subtitles", Brad Pitt's character is THAT much better. And the deleted scenes feature ("Stealing Stones") while playing the movie really gives terrific insight into the director's thoughts. As does the commentary track.
Snatch is a gritty, nicely paced, comedic crime heist picture that should make its way into your DVD collection. Be warned, however: If you're turned off by sometimes indecipherable digalgue (yes, the Brits are hard to understand sometimes), then Snatch may not be one of your faves. Also, it's definitely a testosterone-driven flick, so you women may have some problems enjoying the ridiculous violence and gangster goings-on. 
Still, all this aside, top to bottom, Snatch is a wonderful way to spend two hours.
