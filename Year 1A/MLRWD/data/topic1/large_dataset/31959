I had heard this show referred to as "one of the best shows no one is watching," so I decided to give it a try. It exceeded my expectations by miles.

The pilot had a bit too much going on for my taste, and it left me thinking that I'd never figure out who was who and what was going on... But the second episode completely hooked me and I feel like I "know" all these characters personally at this point!

If the writing is phenomenal, the acting is out of this world amazing. It doesn't feel like your usual recurring TV drama; it feels much more like a documentary. I found that I became very attached to the characters and was often on the edge of my seat wondering how things would work out for them. Even the characters that you "shouldn't like" grow on you!

Since it has "football" in the title, I can imagine that it has turned non-football fans off to trying the show. I happen to love football, so those scenes are great, but I have friends who don't like football who I "made" watch this and they absolutely love this show! The football games actually get very little time in the episodes; the story of the characters struggles and accomplishments is the true focus.

If you're still one of the "no ones" in the description above, do yourself a favor and give Friday Night Lights a shot. I highly doubt you will ever regret it.
