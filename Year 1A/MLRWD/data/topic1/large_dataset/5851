Its funny to me when I read some of these reviews. People mention the drugs and violence in this movie but yet there isn't one instance of drug use ever mentioned or shown in the film and the SO MUCH SO CALLED Violence only takes up about 1 Minute of screentime. One reviewer says how they used to go to a school where noone would tease you at recess and she never had a nick name. Guess what you're the type of person who ends up being so overly senstive to everything. I mean to complain to the manager about 1 minutes of violence and it's not even anything graphic WOW! This movie is about STEPPING which is a tranditional form of dancing in BLACK FATERNITIES and not the UNDERBELLY of the AFRICAN AMERICAN culture. The underbelly? These are COLLEGE educated youths who are pursuing a first rate education to become LAWYERS, DOCTORS, JUDGES, PROFESSORS etc so how is this the UNDERBELLY of AFRICAN AMERICAN Culture. Just becuase you can't understand something from your (and I'm not sure but going out on a limb)Lilly white Glass house doesn't make it the sludge of society. Look yes we've seen this story tons of times before but its a entertaining movie where the DANCING really shines like no otherd ance flick in it's vien before!
