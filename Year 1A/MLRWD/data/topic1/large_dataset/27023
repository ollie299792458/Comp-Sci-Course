All I have to say is thank goodness DePalma chose Sissy Spacek.  Watching the documentary on this film was a real learning experience.  This is probably one of the best horror films made.  One of the things that makes it great is that it doesn't really start out as a horror film; more of like a "coming of age" type of movie.  But the sudden twist takes you deeper into the character, and makes you realize what hell Sissy goes through in that high school, with the people that surround her and within herself.
The transfer is the best I've heard so far.  The audio and the music together is equally balanced, which seems so rare to find on DVD's these days.  Beautiful menu montage, well done documentaries, and a touching picture gallary makes this DVD perfect to get at such a low price.  This is one of those DVD's that will make people want to get more and more movies on disc.  It was like watching the film all over again, as a new experience.  I felt I was sitting in a movie theater.  This standard will most likely change formats for DVD's, and change the way we look at films for a long time.  A great DVD to start your home viewing experience with.
