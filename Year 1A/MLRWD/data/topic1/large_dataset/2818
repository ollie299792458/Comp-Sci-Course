Good performances from a top-notch cast.  I found Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier and their gang to be a barrel of laughs, but I didn't necessarily find them sympathetic, although they were the heroes; I was more moved by Ben Kingley's "Cosmo."  In his eyes, what he and Robert Redford's "Martin" were doing in college -- shifting money from "The Man" to charities via hacking -- was a real exercise in altruism; for Martin, it was just a prank.  Although Cosmo is technically the villain of the piece, he is not evil (just off his rocker); he doesn't want to use the MacGuffin to gain power, but to carry out a demented, massive-scale version of the same wealth redistribution he and Martin were doing in college.  He's a genuinely tragic character, and Kingsley's portrayal of him was very powerful, yet he avoided scenery chewing (and that line about the future being about who controls the information was terrifyingly prescient).  I also thought that "Liz," Martin's on-again, off-again, was a charming, elegant, intelligent, welcome departure from the bimbos so popular during this period.  And the tech stuff was fun, although the drawback of getting too tech-heavy in any movie is that whatever may be cutting-edge or even futuristic computer effects at the time is going to look like Commodore BASIC even a decade later.
