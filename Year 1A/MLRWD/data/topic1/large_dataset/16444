So I've read alot of reviews (most are bad and misguided) about this movie on this site. And, well, here's my 2 cents, for what it's worth...
THIS IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!! It's a horror movie, but just barely. It's more science fiction than anything. Most people are trying to compare it to ALL zombie movies that have come before. If you do that then you WILL be disappointed. Let me repeat-it's NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!! If you're watching it to get a cheap scare you will also be disappointed. Watch this movie with an open mind-as you should ALL movies-and don't compare it to anything.
This movie is actually about the end of the world and how we as humans will carry on-the whole last half of the movie deals with this-the survivors journeying towards a faint hope on the airwaves and the soldiers who are just waiting for female survivors to show up to carry on the species. That's it, plain and simple.
It does have it's minor problems, I will admit. I too was a little disappointed at the neatness of the ending. I would have prefered it to not be so happy-it would have fit the tone of the film better. I would also have liked to know how far the 'rage' reached. They eluded to it spreading to New York and Paris-but didn't go into it much more than that. It might have added to the overall mood to get just a slight glimpse.
