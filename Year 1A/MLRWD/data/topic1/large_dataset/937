From the begining of this movie, when you spot Elizabeth Taylor having the temper tantrum of a lifetime, you *know* this is going to be a good time.

I adored this movie!

Kate and Bianca are sisters.  Their father has decreed that the younger sister, even tempered Bianca, may not marry until her elder sister walks down the aisle.  Unfortunately, Kate (Liz Taylor) has the disposition of a rattlesnake and is given to fits of anger.  Thus far, it has put off any suitors, and Bianca frets that she'll never be allowed to marry.  Then Pertruchio (Richard Burton) comes into the picture - a rather mad gentleman who is looking for a woman with a large dowry - and he pursues Kate, much to Kate's chagrin.  Eventually, he tricks her into marriage.  The honeymoon angst beings soon thereafter.

Great acting, great sets, and beautiful costuming, The Taming Of The Shrew is a great time.  I am very glad I bought this one.  I'll be watching it over and over again, I can guarantee.

Happy viewing.
