Whenever you see the words "based on" you know the film isn't going to follow the original story...as proves the case in this series.  I don't usually like films that are "based on" - particularly if I have loved the original stories - but I did enjoy this series directed by Michael Landon Jr. If you can accept these aren't the stories of the books written by Christian author Janette Oke, they are an enjoyable set of films of love & faith to watch in their own right.

In this film:
Missie Davis has grown up, & is now teacher at the school. She has attracted the interest of wealthy Grant Thomas -a surveyor with the railroad - who sets out to woo her.
Clark Davis has a serious accident, which means he now can't plough or plant. As Marty takes care of Clark, Missie closes the school & takes over the ploughing - struggling rather! Stranger Nate (or is he? Clark & Missie are sure he's familiar) who helped bring Clark back to the farm after his accident appears again & takes over the ploughing & planting - much to Missie's relief. He also saves Clark's leg through vital surgery.
Which man will Missie choose - the one who can offer her everything so there won't be any difficulties to worry about, or the one who will love her through the difficulties that arise?
