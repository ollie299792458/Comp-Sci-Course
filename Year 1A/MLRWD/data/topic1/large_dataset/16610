I have very vague memories of watching this as a child, scared to death by the weird music, lighting, etc., and better memories of watching VTTBOTS in reruns years later.  At one point I became aware that it was on at 6:00 am and I would actually try to get up to watch it then.

In today's world, the "special effects" would be considered cheesy, at best, and Irwin Allen's "monster of the week" theme became tiresome, but I'm really glad I bought this.  It brought back wonderful memories, and, frankly, the acting of the two main leads, Richard Basehart and David Hedison, is wonderful.  The actors did their utmost to imbue the scripts with real emotion, and this first half of season 4 has some really good entries.

Just as a side note, my special-effects jaded 7 and 12 year olds still stop to look whenever I'm watching VTTBOTS in the kitchen, despite their claims that "it's such an old show."  In contrast to today's network stuff, the show is filmed in healthy, vibrant color; the models used for Seaview and the Flying Sub are terrific; and the friendships between the main characters are healthy and palpable.

If you have any interest at all, I'd say go for it!
