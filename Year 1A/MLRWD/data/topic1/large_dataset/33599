I've been waiting for a Special Edition DVD of Say Anything for a long time.  I'd been hoping for a commentary track by Cameron Crowe -- but I was extremely excited to learn that the commentary track featured John Cusack, Ione Skye and Cameron Crowe.  There are also some deleted scenes, extended scenes and alternate scenes.
It's a great 80's movie with an excellent cast.  John Cusack is great as Lloyd, a recent high school graduate with no definite plans for his future.  He falls in love with Diane (Ione Skye) who is the stereotypical vision of perfection.  She is intelligent, financially stable and beautiful.  These two types bring out the best in each other as they fall in love and eventually come to conflict... and back into love at the movie's end.  This is one of my favorite performances by Cusack.  The amazing honesty and purity of Lloyd is wonderful and easy to identify with.
It's a great DVD.  The extra and extended scenes are interesting and while it's pretty obvious why many were left out, some of them would have flushed out the character of Diane's father (John Mahoney) a little better -- but would have also cluttered the movie.
The commentary is in some ways pretty standard.  Commentary tracks seem to be either really negative ("Oh man, I can't believe we did this like that!" "Remember that guy?  He's so lame!") or extremely congratulatory ("Oh you were wonderful here..." "Oh no, it was YOU who was wonderful!").  This commentary track falls into the latter category.  While this sometimes gets kind of annoying, there's very interesting dialogue between these three main players and some of the underlying storyline elements that I'd missed suddenly became clear.  There are also some fun little bits of information revealed as well.
Overall, it's one of my favorite movies and the DVD does not disappoint.  Highly recommended.
