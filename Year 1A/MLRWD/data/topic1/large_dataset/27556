If you want to watch an excellent film that should have been a huge hit, see THE NEXT THREE DAYS starring Russell Crowe, written and directed by Paul Haggis, with a brilliant cameo role by Liam Neeson. This is a film made for Russell Crowe because he has the massive intensity required for the role of an ordinary guy who must throw himself into extraordinary and extremely dangerous situations in order to rescue his wife and save his family. This is a really clever thriller and like all good thrillers, it is unbelievably tense. Partly this is due to the really intense performance given by the great Russell Crowe but the plot is so cleverly devised and executed that this intensity is further amplified to produce a taut gem of a film where no shot is wasted. Liam Neeson's performance, though small, is pivotal to the plot and gives us an indication of where both the plot and Crowe's character are going. I don't want to say too much about the plot because I don't want to spoil it for you but this is an A- grade movie destined to be celebrated by all those who take the time to see it. The film is exceptionally written and beautifully directed by Paul haggis and there are some other beautiful performances by Brian Dennehy, who says a lot with just a look, Elizabeth Banks who gives a carefully calibrated performance of someone under great stress, and Lenny James whose character adds to the tension immeasurably. This film is based upon a French film called POUR ELLE (For Her) which is worth seeing in its own right but this American remake is also a superb film. A gem of a movie!
