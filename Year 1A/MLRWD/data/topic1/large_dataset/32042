I've adored this movie from the beginning to the Hong Kong DVD to the Canadian DVD and now the Italian DVD which is 169 minutes long and has a second disc with interviews and how the movie was made, etc.
This longer version adds even more magic to this unforgettable film.  It's as though these wonderful, memorable characters came back to just tell you a few things more.  Most of the additional footage is in the first half of the film and no matter how well you know the shortened version, the additions are virtually seamless, making you think they were there all along.
For those who question why this film didn't do well originaly, it was released around the time of Cameron's "Titanic" and people had all the wrong expectations for this one.  
The Italian version (in PAL format) has dialogue and subtitles in both English and Italian for not just the film, but the bonus materials too, so many (well, if you have a multi-region DVD player) people can enjoy.  This movie is reason enough to blast the studios for fighting all multi-region "firmware" out there for DVD players.  Otherwise, we'd have to go to Italy to see this version.  Ridiculous.  
Oh, if you get it, turn on the subtitles--since they were done in Italy (the Canadian DVD has none), it seems they might be from the original script and you can compare them to the onscreen dialogue which is more idiomatic and character-driven.  
Now can we please get the long version of "Bagdad Cafe" on DVD?  The one that runs on Bravo....
