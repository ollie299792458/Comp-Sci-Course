It has been a few years since I last watched North Country! I am actually from Minnesota, so it is kinda cool for once in a good time to see a Minnesota movie, but also to see some history of Minnesota in itself.

Charlize Theron does a great performance of not only acting in this film, but to portray the true story of what some of these women went through in the steel mining industry!

This movie is inspiring because not only does this movie get the message to the audience that sexual abuse and harassment does happen within the work place and outside of the work place behind closed doors, but it gets across the positive message that any woman is of equal importance as a man in the work field and off the work field and that women these days stand up and speak out on behalf of other women and for themselves for women's rights!! Women aren't just an object in American society and Charlize Theron will let you know about it!

Overall, great movie in the non-fictional standpoint!
