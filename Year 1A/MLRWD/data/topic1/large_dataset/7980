Having seen this awhile back in Minneapolis, I picked up the DVD "Le Pacte Des Loupes" while visiting in France. Overall, it's a fun film, one that doesn't take it self too seriously, but at the same time, is dedicated to the presentation of the period in which the film takes place. The cinematography is great, washed over with a sense of darkness and foreboding, adding a great touch to the film. The actors, a great collection of hot French actors and actresses, only help to compliment this. Samuel Le Bihan and Vincent Cassel, like always, are great, each really getting into the roles of their characters, Cassel especially. The kung-fu action parts are fun, albeit a bit ham stringed, and towards the end, the resolution is a bit stretched as well. But, overall this is a great film. And, thanks in part to the action elements, should add a nice incentive for those movie goers who usually shy away from foreign flicks a nice opportunity to see one that is a bit "against the grain."
The DVD is nice, with a pristine transfer. Compared to the French version of the DVD, though, the American release is pretty lacking in extras. US buyers will be missing out on an entire extra disc of special features, including cast interviews, featurettes, additional deleted scenes and more. Overall, though, it gets some nice treatment considering it is ia foreign film.
