I was both excited and hesitant to start watching this movie.  Excited because from what I'd heard of the movie and from the cover alone, I sensed the potential for learning something deep and profound about life and humanity.  Hesitant because I hated the movie crash, both for its vignette style and its propensity to hit you over the head with the message ever five minutes.  And I had heard that this movie was 'in a similar form.'  As it turns out this movie let me down on both counts.  The thing I remember most and disliked the most about Babel was the fact that the entire movie seemed to be one long silent montage of boring events.  Every camera pan to villagers in Morocco or flashes of Mexico from the car window was at least two minutes too long.  And when there was action?  The action would happen in short bursts, but no one's story was compelling or exciting enough to make up for the inevitable stretches of boredom that were to follow.  I did find myself mildly engrossed in the story line set in Japan, mostly because the struggles of the deaf mute girl seemed 1,000 times more real than either the nanny in Mexico or the couple in Morocco.  Why?  Maybe because no matter how hard the movie tried, I was never rooting for or even remotely cared about the blond mother that got shot or her deadbeat husband.  The same goes for all of the other characters, whose story lines were either too short, too predictable, or just too boring.  And the movie ultimately failed to bring any of the stories together in any sort of real meaningful way.  I suppose the message is that people everywhere struggle to communicate and exist together in a world that is changing and becoming increasingly more complicated (and this message I have gleaned solely from the story of Babylon and not from the movie itself).  But Babel failed to communicate anything to me other than my confusion as to why I didn't fast forward at least half of the movie while watching it.
