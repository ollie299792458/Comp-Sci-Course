Ok, now this movie can be viewed two ways. One, as a critic with a notebook who would probably scribble down "Absolute piece of crap do not even waste your time" or with your mates with a pizza, plenty of beer and you would probably view it as "Bloody fantastic". I tried to do both but quickly got bored with the first way and almost immediately did the second and me and my friends' reactions were exactly like what I typed earlier, "Bloody fantastic".
Sure it's bloody, sure it's gory sure and it's not the greatest movie of all time but when you sit down and watch would you really expect Citizen Kane? The caption above the title basically says what the whole 100 minutes of pure gory entertainment is all about. It's a gory tale of a wimpy but overall nice bloke called Lionel living and obeying under his over-bearing mother's every rule. But after mummy is bitten by a  sumatran rat monkey everything gets a little bit more stressful for Lionel as his mother has turned into a zombie. As he now has to hide her mother's victims, including a dog, from the rest of the neighbourhood. But through all the hilarious, bloody and sometimes disgusting moments it all climaxes with the infamous lawnmower scene and when Lionel is finally "born again" but I won't spoil it for first timers.
Overall it's not a great movie by any means, nor it is a terrible movie but it is great entertainment and briiliant comedy laced with Python-esque style humour perfectly showcases Peter Jackson's warped sense of humour which is also shown in Meet the Feebles and Bad Taste and an obvious skilled director who would move onto bigger and better things such as Lord of the Rings and King Kong. It is an absoulute must for cult movie enthusiasts and gore hounds. Just don't come expecting a terrifying horror movie.
