This DVD, "The Mechanic," starring Charles Bronson is a classic among dvds of this genre
and within the Charles Bronson collection.  He is the ultimate assassin, organized, crafty,
driven, and akin to spys, a gentleman and professional in what he does -- assassination.  As
he gets older, he needs to groom a young buck to help.  In this case, it is ironic.  The young
buck turns out to be the son of the man he has known for a long time, but becomes his current
target.  Instead of shooting his target, he causes him to have a heart attack while running
up hill from a sniper attack.  This seems a bit more humane for an old friend.  However, as most
of you can guess, the young buck learns his trade well and even has a predilection for it.  Young
buck learns of his father's fate at the hands of his now current teacher and seeks revenge ala the
young, cavalier buck that he is; but yet outsmarted in the end.  Moral of the story is: never
screw with your teacher.  In this case screwer becomes screwee.  Old teacher gets the last laugh
because he studied his protege's strengths and weaknesses and kept a cool head.  I'm sure you've
seen the new Mechanic out with "Transporter" star Jason Stratham.  It's a good flick; but the
original Bronson version set the foundation.  Go check it out -- it's like Clint Eastwood's Dirty
Harry series -- never outdated, always appreciated and exciting to watch.
