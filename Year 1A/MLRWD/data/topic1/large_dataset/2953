The Asylum and SyFy have done it again. They made another SyFy original movie that not to many enjoy. First off I saw this with my mother when they showed it on TV and she thought it was horrendous and unwatchable. I begged to differ and thought it was pretty funny. The plot of this movie is something of the mind of a 4th grader would make up. A US Ambassador to Venezuela was going on a Boat trip to in the Orinoco River when the boat was attacked by Piranhas. The Venezuelan government thought this was an assassination. The US Government calls in Special Agent Jason Fitch to see what happened. He finds out the boat was attacked by Mega Piranhas that are going to get bigger and bigger and attack.
  Aside from the plot being extremely ridiculous, this movie turns out to be an unintentional comedy. Another thing is that this movie is more enjoyable if you have a bunch of friends over your house for riffing the movie.
Now on to the picture transfer. 10/10. The Picture transfer for this Blu-Ray is actually amazing apart from the movie being a low budget B movie.
The Audio quality is a 10/10. I didn't have to turn the volume up on this movie one bit.
Special features, Alas there is none.
