Russel Crowe is a good actor who up until movie-selected-good solid scripts.  What happened?  This moving is boring (even the high powered Wall Street type scenes are dull) and the characters are jerks.  The women are all bimbo types dying to get "shagged" by Max (Crowes' character) who thinks he's God's gift to women and the corporate world.  This is all supposed to be funny- yuk yuk.  Crowe's character is the epitome of disgusting corporate excess and ironically this movie and all its delight of corporate greed and excess was released about 2 months before the world economic crash.  A year or 2 after its release and this movie would be a glaring documentary about the shrill vulgarity of corporate greed.  It's not funny watching idiots like this-now.

The bottom line is that movie just plain bad- that characters are all a bunch of dim-wit greedy jerks and it's not funny-really stupid idiotic type scenes.  I would not pay a dime to see this movie. I saw it free- on a plane traveling to Europe. Thank God.
