Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is not shakespeare by any means, but if you get past it's first low budget, straight to video 15 minutes that really does set up more of the story than you might think, what you'll get is an action movie worthy of having the beautiful and talented Lucy Liu starring in it. Lucy plays Sever, an ex agent who's on a mission to seek revenge against the man who took away her family. Antonio Banderas plays Johnathon Ecks, an FBI agent who's also seeking revenge on the same man for taking his wife and making her think he was dead. Both Ecks and Sever believe they are working against eachother which leads to some nice fighting and action sequences; one in which involves Sever on top of a bridge with a rocket launcher firing at any threats that come her way. Martial arts, car chases, explosions, shootings and kickings are just a few of the things you can expect to see in this movie which is also surprisingly touching when Ecks and Sever team up and learn more about eachother's past. This is not the best movie I've seen, but if you want your Charlie's Angels fix and you wanna see many, many things blow up in a no holds barred style movie, then I recommend seeing this fun flick with a group of friends.
