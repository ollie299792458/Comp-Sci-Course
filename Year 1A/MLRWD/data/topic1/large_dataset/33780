While it has the expected jingoistic/nationalist tone for a British film made on the eve of WWII, it's actually a bit more cynical and somber than many such films made contemporaneously.  The focus is more on personal duty, honor, and friendship than "national service".

While the plot is somewhat routine, there are moments that elevate it and the performances are good.  The battle sequences are good but (obviously) lose some impact on the small screen.  It may be apocryphal, but real British soldiers (in period outfits) and real dervishes were used as extras, and it is claimed that the British rifles were loaded in case the dervishes got "carried away" during filming.

There is the usual casual racism of the era in the portrayal of any non-Europeans and the usual stilted dialogue of 30's films, but neither of these issues ruins the film.

Anyone who enjoyed Lawrence of Arabia should find enough to appreciate in this film, although it obviously isn't anywhere in the same league.
