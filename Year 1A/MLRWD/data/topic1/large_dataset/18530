I bought this movie for 2 reasons, the first being Peter O'Toole (god of acting), and the second being that other reviewers claimed it was a mind trip. On the first point my money was well spent. O'Toole gives a virtuoso performance, with all of his characteristic dry wit and style. His performance was in fact very nearly the only reason I gave the film 2 stars instead of zero. The stunts were also remarkable. In nearly all other aspects however, this film fails miserably. The female lead is alluring, but Railsback is truly a pathetic excuse for an actor. His Veitnam vet was emotionally dead and a ridiculous stereotype. The film's script is sloppy and overlong, and I'd like to point out the wisdom of an earlier reviewer who commented ot the hypocrisy of the story and its characters. As for this being a mind trip which changes the way we look at cinema, the film was behind its mask of intellectualism without any interesting comments to be made. Not even the most neanderthal-like of film-goers doesn't know that hollywood is full of cutthroat executives and that cinema plays with our sense of reality. I was extremely dissapointed in this film, its excellent premise and the presence of O'Toole getting my hopes up. Anyone who worships this film, as I'm aware many do, than I pity their ignorance of the far better films out their.

I would reccomend to anyone who likes this film John Fowles novel "The Magus", to which it owes much, as well as Terry Gilliam's film Brazil, another cult favorite mind trp, but a far better one
