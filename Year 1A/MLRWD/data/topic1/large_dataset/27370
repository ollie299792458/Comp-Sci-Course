The review for this movie all seemed to say this was a really scary movie. The reviews seemed to imply that something happens at the end. The "bloody"climax was nothing. By reading the reviews I thought that in the end something interesting would happen rather than the slow nothing that did. It seemed to me that they would fight back against the intruders in a struggled for their lives. Liv Tyler gives a good performance but when she is attacked, finally, its like she is just giving up which seems contredictory to her character and the survival instinct. The movie is creepy when the intruders slowly tell Liv they're there, but for all the build up it comes to nothing. I was fine with the slow moving begining because I assumed there would be a decent climax because of the "bloody climax" the reviews mentioned but that is a lie. The climax was horrible. It was an okay movie but I was terribly disappointed because the reviewers not only lied to us the movie ended with no closure even though it was "based on true events" and anyway if you're going to make a movie, that means you're changing half the stuff anyway so why not make it more interesting. The secenes where Liv was trying to find help and hiding were good but really slow moving. They really didn't have a full movie and they tried to lengthen it with "tension" that gets you really rather bored. What the reviewers don't seem to tell you is that the movie drags like a snail all the way to the climax which sucks.
