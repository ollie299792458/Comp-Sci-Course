I liked this movie a lot better the first time I saw it...

...when it was called "Star Wars".

I really liked the scene where Eragon was looking off into the sunset.  Boy, how original.  I haven't read Eldest, but I'm assuming that the princess is Eragon's sister.  Is this correct?

I was wondering when Han Solo was going to show up, and then of course he did.

I also like the scene where Eragon had to take a detour to go to Cloud City to rescue the Princess.  And then she tells him its a trap.  I was expecting the villian to say, "The magic is strong with you, Eragon, but you're not a Dragon Rider yet."

I hear that the writer was only 16 when he wrote this.  Big deal.  Lot's of aspiring novelists are writing stuff at 16.  It never gets published for a reason.  Their brains are not fully developed, and they don't have enough life experience to absorb their influences and reshape them into something original.  I think this is definately the case here.  Mozart wrote his first symphony at 5 years old.  We never hear that one, though, do we?

By the way, Aragon is one of the main characters in the Lord of the Rings.  Its like this kid isn't even trying to be original.  Changing the first letter, but leaving the name phonetically identical is NOT being original.
