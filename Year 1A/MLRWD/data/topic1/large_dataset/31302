I also have three of Ellen's Crunch Pilates DVD.  All are excellent.  This particular DVD keeps me moving - I never get bored.  The participants on the DVD are not all "hard bodies" - they are "everyday" women which for me, is easier to watch.  The music is uplifting, fast moving - and Ellen is easy to understand and follow.

I like the addition of hand-weights.  This is a new spin on pilates.  My arms and legs really felt the burn.  If you do not like squats or if you enjoy a slower, calmer pilates style - this may not be your favorite...however, it is definitely one of my favorites because I keep a great pace and I can feel the muscles stretch and move without having a high-impact workout.

The mat work was shorter than her other DVD's, however, I substitute a segment from her "Pick Your Spot Pilates" DVD if I feel I want to continue mat work.

Ellen is definitely my favorite instructor.  I look forward to any more pilates DVD's she releases in the future.

I highly recommend this DVD!
