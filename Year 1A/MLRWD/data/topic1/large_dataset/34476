this movie is quite scary. i have the dvd of it, thanks anchor bay for releasing such a great dvd. anyway, dude this movie is messed up. the scariest part is in the beginning, when the kid's parents get killed. and the music in the very beginning, when the wreath is coming at you and you hear "santa's watching, santa's waiting, christmas eve is slowly fading" in that little kid's voice, it is so creepy. and there are many good death scenes, i won't give them away. it is hard to find a good christmas horror movie, but i will save you time by telling you, check out black christmas and this movie, forget the rest. you will be pissed off if you watch christmas evil, as a matter of fact, avoid troma movies at all costs, they are bast*rds and deserve to die, they disgrace the horror genre. anyway, check this movie out, replace "a muppet's christmas carol" or a miracle on 34th street" and watch this instead. one more thing, take some free advice. DO NOT watch this with your parents or any other adult. watch it by yourself in a dark room like i do, it makes it more scary anyway
