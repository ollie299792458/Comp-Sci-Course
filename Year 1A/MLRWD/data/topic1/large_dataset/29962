SON OF FRANKENSTEIN is the last of the great horror films from Universal in the 1930's. The film bills Basil Rathbone as the son of Dr. Frankenstein. In which he does a fine job of bringing the character to life. Next is Karloff, who does nothing in this film. He is a prop, a lifeless doll who lays around, waiting for, "his brother," in which Lugosi calls Rathbone and the monster, to make him well, so the deranged, Ygor (Lugosi) can send the monster back to ravage the countryside. Lugosi was to have a bit part in this film, but the director kept him in practically every scene until the last, which was the best decision made for the great film. One of the best scenes of the film is when the elders of the village bring old Ygor in for questioning. Of course, there have been some murders taking place, and who else could they blame! So Ygor sits on the stand, and proclaims he knows nothing. They tell him he better come clean, or they'll hang him again! And old Ygor goes on to tell them he was already pronounced dead once, and they can't do it again. He knocks on his crooked, broken neck, stands up and staggers around the room, coughing on the old men as he makes his way. Beautifully done scene! Menacing and funny all at once. And don't forget Lionel Atwill who comes a close second to Lugosi's creation of Ygor. Atwill's one arm inspector is good discussion by a warm fire, with a fine ale in hand... Do not miss.

THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN is a fun film, with Lugosi's reprisal of Ygor, but it can't hold a candlestick to SON. But if you're a fan, you will be delighted.
