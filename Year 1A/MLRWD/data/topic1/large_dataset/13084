indidviduals who are alienated, an outcast within the society tells their different story in this artistic entertaining movie.  Cinematogrophy done by the one and only stylish chris doyle.  Chris is amazing wih the cinematogrohy done on this film.  Shot with neon, dreamy, hallucinatory preparation made this film an artistic beauty to watch.  Each characters in this story are very interesting in their own way.  We have the cool laid back quite assasin (leon) who lurks his way down at night to the city lights of hongkong in order to fulfill his mission guided and ordered by his dreamy melon-cholic girl partner, in which both of em never met one another but only find cues on things on recognising each others' personality.  Such when michelle (the assasin's partner) look through the assasins left overs in her hotel room to know the assasin's preference.  We have the mute, entertaining, colorful personality character who also lurks his way with his scooter at night to run his imaginary jobs at random shops and restuarant.  This mute guy is takeshi kaneshiro who always run in with this one particular guy in which takeshi forces him to become his customer otherwise painful consequences might happen(a funny scene).  The movie is entirely unique in its own way that i really find captivating to the senses.  There is way more stuff in the movie than what i just said, you just have to find it for yourself.  In my opinion this movie is way better than its predecessor chungking express in which directed by the same director.  get the movie if u want to see a unique cinematography and stories of alienated individuals.
