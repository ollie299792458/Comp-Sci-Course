Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is one of those films I can curl up with on those days when a bit of comfort is needed. It's about getting older, seeing one's mortality, and yet always reaching out generously to others. Joan Plowright must be in her 80's now, and not a typical "romantic" lead actress, but this part allows her to use her considerable talents, and to great effect. Ignored by her family and missing her late husband, "Mrs. P." moves to a seedy residence hotel in London, where she interacts with the usual suspects, who are aging and each very strange in their own ways. It's very amusing and poignant, but there wouldn't be much of a film to report about without her chance meeting with a poor busker who comes to her aid after a fall in the street. The way in which the friendship which follows is developed by the actors, the writer, and the director, is what makes this gem what it is. In other hands, this plot could have gone over the top in many ways, but with perfect British restraint, the story of Sarah Palfrey and her young rescuer unfolds in a sweetly natural way. Rupert Friend is 100 %, in looks, acting ability, and he even sings. Joan Plowright shows that she still has it, in every way. The rest of the cast is excellent. Bring your hankies, but prepare to smile through your tears. This is a love story you don't want to miss.
