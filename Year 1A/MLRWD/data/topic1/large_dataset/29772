This is my all-time favorite John Wayne film -- and one of the best westerns and films of all time. It's a simple tale of a cattle drive, a cruel, driven man (John Wayne), and his sensitive adopted son (Montgomery Clift). Clift is maybe the only actor I've seen -- except for James Stewart -- who can command by his performance equality in a scene with Wayne.  I thought he was superb. The supporting cast is similarly good: Walter Brennan as comic relief and moral arbiter sets the standard for the type.  The ending, however, would have been better had a female character, Joanne Dru, never have been introduced.  This is a story about men; let them work out their problems in their own way.

Wayne, in a reversal of usual Hollywood practice, plays a man older than himself in this movie.  He was about 40 when "Red River" was released, but his character in the movie is probably closer to fifty.  This is probably the first time he played a tough old man, but he went on to play about the same role dozens of times.

The virtues of the movie, in addition to the cast of Wayne/Clift/Brennan, is the black and white photography. A scene which terrified me when I saw this movie as a small child is when Wayne takes on the Comanches at night in the river near the beginning of the movie; Then, there is the justly-famous scene when Wayne strides angrily toward a showdown with Clift and the cattle herd parts for him like the Red Sea did for Moses.  And the "hee-haw" scene....and...and....  This is a memorable film.
