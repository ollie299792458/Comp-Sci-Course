I mean it.  Bar none.  I am not a huge fan of the Marx's, but this film is certainly their best (closely followed by "A Night at the Opera").  Basically, dictator of postage-stamp sized Freedonia, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) declairs war on neighbouring Sylvania without good reason at all, and havoc ensues.  It's perfectly simple, but at the same time is pretty accurate when you think about how most wars start.  You may feel uncomfortable the first time.  This movie pulls no punches when it comes to nasty insult based humour.  However, it grows on you something shocking.  The brothers knock off just the right mix of slapstick (Harpo), stupidity (Chico), smart-alec (Groucho) and straight (Zeppo), that you can't help but keep laughing all the way through the film's short 70 or so minutes.  My favourite sequence? The Mirror scene of course!  But I won't spoil things here.  If you're a fan of comedy, that is ANY sort of comedy, you owe it to yourself to own this movie.  It features enough gags for six features, but one this good is enough.  My only minor quibble is that some of the musical numbers have lost their edge with time, and now seem contrived and out of place.
