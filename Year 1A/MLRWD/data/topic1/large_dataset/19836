SPOILER ALERT
It's always risky to watch a movie made from a book you liked, and I did like the book version of the story quite a bit...it was lyrical and dreamy and morally challenging. The film, for some reason, inserted a weird narrative about abortion, which was not part of the original story. It also made Maureen, the best friend, a Christian virgin. So of course the whole thing becomes a religious morality play, whereby the bad girl chooses to die to make up for the life she took. Yuck. The book had none of that nonsense. And in fact, the (anti-)heroine made quite a different choice in the book, which offered a completely different twist on the "choose life" thing--in the book the grown-up Diana sees a bumper sticker with that saying on it--the person who wrote the screenplay obviously noticed that and decided to make it more of a propaganda piece, instead of a morally ambiguous fable.
That said, the performances were good, and it may be that the whole story would have played better to someone who hadn't read (and liked) the original novel.
