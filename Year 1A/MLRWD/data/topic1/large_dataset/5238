Downton Abbey is television at its best.  It has it all: character development, great writing and wonderful acting.
  Everything is done with such an eye for quality that the series cannot help but impress.  And impressed we are--right from the opening credits where we get to see the actual house (castle would be more appropriate to say)where Downton Abbey is filmed.
  As we become involved in storylines of the wealthy who live there and all the scandal and intrigue that comes with being part of the social elite, we get to know the staff who works for them--there in the underbelly of the great mansion's hierchy--working people who have their own lives to live and stories to tell too (which are just as interesting as the lives of those they serve.)
  Though some of the characters may appear pompous due to their privilege, they are not portrayed only as one-dimensional people as if they are sterotypical cut-outs but as multi-faceted characters who have good and bad qualities.
  If you watch Downton Abbey, you will probably become a fan and the wait between seasons will seem very, very long.
