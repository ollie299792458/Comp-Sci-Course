This could have been a "B" movie exploitation film of a short lived pop group.  Instead, it turned out to be the precursor to MTV and music videos, shows what made the Beatles so much fun and manages to play a few of their great tunes at the same time.  The plot is minimal, consisting of the Beatles entourage getting the Beatles to a live television show on which the Beatles are to perform.  Nearly from the beginning to the end, the Beatles are chased by pimple faced young teens, the police, their handlers, and everyone else.  And throughout the film, Paul's grandfather, played by William Brambell (a very clean old man), keeps stirring up problems.

The nominal plot allows the Beatles natural likeability to shine.  This film established the personas of the individual Beatles (as portrayed to the media) -- Paul -- straightforward and good natured, John -- incessantly sarcastic, George -- subtle with a dry sense of humor,  and Ringo -- quiet, shy and introspective.  The movie is irreverent, inventive, funny, droll, deadpan, filled with non-stop movement, and some great, if dated, rock-n-roll!  It is a wonderful film showing the exuberance of youth, the innocence of an earlier time, and Beatlemania in all its glory!

The DVD's extras include interviews with about everyone still living who participated in the film except the surviving Beatles.  While it is nice to have all of the insiders reminiscing about the film, it would have been nice to hear from some of the Fab Four.
