An excllent, suspenseful movie with Forrest Tucker and the luscious Janet Munro who lit up the screen in Darby O'Gill and the Little People (admittedly, the competition was an old man, Sean Connery, and a bunch of leprechauns.)  Really, it only falls short when you get, you know, to the crawling eyeball creatures.  But on the kind of anemic special effects budget English horror films had, it's understandable.  Of course, it's still crawling eyes.  I meran, really, crawling eyes.  All you need is Navy SEALS armed with squirt guns filled with fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  Tucker was the American lead witrh an all-British cast, a formula Hammer Horror pioneered with great financial success in their first horror film, The Quatermass Experiment.  They wound up sticking with that formula until developing their own in-house stars, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  As I said, this film does work very well right up to the confrontation with the titular occular stars after which you just have to go with it.  It's still enjoyable.  Consider the Mystery Science Theater 3000 send-up instead for an extra boost...a watchable movie with the MST3K touch, my favoite combination
