Keep in mind I'm reviewing the dvd not the film.

As for as the dvd goes I say it was great transfer. The first disc contains the film and commentaries by Romero, Lori Cardille, Tom Savini, and Cletus Anderson. There is also another commnetary by fellow Day fan Roger Avary.

Now the second disc it contains all the trailers and tv spots(as I know). Poster, Advertising, Behind the Scenes, Production stills, Memorabilia galleries, and also a zombie make-up gallery included(shows how nasty those Day zombies are up close!). A interview with Richard Liberty(before he died), a Wampum Mine Promotional Video where Day of the Dead was filmed and of course the 39 minute The Many Days of the Dead doc(Very informative it is!)

There is also a 31 minute behind the scenes production footage with Tom Savini. Shows you the transformation of the extras to the gruesome zombies they become in Day.

The only reason I knocked a point of is because of that. Since this is the Ultimate Edition of the Day you would think they would get all of the production footage with Savini which is 4.5 hours long(which could be found at ebay at times) but, nope they only got 31 mins of it.

Oh well. I recommend this 2-disc special of Day of the Dead only if your a fan of the film or the Dead trilogy in general.
