I just had to comment regarding the person who slammed Eddie Albert because he doesn't have a convincing Persian accent in the movie.
Talk about missing the point!  The character of the traveling salesman is  supposed to be a PHONY Persian!  He's supposed to be as Persian as Bill  Clinton!  An actor successfully playing the role uses a bad accent ON  PURPOSE.  The guy who played it in the original Broadway cast used  something close to a Yiddish accent.  If Eddie Albert's accent kept  changing throughout the movie, this does not mean he did a BAD job of  portraying the character.  It means he did a GOOD job.
The traveling  salesman in Oklahoma! is similar to Harold Hill in The Music Man -- he  travels around trying to gyp people in small towns by selling them phony  products -- one of them, in this case, being an Egyptian elixir.  Eddie  Albert played his role so well in this movie that 4 years later he was  selected to replace Robert Preston in the original Broadway run of The  Music Man.
While I'm worked up, someone else said he prefers the  CinemaScope version to the Todd-AO.  He says he realizes this puts him in  the minority.  I'll say!  The Todd-AO version is better in every way, shape  and form, and that's the only one that ever should have been shown to the  public, anyway.  The CinemaScope version is an anomaly of movie history.  The C-version looks brown and muddy.  The Todd-AO version is bright and  colorful.  I know "brown and muddy" is in style these days, and  "bright and colorful" is out, but "bright and colorful"  is much more indicative of the musicals of the 1950s, and evidently was the  original intent of the filmmakers, and really SHOULD be the only version  available.  I have no nostalgic feelings for the C-version, which is the  only one I ever saw for 40 years.  Going from the C-version to the Todd-AO  is similar to going from Kansas to Oz -- everything turns to color!
