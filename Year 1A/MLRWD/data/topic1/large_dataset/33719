Bar none ...

& there are more than a few outstanding actors who have been Robin Hood on the screen (Russell Crowe, Errol Flynn & Jason Connery on the little screen) ...

Sean Connery & Audrey Hepburn gave the Robin Hood story its heroism (which most of them do), its depth & humanity. This is not a carboard cutout love story - it's a love story for romantics who have grown older & wiser & who are still in love.

Robert Shaw plays a conflicted Sheriff of Nottingham - a soldier faced with fighting an opponent he knows is a better man than he is because the king says he must.

& Nicol Williamson as Little John is both Robin's friend & a realist who worries that his old friend's insistence that he is the Robin Hood of the ballads is bound to end in disaster. Little John knows that Robin has grown old & that his muscles ache in the cold & the wet, but he follows him to Sherwood nonetheless.

& Richard Harris is a splendid, mad, megalomaniac King Richard Lionheart who dies in a French field fighting for nothing more than a piece of carved stone.

Bar none ...

Robin & Marian is the best Robin Hood ever.
