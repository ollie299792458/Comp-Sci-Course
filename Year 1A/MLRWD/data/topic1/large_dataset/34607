Unfortunately, as with many other newer shows, this one is "dumbed down" for the masses. At one time, the Discovery family of channels was intended for "thinking people". Now it is little more than pop culture programming aimed at the mindless sheep with attention spans of 15 seconds or less, and no appreciation for detail or accuracy. There are many errors in this series, such as inaccurate specifications on some of the aircraft, and inaccurately rendered aircraft in the animations. The video clips often are not even of the aircraft involved, but the same old worn out stock footage we see everywhere else. Many of the animated flight regimes are simplistic and cartoon-like; showing aircraft performing unrealistic maneuvers. The "camera" that shakes when aircraft fly by is MADDENING. Why does everything have to be aimed at the common denominator?

With all of that said, it is a good show, compared to what else is available out there. Not just good, but really good. So good in fact that I gave it 4 stars.

It just could have been so much more.
