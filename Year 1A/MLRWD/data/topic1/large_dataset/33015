In her dozen or so years in show business, Julia Roberts has played many roles.  A hooker, a movie star, a step mom, and Tinkerbell are among a handful of Roberts' roles in the past decade.  And in that time Julia Roberts has become "America's Darling" and one of the most recognizable (and highest paid) actresses in the history of cinema.  Yet, she has never clutched an Oscar in all those years.  So, to say that her Oscar-nominated performance in Erin Brockovich is well deserved would be a tragic understatement.  Roberts takes on the roll of a double divorcee-single mother of three struggling to earn enough money to get by.  Playing Brockovich is easily the most challenging role of Roberts' illustrious career.  But it was also, in turn, the greatest performance of her career.  What makes this a standout role for Roberts is the fact that she has built up that "squeaky-clean" image over the course of her career.  She almost always played the role of the vixen, or the damsel in her most memorable movies.  But now, she plays a foul-mouthed, and cunning ex-beauty queen... a far cry from Tinkerbell indeed.  And Julia Roberts stood and delivered the entire length of the movie.  However, Roberts is not the only one to make the movie as great as it is.  Steven Soderbergh's directing job is flawless in this film.  He helped create a movie based on a true story that is, in fact, very believable, humorous, witty, clever, and moving all at the same time.  Erin Brockovich could very well be the best film of the year.  It is certainly well rounded in terms of production.  Great casting.  Great direction. Great Acting.  Great Writing.  Great Film.  And so on Oscar night... Julia Roberts may finally get the recognition she deserves.
