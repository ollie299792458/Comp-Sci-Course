I first saw this Met's production of I Puritani on HD screening at the movies. The video quality wasn't very good and rather dark, and there were a few technical glitches like the end of the last scene was cut off. I was amazed, in comparison, that this DVD is sharp with excellent video and audio quality. If your intent, watching this production, is to hear the 'Elvira' of this or that soprano, forget it and turn it off. If you want to see and hear Netrebko's Elvira, keep it going and you'll be in heaven. As with her other DVDs, Netrebko steals the show, theatrically and vocally. In her duet after the mad scene, she outsings Cutler, as she's been doing all along with all the other tenors. Netrebko's voice size is getting larger without affecting her lyricism, legato, flexibility and color. Netrebko's mad scene is a case in point what grand opera is all about: theater using music to convey drama. Without theater, historically, there would  be no opera. Opera was conceptualized by the opera founding fathers as the means to serve the theater. Greeks invented the theater with its chorus, etc., and the Florentines added music for dramatic effect. That's why, thematically, the first operas, like Daphne and Orfeo and many others later, were based on Greek dramaturgy. All opera aficionados talk about the voice, the Goddess of opera, and that's true. On the other hand, if the voice is expressed with body language- theater, acting- the dramatic effect can be profound. That's where Netrebko comes in. Some said that lying on her back, with her hair flowing over the orchestra pit was a cheap trick. I'm sure she didn't ask for it, but stage directors use her unique physicallity and athleticism to enhance drama that we haven't seen in a long time. On the strength of Nerebko's merging theatricality and vocalism in the mad scene, this DVD deserves five stars and is highly recommended.
