I watched this movie today on a Delta flight.  I had seen the poster at a local theater, but hadn't heard more about it.  Now, I'm really glad I got to see it after all.

The movie's a great opportunity to meet wonderful members of the choir.  There's the feisty 92-year old woman, who swears she's 29, and spunkier than some a third her age.  A former standout performer shows up tethered to an oxygen tank and pulls out all the stops.  He also could have a career as a comedian.  He's that funny.

While the scenes with many of the members are funny, the movie is also truly moving.  Can you imagine performing less than an hour after hearing one of your fellow choir members has died?  That performance - at a local jail - is likely to elicit tears from even the most jaded of viewers.  I know it choked me up.

The interesting twist on this elder choir is that this is not a bunch of people sitting around performing old time ditties.  They cover everything from James Brown to Sonic Youth to Sinead O'Connor.  I'm not sure who has more fun, the performers on stage or the audience members at a sellout concert in town.  As an added bonus, the film features the choir members in their own videos - even a Saturday Night Fever takeoff!

The drive to perform and do a great job is truly amazing!  One member, who's at the heart of the group, has had enough chemotherapy to kill most people.  He's still hoping to make the concert even after a recurrence of cancer.  Another vows to come back from a severe heart attack and rejoin the group.

If you want to laugh, cry and maybe even dance a little, you should definitely see young at heart!  Not only is it inspirational, it's also motivational.  As an audience member says, "I will never complain about being too old again!"

Enjoy!
