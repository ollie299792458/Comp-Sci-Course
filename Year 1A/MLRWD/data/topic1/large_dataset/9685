I haven't read God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza, but I think Polanski's cinematography itself deserves 5 stars. Most likely dark humor covering all contemporary culture idols with vomit in literal as well as metaphorical sense covering all does come from the play, but Polanski surely did a great job of bringing all this to us in a crisp modern setting which makes every screen look like an art piece in itself, by placing every person and every single object in the exact place where it should be, by having selected exactly right actors, colors, sounds, everything.

Reza's  misanthropic message (I'm sure it's there in the play) comes across forcefully in Polanski's rendering, and the film covers not just modern culture, but human relationships in general, including what we call "fair" competition in the industrial world, psychopathic industry captains, women whose life is all facade with no substance, parents who bring children in this world without really knowing what for and what they really want from life themselves...

This film is considered black comedy, but I think this is too narrow a definition. It is black, to be sure, and yes, it's superbly sarcastic, but it's not a comedy, it's as deadly serious as life  ever can be.

This movie can be seen as anti-American, but I think it's bigger than that, it's misanthropic in general, especially so considering that the world around us becomes more and more Americanized by the hour.
