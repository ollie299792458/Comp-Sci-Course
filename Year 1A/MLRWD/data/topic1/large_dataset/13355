I have two words that have stuck with me since youth "RAZZLEBERRY DRESSING!"  I saw Mr. Magoo's version of A Christmas Carol sometime in the late 60's and for months afterwards went around singing about Razzleberry Dressing.  I only wish you could find those songs on record (yes, I said record) back then.  It is available on the Nick At Night Classic Cartoon Christmas CD.

You can watch 100 versions of Dickens classic, by every T.V. and Cartoon character imaginable.  But the two best have to be #2-Mickeys Christmas Carol (I have it on VHS and have not seen it on DVD) Mr. Magoo (#1).  No matter how many times you watch it you find yourself caught up in the "Broadway" type presentation and you don't want to move or make a sound until the show is over.  The original songs and lyrics are a wonderful addition that makes this version stand out!  You can't help but be touched deep in your heart when a young Scrooge left alone for the holidays at boarding school sings "A hand for each hand was meant for the world, why don't my fingers reach?  Millions of grains of sand in the world, why such a lonely beach?  Where are two heels to click to my clack, where is a voice to answer mine back?  I'm all alone in the world."  As a child, I remember it was at that point that I began to pity Ebenezer instead of loathing him.

Regardless of age or familiarity with the Magoo character, everyone will enjoy this holiday classic.  It's truly timeless.  My five year old God-daughter, her 30 year old mother (my niece) and I (40) watched it together recently when we got in a "Christmas In July" kind of mood and every one of us enjoyed it.  I'm happy to say that the 5 yr. old was singing about "Razzleberry Dressing" a week later!  I'm on Amazon to buy her the CD (title above) with the song.  The song is called "Lords Bright Blessings."
