(I viewed this film on the HD-DVD format).

This film is the most incredible visual experience you can ever imagine!  The racing scenes around Monaco at the begining of the film makes the best  Hollywood car chases look like a family drive to Sunday church.  One advantage they have over Hollywood car chases is that they can have a cameras located on the front of the car so you really get a feeling of speed. They can sustain the forward looking view for several minutes (entire laps) to give you the sense you are in the driver seat.  It is almost liked being in a roller coaster ride. A continous front camera views are much  harder to do in Hollywood films as they can only film in very short takes!

Amazingly innovative direction with very bold clever camera angles and special effects.

An intelligent plot and a charming love story between two intelligent people binds the film togeather.

But the car chases are the real star!!!

On HD this film is stunning!  I saw on HD-DVD and the transfer was amazing. I used the disc to demo my projector set up.  So I expect the Blu Transfer to be better!!!x
