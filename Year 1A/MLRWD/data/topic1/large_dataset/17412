Kikujiro is a fantastic movie that really surprised me.  I was curious to see what would happen when Takeshi "Beat" Kitano stepped outside of his usual role so I decided to rent it.  The story is interesting because it shows what happens to a tough guy who unexpectedly becomes responsible for a young boy's welfare.
The story uses a lot of symbology and fantastic departures from reality that give this movie an almost fairy tale feel, then moves to the reality that young children need to be provided food and shelter.  Many of the people that the two main characters run into seem to serve two roles, they all have their surface level interaction, but they all briefly take on a symbological role that show the similarities between the grown man and the young child.
It's very interesting how this movie is presented in an almost playlike fashion at some points.  This movie shrouds it's deep insights with a cute story of a gangster looking after a little boy.
I highly recommend this movie.
