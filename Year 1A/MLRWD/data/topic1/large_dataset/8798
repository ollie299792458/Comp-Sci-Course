I need to watch this film again, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews others wrote.  This is not a movie that goes with my popcorn.  This movie was not entertainment, but rather work!  It's castle location is splendid, and the actors are very pleasant because their personalities show through.  Enjoyed smiling at the poet's role (John Heard), and also enjoyed the charm of lost-Presidential-race-politician (Sam Waterston), but I felt sorry for all the WORK Liv Ullmann went to just to learn ALL those lines rather than what her character was saying, which took up the majority of the movie.  Perhaps I just don't care for so much philosophy outside the college classroom.  My summation: I'm probably not the audience to fully appreciate this kind of movie in the evening when concentration is ebbing.  I will, however, give it another try, if only to make myself feel brighter.  Perhaps other viewers will give this one a chance.  (MindWalk is part of the "Sam Waterston Library" that we're collecting.  We particularly appreciate his roles of the past 12 - 15 years rather than his earlier works.)
