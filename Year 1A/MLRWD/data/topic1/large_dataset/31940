I was expecting more from the director of Devil In A Blue Dress, Carl Franklin. Any diehard movie goer would be able to see where this movie is heading and how it is going to end. It appears Director Franklin doesn't appreciate the intellegence of his audience and lays in too many little give-aways. 
The story: Attorney Ashley Judd is married to a chap who has years earlier assumed a new identity to escape military justice. She discovers this interesting facet of his personality when the FBI jumps on them and takes him away to face murder charges at a military court martial. He is accused of killing citizens in a raid on a El Salvador village while in the Marine Corps. After reeling with shock that her husband is some other guy Ashley settles down and decides she will stand by him. Not only stand by him, but defend him. A court martial being out of her groove she contacts an attorney with military experience. Enter Morgan Freeman. Up to this point the story has been very good, leaving me wondering: "How would I deal with this situation? What would I do?" 
Now the movie shifts gears and the most interesting part is not the story which involves the court martial and dealing with the military mind, but the interaction between Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Ashley Judd is quite beautiful and charming and I am sure her best work is still ahead, but it is Morgan Freeman who commands your attention. He does not play that cool, confident character he does so well, rather he plays an achoholic in need of a haircut. A man with problems of his own. This is the best on-screen work he has ever done.(Aside: Wouldn't Bagger Vance have been a great film if Freeman had been the caddy?). 
The story warps and weaves its way to a very nice last scene that leaves a pleasent glow if you have watched the preceeding, so hang in there.
