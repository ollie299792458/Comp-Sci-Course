White Oleandar is a very "between the lines"  type of movie.  Very intense drama up front as Astrid deals with different foster homes.  She is the young daughter of a mother who kills her boyfriend.  It gives one a glimpse of the perils of the foster home system, yet, has an underlying message of a child who grows into a woman, and has to divorce herself from the controlling influence of her mother. I watched this movie again, in order to understand all of the underlying hidden messages.  It also has a wonderful cast.  Michelle Pffeifer is as usual strong and beautiful.  Allison Lohman who plays Astrid, is wonderful as a child of 12 maturing into a teenager, and a young woman.  I loved Robin Wright Penn as Starr, the jealous foster mother. Renee Zellwegger stands out as Claire, Astrid's second foster mother, who is loving, but insecure.  She also is a threat to Astrid's own mother, who is jealous of the relationship between Claire and her daughter.. I recommend this movie to anyone.  It is a classic... The book is just as good as the movie
