I've always been really into WWII history, my Grandfather served as a machine gunner and scout during the war, and as a kid I use to listen to him talk about his times in Europe.  I remember one winter when a snow storm came through and it was probably 15 degrees outside and snowing like heck and he said "this is damn cold, this reminds me of Bastogne."  I didn't know where Bastogne was or what it was, but later on after he passed away in 1999 I began to have a greater appreciation for what the men of 'The Greatest Generation' did, and I learned about Bastogne. That's why I love this movie.  The classic opening is what WWII was all about to me and why my Grandpa fought.  Gen. Patton is one of my personal heroes.  I look up to any man who can look the enemy in the eye and not flinch.  This is a great movie.  Although by modern standards (Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers) the action and special effects are somewhat dated, but the story is timeless.  It also has some great extras.  There is a documentary on Gen. Patton as well as an impressive photo gallery set to the soundtrack.  Then there is a special on one of the units that Gen. Patton comanded.  If you like/love this movie like me then you owe it to yourself to get this fine edition of a cinematic classic.
