I really enjoyed this film and have watched it several times and showed it to a lot of friends: it's nothing more or less than a ghost story set on a WWII submarine. The quality of the filming and CGI, the script pacing and character delineation is not quite super Hollywood level but it's better than the usual straight to video fare by a long shot and way way better than the sort of lame retread ghost story we're getting out of Hollywood right now. It has a story, sets out the basic premise, then proceeds to tell its story in assured strokes with superb character work from every actor. The computer-generated graphics are not greatly advanced beyond high quality video game level but that's not really a problem and it's satisfyingly creepy and cool to look at.  Nothing here is going to shake your world but it's an agreeable way to spend a few hours and if you're a ghost story fan like me (not just 'horror'. Ghost story. Big difference), it's a great addition to the genre of mystery based haunting tales like the Changeling and the Others. Star Trek fans should note the lead actor is Bruce Greenwood who played Christopher Pike from the latest film, doing the great work he always does.
