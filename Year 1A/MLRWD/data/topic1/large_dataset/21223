I love hood movies and as far as acting, writing, characters and sheer believeability go, this movie ranks way below films such as Boyz n the Hood, Juice, Clockers, ect.
Besides Ice T's (Scotty) and Snipes (Nino), all the other characters seemed so false. Even though those are the two main characters, if all your other characters arent believeable, the whole movie falls apart. The chief of police is like someone out of a cartoon. Chris Rock (Pookie) isnt funny and does his part no justice. Mario Van Peebles is a joke
Apparently a drug syndicate is able to take over and entire apartment building in NYC...for years!! Its amazing isnt it. They can ride up in a drop top jeep and shoot people point blank in the head in broad daylight and not get caught. The story is just so hard to swallow. 
Also the cinematography is really sub par. There is no artistry in any of the shots even in the dialogue. It also seems like the entire movie moves too fast for the events that are supposedly taking place. There are no subtle nuances at all in this film. I would say dont waste your time, the movie isnt really exciting at all, the performances are boring as is the plot. Go watch Juice.
