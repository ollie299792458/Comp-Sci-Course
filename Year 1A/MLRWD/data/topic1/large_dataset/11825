I had heard of Wolf's Rain, but found the concept of having wolve's as main characters rather different. But at the same time I found this VERY ORIGINAL, so I gave this DVD box batch a shot.
In the future, much of the Earth has become a hostile environment, and people now live in Dome style cities. Wolves have been thought to have been extinct for two hundred years, but in fact they've disguised themselves as humans. Kiba, a white wolf, begines a journy to search for paradise, taking with him new friends along the way.
This series is really off to a great start! Each of the main cast have their own very different personalities.
Kiba and the others aren't so much were-folk in a sense. They are still wolves, who 'camaflauge' themselves by creating a human appearance around them. They can do human things this way, but those who are very open minded can see through the illusion. Also, even while in human form, they still act like wolf's whether it's through their speech, or even their attitude or actions.
The music is another plus! Very emotional! I love the opening theme, as it has that 80s style rock to it. It's the kind of song that makes you feel good inside. The ending theme is also another plus, as it's very emotional. I almost felt like crying, for me it was very beautiful.
The animation is really great. Very detailed, clean, and evidence that the creators of the anime had money to spend.
This set comes with DVD 1, The DVD box case (For you to place the other DVDs in eventually), the Wolf's Rain soundtrack, and yes even a Plush of Kiba (For those who like cute things, hehe).
This is a great series that has now got me hooked. I can't wait to get the other DVDs as they come out. This series is VERY original! With a great dub cast, decent sub cast, with memorable characters, animation, and a great story. Unless you aren't a fan of Wolf's, this is a title you SHOULD NOT MISS! See this and get it when you can, you shouldn't regret it!
