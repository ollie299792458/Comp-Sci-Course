i have always wanted to learn belly dancing but can't afford a teacher so of course i turn  to the videos.  i have had several and enjoyed them but found myself getting lost. this one is different, at least  for me it is.  she has the video broken down in differant segments, so if you just want to work you arms one day and then work on shimmies the next you don't have to wade through a whole program to get to the section you want.  then you have a whole sections where you combine the movements you learned at the begging.  what i am trying to say is that i can work on just my foot movements until i have that down and then go to the section where is combine as multipal movemnts together. (that is where is usually get lost and fustrated). it's an added bonus for me that the instructer actually has curves, so i am not stuck watching a twig. it some how makes it more realistic and i feel more comfident about myself. it is SO worth the money and they shipped it to me in no time flat.  i got a great deal on this movie and since i have watched i would have [ayed more for it.
