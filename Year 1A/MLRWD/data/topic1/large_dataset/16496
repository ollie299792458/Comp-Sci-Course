All in all it's not a great movie.  I found the plot somewhat convoluted.  The acting is awful at times.  Most of the main characters are people I would not associate with but John Wintergreen (a young Robert Blake) was all right.  He had an overdeveloped sense of fairness, right and wrong that would eventually do him in.  The movie has a quirky personality.  At times it's intentionally funny but some of the great scenes are when it's unintentionally funny.  I liked the background music.  More than a few times it was perfectly suited as background for the associated scene.  The chase scenes were well done, at times overdone.  The raw, seedy side of the Southwest was the perfect backdrop for this movie.  I could almost smell the stale cigarette smoke, beer and urine.  The scenery was at times Kodak perfect.  Twenty-five years ago I really liked the last song - the one that plays over the credits. Today, I find it preachy and very 60's.  I'm surprised the movie has not achieved cult status.
