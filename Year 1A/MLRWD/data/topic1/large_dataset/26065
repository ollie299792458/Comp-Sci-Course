Whaaaat?  This was based on a true story??  That's like saying a zombie apocalypse that was filmed in Gettysburg is based on a true story just because it takes place in Gettysburg which just happens to be a real place, for example.  Get real!  Now come the spoilers.  To begin and end with, there is nothing--absolutely nothing--even remotely original about this movie.  Every clich&eacute;', from the fake anticipation of danger followed by the real thing, to the cannibal theme is mined to no great depth.  Ok, there is one scene, which would do Shakespeare proud:  our principals really DO exit out of a scene pursued by a bear.  Other than this unintentionally hilarious Scooby moment, it is non-stop stupidity.  The crowner is when one of the main characters spends the whole film swaggering around speaking his Russian and then ends up begging for his life in front of the local army in English.  Their guide has been doing this "tour" for 5 years and doesn't even suspect anything dangerous?  And why is the movie entitled "diary" when the format is not found footage, and there is nothing even remotely resembling a chronicle of any kind.  Not very surprisingly, the ending is also illogical junk.  There are far superior movies of this ilk out there such as The Descent and even C.H.U.D.  If you are really feeling brave, try an obscure classic called Tombs of the Blind Dead, which deals with the similar theme of strangers going into an abandoned village and getting way more than they bargained for.
