Although the actual touring Yes is the original lineup, this band showed it's more commercial stage when 90125's "Owner Of A Lonely Heart" took the mainstream by storm. One of the best selling albums of Yes . I consider this band to be the greatest band to ever play in this planet -in every stage and every way possible. Nevertheless the influence of younger guitarrist/composer/singer Trevor Rabin was one of the most powerful assets they had in mid-80's. This concert reflects it at it's fullest. It's "90125" album plus -for example... did you ever imagined how the "rock'n rollest" version of "I've Seen All Good People" could sound? Well here you have it. I love Steve Howe's playing, but Trevor Rabin has a more contemporary approach and sound which results in a very interesting musical combination with the rest of the well known and respected lineup. They edited it with some very interesting visual effects -if it's the same as "9012-live", the VHS.

In spite of a little playback on some songs, it's the best recording and edition of a Yes concert I've ever seen.

I've played my old VHS on "9012Live" so many times -the tape has become transparent.

It's very dissapointing to find the DVD it's listed but not available.... please, Amazon.com people... don't just stand there...do something please!!
