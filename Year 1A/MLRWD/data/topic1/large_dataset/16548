Well, Madame Em and her husband, Dr. Colonel Mr. Madame Em, actually suffered through what MAY be one of the worst movies ever made (but not "good" horrible, like "Plan Nine from Outer Space")...but HORRIBLE. And I am SURE many queer people who have an idiotic sense of "humor" thought it was "cute."

It SUCKED so bad, and it SHOULD have been called "The GHOST GROOM," because Michael Vartin, who plays Jennifer Lopez's soon to be groom, might as WELL have been invisible, for all he did, and was given to do, and how much he was in the movie, and how RETARDED his part was. It's like, who even cared he was there?

There was about as much chemistry between Michael Vartin and Jennifer Lopez, as.............let's say, Bea Arthur and Johnny Depp, but wait, maybe even THEY would have had more Chemistry..................sort of like, chemistry between Verne Troyer and Catherine Zeta Jones. Which means, MINUS 0 CHEMISTRY.

Oh, and Jane Fonda, what have you DONE? The ONLY redeeming thing is, she didn't resort to WHITE DIAMONDS lighting, as other aging stars do, she was filmed exactly like everyone else. I mean, Jane has a great body and she IS pushing 70, but she looked AWFUL. Screeching white teeth, old timey hair.....just............ugh.

And her son, Michael Vartin, was a DOCTOR, and I GUESS he had never HAD a girlfriend before Jennifer Lopez, and he was probably 35, which tells us something............

You see, Jennifer Lopez IS THE WORST ACTRESS IN THE WORLD, her head looks like it's been SQUASHED between two GIANT FLAT IRONS, because she has a flat face and a flat back of the head, however, she has a HUGE ASS which she refuses to hide, and HUGE THUNDER THIGHS, and kinda small boobs, which makes her sickening to look at. She's NOT talented, in ANY way, so Madame Em has J. Lo FIRST on the list of Deal Making with Satan. I can only hope the Devil calls in his due REALLY SOON.

Jennifer Lopez's "style" of acting is like......oh, say you pinch your nostrils together, and have a whiny, irritating, little girl, bad actress voice, and dialogue like "Oh, you SHOOT-ENT have!", or "Oh, you DIT-INT need to DOO that....oh.........you are TOOO sweet," but sound all nasally and completely insincere, and you've got her down.

Then, make her a real "go-getter" with three jobs, one of which is a professional Dog Walker, one of which is a Caterer's Assistant, and she secretly designs clothes on the side for nothing. Which is as it should be.

Then she meets that Ghost faced Michael Vartin, and their CHEMISTRY IS SO STRONG (not) and off we go!

Michael Vartin's Mother is Jane Fonda, a high powered Newswoman like Barbara Walters, who is fired for being OLD, and goes nuts and goes to SHADY MEADOWS after her meltdown,gets released because she's "all better", and decides to interfere in her only son's life EVEN more than she was before!

I can't IMAGINE that a man that old would not have had girlfriends who met his MOTHER and didn't go RUNNING for the hills, and tell EVERYONE that his Mother was LEGALLY INSANE and a potential murderess. How funny is that? HA HA HA!

So, Jennifer Lopez's character is named CHARLOTTE, but of course, her obligatory gay neighbor, who eyeballs all the cute guys in Lopez's life and makes gay wisecracks, and ANOTHER female fairly cute best friend, call her "Charlie" cause it's all cute and free and stupid.

And then, that mindless numbskull, Michael Vartin, dates "Charlie" for a few months, and then, takes her to visit his MOM, who is a legend of course, having interviewed Heads of States all over the world, I mean, you name them, she knows them.

And since Jane Fonda PRETENDS to like Jennifer Lopez, Michael Vartin PROPOSES right in front of his Mother, who is seething with killing hatred, and Charlie says "Yes, yes!

And off we go for one of THE MOST STUPID PLOTS, if you can CALL it that, of the EARTH.

Jane Fonda "pretends" to have a heart attack when they are all lunching, and gets to the Hospital, while, handily, she's HIRED AN ACTOR TO PLAY HER PSYCHIATRIST, and he "recommends" that Jane Fonda LIVE with Charlie and Michael Vartin until she is more "stable." RIIIIIIIIIIIIIGT. And all this time, Michael Vartin has NO FLIPPIN' IDEA HIS MOTHER IS A CONTROLLING EVIL WITCH who will stop at NOTHING to keep her son all to herself.

So, he has a "Medical Meeting" someplace REALLY FAR AWAY, and leaves his NEW FIANCEE with Jane Fonda, even though Charlie has been TELLING him that his Mother hates her, and is trying to break them up. He just says "Oh, Charlie, Mother is just eccentric. I'm sure she loves you! Who couldn't?"

WHAT AN IDIOT.

Of course, Jane Fonda has her black Pearl Baily-like ASSISTANT around for all the usual "wisecracks" and "Asides," such as "Um Um Um...that girl don't know WHAT she gettin' INTO!" Or, "You SURE you want to do this to your OWN son? He look HAPPY to me!" TO which Jane Fonda treats this woman like a SLAVE and basically tells her to shut the Hell up and do as she's told, WHICH SHE DOES.

So, Jane Fonda decides she will drive Jennifer Lopez INSANE. I cannot type all the INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING and idiotic things that transpire, even when Jane Fonda DRESSES UP LIKE GHENGIS KHAN with those pointy metal things on her fingers FOR NO REASON, but it's bad. She runs background checks on Charlie, has DNA testing on Charlie's HAIR. (For what? What is she looking for? We never know).

She cooks her poison food when she realizes that Charlie is allergic to PEANUTS, which of course could KILL her, but Charlie just gets swollen lips and vows to fight Jane Fonda, with pesky little things like replacing Jane Fonda's regular pills with PILLS SO STRONG THEY COULD KILL HER, and letting Jane Fonda pass out FACE DOWN IN SOUP, which in REAL LIFE, WOULD have killed her because she wouldn't have been able to flippin' BREATHE.

Then, the wedding day, and they are slapping each other and Michael Vartin is still OBLIVIOUS, and Charlie tells Jane Fonda to "Bring it on, Grandma", which shows SUCH CLASS, and then, Jane Fonda's MOTHER shows up for the wedding, treats JANE FONDA like HUMAN GARBAGE, and ALL OF A SUDDEN CHARLIE SEES why poor Jane Fonda is such a CRAZY BITCH, they forgive each other instantly, Jane Fonda becomes a complete other person, all meek and sorry, and the marriage happens, and the end.

If you want puke or get really pissed off, watch this movie. It's MUCH worse than this review. You just HAVE to see it.
