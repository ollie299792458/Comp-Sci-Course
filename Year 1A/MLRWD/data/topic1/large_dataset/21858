I read the other reviews of this movie and I just have to comment that it wasn't that bad at all.  First, let me mention that it is definitely a "chick flick", so all who don't like movies like that, stay clear.  But to me, I actually liked Kevin Costner in this movie.  He wasn't his usual boring self.  He was very funny and lovable as the supposedly cad that slept with the Mother and Grandmother.  Jennifer Anniston has gotten a pretty bad rap for always reverting back to her Rachel character, but I think people should get over that and stop always thinking of her as Rachel.  I like the stuff she's been doing lately.  Shirley McLain is hysterical as the Grandmother. The movie is good and it is funny.  It is totally predicatable, but after all isn't that what a "romantic comedy" is?  Overall, it wasn't bad, I thought it was pretty good actually. My advice is just don't go see it on a date with a guy, go with a girlfriend or someone like you who loves romantic comedies and if you're renting the DVD, rent it on a night when u just want to curl up alone in a comfortable pair of PJs with a pint of Haagan-Daz and watch a good "chick flick" or better yet, buy it and put it in your "chick flick" pile. That's what I did. I give this film 2 thumbs up :)
