Plenty of reviewers bash this flick for all the usual valid reasons...which in turn proves that they themselves are simply retreads of old ideas. Yea, there isn't much new in this film, and the writing, acting and directing are all pure B-movie quality. So what?!? All these faults are equally present in the highest grossing film of all time- TITANIC! OK, maybe the boat's director is higher caliber...granted. But taken for what it is, 'The Car' is a good time, with a few unique moments that were still fresh in my mind 20 years later, before the VHS and DVD re-release came out. Things like the musician's belief the driver would be a babe that would ruin his back..in a good way. Or the Car's frustration at being unable to enter the cemetary...it actually LOOKS angry about it! Then there's the 'rolling-pin-two-cop-car-squash' stunt...the sound of the car's exhaust and horn...and the cheesy-but-spooky face in the fire at the end. You won't need a thesaurus to decode the deep dialogue....the acting won't rival Sir Lawrence Olivier. But it sure beats two hours spent watching ANYTHING available on TV today!! WooHoo.....drop the hammer, and let's go run over a few innocent pedestrians!
