Finally, Sandra Bullock has acted in a good film!  Ever since I saw her in 'Speed', I always thought that she was a talented actress.  But then 'While you were sleeping' and 'Hope floats' were thoroughly cliched and made me wonder if she was just a one-film wonder.  Well, she did prove me otherwise in 'Murder by numbers'.
If you thought from the title or the trailer that this film is about a serial killer, you are wrong (I did that same mistake too!).  This film is about the perfect crime or what the killer(s) think will be a perfect crime.  As is the case with all killers, they do one simple mistake and that is enough for Casey (the cop played by Sandra Bullock) and her partner Sam to solve the case.  
Even though there is no actual suspense in the film, I will not spoil the plot by telling who the killers are.  The director does not attempt to hide the identity of the killers, it is fairly clear who the killers are right from the first or second scene.  In spite of this, the film continues to gather momentum, with Sandra Bullock and her partner doing their detective work meticulously.  Where the film lacks in suspense, it more than makes up for it in the tight story-line and the excellent acting by all the actors.
Sandra Bullock is very convincing as the troubled cop who has a checkered history of her own and that comes to light as the film progresses.  Ben Chaplin, who plays Bullock's partner Sam is good too, but the best acting in the film comes from the two young men played by Ryan Gosling (who plays Richard) and Michael Pitt (who plays Justin).  Gosling is nothing less than brilliant in his portrayal and his future as an actor sure looks bright.
The film drags a bit towards the end, with the climax being a bit cliched.  But this is surely a film that is worth seeing!
