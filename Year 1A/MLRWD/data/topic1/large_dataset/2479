This film has maybe the cleverist, smoothest, and fulfilling script of all time.  The dialogue and the what you learn about the characters from the dialogue is unbelievable (Steinbeck but faster and lighter).  The film as a  whole is also delightful.  Nothing but pure enjoyment here.  This film can  say and mean alot to anyone so stating one meaning is purposeless (and I'm  not the kind of person who says that all the time).  The only thing I  disagree with with the reviews below is how many people said Kinear was  better than Nicholson.  Kinear was touching and graceful and yes should  have recieved the oscar but Nicholson was pure genius.  Just try to mimic  what he did without looking like a jackass.  He played one of the most  difficult roles in history to perfection.  I was never a Nichoslon fan  until I saw this movie (the only other thing I saw him in was that piece of  sh*t, A Few Good Men) but this performance compelled me to follow up one  his acting and now I am convinced he is one the the greatest film actors  ever.
