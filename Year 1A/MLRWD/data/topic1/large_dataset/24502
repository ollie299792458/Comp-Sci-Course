Naturally this movie has all the makings of a great action movie. There is little doubt that it fulfills those expectations. I just wish Hollywood would do some research instead of assuming that all Hispanics are Mexican. And by that I mean the comment the Russian makes upon finding his partner in a tortilla bin. He states, "It must be a Cuban tradition to use a tortilla bin." There are probably more tortilla bins in Russia then there are in Cuba. Cubans, like most Latin American countries, do not eat Mexican cuisine, and do not use Tortillas, or tacos, or quesadillas, or any of that in their food. Hollywood being ignorant and in southern California made a rediculous mistake with that one. Only a few of Latin American countries make tortillas, and Cuba isn't one of them. They made the same mistake when they had the guards playing soccer. Sure some Cubans do play soccer, but baseball is their main sport, and you would be more likely to find guards in America playing soccer, because even though the sport isn't highly regarding in America, it is still far more popular than it is in Cuba. Amatuerish mistakes on the film maker's part, which demontrate his ignorance of life outside his own borders.
