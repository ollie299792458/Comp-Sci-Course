I first saw this as a video store clerk when it first came out on VHS. I was intrigued by the title and description of the movie. I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino back then, and most people I knew circa the early 90's didn't either; but there's no question about the fact that, after seeing this movie, I became a huge fan. Soon after, Tarantino's other films such as True Romance, and especially Pulp Fiction, put his films on the map of "must see" movies.
There are so many things to like about the movie. The dialogue, the directing, the plethora of memorable and classic scenes, etc. In an industry of re-treads and unoriginality, this movie really epitomizes the meaning of "cool" and brought originality and quality story-telling back to Hollywood.
From the "Like a Virgin" discussion, to the "I don't tip" issue, to the "I don't wanna be Mr. Pink" dissent, to the classic "ear" scene...the witty dialog never seems to stop.
If you're looking for an original, hip, heist-gone-wrong movie with great characters and star performances check this one out.
