The Hiding Place has always been one of my favorite books; I first read it as a young teenager, and I come back to it over and over. I saw the film years ago on TV and had been unable to find it on DVD till now. The film necessarily has to leave out large sections to fit in the running time for a movie; but they also took quite a bit of articistic license in completely changing the personalities and behaviors of some of the characters. They turned Eusi the Jew into an obnoxious snob, and the prison nurse was also represented very differently than she was described in the book. Even so, this film is still moving--both heartbreaking and uplifting.  I've read other reviews that mention horrible picture and sound quality.  I did not have any issues with sound--I can hear all the dialogue very well.  Naturally the picture quality is not what you would see from a film today--this film is decades old.  Even so, I do not recall any scenes that were so dark or such poor quality that I could not see the characters or sets, like I read in one review.  I may have a different version or release than that person had.  For when it was filmed and the alotted time it has to run, the movie still does a good job of portraying the WW2 experience of the Ten Booms.  It's an inspiring and emotional story that can benefit anyone, religious or not, and I would encourage viewers to read the book for an even better appreciation of what the Ten Booms, and so many others, went through.
