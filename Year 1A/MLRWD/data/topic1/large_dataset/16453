<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079215455X">Days of Heaven</a>Days of Heaven, released by Paramount Pictures in 1978 is a breathtaking beautiful film. Richard Gere is the brother, Brooke Adams is his girlfriend {they tell everyone they are brother and sister], and Linda Manz as Geres real younger sister.  They travel across the country looking for different types of workand finally get hired on working in the wheat fields.  Sam Shepherd owns the farm where they work and is immediately taken with Adams.  You see Shepherd is sick and is dying so Adams agrees to marry him expecting upcoming wealth with his passing.  Except he starts getting better.  Enough of the storyline because that definately takes a backseat to the beautiful Oscar winning cinematography of Nestor Almendros.  One of the most beautiful films ever.  Credit must be given to Director Terrence Mallick, Whose only previous feature 'BADLANDS' another excellent film.  Mallick I think is a genius.  There is very little dialogue, the film relies on imagery and music to tell a simple-very simplestory masterfully.  Linda Manz and Sam Shepherd stand out in the cast but adams and Gere are good as well.  Directed by Terrence Mallick.  Color.  94 minutes.  Rated PG.  Paramount
