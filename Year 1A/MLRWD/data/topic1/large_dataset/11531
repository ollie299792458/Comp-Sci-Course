It's a cliche in Science Fiction film circles to bang on about how 'Forbidden Planet' is a space opera version of 'The Tempest' (OK, it is...) but it's not yet a given that this superb version of Bill Stratford's 'Richard III' (No, star wars fans, there are no Richard I or II movies) is best enjoyed as a SF film.
To quell the outraged Bard purists, I'll admidt this is just one way of viewing the film: Richard III is a brilliant play per se and any version with Ian McKellen would be welcome. But watching the Duke of York's humourously cackling villiany in the setting oif an alternate fascist 30s Britain is sheer joy...this classic tale adapts well to its Moseleyesque sets and design, which threaten to dwarf a nonetheless brilliant cast (even the Americans are excellent - no xenophobia implied, but the accents you guys have don't always cut it in English drama). The music is perfect also, jaunty 30s big band jazz and the climax sees Bosworth replaced by Battersea Power Station, which is sheer genius...'My kingdon for a horse,' yells Sir Ian, clutching his machine pistol like the blackguard he is.
Aside from the superb speculative setting, worthy of comparison with the great alternative history SF novels (Pavane, The Alteration, The Man In The High Castle, Bring The Jubilee), McKellen himself is brilliant, projecting the black humour of Richard's cartoon nastinness superbly, capering and grinning like the mad anti-Quasimodo he is.
So if you're in the mood for anti-fascist alternative history, don't bother to watch 'Fatherland', go for this instead....
