Of all the movies I've seen about the life of Christ, including the recently released "Gospel according to John" by the same company, this one stands out the most in my mind.  This portrail of Jesus is one of a living man, not a stiff person who merely died on a tree.  It helped me tremendously in my understanding of the Bible, so much so, I have bought the DVDs when they're on sale here to give to friends.
The costumes and acting are very well done, and the actor who plays Jesus helps the viewer realize that his life was not only about the sacrifice for all, but about love.  This is the New International Version word for word.  Not one word is interjected into the script, and it's absolutely amazing that it could be acted out with such continuity.  Even the "begats" (the lineage part most of us skim over) had some memorable moments.
I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the life of Christ, or who is tired of hearing that God is all about punishment and wrath.  "What you have done for the least of these you have done for me".  "I tell you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you".
You might even get the impression He has a sense of humor.
