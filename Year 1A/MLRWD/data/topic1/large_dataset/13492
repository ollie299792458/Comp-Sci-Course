To start with, I'm tired of those idiots who give away an entire plot, instead of just reviewing the movie. Every movie I check out, there's at at least 5 morons who give away everything, and don't even talk about the movie (yes, it's possible). So, with that, read on if you're still interested.

This movie is categorized as either thriller/horror. I would say that it's more of an action-adventure/thriller. Sure, you'll see blood and gore, but for the most part, this is an edge-of-your-seat-action ride of a movie. If it helps, I would say that this movie has more action than your typical action movie. If you took your typical movie, with around 2 hours of screen time, and cut out all the unnecessary BS, and jacked it full of action, then you would get "The Hitcher".

The plot does seeem simple, and the unknown actors do not give the greatest performance, but the movie is still awesome, no matter what. If you're tired of the current state of horror genre movies, from the past 8 years, then you might take a liking to this movie. Whereas your typical so called thriller/horror movies follow the same, lame predictable story line, this does things just a little differently. Plus, the production, camera angles, and camera shooting are all top-notch. This is a movie that is not painful to watch because it wasn't shot properly, or the sound was off. Film production was done right. As you might notice from the other reviewers, the complaints are all about the story, and not the film production.

The Bottom Line: Kick-a** movie that you'll watch over and over again, defintely a surprise hit for me. I didn't expect any new movie to be this good.

NOTE: The extra features include behind the scenes, and making of footage, for those who want it.
