In the opening scene, the character Nikita utters the simple phrase "J'en veux" several times. Each time, however, the DVD gives a different translation: "Gotta have it", "You have it?" Never does the real translation appear: "I want it." This simple, yet aggravating, translation problem seems to characterize the quality of the DVD as a whole. 
Nonetheless, the movie is fantastic. Luc Besson directs a thriller action movie, one which everyone can enjoy. The acting is superb, the special effects are great, and the plot is utterly compelling. This is not a movie to be missed. 
While the VHS version has a better translation, the DVD has better picture quality. Which do you prefer? ...We can only hope that a special edition will be released in the near future. 
On the plus side, the English voice-overs seem to be much better than those normally included with foreign titles. (I've only watched the opening scene with the dubbed soundtrack, however. I prefer subtitles.)
If you're interested in other foreign action movies, check out Nowhere to Hide. Although this new Korean movie is more artistically oriented than the average American action movie, it is outstanding.  
As for La Femme Nikita, the movie is definitely worth 5 stars, but the DVD deserves only 2.
