This classic is indeed timeless and will gladly go on forever!

A fervent story of one man's inhumanity to others and to himself, and of his learning the ultimate lesson in compassion and charity.

Apart from the Sim's version, there have been other versions starring well-known actors such as Geoge C Scott, Patrick Stewart, Henry Winkler, Reginald Owen, and others.  While the other variations are excellent in their own right (e.g., Reginald Owen's opening scene with his nephew or George C Scott's Ghost of Christmas Present), none compare to the transformation energetically espoused by Sim!  One of the best scenes is happy-go-lucky Sim boyishly chasing his maid to give her a Christmas present!

For those who have read the book, the Sim's version is great, especially his time with the Ghost of Christmas Present and all the places they visit, seeing Christmas cheer and happiness across the globe (which is usually not in other versions).

B&W or color - the Sim's version is a keeper for the lovers and collectors of this timeless tale.
