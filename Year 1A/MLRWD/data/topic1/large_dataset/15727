"Return of the Jedi" is as good as any of the "Star Wars" films, and is perhaps the most moving one. Of course the film is packed with the usual action, as well as the humor that made the first three films so charming and which is sometimes lacking in the more recent efforts. This one has a big job to perform, tying up all the strands of plot and giving us the climactic confrontation between Luke Skywalker and the forces of the dark side. It succeeds well - there is some real drama and emotion to these scenes, exceeding that of the usual science fiction fare. (Maybe it's a bit corny, but it works.) I am also very fond of the early scenes of the movie, which take place at the lair of Jabba the Hutt, a fat blob who runs a den of sin that is hugely amusing. Some fans may grow tired of the cutesy Ewoks later in the film, little teddy bear things that probably rank just above Jar Jar Binks in the saga's popularity. However, the Ewoks are crucial to the plot - indeed, without them, the rebel mission would be a failure. Their simple-hearted efforts are able to overcome the sinister advanced technologies that are pitted against them, and this message is actually rather inspiring. Overall this is a very entertaining film, and a memorable one.
