Many of the horror/sci-fi movies of the 80's look outdated today in an age of CGI and non stop action sequences. I'm glad to say that AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is one of the few films of that era and genre that holds very well even today. At the core of things is the good story: 2 american boys on a hitch hiking holiday across northern Europe where they ultimately find their fate. One thing that stands out is the dialog: it's not some over dramatized sermon; it actually sounds like the type of things two young guys would say given the film's situations. By doing so, some of the scenes come off as "funny", but I wouldn't say this is a "comedy", even though it was directed by comedy maestro John Landis (Blues Brothers, Animal House). When the violence gets going it gets pretty ugly, even by today's standards. The Special FX (by Make Up Guru Rick Baker) earned this film an Academy Award. The movie moves at a nice pace and it never gets boring, something that, sadly enough, did not happen in the "other" werewolf movie, THE HOWLING, who despite this, was another landmark in Special FX.

The DVD contains the vastly superior DTS sound, which will make this a joyride. The DTS mix is loud and proud and makes every tiny detail stand out. Also of mention is the crisp and clear video transfer, a vast improvement over the VHS version.

You will do no wrong in owning this film. Not only it is an important history lesson, but it's also one hell of an entertaining horror film.
