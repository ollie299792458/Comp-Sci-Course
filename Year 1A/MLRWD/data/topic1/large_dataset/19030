These are NOT edited..let me explain. The only fans who will notice bits missing are USA fans because the MR BEANS when shown in the USA were done on a tv station without commercials, opposed to in the UK where they were shown with ad breaks. Because of this the USA tv station requested extra material to be put in to pad them out to the required length. The production company obliged, put in little bits n bobs to stretch them and so when this release came out, comprising of the official versions..shown everywhere else in the world they thought they were edited. Essentially although slightly different to the USA broadcast versions, these ARE the way Rowan Atkinson intended them to be viewed, the oddments which were added to the USA episodes as a necessity were considered surplus to requiremenrs, inferior in many cases and left on the cutting room floor. OK, so perhaps these scenes could have been included as extras..outtakes for example..or even the extended episodes used for this release BUT I dont think its any major crime, Rowan Atkinson decided these were what he wanted broadcast in the UK/Europe etc and thats good enough for me. Basically only USA fans will notice any change, and even then just slight changes...all in all this is a great set, cheap and VERY funny.
