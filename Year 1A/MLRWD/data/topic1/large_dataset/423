I am sorry that I said some things that might have offended one reviewer regarding this-here movie, I am so sorry. Maybe I even offended more than one, by calling kenneth branaugh an overly pretentious,artsy-fartsy bald-faced ham, and for correctly pointing out that deniro has about as much acting range as Rin Tin Tin; constantly playng the same role over and over again. I didnt mean to offend Rin Tin Tin either, by implying that deniro had his acting range. And I dont blame that reviewer one bit for turning me in so many times like he did, he loves this film so. I deserve to be shot for criticising it, thats what.
  I am especially apologetic over my assertion that previous positive reviewers of this flik couldnt tell a certain body part of theirs from a hole in the ground: I am fairly certain that they really can tell it apart from a hole in the ground. But I was upset to hear that the poor reviewer was so offended by that remark. I take it back. I dont wish to cause offense.
But I bet I didnt offend even one billionth of a percent as many people as did kevin Branaugh, Robert deniro, and whoever ELSE may have been responsible for the travisty that is being called "Mary Shelleys Frankenstein". And THEY also offend the very author of the book; converting her classic of literature into barely-literate SMUT! Yes, I am so sorry. I am sorry that I ever wasted my time BUYING this DVD. I apologise to my poor eyeballs, that I forced them to stay open for the first 20 minutes of this film, when they so wanted to be closed. And I apologise to my poor trashcan -that I used it to deposit this waste of "talent" in: I am so sorry mr trashcan, you were my last resort though-bekuz the disc might have got stuck in the TOILET, where it REALLY belongs
