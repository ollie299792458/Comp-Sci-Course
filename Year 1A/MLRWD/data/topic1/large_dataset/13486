I first paid attention to this movie because of the name, the second Clash song I ever heard (the first being the single
"White Riot") and this song was the lead off of their first album.

Then when I saw it featured Abigail Breslin and Elisabeth Shue it turned into a must see picture.

The picture is about an on the way down career-wise, jerk of a R & R singer that meets up again with a female (Elisabeth Shue)and her 13 year-old daughter (Abigail Breslin), the daughter supposedly from a one night stand with him years before.

The film really caught my attention at this point, because in the 70's & 80's I was on the road with many Bands, most months of the year and had written this screenplay in my mind, but starring me and it was a horror picture, but I digress...

Ms. Shue was only in the film a few minutes,but it was nice seeing her. Abigail is growing up fast and she's really very talented and the kid can sing too.

I enjoyed the movie and I enjoyed the Rock touring stuff, the crappy tour bus and the lousy clubs all rang true to me.

It's a very worthwhile Picture

It has a 5.1 and a 2 track soundtrack and audio commentary by the director and producers. Also an interview with the people that made the film.
