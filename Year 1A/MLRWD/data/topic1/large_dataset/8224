It took long enough for 20th Century-Fox to give us a DVD release of HELLO DOLLY, but boy it was worth the wait.  At last, DOLLY the way it was meant to be seen, in Widescreen and Stereo.  This movie is one of the best DVD transfers of an older film that I have ever seen.  The beautifully restored picture is heads above the previous VHS releases.  The crystal clear stereo soundtrack is equally as impressive.  Additionally, the Intermission/Entr'acte music and the Exit Music, which I believe were not on the VHS versions, are here as well.  The only thing that this DVD comes up short on is the extra features.  As usual, we have a theatrical trailer.  There is also a short 1969 featurette, which is nice, but we would like to have perhaps seen a "making of" documentary with surviving cast members (Streisand and Crawford, as well as Tommy Tune and others), or something to that effect.  Oh well... This DVD is still top-notch.  The restoration efforts alone make this DVD a necessary addition to your musicals collection.  Now we just need a restored and expanded relese of the original soundtrack album.
