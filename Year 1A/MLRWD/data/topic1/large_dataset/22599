Despite what the title might suggest, "Enigma" is not so much about codebreaking as it is about the relationship between the main character, played by Scott and his missing girlfriend. The movie is centred about the missing girl and the codes that she has stolen.
I enjoyed the many twists and turns that the plot presented. The audience never quite knew what was coming next. Unfortunately the first half of the movie is quite slow and tedious. I don't really understand the role of Kate Winslet's character I think it was poorly portrayed and rather superfluous to the film.
The second half of the film is very gripping. However, certain aspects of the plot are difficult to grasp and at times the plausability of the film is stretched. Codebreaking is given a cursory overview and those expecting lots of action will be disappointed. The extras in the film include biographies and interviews that are worthwhile.
In all honesty I cannot recommend this film except perhaps to World War II buffs.
