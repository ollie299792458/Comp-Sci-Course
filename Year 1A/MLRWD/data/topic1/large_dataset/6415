The plot of this movie is a rich couple(Bo Derek/Rob Lowe)

set out get rich by having Big Tom(Brian Dennehey) marry

Beverly(Bo Derek) and have her divorice him and take half

of everything he owns. Then Big Tom dies at the wedding

putting his company in a huge bind. With a unproven break

pad division, they are unable to get a loan to prevent

having to see the company to another company. So Tommy

Boy(Chris Farley) decides to give up his half of the

stock in order to get the loan.

A catch is that Tommy Boy and Richard(David Spade) must

go out on the road and sell thousands of break pads to

keep the company going. That is where the fun starts.

Tommy Boy being the son of a rich father always got

what he wanted and never really made an effort to get

smart so Richard picks on Tommy Boy 3/4 of the movie

because of his ignorance for the business and the fact

that Tommy doesn't take live very seriousally.

We are treated to several sarcastic jokes and scenes

with Tommy making a total fool of himself. Like I said,

this is a movie that you really start to care less and

less about the plot as the comedy just takes over. Chris

Farley and David Spade just have such chemistry in this

movie. They tried to capture it again with alittle less

success in Black Sheep, which really is the same as this

movie with a slighty different plot. It just didn't have

the charm that Tommy Boy had.
