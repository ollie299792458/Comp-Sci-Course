If you are a fan of animation and anti-cultural atmopshere, then you will love Heavy Metal. Forget about the recently released Heavy Metal 2000 (...) and nab a copy of this well done DVD.
Sure it is from 1981, but like a fine wine, it just keeps on getting better with age. I have owned this DVD for over a year now and I am glad I made that decision. Heavy Metal succeeds for these reasons:
1. Top Rate Voice Overs: Second City Alumni John Candy, Harold Ramis, and Joe Joe Flaherty.
2. Unmatched Music: Ever hear of Cheap Trick, Devo, Black Sabbath, and Blue Oyster Cult? If you are a fan of either of those bands or their style, you will agree that the musical ambience rocks.
3. Out of this world scenes: Ranging from a deadbeat cab driver to a kid who wants to get laid to a world saving heroine, Heavy Metal paved the way for many animation artists and it shows.
So in the end, if you want an out of this world movie that has nudity and swearing (not the main reasons to get it) then do yourself a favor and experience Heavy Metal today!
