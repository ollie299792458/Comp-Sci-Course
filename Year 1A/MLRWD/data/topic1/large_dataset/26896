I paid a dollar to see this movie.  Since this second run theater opened at my apartment complex, it's hard to justify not seeing a movie.  I mean, it's a dollar, so who cares?  This is probably the first time I've walked out of the theater feeling like I had just wasted an afternoon.  It's not the dollar I miss--it's the 90 minutes.

The casting was fantastic.  Tara Reid as an archeologist?  Sure.  But I'll only believe it if she wears black glasses and her hair is up.  The chemistry between Reid and Slater was also fantastic.  The sex scene barely seemed unnatural.  Seriously, why was that scene left in?  Who had that great idea?  I'm a little sad I didn't wait to see this on dvd, because I would be interested in seeing the deleted scenes.  If they left the awkward-out-of-nowhere sex scene in, what did they take out?

Probably the "best" part was the writing.  A lot of reviews credit the awkwardness to the actors.  Sure, they might be partly to blame, but they can only do so much with what they're given.  When there's a lot of awkwardness, the director and writers deserve some of the "credit."  The first scene with Tara Reid should be viewed in every writing class taught from now until the end of time.  The heavy-handed revealing of background information in that conversation set the tone for the rest of the movie.

After wasting 90 minutes of my afternoon, I came home to read the reviews.  The 5-star one liners are more laughable than the movie.  I hope to God they written by someone associated with the studio or the actors.  (Is it a coincidence that two of those reviewers also gave "Are We There Yet?" 5 stars?)
