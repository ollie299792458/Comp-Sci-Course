And here is another movie which I decided not to watch when it first came out. I just watched it on dvd and it was a beautiful film. The scenery, the custumes, and the palace of Siam was just breath-taking. And the characters were very memorable, and there are plenty of them in this movie. I normally don't like Jody Foster, but she was great in this movie. Chow Yun Fat was great as well. He is a great Chinese actor and this movie reveals his charisma and ability to carry a movie better than Crouching Tiger. I have completely misjudged the film before watching it. This movie, contrary to my expectation, is very different than "King and I" movie of the 60's.

Some reviewer complained that this movie is a non-fiction. This kind of  criticism really bothers me. Aren't most movies fictions? This is a movie, not a documentary for crying out loud. As a fictious story, based on an historical event, it was great. But if you want to watch a movie that is over 90% accurate to the historical facts, this one is not for you. Also, although there is no violent war scenes, there are violent/brutal scenes like blowing a guy's head and chopping off a female's head, which would bother some people. I personally felt it was too violent for this kind of movie and should have been left out. Don't have to be so graphic to make a point. That's my only criticism.
