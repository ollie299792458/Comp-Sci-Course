The film was a good portrait of Richard M Nixon.  Nixon was paranoid and portrayed as a MacBeth like-figure, minus a prodding wife.  Joan Allen does well as the reluctant, then content, then exhausted Pat Nixon.  The supporting cast was good.  Nixon does not villify the man, like some thought or feared.  The film was made about the time Nixon died.  There are political implications, and what-ifs, and the usual Oliver Stone conspiracy theories.  Nixon dodging the JFK Assassination by minutes, along with CIA Director Richard Helms reminding Nixon on the numerous coups and intelligence operations that he signed off on.  Did Richard Nixon really know what he signed onto?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Let's not forget Bob Hoskins' portrayal of FBI Founder and Director J Edgar Hoover.  Conspiracy theories on how MLK and Bobby Kennedy could be drawn from Hoover and Clyde Tolson venting rage at a horse track.  The film's start was OK, and obviously showed Watergate as a part in a series of dirty tricks and internal spying.  The film was good.  I wonder what a movie on George W Bush would be like?  I doubt they'd get Michael Moore to direct it.  Oliver Stone would be good, despite recent clunkers like U-Turn and Any Given Sunday.  Stone did a decent follow-up to JFK, which I liked better.
