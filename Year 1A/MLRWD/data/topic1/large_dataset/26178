I watched this movie on a recent plane journey and ended up crying on the plane! I had to buy it so I could watch it again and share with friends. To be honest I hadn't heard about this film and the trailer I watched didn't do it justice but since there was nothing else I wanted to watch, and I respect Jodie Foster as an actor and director, I felt it could hold merit.
I was right! This movie had me in from the beginning and kept me thinking throughout. Having suffered depression myself for a long time I could totally relate to Mel Gibson's performance, and wished I had a beaver to do my talking for me!
I think this movie should be watched by all those who know of depression and of friends or family who suffer depression. I believe the word "depression" is a misnomer for this condition/disease. People who have never felt it are apt to brush it off as an excuse, but for those of us who struggle to get out of bed every day it is very real, and my response to those who don't believe in depression as an illness is to say, if you think it is so darn easy to just "cheer up" don't you think I would have by now?!! It's not like one chooses to feel that way.
The characters in this family gave a very real and believable interpretation of the script and Mel Gibson, dare I say it, was superb in this film and made me remember that he really is a good actor. Jodie Foster, as always, was brilliant in her role as the long suffering wife.
There is the odd moment that was a little confusing in the telling, but otherwise I found this a very thought provoking and surprisingly enjoyable film and not as "depressing" as you may think!!
