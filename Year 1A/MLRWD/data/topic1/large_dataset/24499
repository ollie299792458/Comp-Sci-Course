Brotherhood dramatically captures the sttruggle between good and evil inherent in all of us.  The brothers Caffee embody the everyday angst that may haunt most of us.  Michael, played by Jason Isaacs, the returned, dark brother tries mightly, despite his amoral criminal life, to be the "good" son, brother, uncle, etc.

Tommy, played by Jason Clarke, with his desire to serve his constituency, can not seem to repel the forces that beckon him to a darker side.

Eileen, brilliantly portrayed by Annabeth Gish, Tommy's wife, struggles with her own demons, while trying to be the ideal wife and mother.

Fionulla Flanagan, as the matriarch of the family, is reviting--powerful, sexy, and meancing, all at the same time.

Filmed in Providence, this series captures the working class neighborhoods of the U.S.  Its sights, sounds, and feelings are captured beautifully on film.

Blake Edwards has depicted this classic Ameerican struggle with a script that is both griltty and spell binding.

Brotherhood is a must see--must have.
