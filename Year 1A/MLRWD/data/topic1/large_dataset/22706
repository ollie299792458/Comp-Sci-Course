I enjoyed watching this movie over 55 years ago, when it was already vintage.  However, I was too young to understand the social/political aspects of it, based in the Depression experience.

This is a feel-good movie about a household of "eccentric" characters, Jean Arthur's family, which includes Lionel Barrymore of the great theatrical family, Spring Byington (remember "December Bride?"), and a very young Ann Miller(purely zany and none of her great tapping).  They have several roomers and pooling resources seems to be the way they all support their belief that everyone should only do what they love to do.  I don't know if that was true for the African-American characters (including Eddie "Rochester" Anderson who used Jack Benny as his straight man), but it was another era.

Jimmy Stewart, the son of a wealthy and greedy banker (Edward Arnold), falls in love with Jean Arthur (his secretary) and his determination to marry her leads to an amusing and telling clash in social perspective and values.  Frank Capra directed this with his light and amused touch and created a gem, an ironic comment on the income gap that speaks to us today.
