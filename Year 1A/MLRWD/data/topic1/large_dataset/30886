That's exactly the treatment this forgotten gem is afforded on this bare bones DVD release.

Though I was ecstatic to finally see a clean DVD come out (My pathetic AMC recorded VHS was getting pretty crinkly), I was a bit disappointed to see it not given the treatment it deserves.
The aspect ratio is too tight, maybe correct width, but much loss along the bottom of the picture.  And if any strange, belated journey of an internationally co-produced ode to epic end of the world flicks of the 1950's to the screen should be told... Crack in the World is it!  Sigh...  Maybe?... Hell, no.  Seriously doubt any future definitive edition will happen, given the continued demise of physical media (damn you, digital download streaming, on demand crap!).

So, I guess this will have to suffice. It is better than anything available before and at a fair price.

So, I am thankful to own it.  If you have never seen Crack in the World, and you are a fan of 1950's End of the World AND 1970's disaster epics, you will dig this.  Trust me.
