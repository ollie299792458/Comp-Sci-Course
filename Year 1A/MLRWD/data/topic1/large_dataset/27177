I'm David Shaber's daughter, Sam, (Samantha.)  My father wrote the screenplay for The Warriors, and I'm hoping this "review" gets printed because he just passed away on Thursday morning, November 4th, of a  sudden burst anneurism. With so many "Warriors" fans out there, I  thought you would want to know.  I'm incredibly warmed by these wonderful  comments about this film and I know that if he read them (although he had  barely learned how to search the internet before he died) he would chuckle  in his lighthearted way and say something like "Oh, well isn't that  nice," all-the-while refusing to take credit for any of it.  But I  know he deserved that credit, having taken a dark, psychological study of  gang warfare and infusing it with a classic but clever and topical, good  vs. evil story.  (And maybe I shouldn't admit it, but my dad didn't really  like the baseball face-paint idea which I believe was one of Walter Hill's  additions - he thought that was too unrealistic and  "Hollywood"...)  Anyway, I do hope the movie is re-issued with  the extra scenes at some point, and for those real "followers" I  just discovered that you can find a complete list of his produced titles on  the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com) if you want to check it out.  The  Warriors is indeed an AFFECTING picture, whether you love it or hate it.  So thanks for your comments and take care,  -Sam.
