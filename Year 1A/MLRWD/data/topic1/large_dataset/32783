Mystery, suspense and murder follow the defection of a top soviet spy.

The story concerns itself with the Cuban Missile Crises (circa 1962) and French intelligence's intervention in Cuba with respect to American interests.

A French intelligence officer's wife is having an affair with a man, codename "Topaz", and the point is made that all wives always talk "shop" concerning the work of their spy spouses. Thus, "Topaz" knows everything;

The husband, a French intelligence officer, is having an affair with the beautiful head of a subversive underground group in Havana.  Before starting this movement, she played an important role in the seating of Fidel Castro, as Batista was fleeing. The national respect earned by her work provided a position of influence, but since that time, she has observed that the Castro government is not the government she wanted, so creates a new underground movement for personally satisfaction.

This is a quiet, subtle Hitchcock film without major film stars; that is, stars recognizable to American audiences. But it definitely is Hitchcock, from a book by Leon Uris.

While searching "Topaz" for Hitchcock's cameo appearance, remember he can be seen behind every camera.
