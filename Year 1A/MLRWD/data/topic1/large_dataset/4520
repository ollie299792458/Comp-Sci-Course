It would be too harsh to say that "The Bourne Supremacy" is a bad movie, but compared to the relatively straightforward plot of the first film, this was at times difficult to follow, with some explanations only showing up in the deleted scenes.

The basics are good: Bourne is living in India, still on the run (he thinks) from Treadstone. Then a CIA operation goes bad, agents are killed, and Bourne's fingerprint is left behind ... in Berlin. At the same time, his girlfriend is shot in a bullet meant for him, which brings him roaring back to the West to settle matters once and for all, unaware that he's been framed as a traitor who kills CIA agents.

So far, so good. Throw in a ripped-from-today's-headlines Russian oil magnate and you'd think we'd be in good company, but neither Matt Damon nor Joan Allen (in a stellar performance) can save this. Things get confused to the point where one suspects the director wasn't really sure what was going on. Some loose ends are wrapped up, there's a lot of really good action and other set pieces, but the whole does not add up to the sum of its parts.

I have high hopes that the third part of this trilogy will return it to form. In the meantime, this is a rental.
