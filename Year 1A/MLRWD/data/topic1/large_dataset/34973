Stallone might be the main actor here, but Brian Denahy (one of America's most-loved character actors), who plays a ... cop in a small Pacific Northwest town, sums up the film's message best, when asked by Rambo, "why are you pushin' me?"  Denahy's response is a brilliant summation of the insidious fascist collectivism lying at the root of our nation's alleged "rugged individuality", and serves to provoke the heroic rallying cry of Rambo's gallant non-conformism: 
"First of all, you don't ask the questions around here.  I do.  You understand?  Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.  Drifters.  First thing you know we got a whole bunch a guys like you in this town.  That's why.  Besides, you wouldn't like it here . . . this is . . .  this is a quiet little town.  In fact, you might say its boring.  But that's the way we like it, and I get paid to keep it that way." 
A challenge indeed.  The battle table is now set, and before it's all over, Rambo will have outrun, outwitted, and seriously crippled a dozen sadistic police officers (as well as a few good family men), a whole platoon of national guardsmen, and a few tracking dogs to boot.  Rambo is a monster, a Frankenstein, created by the masters of war in the Pentagon, and now they're reaping the fruits of their own bitter harvest.  However, this is one Frankenstein that fights his battles in a half-hearted manner, dragged down by an inner conflict of will.  We see in the film's opening sequence that Rambo has not felt grounded in reality since returning from the `Nam.  The "junk in your pockets" that he complains about is apt symbolism for the collected junk inside John Rambo's tortured mind.  And Denahy's small-town fear of outsiders manifests itself in a self-destructive war with a one-man army, an apt metaphor for America's cultural civil war -- the wounds of Vietnam reappearing as enduring political cleavages during the late Cold War period.
