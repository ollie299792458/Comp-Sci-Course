Joan is at her delectable best, as she steamrolls her way over the supporting cast, totally stealing every scene with her over-the-top style.
This is one dame who's not going to blend into the scenery. If you are a Crawford fan, and if your reading the reviews of this film, you must be, you simply must add this film to your collection. Joan plays Eva Phillips, a conniving southern socialite, with a taste for the finer things, only matched by her taste for other women's men. Eva's the queen bee, and there's no doubt that she's the one running the hive. Joan delivers some wonderful lines in the film, for instance, "Any man's my man if I want it that way". Joan looks wonderful slinking around in drop dead gowns designed by Jean Louis. Whether she's verbally abusing her alcoholic husband or driving the poor unfortunates who dare cross her to suicide, Joan can do no wrong. Of course in the end, Eva gets what she deserves.
Add this film to your Joan collection, it's really a keeper.
