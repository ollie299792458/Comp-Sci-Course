I have always been a JFK Assassination buff and have read several books and watched a number of TV documentrys including the movie JFK. It is hard to believe that after 45 years of intensive research, thousands of books and endless debate, we are still left as confused as ever! For those who know their JFK facts "The Men Who Killed Kennedy provides plenty of spectulative assumptions and tremendous leaps of faith as to how truthful most of the information presented is. However it is very entertaining and thought provoking. For those who have read Prosser's "Case Closed" and believe his conclusions, then the the Men Who Killed Kennedy will probably rile you. In spite of some sketchy evidence and questionable assumptions, I really enjoyed the series. My only regret is that Oliver Stone didn't base his movie around  one of the scenerials in The Men Who Killed Kennedy. I think the end result would have been more believable than the Clay Shaw and David Ferrie connection. All said and done I think it is a safe bet that Oswald was the shooter, but was he part of a conspiracy? I think the answer to that question is buried in the time he was in New Orleans before the Assassination and his connections with the Cubian groups and if the CIA had involvement with him. If we knew the truth and answers raised by his time in New Orlean's perhaps the JFK Assassination case could be closed.
