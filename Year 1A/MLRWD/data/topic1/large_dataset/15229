I looked to Frost/Nixon because of a curiosity in the troubled president. I had hoped to find some substantive political content and real insights into Nixon's character, but the whole affair felt a bit trivialized.

Perhaps a game show host provides sub-par subject matter for the serious drama this was billed to be. Frost comes off as an arrogant philistine, making it hard to enjoy his hard-hitting questions. The most valuable part of the film was the scene at the end. Nixon proclaims his bold vision and hints at some illusions of grandeur, while Frost responds with adolescent boredom and an intense desire to escape this creepy man. Only at that point did the film make clear how fundamentally different the two men were. All along, I was waiting for Frost's apathy and superficiality to yield some sort of deeper meaning which never came.

The mismatch between the two does provide some dramatic tension. But any meaningful differences are trivialized by overacting. "When the president does it, it's not illegal" seems cliche when there's such a treasure trove of information about this man.

I would say, just read a book about Nixon's presidency. You're bound to learn more - and will be able to approach the situation more intelligently than a typical interviewer.
