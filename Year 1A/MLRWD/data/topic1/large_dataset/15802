This movie cannot be categorized as a Comedy alone.. No Way.. You cannot compare this only with 'Death at a Funeral' at all..This movie is like a mix of a lot of others bt only has bits of all of them like from..Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels + Snatch + Magnolia + 21 Days...

Some magnificent performances by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson & Ralph Fiennes.. I too like many other viewers didnt think much of Collin Farrel when I saw SWAT & Miami Vice... bt man I was impressed by this guy's acting..much the same way I was impressed by decaprio's performance in the Departed..

And Ralph Fiennes just owns every second he is on screen.. every second of it..

The Witty & sharp dialog is the best thing of the movie..combine that with dark comedy & the visual expressions of the characters + the story line.. this is just pure cinematic joy...

Theses kinds of movies just have some thing in them which you just cant put your finger in it bt you just love them for exactly what they are..you dont like to change one second of it..

What a little gem this is...the best movie I've seen after the German Masterpiece 'Four Minutes' this year...
