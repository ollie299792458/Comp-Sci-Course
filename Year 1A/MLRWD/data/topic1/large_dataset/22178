I loved watching old Betty Grable movies with my grandmother on TV years ago. She loved them when she was young, and thought I would enjoy them, too. I was barely a toddler, and have fond memories of those viewings. So, I recently purchased the new batch of Grable DVDs hoping to re-experience those treasured memories.

BAD MOVE!

I should have waited for more GABLE instead of wasting money on GRABLE.

Betty Grable and Dan Dailey were performers of modest talents to say the least. They had a nice chemistry, and were surrounded by good production values, nice music, and what I assume originally was gorgeous Technicolor.

The DVD looks very bland and flat, and doesn't do the film's production values justice. Whether it was actually filmed in a bland way, or is just a grainy transfer with color breathing, I couldn't tell you. Fox musicals usually compensate their lack of substance with dazzling colors or terrific songs.

None of that is here. The DVD is drab looking, the songs in the film are mediocre, and the performances are downright tacky at times. I may have liked it at age 5 or 6, but MY BLUE HEAVEN is  hardly heavenly when viewing this ugly looking DVD which can't compensate for the drab screenplay, tired stars, and boring music.
