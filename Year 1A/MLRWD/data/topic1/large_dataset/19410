This Survivor Series was the second best one. It trails right behind the 2002 Survivor Series (Elimination Chamber debut). Here's the line up.
AL SNOW vs. CHRISTIAN (European Championship)- Decent opener, one of Snow's better performances, Christian is very underated!
WILLIAM REGAL vs. TAJIRI - BORING! These two fought at like every PPV while the Alliance was here and it's never been interesting
EDGE vs. TEST (UNIFICATION) - U.S. Title vs. Intercontinental title. Great match. Starts out super boring, but you'll get into it. Good ending.
HARDY"S vs. DUDLEY"S (STEEL CAGE!;UNIFICATION) - The Hardy's and the Dudley's are known for thier epic rirvalry. They put on the first ever Table match! They worked TLC's Together! Heck, thier amazing. And this is a fitting ending to that rivalry. Good ending. Bigginings slow but it get's good fast!
IMUNITY BATTLE ROYAL (Winner keeps a job for a year!) - usually these are boring, but now they have something to fight for. Finnal five are: Kidman, Bradshaw, Test, Billy Gunn, and Lance Storm. Unexpected ending!
WOMEN"S TITLE MATCH (Six corner match; Sudden death) - Lita, Trish, Molly, Ivory, Jackie, and ???? (Jazz) face off in my personal favorite womens match. I never would've guessed who won. Awsome out of all six women!
TEAM WWF vs. TEAM ALLIANCE (loser leaves the bissinus) - I hate the beggining but when it all get's down to 2 on 2, it's like a dream Tag team match! Very, Very unexpected betrayal!!!! Awsome match, stole the show!
