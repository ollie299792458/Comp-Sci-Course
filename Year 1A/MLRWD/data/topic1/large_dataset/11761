This guy is angry and he's putting his foot down.  Bill (Michael Douglas) isn't happy, so he's angry, but at the same time he's also the hero of our story.  The story begins at a point where Bill is stuck in traffic, he's divorced, his wife has a restraining order that doesn't allow him to be near his wife or his daughter even on his daughter's birthday and plus he's just lost his job.  That makes him economically viable.  Within the first 3 minutes of this film, we can catch the moment where Bill's faith in the world extinguishes and his life ceases to mean anything for himself.  It is from then on that Bill just does not care anymore.  And due to his increased irritability, Bill is now more violent because he's not getting his point across otherwise since the people that end up upsetting him are unwise to the fact that he has completely lost it.  At some point in the movie, there's a skinhead that compares his racial discrimination to Bill's anger, but that just makes Bill more angry because Bill is not racist.  Bill just can't take it anymore.
