Season Four of this once-hilarious series trumpeted its death knell by jumping the shark...several times.  Two of these moments came from Michal Scott and Jim/Pam.

Michael Scott, once a naive, crass, yet stangely sympathetic character was turned into a cartoon simpleton, going as far as to kidnap a pizza delivery boy.  I won't even mention his idiocy in driving a car into a lake.

Jim and Pam at one time represented to heart of this show, two star-crossed people who found the humanity in each other and overyone else working in this strange reality.  However, once we arrived at the season finale we have Jim's pentultimate moment with Pam ripped away by the Ol Bait and Switch.  My tenuous hold on my favorite series was broken by whatever writer thought a season finale should end on the 'fake proposal' cliffhanger.  From watching John and Jenna say so much without saying a word in Booze Cruise morphing into what they are now is just sad.  Oh how the mighty has fallen.

As far as the dvd set goes, paying over 30 dollars for a strike-shortened season with less extras than ever is just plain robbery NBC.  You should be ashamed.  You reward the viewers who stuck with you during the entire strike only to gouge them at the cash register.

Oh and Mr. Krasinksi, you should really try to make the time to show some love to the fans instead of blowing off the commentaries.  I've seen you in a couple of movies, and your bread and butter is this show trust me.
