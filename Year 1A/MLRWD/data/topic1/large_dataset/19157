No spoilers here...
I am glad I did not read the other reviews before I watched the movie.
Yes, the movie has its faults, but it was as I expected by looking at the cover: lots of fast-paced action. I do not know anything about John Cena or WWE, and I saw nothing that detracted from the movie relating to wrestling.

What I hate about the disc is the heavy-handededness of the disc producer/manufacturer. I was FORCED to watch the previews... I could not go directly to the menu, I could not fast forward through them, and I could not skip to the next chapter. This is the first disc I have come across where this is the case, and I will not keep it in my collection. I actually turned off my TV and waited for the previews to finish before I turned it back on. I think I am going to return it to the studio that produced it, and this review is my way of letting them know my displeasure. It is unfair to give the movie itself a poor rating for the software used to cram ads down our throats, but perhaps if all discs that are encoded like that are given bad reviews...

WWE and 20th Century Fox.... zero stars for you!! (I have lots more anger to vent, but I am afraid it would not get past the censors at Amazon).
