If you like happy endings, don't watch or buy this movie.  In fact, stop reading right now.  This movie is dark; hell, it's a black hole and could be a candidate for the "bummer movie of the decade" award (if there was one).  However if you like excellent character development, great acting and offbeat dark humor, this movie is for you.  Bobby is in debt to the mob and he blows a radiator hose en route to the pay off, and everything that can possibly go wrong does.  His first encounter in this small Arizona desert town is Billy Bob Thornton, playing one of the weirdest characters he has ever played (which is saying a lot for Billy Bob Thornton) as the mechanic from hell.  Eventually Bobby abandons hope of ever getting his car back and buys a bus ticket, however in a surrealistic momment it is snatched from his hand, chewed and swallowed by Joaquin phoenix's character who suspects Bobby of flirting with his girlfriend.  The horrified expression on Sean Penn's face as he watches his precious bus ticket digested before his very eyes is priceless.  There are so many great scenes in this movie I could write 10 pages.  Suffice it to say, if you think you are having a bad day and are feeling sorry for yourself, then watch this moview and your day won't look so bad.
