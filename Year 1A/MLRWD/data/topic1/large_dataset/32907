In response to Jammmer's (from Wyoming) review, let me begin by saying that the prerequisite for liking this movie has nothing to do with "Dragnet." I've seen many, many episodes of "Dragnet," and except for the presence of Jack Webb and a similar overall format, this movie is very little like "Dragnet" (and I doubt that Jammmer has even seen an "original" "Dragnet" episode). I addition, the cops in this movie are not portrayed as "wonder-boy saints." They are portrayed as regular human beings who make mistakes and even get killed (or seriously injured) on the job. This was done to rebel against the super-hero image that cops had been given in Hollywood for a long time, and I'm surprised that such an apparent "expert" in classic films like Jammmer couldn't figure that out. Along these lines, the acting was kept restrained to give the police a less glamorous image, but what I'd like to know is how people like Jammmer expect cops on the job to act. Should they tell some jokes, shed a tear, or chase a dame while they are on a routine job? Look at everyday people's faces while they are working and that is what you are supposed to see on the cops in this movie. In addition, this movie is a semi-documentary that is supposed to illustrate a real crime scene. When police go after crooks, they do not immediately know the crooks' motives, or other things that Jammmer wishes this movie would illustrate. Jammmer's comments and others like it simply prove that many people cannot grasp the original concept of this movie. But I can and the movie pulls it off excellently.
