The little film that could. Even with Brad Pitt and Ridley Scott producing, Warner Brothers hated this film and dumped it in a limited release theatrical run. Now on dvd, it's literally selling out at many major chains. I am not a big fan of westerns, but there are a few that captivate me. The Assassination Of Jesse James is the kind of film that the masses just won't get. It is slow paced, deep and full of little details that truly immerse you in the late 1800's. It doesn't have horse chases and lots of gunfights, so the general public should just stick with 3:10 To Yuma (a fine film itself). This movie is so detailed and rich that it requires several viewings just to take it all in. I watched it twice in 2 days. The music, the acting, the locations...all perfect. I really appreciated the "Gothic" look of the film as well. Instead of wearing tan dusters, big hats and other such standard "cowboy" apparel, the characters are mostly seen in black, Victorian era coats and hats. Very interesting and visually stunning. What more can I say? If you enjoy films that truly take you away for a couple of hours +, this one can't be beat. But if you like cheap, loud popcorn movies that require very little audience commitment, stay away!
