Although I was already a fan of Shahrukh Khan, and have seen many of his films, this was my first experience of a Hindi film in a theater. It was absolutely incredible. The music, the costumes, the sets, the dancing, the acting were all superb, brilliant, gorgeous, out of this world. This has become my favorite movie of all time. I feel so fortunate to have seen it on the big screen (and thankful that it had subtitles!). I only regret that I didn't seize the opportunity to go back and see it again and again while I had the chance.
For those who don't know the story of Devdas, it is a classic of Indian literature, about a weak, self-destructive man who cannot bring himself to act on his better impulses until it is too late, and then drowns himself in self-pity and alcohol. Shahrukh Khan, as Devdas, was absolutely brilliant, Aishwarya Rai as his lost love, Paro, was stunning to look at, and acted superbly. And Madhuri Dixit as Chandramukhi the courtesan, who loves Devdas in vain, completed the love triangle to utter perfection. 
This film is a gorgeous work of art. Buy it.
