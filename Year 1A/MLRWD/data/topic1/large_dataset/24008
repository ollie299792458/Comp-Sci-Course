With the title "Waitress" and starring Keri Russell of TV melodrama "Felicity" fame, this touching indie movie was doomed to be overlooked by the masses, especially men. What a pity.

Despite a near fairy-tale ending, "Waitress" documents life as a series of lonely, desolate valleys -- with flashes of blinding truth and transcendent passion for those willing to endure the speed bumps.

Like Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train," this film traces damaged souls intersecting in a stark, working-class Southern town. "Waitress," however, demonstrates more warmth for its characters and avoids Jarmusch's self-conscious nudges and winks.

Russell plays Jenna, a spirited young woman whose one-of-a-kind pies sustain the local diner owned by Joe, a bow-tied curmudgeon and acid-tongued customer (Andy Griffith).  The names she gives her concoctions, like "I Hate My Husband Pie," are as hilarious as her recipes are inventive.

Emboldened by the prospect of winning a regional baking contest, Jenna plans to leave her abusive and clingy husband, but her dreams are shattered when she learns she is pregnant. Bliss alternates with despair as Jenna falls for her obstetrician -- also married -- while her husband's insecurities reach a dangerous, fever pitch.

"Waitress" charms like few other movies do with genuine affection for its characters, especially Jenna's co-workers and best friends, played by Cheryl Hines and the film's director, the late Adrienne Shelly.  Even the villain, Jenna's husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto), manages to muster shreds of humanity despite his brutality.

Like one of Jenna's hearty meat pies, "Waitress" will settle in your stomach and warm your heart, but without the unabashed sentimentality of a pre-fab Disney confection. Instead, it will remind you that life is untidy and unpredictable -- a glorious and memorable mess, not to be missed.
