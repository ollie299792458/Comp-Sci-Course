This box office bomb is one of Scorcese's best films.  The performances are fantastic and in Rupert Pupkin, the movie's weird protagonist (if there is one), DeNiro created one of the most complex characters of his career - - Pupkin is darkly hillarious and incredibly disturbing at the same time.  
The pathetic scenes in which DeNiro's Pupkin pretends to be a guest on the popular Tonight Show-style talk show hosted by Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis as the Carson-style host) with cardboard cutouts of Liza Minelli, etc. and the imagined conversations/interviews are one of the highlights of the movie and DeNiro's performance.  Sandra Bernhardt is fantastic as the obsessed fan and enabler of all of Puplin's celebrity fantasies.
At its core, the movie is about the dangers of celebrity and the desire of everyday Joes and Janes to inject themselves into that world.  Pupkin is the natural and extreme extension of the personality quirks of anybody who has ever asked a celebrity for an autograph.
In the end, there's something oddly likeable in the pathetic Pupkin that DeNiro creates.  The arch of the movie follows his wild ride from untalented schmuck to "c" grade celebrity in his own right after he kidnaps talk show host Jerry Langford in his last desperate act to get five minutes of airtime on Langford's show.
A terrific Scorcese film with terrific performances from a great cast.  Jerry Lewis is incredible in the straight role as the talk show host cut from the Johnny Carson mold.  Great movie.
