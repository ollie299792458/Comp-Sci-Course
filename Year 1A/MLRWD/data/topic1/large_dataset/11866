Ah, the gift that keeps on creeping...Jonathan Demme's masterwork, as many have pointed out, isn't a "big budget" movie by today's standards, but when you've got a tight screenplay based on an excellent book, Demme at the helm and a cast this good, it makes for a near perfect experience. Add to that a great transfer by Criterion (I prefer this one to the MGM version, only because I like it a little darker - but the MGM edition's good, too), and you've got a great DVD.

It's about as good as book adaptations get - period. Having read the book before I saw the movie, there's only one part in the book (when she's on the shooting obstacle course) I wish they'd included in the movie that would have helped pay off Starling's character flaws a bit more, but the story still works just great as is, so no sense belaboring that bit. It wasn't there and if you've never read the book, you'll still get it.

This version has a few extras not on the other, so if you like your Lambs with an extra side of contrast, see if you can score the Criterion edition and enjoy it with some fava beans and a nice chianti! Okay, everyone's done that joke before, but I couldn't resist!
