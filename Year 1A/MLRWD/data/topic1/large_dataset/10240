So you put 4 talented, or I think it's safe to say extremely talented, actors together and what is supposed to happen?? Not this! I'm in shock at the complete dullness of that movie. Don't get me wrong, Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins, in whatever movie they are in, give a great performance, but this could have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sure, it may have been well shot with nice scenes and good acting, but what ever happened to a little something called a plot? By the end of the movie I was praying for it to be over. I didn't care if any of the actors died because I had no sympathy for any of them except for the african american family. I'd like to know how some of these movies get made these days. The screenplay is one of the most important, if not the most important, aspect of movies and this movie bombed. Could it be any more miscasted? (is that a word) Also, there wasn't one twist. There wasn't one plot point that caught my interest. This movie could have been an amazing thriller but instead it was Hopkinds and Kidman having sex for two hours because... oh wait I don't know why they like each other. This movie could have been amazing, even with the same actors as it had. Kidman's past would be amazing if elaborated, and the whole sex deal between her and Hopkins would have to go. My favorite part of the movie, if you can call it that, is when the psycho crazy guy kills them both. I find this movie an insult to Hollywood and an embarresment to the actor's careers. I'd like to know what the director was thinking. Books are different than movies. Books can keep your interest in different ways than movies can, and I'm sure the novel it was based on was great, but this movie was a dissapointment, and I'm shocked at the five stars that appear on the site. If you want to see Kidman and Hopkins really give a permormance rent Instinct or The Others, not this excuse for a movie. Sorry if I was harsh, but I can't belevie what i just watched!
