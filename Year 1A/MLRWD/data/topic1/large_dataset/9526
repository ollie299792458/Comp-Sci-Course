With enough star power to light Las Vegas (as long as no one's around with a pinch), Ocean's Eleven comes packed with all the action, suspense, comedy, and George Clooney a girl could want (guys, substitute 'Julia Roberts' for 'George Clooney').  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, and Elliot Gould, among others, make the picture sparkle with superb acting, while excellent directing from Steven Soderbergh keeps the picture down-to-earth, funny, and interesting without losing the element of suspense.

The plot, based on the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same title, is equally good; the characters especially are well written and casted.  The Ocean's Eleven, as well as other main characters are unique and realistic, and very well interpreted by the cast.  Even the costumes used help to make the film unforgettable.

Definitely a firm recommendation for anyone who likes a good movie--this one's got it all, supense, humor, and action.  Just be careful while laughing on the edge of your seat; it tends to be dangerous.
