The second season did not quite live up to the first.  As Amazon's description already tells you, it begins with Joan having decided that God did not talk to her and she tries to ignore his attempts to reach her.  This is an interesting dramatization of the way people really do ignore God in their lives.  But I felt it went on too long.  Also, Adam spends a good deal of time in the first episode trying to convince her that maybe God really has been talking to her, even carrying around books on the subject, and then completely drops it for the rest of the season.  If he really believed this, you'd think it would have come up again.  It is, after all, not something you hear about every day.

I also had a problem with the way the plotline later in the season involving Joan's relationship with Adam was handled.  I feel they missed some serious teachable moments here.

Most episodes in the first season had a pretty predictable formula.  "God" asks Joan to do something she doesn't want to do, she does it, we see little miracles and we learn something without being preached to.  Predictable or not, this formula worked and there was no reason to move away from it.

All in all though, this season was still terrific viewing.  The episode with the feral cat was particularly good and it's almost worth buying the whole season just for the one with the zombie musical.  I watched that one twice.
