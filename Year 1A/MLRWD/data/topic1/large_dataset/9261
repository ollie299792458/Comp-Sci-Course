I just received this DVD today and I went to view the special features and I found out the hard way that this DVD was not the Special Edition as Amazon.com said it was! I bought the Special Edition several years ago and it's all scratched up now so I wanted to buy a new replacement one. I am very disappointed with Amazon.com about this issue!!!!!

The version I got from Amazon has:

1) The feature movie
2) Trailer
3) DVD rom features

Now the Actual Special Edition Version has:

1) The Feature Movie
2) Trailers
3) T.V. Spots
4) Documentaries: "THE TERMINATOR: A RETROSPECTIVE" & "OTHER VOICES"
5) TERMINATED Scenes with commentary
6) Still Galleries
7) Original Treatment
8) DVD ROM Features

So I want to let everyone know that this version is NOT the Special Edition version!!!!! It is just a single release version that you get from Wal-Mart or anywhere for $7.50 or less than what Amazon or the manufacturers are charging!!!!! So don't waste your money!! Just go to Wal-Mart! I hope that I have helped at least one person to make an informed decesion by writing this review. 5 stars for it being The Terminator. 1 star for false advertisement!
