1997. Penn State University. Michael Hauge was holding a seminar there on "How to Write Screenplays that Sell." I was about one year out of high school and really interested in the prospects of a screenwriting career.

For anybody who attends any sort of seminar, there is usually a certain film, script or work that an instructor uses to demonstrate the points of a successful story and/ or film. The script Michael Hauge had chosen was "The American President," written by Aaron Sorkin.

I had no idea at the time of the calibur of storytelling I had in my instruction manual. I knew I liked the movie, but I didn't know why until the seminar had concluded and the film had been dissected to its core. I went on to learn that Aaron Sorkin had also written "A Few Good Men."

Those two screenplays alone are an education, brilliantly crafted, riveting in both plot and in the dilemmas and conflict of character, but the stamp of Aaron Sorkin's style comes in his use of dialogue. There are few other writers capable of crafting the intelligence, heart and wit that gets fired out of the mouths of Hollywood's most gifted actors.

West Wing provides time to focus on issues, life and love in a way no feature film can and each season leaves you wanting more. Aaron Sorkin was able to take one simple idea of a behind the scenes look at Senior Staffers in the White House and turn it into an extraordinary hour of television year after year. Due credit should be given to John Wells, Tommy Schlamme and other contributors who helped make the West Wing come alive and to the actors for giving those people heart as well as wicked tongues. So, in conclusion, the West Wing provides entertainment as well as an education whether you are a democrat or republican - an aspiring writer or director or maybe just someone in the mood for a well told tale.
