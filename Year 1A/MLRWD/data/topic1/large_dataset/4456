The packaging is well done with each disc numbered, and each season in its own file
folder and the files in a pleasant looking portfolio box with the Presidential seal
on it. The clarity isn't up to the Hi Def standards but it's as good as most other
movies I've bought( When purchasing I was looking for "West Wing" in Blu Ray but
couldn't find it). I am presently into the 2nd season and am so much enjoying coming
back to "West Wing". The series presents what one would think are realistic situations
with realistic characters that one could easily imagine in the White House. In NCIS
fashion it combines humor, touching situations, and high drama of the west wing of
the white house. The actors do a fantastic job and are totally believable. The sets
make you feel you are truly in the White House. The situations that happen really
could and in some cases I'm sure have happened. The series is more about the staff
of the President rather the president himself. It is so refreshing to see thought
provoking entertainment again instead some of the mindless chatter that prevails in
so much of television. For me and I'm sure for most, "West Wing" is a great Buy.
