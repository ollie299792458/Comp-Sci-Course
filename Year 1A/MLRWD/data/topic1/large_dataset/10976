OK, I like this original well enough.  
I saw it on the Wonderfull World of Disney on TV and then repeats on Cable.  I have to agree with some of the other posters that Annabelle being 13 makes the car driving funnier.  And "Gomez Adams" as the Dad is also a great plus.
Yet, I personally like the 1st remake with Shelly Long / Gaby Hoffmann.  (NOT out on DVD, but I am waiting)  Given that its a worn out premise, I like the "feel" of this version.  It a more modern look, with out the "too cool" look of the newest version.  It has pretty good chemistry with the two leads.
I would also like to recommend another switched-bodies movie that is very cute.  Its called "Wish upon a Star" with Danielle Harris / Catherine Heigl.  It's a little sister / big sister switch.  Just a fun little movie but that has a pretty nice message about sibling opposites understaing each other and getting along.  This one is available on DVD, just type it into the search box.
