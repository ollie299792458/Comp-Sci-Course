This fine movie is driven by a strong plot line and a strong theme:

1) The Plot Part I: Can a young man who is the child of a famous lawyer move beyond his fears and dare to fill his father's shoes?
2) The Plot Part II: A young soldier dies on a military base. Who is responsible for his death?
3) The theme: What happens when the military's codes of law and loyalty comes into conflict with core moral values?

These are all powerful ideas well suited to providing motivation for the characters in a story. This particular film combines this fine foundation with good actors and an excellent screen play to create a very entertaining and relatively thoughtful movie.

Just to balance out this review, I can mention a few things that are not entirely convincing to me in this production.

* All of the actors do a great job, but there are times when I feel like they are performing rather than acting. It is as if they are in a competition to outdo one another with excessive bluster.
* The direction is always competent, but rarely inspired. The story pulls me along relentlessly even though I've seen it several times now. Yet I still find myself popped out of several scenes and into my seat, feeling as though the acting isn't quite convincing, as if the nuts and bolts of the story line are a bit too exposed.

But these are quibbles.  A Few Good Men is Hollywood in great form, doing what it does best. The movie brings to viewers a great screen play, strong themes, good performances and competent direction. The screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, is surely one of the best of his generation, and this film demonstrates why he is so highly revered. If you want a movie that entertains you while giving you something to think about, this is a great choice.
