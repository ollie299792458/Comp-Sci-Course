It is truly difficult to find any movie today that can capture one's attention for 2 hours and 35 minutes, yet "Midnight" does. While the story itself is somewhat predictable, Eastwood has done a superb job of crafting intricate and fascinating character studies of Southern civility and gentility, and those who abide by such qualities. So much so that you lose track of its length as the inherent likability of the main characters hooks you early on.
Based on the actual life of wealthy Savannah antique dealer/power broker Jim Williams (an outstanding Kevin Spacey), the only man in Georgia's history to be tried four times for the same crime, the movie elegantly examines the eccentricities and Code of the local populace, premised on a veneer of gracious 18th. century politeness that covers the sometimes decadent and bizarre Savannah lifestyle of the 1980's. If muggers exist here, they would all say "May I?" and "Thank you so much!"
Our window to this world exists in the persona of magazine writer John Kelso (perfectly infused with Yankee determination by John Cusack), as he peels back the layers of the real from the apparent while helping to investigate William's sudden shooting of his gay lover (Jude Law) in alleged self-defense. Along the way he encounters such notables as an irrepressible drag queen, an omniscient, motherly voo-doo priestess and everyone's favorite, the wannabe geriatric urban terrorist who sports live horseflies tethered to his shirt on threads while clutching a bottle of poison perpetually destined for the city's water supply.
In the end, the movie's outcome tantalyzingly follows Spacey's prophetic words from early in the movie, when Cusack asks him if he's interested in the hidden work discovered underneath a recent painting the latter just acquired: "Well, sport, I sort of enjoy not knowing."
