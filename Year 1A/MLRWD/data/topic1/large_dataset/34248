I am a big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt's, but even I can recognize that most of her roles have been one dimensional. The teen in distress chased by a lunatic, the teen in distress attending a party, the young woman in distress over her con-artist mother. Most of her roles require very little acting ability. Finally, If Only comes along, a movie which she financed and produced through her Love Spell Entertainment Company.

The story is about a young woman named Samantha who is seriously neglected by her boyfriend Ian. After arguing, and breaking up, a tragedy occurs and there is loss for one of the characters. Fortunately, this being a fantasy-romantic drama, the couple get to relive their day all over again.

If you lost someone and had the opportunity to go back and do things differently, what would you change? That is the question that this film asks, and ultimately it proves that Love never dies. If Only Love Hewitt was given more opportunities to shine. Watch for this movie coming to ABC Family Channel in January 2006, and to DVD shortly after. If you like romantic movies like the far superior Love Story, you won't be disappointed.
