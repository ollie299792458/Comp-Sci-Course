How can I explain this show to someone who's never seen it? It's centered around three people that drink and smoke and do things that are bad for them, and they love it. They don't really give much though to the future or anyone other than themselves on a regular basis, they live in the moment, and they all have weird things about them that keep them interesting and their interaction lively. The writing is witty and fresh and I think it's hilarious!

Dylan Moran is great at observational humor and designed characters that shine in a simple setting. It's not as dry as a lot of British comedies and makes for a wonderful change. Observational humor, witty dialouge, physical comedy, and crazy (yet perfectly polished) guest characters create a great show with a wonderful sense of comedic timing -- you never think: they're setting up a joke here; the punchline is always a suprise. I laugh out loud every time I watch this show and I have my favorite episodes, but I never skip a single one.

And to my BBC comerades: if you like Chef!, Vicar of Dibley, or Father Ted you'll love this one, just snap it up!
