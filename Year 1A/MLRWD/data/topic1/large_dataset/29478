Fully aware, it's just a movie. I blame the director's and writers for creating such a lousy film. There were too many weak leaks in this movie. Psychological thriller is a specific sub-genre of the wide-ranging thriller genre.Generally; thrillers focus on plot over fictional characters, and thus emphasize intense physical action over the character's psyche. Psychological thrillers tend to reverse this formula to certain degree, emphasizing the characters just as much, if not more so, than the plot. This movie shows two characters preying upon one another minds, either by playing deceptive games with the other or by merely trying to demolish the other's mental state. This character had a severe disorder marked by degeneration of mental and social functioning and withdrawal from reality. The character Ashley played, was along venerable and physically abuse. How could anybody allow you to see something that doesn't t exist. Moral to the story is sometimes the suspense comes from within one solitary character where characters must resolve conflicts with their own minds,usually;this conflict is an effort to understand something that has happened to them. All what I mention in this review,didn't see any of this in the movie.
