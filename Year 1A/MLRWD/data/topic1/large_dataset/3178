I had only watched a few episodes of this show when it aired.  I liked what I saw, but since I hadn't seen it from the beginning it lost a little of it's clarity.  I decided to buy Season 1 so I could watch it from the beginning.  It was a very good decision.  The quality of the DVDs is excellent.  There are extras (such as commentary by some of the cast, producers, etc. and deleted scenes for some episodes).  The fact that there is a scene selection for each episode is also very handy.  Some of the original music IS changed, but not having watched the original episodes I haven't noticed a huge difference.  Dido still sings the main theme and a few other songs in other key moments are still in place.  The discs are in slim cases and are very attractive.
A definite must for anyone who likes the show or someone like me who saw a few episodes in the past and wanted to get the whole story.
I'll definitely buy the Season 2 set, which, according to some information provided in the set, will be released this summer.
