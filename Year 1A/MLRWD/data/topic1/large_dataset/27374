I obsessively rented all of the first three seasons of SFU on DVD (I don't watch HBO), and loved them, though I got a bit bored with Nate's shenanigans at the end of season three.  Season four is absolutely, unapologetically, awful.  And it seems to be the fault of the writers and creator far more than the cast (which I loved, mostly, for their hardy and realistic personalities, and because they aren't all hollywood beautiful).  The writers have destroyed this cast, turning them all into one single plot device:  sex.  Apparently they got bored, or lazy, because the primary character struggle for all the characters other than Ruth pertains to sex in general and, usually, infidelity in particular.

This might have made sense for one character arc.  Say Nate, even.  His wife is dead, and he doesn't know what to do, so he grieves by being destructive.  But Brenda's "problem" is mostly completely overwritten, and the writers have turned almost every character into some hypersexualalized idiot whose perpetual thoughts pertain only to whom they are sleeping with and when.  And we understanding almost NOTHING of their motivations:  aside from Claire, whose aside with her girlfriend is fairly believable and well-written, I seriously can't figure out the basic tenets of the show.  Why is David being unfaithful?  Why is Rico being unfaithful?  Why is Keith being unfaithful?  Why is Brenda (a previously delighftully awful, funny, complex character who expressed herself well) pretending to want to get pregnant when she doesn't, and why does she want to study psychology when the first and second seasons show her life-long mockery of the profession?

The problem is that this show has turned into a soap opera, and we get very little data on the motivations of the characters.  By the end, they cease to become characters at all, really, and are mostly just sex objects.  Maybe that interests some people, but I watched this show for different reasons.  I won't watch season five.
