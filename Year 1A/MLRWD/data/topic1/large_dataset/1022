It started off slow and dull, and then, ten pieces of Almond Roca later, it was over.

This movie is stupid.  Was it really necessary to include a cat killing in it just to make it seem 'scary'??  I mean, come on.  Animal rights aside, The Exorcism didn't even have to do that.

I couldn't stand the actor of the main character, the Reverend.  He reminds me of one of those used car salesmen who practically hands you a jar of Vaseline the minute you step foot on his lot, the kind of guy that deep down you just want to smack silly the minute you shake his hand.  Plus, so much emphasis was placed on him throughout the entire film that the possessed victim sort of got lost in the storyline.  She became the equivalent of an afterthought.

The plot changed so quickly and so often it soon got hard to follow amidst my movie watching snacking.  When will these low budget producers learn that great movies, the kinds that become classics (like The Exorcist), actually require some serious thought and research prior to script writing??  It was obvious this one didn't consume much thought.  Not to sound gory or anything, but a brain dead fetus could have written this one.

Producers, directors, and script writers take note, file this DVD away for safe keeping as a learning tool, a reminder to NOT slaughter your idea for a movie like this writer and director did.

I want my money back.  Oh, and I won't be buying or renting any more movies from this label anymore either.  My lesson has been learned.
