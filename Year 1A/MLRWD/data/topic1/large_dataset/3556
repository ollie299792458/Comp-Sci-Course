What could have been Welles'marterpiece is still worth a good look despite RKO's butchering of the original version! The magnificence of the production and photography  alone would be reason enough, but the acting (Cotten's in particular, but Judith Anderson's also, of course) and the tension of many scenes (what is left of the Ball Scene at the Ambersons'mansion, for instance)make the film unforgettable even after years and weeks, I cannot forget many of the shots and scenes ( my fist experience was in Paris in the sixties ( 1960"s that is). I recently saw it again on digitally remastered dvd and I found all my original admiration came back at the richness of this real American epic, maybe not quite the equal of Citizen Kane, but certainly superior to later ones, such as the overrated Giant. The melodrama of the Booth Tarkington novel is unavoidable, but so magnified and Tranformed by the master director that it becomes comparable to a Greek tragedy. And what a lesson it is to our times, devoured by greed and the pollution created by industry and the frenzy and congestion of city traffic! What a striking prophecy is held in the scene between Cotten's character, a motor car enthusiast and industrialist, and young Amberson who has just insulted him. What a lesson in civility, masterfully carried off by that inimitable actor and what a lesson for our politicians to day!
Unforgettable, inimitable, I said and I will repeat: do not deprive yourself of this great film because it was trunkated by stupid money-grabbing distributors. Maybe some day a miracle comparable to what happened with Lang's Metropolis will make Welles restored original version possible and Criterion will distribute it! That is a dream for every Welles admirer. Meanwhile enjoy what is left of the MAGNIFICIENT Ambersons!
