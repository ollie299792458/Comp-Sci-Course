Another reviewer is concerned about the completeness of the American DVD release of La m√¥me.

I saw this film while on vacation in France last year. As a long time Piaf collector, I am very familiar with her singing and what has been published about her life. I loved the movie and ordered the DVD from Amazon France when it was released there in August (I pre-ordered the HD DVD version, coming out next week in France). The timing on my French DVD is 140 minutes, while the American release is listed here as... 141 minutes!! This is probably due to extra distributors' credits or just because timings may have been rounded up to the next minute on the description. The point is: **this edition must be very much as complete as the French theatrical release I saw**, which matches my DVD, as far as my memory will serve me.

I don't know if or by how much was the film cut down for its American theatrical release, but the seemingly haphazard intercutting between disparate periods in &Eacute;dith Piaf's life is just how the film is structured and the abrupt ending, after she sings Non, je ne regrette rien at the Olympia is exactly as I remember it from the theatrical viewing in Paris. I found it moving and emotionally overwhelming. There are not any sequences on the original that would need to be toned down in order to avoid an NC-17 rating, none at all!!

So buy with confidence and enjoy this superb performance by Ms. Cotillard! (Hope she gets the Oscar!!)
