You should see this movie first if you haven't seen Bruckenheimer's soaped up "Pearl Harbor" (the title itself bears the director's pretentiousness - as no one would dare to name his or her movie `Normandy'). This movie came from Czech Republic as almost out of nowhere. It will most likely surprise you. You would like an authentic recreation of aerial battle (check out the light and shadows of the skies) and the roars of mighty Spitfires against Luftwaffe! What makes a difference in this WWII film with a twist of their unfortunate post war fate is an atmosphere and smell of the European theatre without forgetting a witty side of humanity. The film is beautifully done with a bonus blow up of a real locomotive, while you also notice the plenty of early 21st century SFX with even a greater care and love of a hobbyist making a bunch of model airplanes. By watching this movie you will likely notice the proximity where Hollywood still miserably fails with its over-melodramatic and self-righteous choreographs in other mass-produced war movies you've seen way too many. I bet the director Jan Sverak will eventually become next Wolfgang Petersen or someone in that caliber.  - You will find yourself rewarded. (PS: If you can stand only English-speaking movies then you may dismiss this one.)
