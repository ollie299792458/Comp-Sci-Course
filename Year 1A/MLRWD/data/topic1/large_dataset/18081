I am a big fan of Hoagy Carmichael's "Heart and Soul" and when I saw a brief clip of Tom Hanks playing this song on the step piano, I had to watch this movie. I tried to find it on Netflix to no avail. I tried Amazon Instant Video, but I decided to jump in and spend the extra $8 to have the Blu Ray copy. I am glad I did. This movie is a instant classic. I had no idea what I was in for. I don't want to ruin the movie, but it is a very funny movie in which Tom Hanks becomes BIG basically. Hanks does an amazing job acting like a 13 year old living as a 30 year old. The most memorable part was when Hanks and his boss were playing Heart and Soul as well as the Chopstick March on the step piano.

Never once did the movie slow down or became boring. I was craving for more and fell in to the entire setting and the plot of the movie. The acting was great and the entire cast did an superb job. Overall, the movie deserves 5 stars for it's clever laughs, amazing acting, magnitude of imagination and nostalgia. Nonetheless, when the ending came along, I was left in shock wondering what just happened. Is that it? What happens next? There has to be additional footage. It cannot end like this. It called for a sequel perhaps, but I don't know if it ever came out. If someone knows, please inform me! If you never watched this movie and would like to experience 80's nostalgia, it is highly recommended.

PROS:
+ Excellent Acting
+ Great Plot and Story
+ Worth the $10 to belong in my collection

CONS:
- Ending left more to be desired
- Slightly grainy picture (not a big deal)
