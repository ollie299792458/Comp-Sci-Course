Illustrator David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is just working at home during a terrifying thunderstorm  that ends partially destroying his house. For the need to fix the damages he goes next morning to a local supermarket in the company of his son and a neighbor that also faces  same problems. On the way David notices two things; the heavy presence of the army and a strange "mist" coming from the Lake area which eventually hits some citizens that were shopping in the supermarket.

From the point on the movie builds up making the market a stage for  a "horror circus" coming from creatures outside and a  real terrible monster that stars growing inside the market thanks to Marcia Gay Harden's performance (you will love to hate her) and also I should mention the good supporting cast with Toby Jones (Infamous) that always deserves credit. Another winner here is the surprising end that  make this flick kind of unique in my opinion.

The special effects here only work thanks the B&W version of this movie that is far superior than the color one. The horror works much better in B&W which also makes this film a plus. Is old fashion that works wonders in here see for yourself and compare both versions. The double disc is packed with goodies from director's commentary thru making off - specially scene 35 which is probably the best. So call your friends order some pizza take off the colors from the TV in case you don't have the 2 discs version or if you do... don't think twice put the B&W version first... you won't regret !!!!! Have fun !
