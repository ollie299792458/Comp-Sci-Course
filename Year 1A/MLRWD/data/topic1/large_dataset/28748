Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE is one of the best plays that I have ever read, and now it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Although the action is a little shaky in the beginning, the pace picks up when the trials begin. It may be wise to read the play first to understand the background of the various characters. THE CRUCIBLE is the story of the Salem Witch trials of 1692. To me it shows the tragedy of the human condition. The people of Salem really hate one another, as Abigail points out, but because of their Puritan faith they must repress their emotions.
Winona Ryder succeeds marvelously as Abigail Williams. Abigail is selfish and deluded into thinking that she loves married John Procter, with whom she had an affair. Abigail "means to dance with John on his wife's grave" and she will stop at nothing to have him, even when she accuses innocent people of witchcraft. She has no idea of the enormous consequences of her actions. Towards the films end, she comes to John Procter in jail hoping that he will go with her on a ship to America. Her pleading, "I never dreamed this for you," is a true one. But John Procter replies aptly by saying that the only time they will meet again is in hell. Abigail then disappears, never to be seen again.
Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as John Procter. He is a man of reason who is faced with an impossible choice. He either must give into the lie and save his life, or remain silent. His final "Give me my name" speech will have you in tears.
Joan Allen is great as Elizabeth, Procter's frigid wife. Her breakdown at the end also induces some tears. She loves John, and respects his decision, "He have his goodness now, God forbid me take it from him!"
THE CRUCIBLE shows how good people can be forced to do despicable things without helping themselves. As a tragedy of the human spirit, THE CRUCIBLE is a masterpiece. Bravo for everyone.
