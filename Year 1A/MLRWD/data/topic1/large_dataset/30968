The first thing that struck me about this film is that it should've done better than it did. Based on Philip K Dick's short story, "Impostor" delivers the goods, surpassing this summer's other PKD celluloid offering, "Minority Report", in every aspect. Gary Sinise, Vincent D'Onofrio, Mekhi Pfifer, & Madeleine Stowe all turn in top-notch performances, & Gary Fleder's direction is absolutely sublime.
One of the intriguing things about the Director's Cut DVD is that it features the original 38-minute short film (essentially the first 25 & last 13 minutes of the theatrical version), which was originally to be the linchpin in a trilogy of sci-fi short movies (and was, I believe, released as such in Japan). The higher-ups at Dimension were so pleased with the results that they gave the go-ahead to make it a full blown feature (kind of a shame for the other two movies), & rightly so.  The film doesn't concentrate so much on the futuristic aspects as the characters, which is what PKD's writing was all about.
No doubt, "Impostor" will get lost in the shuffle of all the hoopla surrounding the somewhat inferior "Minority Report", which is a shame.  This film deserves to be given a fair shake.
