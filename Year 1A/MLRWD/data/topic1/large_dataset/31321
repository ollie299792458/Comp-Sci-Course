I bought this film on VHS, and it comes in two cassettes, roughly half of the film in each cassette.
I loved the first half of this film. Gulliver, his wife, and son - they are all excellent actors; particularly when Gulliver recounts his fabulous adventures to his believing young son - they are a charming duo. Peter O'Toole is also hilarious as the cruel and petty, but adorably tiny, King of Lilliput.
The story is delivered on screen with ingenious skill: remember, there are two stories to be told at once - Gulliver's travels, as he relives them with us, the viewer, and Gulliver after his travels, as he tells them to us, the viewer. These are two sides of the same coin, and the filmmakers weave them together with clever artistry.
In the second half of the film, the novelty of experiencing all of what I've just described wears off, and the travels become aimless wanderings, where Gulliver becomes stern and preachy about the failings of human nature. Things get very boring indeed, but the first half still remains for me both fresh and endearingly funny. If only the first half of this film was made, I imagine I'd be giving "Gulliver's Travels, Unfinished" the full five stars.
