For a long time I had heard about the movie Gargoyles but I was never able to see it because no one ever had it on. Then one day, I was doing a google search for it and saw that it was on DVD and decided to take a chance. Man am I glad I did. Gargoyles came out of that great era of television when broadcast networks had weekly movies and mini-series in which the people involved actually cared about their work, no matter what. In the movie, we have a professor of folklore played by the great but sadly late and mostly forgotten Cornel Wilde who is traveling in the southwest with his daugther to hear a story from what appears to be a crazy old man. However, as the old man is telling his story, the building they are in is attacked by horrific monsters. These are the Gargoyles, the evil ones. Now this summary may sound like any other monster movie you've ever seen. But what really makes this movie stand above so many others is the makeup. The makeup in this movie is so real looking that if I was walking down a dark alley and someone jumped out at me with this makeup on, I would probably die of fright. For a movie made in 1972 for television, that is nothing short of amazing. Although, if you look at the credits for this movie, I guess it should come as no suprise since the amazing Stan Winston was involved. Bottom line, if you love good monster movies, don't miss this movie. You would only be robbing yourself.
