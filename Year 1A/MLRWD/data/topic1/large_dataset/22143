In my modest movie collection, there are very few Nicole Kidman movies because I simply don't like her personality. In Bewitched, though, she outshines everything else (except for The Hours, in which she is equally good yet different of course) she has ever done. She completely embraces and lives her character, making it a very entertaining, lighthearted and just fun to watch picture. Will Ferrell, though not in his best role, definitely puts his best foot forward within the limitations of the script and his more famous counterpart. I enjoy comedies only when they are well done. This is one of the better ones, even if it's just because of the subject and that the story is well directed. Watched it several times and I highly recommend it. For those who have given this a bad rating, hey, I have my bad days too and I have written a negative review myself even when the movie didn't quite deserve it. Hope you're having a better day today and can appreciate this witty comedy with an outstanding performance of Nicole Kidman.
