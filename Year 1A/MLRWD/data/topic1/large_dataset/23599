This movie was intersting from begining to end.I didn't see this movie when it first came out in 1986.I was only 11 years old at the time so I somehow missed it but I am so glad I've seen it now.I thought the acting was great and it had many good characters.It was intersting to see Ayla in many stages of her life,from child,teenager and adult.You get to see how hard it was living back then and appreciate that your living here and now.I thought the costumes were good but one of my minor complaints of this movie was that Daryl Hanna was to well groomed.Her hair was nice compared to the rest of them and she had nice white teeth while the rest of them had yellow teeth.If she did take care of herself better that the rest of the clan we never saw this in the movie.Also she had no hair on her legs.I thought the ending could have been a little better.It leaves you wondering what happens next.They should've made a sequel.I haven't read the books(didn't know there was one)so my review is not a comparision to the book.I love movies from the 80's and prehistoric movies like this and if you do too,you will probably like it but if you didn't grow up in the 80's and are the younger generation and don't care to much for these kind of movies(cavemen)than you might not appreciate it but give it a chance.You might surprise yourself.
