I loved Little Dorrit as a novel.  But I could not make heads or tails of the dvds.  It was a kaleidoscope of complexity that did not progress, but also did not end in a satisfying manner.  I require that all film end in a way that makes me more deeply understanding of the basic story.  There were some themes that came through: the pride of little Dorrit's father in his elevated role inside the debtor's prison, but the little Dorrit I imagined from the novel was not an insignificant figure, a simple tattered waif.  She had something compelling about her in the novel that transcended her pecuniary status.

I am not angry at the people at BBC who tried to bring this novel to film.  But they need to try again, and I will buy it if they do.  I must read the novel again in order to even understand the dvd.  It is a hodge-podge of miscellany from the novel that does not explain the novel.  I can imagine how hard it is to do Little Dorrit.  I know only two people personally who have read it, my sister whom I practically bludgeoned into it, and my old, favorite college professor in English who really cared for it, as I did and do.  It is one of my favorite English novels.

Maybe I need to say I love the BBC and Masterpiece theater.  I adore what they did with Jane Eyre.  I had read the novel, been to the pastor's cottage, seen all the many graves, walked Top Withens.  And I feel they did marvelous things with the Jane Eyre dvd which I watch often, but Little Dorrit is not whole, does not exemplify the little child grown into a woman who was little Dorrit  in a debtor's prison.  I cannot help the people who made this film.  I could not read my novels by Dickens aloud to my husband because they did not translate from reading to speaking.  I only know I read almost every Dickens' novel that existed, save Pickwick Papers.  I loved Dickens' novels.  It took me almost a year to work through them.  And in that year I discovered Little Dorrit, which I had great liking for.
