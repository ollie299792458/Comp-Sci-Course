First of all, this movie is of course awesome.  One of my all-time favorites.  The Extras on this DVD are great too.  The documentary is about 60 minutes long and very entertaining and interesting.
Now the disaapointments:
In the details for the DVD it says there is footage from Bill Paxton's 'home movies' shot during astronaut training.  I can't find them on the disc at all.
The biggest disappointment is the way this movie was converted to WIDE SCREEN format.  Wide Screen format, when viewed on a standard TV is supposed to give you more to see, but of course a smaller picture due to the black strips at the top and bottom.
With most wide screen formats (like Castaway for instance) I lose about 25% of the screen to the black bars - no big deal, you see more of the original movie.
But, with Apollo 13 the wide screen black bars take up literally 50% of my screen.  And, to top that off you are NOT actually getting more in the picture.  I compared my old Full Screen VHS version side-by-side to the Wide Screen DVD version, and I literally lost half of the view.  There was very little gained on the outer edges.  Very poor - it looks like they actually took the Full Screen version and covered it up with black bars.
Looking back, I still think I would buy this because of the documentary film.... but beware of how much you lose with the Wide Screen format.  If I want to watch the movie, I actually use my VHS tape instead of the DVD.
5 STARS for the movie itself, and the Extras - but because of the lost images in wide screen format, i give it 2 stars in the end.
Anyone else notice this big in the wide screen format?  Is is because this is an older film?
