Having first watched this as a teenager when it was shown as an afternoon movie on a B&W TV in a heavily edited version, I really looked forward to seeing this for "the first time" as an adult.  I wasn't disappointed!

In many ways, it's almost painfully innocent invoking a time when comedy didn't have to make sense or rely on fart jokes as punch lines.  To me, Help! invokes the spirit of my favorite Marx Brothers film, Duck Soup.  The four Beatles, while not as distinctive here as the four Marxes, seem to be having a grand time running around in a crazy not-quite-real world that isn't too far removed from Duck Soup's Freedonia.  The film's logic operates on its own level and that works just fine.

The humor--to use a modern term--is "politically incorrect," basing the chase for the ring on a quasi Hindu and/or Muslim beliefs as filtered through Western screenwriters and their bag of cliches.  It's dated, but its still funny if you can get past the stereotypes.

The film itself plays around with the form, using titles, self-reflexive joking around, and all in all silliness.  The thin plot is like the best of the Marx Brothers, nothing more than a place to hang the jokes and schtick on.  On that level Help! really is a lot of fun, plus all that great Beatles music.

The DVD is filled with goodies and the print is fantastic, rich in color.  The short documentary on how the film was restored is well worth watching.
