I actually bought this movie because I enjoyed the soundtrack CD by Pat Metheny so much, and because the reviews here on Amazon are favorable.  I got more than I expected from this movie.  It's so good that Metheny's music is overwhelmed by the drama.  I won't go into summarizing the plot, as several other reviewers have done that very well.

If only Sigourney had kept her clothes on, this would be a perfect film for almost the whole family.  She delivers an excellent performance, as do Julianne Moore and David Strathairn.  The gratuitous sex scenes and home sex video banter amongst the couples should have been left on the cutting room floor to improve the movie.  I saw enough of Sigourney in the movie Alien...not that I'm complaining!

This movie highlights how pack-driven we as a people can be in damning innocent people.  You see it often in newspapers and magazines.  That said, if I were in her place I would be racked with guilt at having let the little girl out of my sight long enough for her to reach that body of water next to their house.  It's not like the pond just suddenly appeared at dawn.  Heck, a fence only costs a couple of hundred bucks to put up yourself.

Buy it, enjoy it, have a good cry, but keep your finger ready on the fast forward button to skip the aging-actress skin scenes.
