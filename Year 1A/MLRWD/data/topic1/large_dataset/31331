I was literally rolling on the floor laughing at this movie.  It is hysterical to Nth degree.  Ryan Reynolds is brilliant as always.

Amy Smart plays the girl Reynolds has been pining over since High School, when he was over weight and trapped in the "friends" category.  Due to shaming and ridicule, Reynolds leaves New Jersey, his home, and heads to LA where he loses weight and becomes a high powered record exec.

Needing a star, the record company Reynolds works for, or rather his boss (brilliantly played by Stephen Root), has pegged Anna Farris to be the next Big One.  And like so many stars today, Farris turns out to be a no-talent, annoying, hack in the movie - think Paris Hilton (in real life I think Anna is a great actress).

Instructed to stay by their new star's side, Reynolds soon finds himself stranded back home in New Jersey where he of course runs back into Smart.  Bascially hillarity ensures and you will have to stop the movie at times due to fits of laughter.

One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, this is truly a must own.
