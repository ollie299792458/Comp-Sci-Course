Nashville and The Long Goodbye are two of my favorite films of all time.  Both are masterpieces of cinema that I can pretty much watch any time.  This is unfortunately very weak Altman in my book with a terrible performance by George Segal.  The film starts great and has a nice realistic feel to most of the proceedings and then spirals downhill for the rest of the film without any real sense of direction or purpose.  The cinematography and Elliot Gould's performance keep you watching for the most part but this film grated on me after I awhile.  If you want a really good gambling movie about loveable loser's who've lost their way then check out PTA's Hard Eight(Sydney)...Probably the best film about the dark and seedy world of gambling ever made.  The fact is "Split" doesn't even work as a comedy...The only real humor in the film (which is funny mind you-don't get me wrong) comes from minstrel tunes and Gould's trying to figure out all the names of the seven dwarfs.  Otherwise this is a serious disspointment from one of America's most innovative filmmakers.
