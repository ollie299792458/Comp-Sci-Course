The first half of this movie is fairly good.  It establishes the presence of a serial killer, it gives us decent characterization of the main cast, and the story is intriguing.  Something evil is happening on a certain subway train at 2:06 AM, and we want to know what it is.  Unfortunately the entire films falls apart during the second half.

During the second act, the film changes focus and become the stereotypical torture-porn Lion's Gate is notorious for with their other "goreno" films.  It's as if the film was split down the middle between Clive Barker's original short story and Jeff Buhler's screenplay.  To add insult to injury (no pun intended), every primary plot point that was hinted upon is thrown aside, every seeming truth to the narrative is sunk, and the four or five revelations as to what is going on are nothing but gaping, nonsensical plot holes that the film does not even attempt to answer.  It will just throw out a ridiculously bizarre situation, but it will take no means to explain or even placate us as to what the heck is happening.  What was that scarification committed upon on the main character?  What was killing people?  Where did It come from?  What is It?!

I haven't read the original material, so I have no idea if the plot is revealed in the short story or not.  But as for a film, it doesn't work for me because midway through it stops being a character driven thriller and it devolves into near mindless exposition, "The Matrix" inspired scenes, and CGI gore without any intent to deliver anything except this.  It wastes the otherwise good performances by the principal  cast, and it throws aside any redeeming qualities it could have offered.  I'm not sure what Buhler was trying to say in his film, but to me it didn't work.  Fans of "Saw", "Hostel" and "C.H.U.D." may like this film, but if you want more than hack and slash, try something else.
