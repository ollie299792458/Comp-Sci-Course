It was only recently that I watched the anime series that preceded this movie, and I will say that all of my comparisons are between this and the movie as I have not read the manga. It is possible the movie is truer to the manga, but I doubt it.

The movie overall is not bad, but as you would expect any lengthy piece of fiction being crammed into a two hour movie, they had to approach it from a different angle. The character portrayals are spot on, even Ryuk the shinigami, although the acting is a little over-the-top. They use the cliche of newspaper headlines multiple times throughout the movie to demonstrate the enormity and number of Kira's (the main character) crimes. The other thing that throws me is that they not only subtracted some storylines, but they added some new ones as well, which you don't usually expect in a film conversion. The movie starts with him in college, rather than high school, though he experiences much of the same events. However, he has a girlfriend with him for much of this movie that didn't exist at all in the anime. They also stretched out another character's role in the story (Naomi) and changed some names (pointless). They do keep the main arc of the story intact, and perhaps the new additions are just so fans would have something new they haven't already seen in the anime...I will admit it is kind of cool the way it works out. I think anybody that has done a little bit of research will realize that this movie does not really have its own ending, rather it is continued in the second film.

If you are not as fanatical about the anime as I am (it is the best), you can take or leave my review. The whole movie, I was commenting on how this was/wasn't like the anime...but if you just need some more Death Note in your life, I highly recommend it (though you really should watch the anime first and learn the story beginning to end with all its beautiful characters and nuances).
