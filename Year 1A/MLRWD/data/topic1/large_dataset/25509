I have read so many critics' reviews and can't believe how badly this movie is trashed. I have seen it and don't think it's such a piece of gargage as they describe. It does have some weaknesses that can be improved. Considering how many junks Hollywood rolls out every year, I actually enjoy this movie. I don't think they give Madonna enough credits for trying hard and indeed made some improvement in acting. She gives a credible and convincing performance and she actually does a better job than in "Evita." At least that is how I feel. 
Her performance here (the first half) is quite similar to the one she did for BMW "The Hire" series. ... She did a good comic job there. (Yes, she plays a spoiled star and as easy as it sounds, no, acting is not easy.) 
A lot of people are going to dislike this movie because it's so "unAmerican," just as much as they will find other European movies bewildering and unsettling, for example, "La Pianiste." 
The tone of the film changes after 1/2 of it and it just got better. The chemistry between Madonna and the handsome leading man Adriano Giannini is infectious and only makes her transformation more convincing. Adriano does a wonderful job and especially to the end. The ending does make my eyes wet. It's entertaining and that is what I want from my [admission].
