I first hear about this movie when I came to college. I finally got to see it and IT IS AMAZING! The only thing I didn't like about it was that it ended and there isn't a sequel.

Virginia made for a pretty good heroine having to come to terms with a past that she can't wuite recall.

Tony makes great strides to overcome his selfishness and cowardace, and becomes a lovable and strong character.

Wolf was by far my favorite. Aside from being completely hot, he's so wonderfully sweet when he's not trying to eat everyone. As a half wolf, struggling to stay on the side of humanity, wonderful performance by Scott Cohen. He's probably one of the most complex characters of any film. He goes back and forth between trying to help Virginia return to NY and trying to keep her in the 9 kingdoms with him. Some of his choices aren't always the best and it gets him in trouble, but he's trying.

This movie is more geared towards teens and young adults, a lot of the content (violence, some of Wolf's behavior) isn't appropriate for young kids, and some of the older scene might not appreciate the slightly random/fantasy aspect of the movie.

Watch this movie. Split it up if you have to, but all at once is much more enjoyable. Make a day (or a night) of it. We just had a party and watched all seven hours in a row. It might have been four in the morning when it was over, but it was sooooo worth it.
