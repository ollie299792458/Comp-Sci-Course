JR reviewer gets it right. As adult fans of both HP books and movies this one just missed it by miles. I think we all need to chant loud enough together to shake the earth under Warner's feet...."WE WANT THE BATTLE>>>>WE WANT THE FUNERAL>>>>WE WANT A WEE BIT MORE ACCURACY to the book. But insulting the fans by not including the great battle at the end closer to the books rendition was most unkind. Not just unthoughtful but down right mean and cruel. I was upset many years ago after Chris Columbus first assured he would make all 7 movies and stay as close to the books as was reasonable.... his "all actors have to be UK born" rhetoric& promises to both JKR and...the world viewers. Yet when most are 8-12 year olds and as adult fans we too could care less about the MOVIE BIZ perse which CC was really concerned and posturing to back then. But then what happened....by Movie 3...CC was bored stiff and wanted out & somehow he was allowed to distance himself....so what does CC make of this mess. I would like to see JK Rowling herself step up if she has anything to say these days about the let down of this movie to her fans. And also please Ms. Rowling....please if you have influence rights still make sure the next so called two movie episodes will be done to honor the viewers and readers and all YOUR fans alike...do it right Warners. This missed by a mile. What happened? Warner insulted not just the fans of course but Rowling herself.  I debated on giving it only a 1 star. But there were some redeeming parts. The responsible people behind this sad cut needs to be kicked to the curve. Make the movie longer to tell it right if you need to...kids and adult fans alike would agree. Anyone up for a remake of this one? Send your votes to Warners!
