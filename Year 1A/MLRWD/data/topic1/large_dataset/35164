It only took 18 years, but they finally got right the homevideo release of this horror camp classic.  In 1983, Vestron Videoreleased THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES on VHS. ...it featured differentorgan music and a too-clean video transfer.  (The music change was NOTindicated on the box.)  This RUINED the movie for me.  In themid-'90s, this same version began popping up on The Movie Channel andAmerican Movie Classics.  (The music was STILL WRONG.)  Now, with thiswonderful new DVD edition, you can enjoy DR. PHIBES the way it wasmeant to be enjoyed -- with the ORIGINAL music (every single note isin intact and sounds great) and a beautiful video transfer.  At thisprice ... order 2 copies -- one for a friend who enjoys clever horrormovies with a little kitsch.  By the way, I also bought the new DVDrelease of the sequel -- DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN -- and the picture andsound quality is also uniformly excellent.  And it's fun to see bothof the original trailers too.  Sorry to gush so much, but I'mabsolutely ecstatic that these 2 movies are finally given the homevideo treatment they deserve.  Thank you, MGM Home Video.  Now, ifthey'd just release THEATER OF BLOOD in similar fashion .... (maybethey will, given that that movie is also an MGM title).
