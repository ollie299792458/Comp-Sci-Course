Frankly, I don't mind the resident evil movies, but I don't like them that much either but this third installment is just... lousy, of course the zombies look great and there are plenty of cool action shots etc, its a hollywood product so that can go without saying and since it should be expected doesn't play any role as to how I rated this film.
What I'm talking about is the total lack of any story, characters still so stupid they don't immediately aim for the head (though they finally have a few gooey headshots though no complete head splatters but the majority are the quick head jerk cut aways from resident evils past), and total lack of any sort of characterization aside from lining up for food, driving, searching for cigarettes or screaming while getting eaten that's it and even that's done on a completely generic level, I didn't care about any of the 1 dimensional characters, exactly as in the previous resident evil movies. The lack of any cool mutations showing up, as in the video games, is really disappointing though the evil scientist mutating into the monster from the end of the original video game did make me shout with glee, but too little too late.
Anyway this movie is definitely not worth seeing in theaters, it does nothing the other two didn't already do before and even when it throws in something seemingly new it's taken directly from the original resident evil video game (the crows and boss mutation) instead of at least using a more recent game, anyway shouldn't they have done that kinda thing earlier, you know in the first movie! Simply wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it if you just have to see it.
