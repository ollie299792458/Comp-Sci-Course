Get Carter is one of the best motion pictures of the 1970's and perhaps the greatest British criminal themed film of all time.  Michael Caine has never had a better role nor delivered as deceptively intense and deep an acting performance.  To propose this when Caine is one of the greatest actors to have lived on the planet is saying a mouthful.  Like POINT BLANK (1967) was with the great John Boorman and Lee Marvin co-creating, Mike Hodges and Michael Caine in 1971 created a steely no-apologies masterpiece.  The only wonder is that British MGM and American MGM meddling executives at the time allowed the film to be released without destructive compromising cuts for commercialism and what is now called political correctness.  The supporting cast is uniformaly dead-on.  The perhaps unrecognized co-star of the film is the cold-sobering, gritty, pre-Thatcher English location of Newcastle.  Long live Michael Caine and long live the ballsy gentlemen like Jack Carter.  Also, for outstanding source material that does Mickey Spillane proud, check out the Jack Carter novels by the late Ted Lewis.
