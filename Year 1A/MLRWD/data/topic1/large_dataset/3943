Glengarry Glen Ross is a flawless film adaptation of Mamet's pulitzer winning play. The characters in this film are drawn with a lightning bolt, each one his own man. Ed Harris and Jack Lemmon are absolutely riveting. Much has been said about Lemmon's performance and it seems like Harris's Moss is often overlooked. These are my two favorite actors and if you watch the subtle expressions on Ed Harris's face as he gets screamed at by Alec Baldwin you'll know what I mean. Lemmon is pathetic as the "machine" in a performance that deserved more recognition as well. I hate to single out these two in such a wonderful cast but they're just too good. Pacino gives a flashier performance which was good, maybe too flashy in some areas. The other actors, Arkin, Spacey, Price, deliver but aren't in the same league as the above three. I find myself talking about performances but it's difficult not to when the writing and acting are this superb. Watch this movie. It is truely one of the great films of the past decade.
