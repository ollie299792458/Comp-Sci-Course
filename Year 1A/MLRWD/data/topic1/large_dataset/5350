This is a magnificent film that does an incredible job of making one of Shakespeare's most difficult, least sympathetic tragic heroes -- not to mention one of his most challenging plays, period -- readily accessible to the modern audience. It's remarkable how Fiennes and company have translated the story and language to the modern world. The way the occasional television news commentators speak Shakespeare's text is almost enough to cause one to think that he had CNN in mind when he wrote it. And Fiennes's portrayal of Coriolanus makes me recall my college Shakespeare professor's evocative characterization of a true tragic hero: a lion chained down in the middle of the road, pulling at the chains, trying desperately to escape the steamroller approaching him, but who, when he realizes he cannot escape, turns around and charges the steamroller.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the film itself but rather with its DVD extras, which are meager. The "making of" bonus feature is almost laughably brief, coming to an abrupt, almost jarring end just when it was really starting to get good. And Fiennes's own running commentary on the film is interesting enough but unexceptional. It would have been nice to hear from Butler, Redgrave, and/or Cox as well.

Still, I don't buy Shakespeare films for the extras. Even if there were no bonus features at all, I would still highly recommend "Coriolanus." It's the Bard on steroids, but without the brain damage sometimes attributed to such performance-enhancing drugs.
