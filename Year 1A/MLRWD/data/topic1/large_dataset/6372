To my chagrin, while viewing "The Naked Gun" on CD at home, it grubbed my attention that John Hauseman's name was omitted both from the opening and closing credits for this movie.
In spite of the fact, that in the commentary to this movie, by its producers, writers, and director they bragged that they had to remember and credit any person; no matter how tiny was his contribution. Indeed they didn't "forget" the names of supernumeraries', stand-outs, even the names of a man and a woman from the firework deleted scene are remembered and credited. But, John Houseman's name was omitted; a person of stature in the film and theater industry, a producer, drama teacher, an Oscar winner actor for "The Paper Chase" as Prof. Kingsfield. JH had a memorable  cameo scene  as a driving instructor, yet his name was skipped and he was deprived of all credits for this movie ;it's not only saddening but a gross injustice too.
The first time I saw " The Naked Gun" was in a movie theater in Israel. When JH appeared on screen, there was a joyful shouting all over the hall: "Professor Kingsfield!! ...Kingsfield ...did you see that?! ". J.H. is known all over the world and yet already forgotten by his own peers....
The movie is entertaining, witty and satirical with slapstick situations that confer light mood and belly-laughs.
