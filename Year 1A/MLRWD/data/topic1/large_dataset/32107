The City of Lost Children is absuloutely the greatest film ever made. From Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro comes a twisted fairy tale with a load of villains and heros. It bases in a strange, twisted, floating city. Where a  carnival strongman takes a poor, homeless boy into his home. But the evil  Cyclops that terrorize the city kidnap. That's when the adventure begins.  He then goes searching for him and teams up with a small girl named Miette.  Together, the strong man (One) and Miette. Go searching for the lost boy.  They soon enter a strange underworld. Learning that a madman played  perfectly by Daniel Emilfork, a Princess, and six bumbling, clumbsy clones  are kidnapping childre because the madman(Krank) was created with the  others by a perfessor and Krank can't dream. So now they kidnap children  and steal their dreams. But all the children fear him and have nightmares.  Krank soon buys One's child from the Cyclops and uses him in his master  plan. Now Miette and One bind a relationship while two evil twins hunt them  down, while meeting a strange scuba diver, a psychotic circusman, and the  Cyclops layer. All of the adventure is jammed pack into one movie. It's my  favorite, I can't take my eyes off of it. See this film! The Directors and  great and also directed a similar film, Delicatessan.
