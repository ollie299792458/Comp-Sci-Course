Ok, let me tell you, this video is excellent. I've been struggling with my weight for a long time, and sure, I'm pretty young and will probably lose weight faster, but this video ALWAYS gives me motivation and results!

I don't even do the full hour when I do it. I just do the cardio, because it's REALLY hard, but it flies by. I think my knees hurt because I don't always do the poses right, and you definitely need a yoga mat for some of the workouts because your feet can slip and it gets REALLY annoying, but it's SO good. I'm not doing it right now, but I just wanted people to know that I absolutely love the video. I'm thinking of starting on it again. I've had it for four years and never really pulled through all 21 days, however, I think if I did, I'd have gotten an excellent body.

I know people say it's unhealthy to lose more than a pound of fat a week, but Denise had me losing POUNDS a week. Not to mention inches! You also feel really good about yourself afterwards, not because "you did it", but because yoga just makes you feel really good.

Over all, fantastic.
