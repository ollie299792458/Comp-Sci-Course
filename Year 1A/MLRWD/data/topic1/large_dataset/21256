The first time I met Charlie Beardsley he was staring intently at the window of a diner at the corner of Market and Larkin St. Inside the diner sat his ex-wife, Sheila, a woman that had engaged in acts with his best friend and then promptly announced to her family that she was a lesbian. She changed her mind only days after the divorce was final and she was now living with the owner of the diner in Pac Heights. Charlie Beardsley had not taken the news well, and spent most afternoons finding different reasons to leave work and stare through the window at the woman he used to spend his days with.

I stood on the corner waiting to cross the street when I noticed him. He turned away from the window and stared out at the street, and then back around and inside. I watched his routine and then couldn't help but walk over and ask what he was doing.  As it turns out, he was eager to be lead astray. We walked together towards an unknown destination while he told me his story. He spoke quickly and quietly until he got to the subject of his best friend. "A man that goes places he shouldn't, that argues with people in stores, at intersections, on buses and trains, and curses at children. And yet, she found him attractive." I asked him if he wanted to get a cup of coffee. I'm not sure why I felt an affinity for him. He looked to be older than me by at least ten years, with worn clothing that had, at one time, cost a week's paycheck. He declined my offer and said that he was thinking of leaving San Francisco.

A year later, he was still staring at the window of the diner on the corner of Market and Larkin.
