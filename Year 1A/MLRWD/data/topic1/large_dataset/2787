I don't understand people who give this 2 or 3 stars. Either you like cheese, in which case, 4 at least, or you don't, in which case a low score of 1. It's a 5 for me.

Hammer was a movie production studio in Great Britain, back when Britain was still pretty great. They made what I consider highbrow horror cheese. Highbrow because it generally had great atmospherics, and either reference to history, literature or folklore. This one is an exceptionally good example of the breed.

The motley collection of perverts and ne'er do wells on the doomed ship are marvellous B-movie character studies. The desperate captain, the dorky first mate, the drunk, the sexbomb, the pervert, the plucky ship's engineer, the woman on the lam; you love them and hate them. There are cheesy monsters, lost continents, killer plants, psychological drama and evil Spanish heretical fascists who are dealt with using that great friend of all proper Englishmen, the Lee-Enfield bolt action rifle. The title is evocative of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and I suppose it is sort of Dennis Wheatley (the writer, who wrote many of Hammer's better films) take on a Burroughs story.

You don't really watch such movies. You drink beer and eat nachos with your pals while you watch this in the background. You hiss and cheer and slap your knee at the good parts and the bad villains, and you enjoy the way these admirable misfits deal with really scary things like giant scorpions or 16th century nazi papist Spaniards in KKK uniforms. There are movies you pay close attention to; those have their place, but unless you're dead, one must watch cowboy and indian type entertainments. This is a rollicking good one.
