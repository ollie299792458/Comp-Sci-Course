My daughter who is just 20 months loves the video, especially the song 'its potty time'. She asks for the video, switches the player on herself and then goes and picks up her potty (which has elmo making a high five on it) from the bathroom and gets it out in front of the TV and watches the video. The excitement she has in anticipation of Elmo opening the door and coming out of the bathroom is very obvious.

We have been teaching her about the potty with books and toilet sessions for sometime now and then we came upon this video with its potty time song on youtube and showed it to our daughter and it was an instant hit. We had to buy the DVD and I tell you its extremely useful. It talks about pee and poo very openly and about dealing with anxieties that might arise during this phase.

She has been watching the video for a week now and today for the first time asked to sit on the potty stating a possible poop and sat down with her pants and diaper off. Though she did not do anything its obvious she is getting the idea of what its all about.

I encourage every parent to give this DVD a try and any other resource they can get their hands on that is able to get their child to engage actively with and make this phase of learning and transition free of embarrassment and filled with fun.
