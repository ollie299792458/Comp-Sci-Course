I'm currently so very filled with total admiration for this brilliant and, forgive me, seemingly annointed story teller, actor, director, music composer, producer, I hardly know where to begin! I had NO clue who Tyler Perry was until one night a few months ago. I was a bit down in the dumps and I picked out this film from my local video store. I merely thought it would  give me a few laughs, as I needed them at the time.  Well, dear ones, hold on to your hat, hearts and kleenex as this film and this MAN are so much more!  Madea's Family Reunion is "dramady" (drama/comedy) and both styles are perfectly joined together in this film! The acting, comedy and drama are first rate! Not to mention the varied and important lessons it imparts to everyone! The closing scenes of the family reunion are powerful and poignant with the brilliant Cicely Tyson teaching the family of today, what they've seemed to have lost unless the new generation of family doesn't learn to have more respect and love for each other. If I could I  would love to MEET Tyler Perry and personally thank him, from the bottom of my heart, for this film that spoke to me in so many ways, and continues to bless me! With laughter and with tears! God bless you, Mr. Perry! You are amazing! MUST SEE! OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
