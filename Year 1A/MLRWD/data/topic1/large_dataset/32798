As I was seeing "La Mala Educacion" the first weekend it opened in New York, I kept thinking to myself "This is a remake!"

The Madrid film director (surely Almodovar himself) as the central character, the transexual former choirboy who confronts his childhood priest-mentor after having "changed so much"

All of this and more were in "Law of Desire" (La Ley del Deseo) a film from 20 years ago in which a much younger and hotter Antonio Banderas was obsessed with a film director (Eusebio Poncela who looks remarkably like Fele Martinez, the director in Bad educacion) Also in it is Carmen Maura as the transexual former choirboy who has become a film star.

This was such an important film for Almodovar that he named his company "El Deseo S.A." and as I see this it's no wonder why this movie of all his movies is out of print and not available for purchase.

See the original that caused an uproar in the Berlin Film Festival 20 years ago.

See the movie that brought Los Panchos, Ne Me Quitte Pas and Bola de Nieve to my life. La Ley del Deseo is a movie that blows "La Mala educacion" away
