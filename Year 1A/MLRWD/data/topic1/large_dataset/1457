World War II was over and MGM celebrated by producing a lavish MGM musical in Technicolor with their #1 musical star, Judy Garland.  Unfortunately, many of the MGM musicals during the war period were shot in black and white  as a way to save money.  
The song that opens the film "In The  Valley Where the Evening Sun Goes Down", sung by Ms. Garland is  beautiful.  The male lead is played here by John Hodiak although for a  time MGM considered Clark Gable.  This idea was abandoned due to Judy's  earlier hit "Dear Mr. Gable".  Additional cast members include  Ray Bolger (scarecrow in WIZARD OF OZ), Angela Lansbury (one of the  "dancing" girls), Cyd Charisse (another Harvey Girl) and Marjorie  Main (Ma Kettle, and also in Judy's MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and SUMMER  STOCK).
The plot here is somewhat thin but the musical score holds it  together.  The big production number, ON THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA AND THE SANTA  FE is spectacular.  Notice how everyone gets into this song from the bar  waitresses to the engineer on the train and eventually, Judy enters (her  entrance is similar to Sarah Bernhardt entering the great stage!) and sings  the verse and a chorus.  The songs here were arranged by Kay Thompson, who  was a good friend of Judy's at MGM and Liza's Godmother.
Judy looks  beautiful and her voice is exquisite here.  Shortly after the filming ended  on this production, Judy married her director from Meet Me in St. Louis and  The Clock, Vincente Minnelli.  
HARVEY GIRLS is certainly an enjoyable  film.
