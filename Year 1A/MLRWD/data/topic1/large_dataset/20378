They say that Woodstock is coming out on blue-ray in 2009, Fitting I since it will be the 40th Anniversary.  But I do have a question for Warner Bros who own the outakes to the footage of the  1969 concert.

If there's a DVD worth of Jimi Hendrix performances not used in the original documentary but were edited and released to the public, Imagine what other performances exist of bands who performed at the concert.

If you read up on the making of the film, they say original runtime of the "first cut" of the film was 14 hours.  I'd have to guess that there are more performances sitting in the vault waiting for them to be transfered and conformed to HD and mixed.  It would be nice if they were available for download or it would be great if we could get them on DVD or blu-ray.  There are other considerations that need to be considered.  The artists, the producers of the film, as well as Woodstock Ventures would need to be compensated and that is probably the sticking point for all parties involved including Warners Brothers.

Come on Warners, hire a guy to oversee the release of these outake performances!
