Warning: the cut of the film on this DVD is so poor, it makes it not worth getting. Criterion put this film out on Laser Disc based on a print made in 1961. That's the one to own. 
I lived by Maltin as my bible. And in many cases, that was a very bad choice. Because of his reviews of this and 'Lady from Shanghai' I stayed away from them. When I saw this for the first time I thought I'd lost my mind. This is such a rich, wonderful film. Sure, Welles didn't get to finish editing it, but that doesn't bother me much at all. What is left is still one of the most ambitious and interesting movies of all time. The sheen of it may not match Citizen Kane, but there is much more going on in the film itself. (Perfect explanation of why Americans slighted it and Europeans rightly voted it one of the most important films of all time.) 
In a lot of ways, Mr. Arkadin is a recapitulation of the Kane theme, but this time, the truth of the character doesn't elude its pursuers only to be revealed to the viewer (Rosebud), the secret is that there was no secret and the whole tangle just disappears in a puff of smoke. There is so much going on in this film, it takes many viewings just to sort it out. There are also some of the greatest moments of Welles career like his telling of the parable of the scorpion and the frog. Sorry Lenny, you are CLUELESS on this one, Dude.
