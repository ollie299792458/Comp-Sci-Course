Paramount has issued a great picture but dull sound with pops every now and then in the film and I have noticed certain scenes that have color like the lighting of the Nick's and some of the town lights and light at the end corner part of the screen in the Potter's Office scene. If this is a repackaging of the previous Republic video release were there color segments? I don't remember any. Is anybody else seeing this? Was this always a part of the film and if so, I wonder why I hadn't noticed it before. I have been waiting for a decent edition of this movie but still out of luck but hadn't seen the movie in 5 years since I traded in my previous Republic edition and am stuck with this edition until Paramount or some other studio remasters the audio hopefully similar to From Here to Eternity, Jaws, and Wizard of Oz all of which had original Mono soundtracks and now have Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound as well as the new Bond sets!

In conclusion, great movie still poor audio quality.
