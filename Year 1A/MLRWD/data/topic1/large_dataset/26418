Every once in a while a movie does something so out of the ordinary, it makes you desperate for more. You sit on the edge of your seat the entire film biting your nails while you are lost in thought about what is  happening. This is one of those movies. This may even be the greatest  thriller ever made. Yet this movie is not a horror film. It is a fast paced  edge-of-your-seat thriller that does not have to be gruesome to scare the  living daylights out of you. There is one true gruesome scene in the movie,  but the rest is pure psychological suspense. Many films have tried to model  themselves after this masterpiece, but have failed. Jonathan Demme's  "Silence of the Lambs" will leave you begging for more as Dr.  Hannibal Lecter stalks your dreams like a hunter and its prey.
The film  is the tale of Buffalo Bill, a transvestite serial killer who cannot be  traced. Only one man knows what is really going on: Dr Hannibal Lecter.  Lecter is a former psychiatrist who later found a taste for humans. Clarice  Starling is a FBI trainee whose assignment is to meet with Dr. Lecter in  his cell at the insane asylum and find out what makes him tick. Dr. Lecter  and Clarice soon develop a bond never thought possible and begin to share  their deepest thoughts and fears. Clarice begins to find out that Dr.  Lecter knows exactly how to catch Buffalo Bill before he skins his next  victim and is willing to tell Clarice. But that information doesn't come  without a price...
Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career as  the terrifying and mysterious Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter and  shows how true horror lies within your mind. Jodie Foster is absolutely  brilliant as the FBI trainee Clarice Starling, along with the rest of the  cast. This film deserved every Oscar it had won and I am strongly looking  forward to "Hannibal" coming out on February 14, 2001. Highly  recommended!
