This is a Great DVD!  My 3 year-old daughter loves this movie even more than the Wizard of Oz.  
Gene Wilder is spectacular as the "Greatest Magician of them all--Mr. Willy Wonka!"  His ability to shift moods at the flick of cane twirl really makes the movie.  Part mad-scientist, part imaginative child, and part philanthropist, Wilder is funny, frightening, warm, and even pitiable when he needs to be.  
The idea of a magic world behind the gates of a chocolate factory will always hold meaning for imaginative children, who aren't constrained by the knowledge big business and corporate profiteering.  
The Oompa Loompas, by the way, have a real show-stealing nack.  Their dance routines and lectures via song, are my daughter's favorite scenes.  She can do most of their routines, and has memorized their lyrics.
Of course, there is also a very nice story of the first being last and the last being first, and of the gentle inheriting the earth.  So despite a slight amount of 1970's baggage (e.g., all the children are caucasian)the film's message is very admirable.  
A question I would like to know the answer to is, how much the author of "Charlie & and the Chocolate Factory" owes to Dr. Seuss, as it appears there a many Seussian homages in the film?  
A bigger question I have is why this wonderful movie hasn't had more of a Wizard of Oz sort of treatment?  While the Wizard of Oz is shown at least once a year, I never see Willy Wonka on TV.  I also haven't been able to find any Willy Wonka toys for my daughter.  That is one of the reasons it seemed important to have the DVD in our video library.
