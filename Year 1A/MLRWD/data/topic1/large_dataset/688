I remember seeing Homicidal "accidentally" one evening on a local Buffalo, N.Y. T.V. station "late show" at around 12 or 13 yrs old. The perfect age for what was even then an "old" William Castle horror flick. I have not seen that film since that one-time viewing and it's frightening images have stayed in my memory all these years. That's why I was thrilled to see it now available on DVD. I can now see the whole movie, start to finish, with no commercials or editing for television. This film is CREEPY. The unknown actors and their quirky looks and dialogue only served to make the atmosphere of "Homicidal" all the more unsettling. One of the most disturbing scenes in the film: When the justice of the peace who has just married the two main characters goes over to kiss the bride....well, let's just say you might want to cover your eyes on that one. If you love the late 50's early 60's horror/sci-fi stuff....you'll want to add "Homicidal" to your DVD collection.
