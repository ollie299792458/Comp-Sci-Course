PLEASE stop postiving negative (low star) reviews referencing the purchase method. Instead, rate the SHOW instead.

For those that are upset and posting negatively against GLEE due to this being a Full Season DVD Set.. Guess what.. Some of us researched and knew how the release was going to happen at the END of the season and DO want to purchase the Full Set. There IS another purchase option for those that already purchased the first part of Season 1 earlier!!! Check out "Glee: Season One, Vol. 2 - Road to Regionals". See? We can ALL be happy!

Now on to the show itself.. WOW! What an amazing first season! GLEE is so much more than a "one-trick pony". It's full of comedy, drama, issues, musical entertainment.. We have laughed and cried, usually in the same episodes! It has been amazing to watch from start to finish and see the characters emerge and grow. This is one of those shows that I can watch a single episode over and over in a row, as I love to sing along. At the end of the season, we aren't left considering what can they pull out of their hats for next season.. we are left excited over the amazing number of possibilities left to explore.
