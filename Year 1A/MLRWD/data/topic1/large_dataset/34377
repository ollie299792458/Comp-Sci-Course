I love this movie.  More accurately: I love Jane Fonda in this movie.  Anytime she opens those big eyes (or shows off those legs) I am mesmerized.  Jane is magnetically sexy (accentuated by great costume design including thigh-high boots, fishnets, skin-tight unitards, etc.) and what ultimately draws me to mulitple viewings of this film.

The story, while usually not important for this kind of movie, is actually somewhat original and made interesting by Jane Fonda's devotion to her role and the sometimes hysterical dialogue.  The acting, for the most part, is average in this movie, but Jane is brilliant and so is Anita Pallenberg in a small role as the Great Tyrant/Black Queen ("My Pretty Pretty").  Anita is also exceptionally beautiful and incredibily sexy.

Notes on the DVD:  While it lacks any special features, the picture is great (although occasionally grainy) and it shows off the wonderful cinematography, great colors, and stylistic set designs (and the wonderful Jane Fonda, of course).  I first saw this movie on AMC and it was somewhat edited, but the DVD thankfully restores the nudity, which is not entirely important but adds to the ambience that makes the film great.

Overall it's a cheesy movie but a pretty good one, and if you don't take it too seriously, you may enjoy it.
