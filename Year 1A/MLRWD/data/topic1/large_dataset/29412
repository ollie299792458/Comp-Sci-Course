How my ratings work:
5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

True this film has some (and others would say many) flaws in it, but just about every movie does. One of the biggest would be the whole drug dealer plot. So why do I give this movie 5 stars? For many reasons.

1) I enjoy the performances; DeNiro and Hoffman are superb in their roles and work well off each other. I even like the supporting roles, even if they are over the top at times.

2) I like the main story and theme; how two very different people can connect. Walter and Rusty share one thing in common, lonliness, a desire for companionship (in love and in friendship).

3) I think it's well made, production wise. The music works well and the look of the cinematography gives it a grimey yet hopeful feel. The sets and costumes are also good.

4) And the final reason for the rating is writer/director Joel Schumacher. After his disaster with the Batman films he did, and others people may have not liked, Schumacher has returned to basics with simpler projects. He's wokring his way back up in the film ladder; Phantom of the Opera was his return to the bigger budgeted films, and he did well with that.

This film is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, but people should give it a chance.
