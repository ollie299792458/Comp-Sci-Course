This movie is  based on a true story about the lives of two women little edie and big edie bouvier beale mother(jessica Lang) and daughter(Drew barrymore)who were closely related to Jackie O and  who because of different disastrous events in their lives end up living day to day in a 28 room house with no running water or electricity. it was a wonderful insight into the world before Grey Gardens and after. These two actors(barrymore,Lang) worked wonderfully together in showing us the strong and unbreakable bond between mother and daughter. This movie reiterated delicately the slow decline of two well known and admired socialites into a downward spiral of filth, decay and too many cats. Grey gardens house encapsulates these women and forever binds them in the past. Only because of her loyalty to her mother Little Edie stays in this decrepit house feeding racoons and cats unable to live her life the way she wanted to. A truly heart breaking movie as the story line is so delicately played out always teetering on the fine line of insanity and sorrow to extreme happiness and denial.  loved this movie because of the winning performances from Lang and Barrymore and would recommend it to all.
