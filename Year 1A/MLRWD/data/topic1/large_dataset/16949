The video quality of this _King Kong_ (1933) DVD from Cheezy Flicks Entertainment is about the same as the NTSC VHS source from which it appears to have been copied. The DVD has a pasty looking picture which suffers from a total lack of contrast and there are occasional VHS-style video dropouts. The picture is off centered to the left and has excessive overscan. The "deleted" scenes are all way too dark. The crude cover art is composed of fuzzy screen shots. The ONLY advantage to the Cheezy Flicks _King Kong_ DVD is that it has reasonably good audio and the movie is presented in its original, 100-minute length, not the 96-minute length of sped up PAL versions. This alone makes the DVD worth keeping.

This Region 1 NTSC disc was made on a DVD burner. It has an English soundtrack, no subtitles and comes with a printed label. The package is an Amaray-style case with an insert sheet that lists the 13 chapters, but the chapters are not numbered.

There are persistent rumors that Warner Bros. will be releasing a superduper Region 1 DVD of the original _King Kong_ (1933) by the end of the decade. In the meantime, this Cheezy Flicks NTSC version sounds better than a sped up PAL version and, for those who really love Fay Wray, it is definitely better than no _King Kong_ at all. Hearing Fay Wray scream on key is what it's all about.
