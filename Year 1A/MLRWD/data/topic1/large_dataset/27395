While it's silly to be arbitary about what makes great art in any form, a fair test of a movie's cinematic quality is how long it holds your attention without dialog...and...beyond that...how long it holds your  attention without dialog without your noticing it. That's how you know  you're in the grip of a masterpiece with David Lean's translation of  Dickens' "Oliver Twist" into film. He's adapting Dickens, for  goodness sake, yet the first 24 minutes of the film doesn't have a word in  it. Just gripping black-and-white cinematography, some very expressive  actors, wonderful music by Sir Arnold Bax...all beautifully focused and  grippingly concentrated under David Lean's watchful eye. Although it's his  first solo feature film directing credit, his gift for narrative in  cinematic form already equals that of Dickens' narrative gift in  literature...as good as it gets. John Howard Davies as Oliver Twist is  exquisitely handled, his beautiful, androgynous face representing the  powerful innocence of his character. Alec Guiness, submerged in elaborate  makeup, brings Fagin to perfect, complex life in a portrait that is at once  completely inhabited, yet full of objective wit and professional relish.  And Robert Newton's Bill Sykes, primarily created by Newton's exquisite  pantomime framed in successive Lean closeups, is one of the most  self-tortured villains you'll ever see. There's no insight to be found in  Sykes' properly limited grasp of words, but oh, those eyes! This is one of  those movies that shows you how highly-conceived cinema can net out into  the greatest entertainment medium established during the 20th century.
