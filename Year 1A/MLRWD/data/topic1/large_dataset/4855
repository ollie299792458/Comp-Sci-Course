As much as I agree with the reviews that point to the wonderful balance of spectacle and intimate biography, I've recently discovered something else about this film: running deeply - though quite subtly - throughout it is the insightful story of how the Middle East became what it is today. The scenes between Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains (and, later, Alec Guinness) show how the English and the French carved up the area for their own interests, with the complicity of the most powerful of the tribal/social leaders (e.g., Guinness, as Prince Feisal). I should emphasize the word subtle, because David Lean was far too good a filmmaker to create a solely political film. But he was also too good a filmmaker to take socio-political subtleties off his palette. If you haven't seen this movie in 10 years or so, take a look again. You'll be amazed at what you didn't rate as important the last time you watched - and you'll appreciate the fact that the film is laden with even more than you remember.
