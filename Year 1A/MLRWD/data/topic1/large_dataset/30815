And then there were 3. After going from 1965 to 1978 with their "Days of Future Past" line up, when Mike Pinder left and then on to 2002 when Ray Thomas left, this 2005 concert features the remaining 3 founder members, plus very long term drummer Gordon Marshall and keyboard player Paul Bliss. It features about 50% of their early work from the "Core 7" albums and 50% from later offerings. Interestingly for people with other Moody DVD's there are a couple of tracks that are new, being December Snow and Forever Autumn. Ray Thomas's replacement Norda Mullen can certainly play the flute, is heavily featured throughout the set (more than RT was I think, and I would like to know Ray's thoughts on that) but was very well received by the audience and seems to gel well with the rest of the band.  Norda and Bernie Barlow (keyboards) are also used as backing singers. They are not as good vocally as the previous backing pair though.
So Moodies fans is it worth buying? Yes it is. As is usual, you get a good mix of titles, competently played and arranged. The Moodies have been travelling and playing live gigs for over 40 years, if they haven't got it right by now they never will, but they have, buy and enjoy.
