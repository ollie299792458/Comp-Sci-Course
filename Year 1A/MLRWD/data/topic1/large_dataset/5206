I first saw this film on VHS and was delighted when it came out on DVD, especially in a Criterion edition.

All right, it is slow in parts as the basis of the switch is spelled out, but then a rapid decision would be not in keeping with the period of the movie. You become immersed in the time period of the 16th Century.

I feel the quality of the print is first rate, and if one compares the visual look of the preview trailer to the presented film, the difference is clear.  Ironically, the Japanese trailers and teasers are visually crisp.

My greatest memory from having seen the VHS version was the final battle scene and the futility of it all.  Swords and spears against muskets is not a good match-up.  This is not a battle scene in the spirit of The Wild Bunch, so one gets the horror of the battle through visual looks of the spectators rather than the carnage on the field, although the aftermath of the battle is clear as to the terror of the battle.  I am glad Kurosawa chose not to make it a 'splatter' scene.  It was if the Generals could not believe what was happening and could not adapt.  The empty stools after the battle are more telling than any battle scene could be.

This is a movie in the manner of great epics.  They surely don't make this type of movie anymore, except on computers.  The visuals are sweeping, and all of it with real people and horses.  To think that the warriors were sent into battle with large flags attached to poles on their backs is amazing, and a visual feast.

Added:  I recently had the chance to re-watch the film, and the commentary, which made it much more enjoyable, as the contrast was made between the full length Japanese version, and the truncated American version.  The Criterion edition has the full version.
