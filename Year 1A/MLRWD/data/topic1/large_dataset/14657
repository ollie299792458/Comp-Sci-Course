This film explores the supernatural beliefs that many people are quick to dismiss. The supernatural belief of Hoodoo is what the movie is actually based around. Although, the practice of Hoodoo is not well known, someone would be under the impression that New Orleans is the starting and ending point for it.

The movie was filmed around New Orleans. Visually, New Orleans comes across as a somewhat creepy place to be around. However, one would get the impression that the directors could have filmed in Disneyland and made the theme park look equally creepy to all of us. The movie has all the makings for another great horror movie. The main actress (Kate Hudson) is a caregiver who begins working in a creepy house. It is eventually the on goings in the house which lead to the revelation of Hoodoo.

The plot of "The Skeleton Key" will keep you guessing until the end. The movie moves along with great intensity. For those viewers who enjoy DVD extras the filmmakers have included some magically informal extras. However, those of us who are quick to dismiss practices such as Hoodoo may quickly dismiss the majority of film. If you are watch horror movies at all then you'll probably love the suspicion within "The Skeleton Key".
