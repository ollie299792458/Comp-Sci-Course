This was the best TNA P.P.V. of the year IMO, followed by No Surrender which you can only get on TNAwrestling.com. You got everything from excellent title matches, bloody hardcore and insane risks.

Four Way X-Division
Alex Shelley vs. Roderick Strong vs. Austin Aries vs. Sonjay Dutt

This was the first match of the night and was a little slow at the start. But it was one of the best matches of the night. Got the crowd ready for a fantastic evening. ***

Jushin "Thunder" Liger vs. Samoa Joe
I was expecting a lttle more from this match. But I have never seen Jushin Liger compete. Good showing for both men. ***

The Diamonds in the Rough (Simond Diamond, Primetime Elix Skipper, and David Young) vs. Apolo, Sonny Siaki, and Sharkboy

I dont really remember this match. But it was decent. **

Lance Hoyt vs. "The Alpha Male" Monty Brown

This exceded my expectations for both men. It is hard to have a big guy fight be so good. But these two were able to pull it off. Both futures look bright for them. ***1/2

Ultimate X Match
Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentley w/Traci vs. Chris Sabin

This was a great match until the end. I dont wanna ruin what happened. But they have a re-match from the two hour iMPACT the following week which is better. *** for the first match. **** for the re-match.

NWA Tag Team Championship Match
America's Most Wanted w/ Gail Kim vs. The Naturals

Whenever you put these two teams together you are going to get a hard fought battle. Both teams delievered the goods and I was not dissapointed. ***3/4

Monster's Ball 2
Abyss w/James Mitchell vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rhino vs. Sabu

I was a little sceptical about this match. I mean with a card full of stipulations, I didnt understand the need for the hardcore rules. That and the first Monster's Ball match was a little below average. This match was way better and had some sick moves from both Jeff Hardy and Rhino. *****

Ironman Match for the X-Division Championship
"The Fallen Angel" Christopher Daniels vs. "The Phenomenal" AJ Styles

Most say the first match from these two is better. I disagree. It is as equally good as the first. Both men once again prove why the are who they are in the X-Division. *****

10 Man Gauntlet for the Number 1 Contender

This match was added earlier in the night since Kevin Nash was un-able to compete. I am a big fan of Nash. But im glad he didnt compete. I wont tell you who is in this match, but you will be shocked at the winner and who enters the match. *****

NWA World Heavyweight Title Match
Special Referee: Tito Ortiz
??? vs. Jeff Jarrett

The winner of the Gauntlet face's JJ right after the previous fight. Once again I am not going to ruin who was in this match or who won. But it was a great ending to the PPV and TNA's version of Wrestlemania. *****

As far as I know the extras are the Fan Fest from the weekend and The Ultimate X re-match. This PPV is a must buy for any wrestling fan. Unless your one of the idiots who gets on here and rips TNA. As much as I dont like WWE at times, they still put on good shows. Just review the product. If you have never seen it, then shut up.
