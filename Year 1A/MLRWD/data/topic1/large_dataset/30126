Steven Sommers....ahhhh!!!  He IS one of my favorite action directors/writers to date!!!  This is the first of a 2-3 part series of this particular kind of action film.
The MUMMY is such a great film, that you will want to watch the next part in the series right away!!!  THE MUMMY RETURNS is the next movie, and also a must-see!!! The 3rd part considered is: THE SCORPION KING (Excellent, ACTION-Packed, and Full of fun!!!!). This film: THE MUMMY is the best of the 2-3 parts.  Sommers has an incredible immagination for these kinds of movies!!!(treasure hunting, action, adventure, what more could you want in such a film??!!!!).  His other film, VAN HELSING is one of the best action movies of all time!!!!!!!!(ACTION-PACKED 'till the very end!!!!!!!!!!!)  **At least in my opinion**
Rachel Weisz is a "PRRRRRRR"-if ya' know what i mean??!!  She was a pURRfect cast for this flick, and Brendan Fraser is also great in this movie!!!  I have watched this movie over and over again soooo many times...i (just) never get bored of it!!!!!  So, without further adieu, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE buy this movie on dvd; you WON'T be disappointed!!!
**Cross your fingers, and hope along with me-that Steven Sommers WILL, in fact, make many, many, many more action movies for his time as a director and/or a writer***  THANX!!!!  $
