I have an expanding collection of DVDs of movies from the 30s and 40s. This beats all of them, not least because of the superb video quality, which is nearly as good as you will see on TCM. No blurred, snowy, two-shades-of-grey pictures, no crackly, hissy, inaudible-voices soundtrack. The sound is loud, crisp and clear, the contrast and focus of the black and white nearly as good as you would have seen in the cinema in 1944. And Hollywood really did to it best then: the beautiful black and white film was one of the major attractions for directors like Hitchcock who emigrated there from other countries. There is the beauty and fine acting of Gene Tierney and the wonderful tune with which the movie begins that is now a standard. You also get a full-length biography of Gene Tierney put together in 1999 on this DVD. The poignant bio alone is worth the price of the complete DVD. Talking of price, there is also a bio of Vincent Price which I haven't seen yet but expect to be also excellent. I won't comment on the plot of "Laura", as it's difficult to do so without including spoilers, since there surprises galore. Like all the best films of the 1940s, it has a superb script, with wit, irony and levels of meaning, unlike the trash produced today that relies on special effects and egregious violence. Dana Andrews and the other actors also excel, but what stands out from this production like a clear light is Gene Tierney. Not far into the film it is clear why all the men in it fall in love with her. This is a theme that is also well developed in the biopic. Buy it now.
