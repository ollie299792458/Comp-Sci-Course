Triple H is a truly mediocre performer. No athleticism, little technical skill, and minimal strength for a man his size. People defend this talentless goon by saying that he has great psychology, but so do 99% of wrestlers who make it to the top. Bob Dylan fans defend Dylan as a "great songwriter" in order to paper over his vocal and musical failings, when genuinely gifted musos like Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney were also great songwriters.

Triple H has had well-documented issues with the likes of Bret Hart and The Rock, and to a lesser extent, Chris Jericho and The Undertaker. What do these men have in common? They were all great athletes and performers, WHO EARNED EVERY WORLD TITLE THEY HAD. All of them have less world titles than Triple H, of course, the man who self-booked the highest number of WWE world titles in history. How did he manage that? He latched onto Nash and Michaels upon arrival in 1995, and when they were gone, moved his lips to the asses of the incredibly-over New Age Outlaws, whom he used to bolster himself. When the new DX fell apart, he slithered his weedy little johnson into Stephanie.

It's a real laugh that, during the early-to-mid 2000s, the announcers were instructed to refer to this hack as "the best in the business" at a time when the likes of Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and others were on the roster. Anyone who thinks that this mediocre parasite really ranks as an all-time great alongside the men I've mentioned in this review, really has fallen for WWE propaganda over the years.
