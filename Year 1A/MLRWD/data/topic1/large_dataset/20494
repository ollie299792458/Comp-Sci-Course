The movie deals with a guy (Luke Wilson) who dates a woman (Uma Thurman) who is a super heroine in disguise.  She goes around fighting crime.  She obtains super hero powers by coming into contact with a meteorite.  The story does not get really funny and interesting until the guy tries to break up with the super powered girlfriend.  He incurs her wrath when he tells her that he wants out of their relationship.  In desperation, he goes to a former acquaintance of hers (Eddie Izzard) for assistance.  The movie has quite a few funny sequences when he is dating her.  There are some uses of profanity, but it is not excessive.  There are scenes of implied sex, so the movie may not suitable for preteen viewers.  There is only one nude scene and it involves the male character.  The violent scenes are not graphic and actually a bit cartoonish.  Anna Faris and Wanda Sykes provide the coworker support in the movie.  The buddy character is played by Rainn Wilson who stars in "the office" on NBC.  It is a cute and amusing romantic comedy.  I thought it was a much better super hero movie than the "Return of Superman" which came out that same year.
