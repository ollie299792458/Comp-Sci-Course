I would've given this 5 stars if it wasnt for the previous special edition of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  The actual box was cool and unique, it was accompanied with post card size versions of all the movie posters (international), as well as the extra disc of special features.  Fist Full of Dollars has the extra disc, but didnt come with as many goodies.  On-line, the picture looks the same, but it was different... it is packaged in a regular dvd box that slides into a cardboard like case instead of the unique, slightly bigger case that came with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Granted, this is a minor complaint... the movie looks and sounds excellent.  Of course, we all know the movie itself is a classic and it is worth the price to own.  I produce and direct music videos for local artist and I have to say that this movie has made a powerful impression on in terms of camera angles.  As well as having a cool story and characters, this is an extremely artistic movie (in my opinion).

I got my products from amazon within two days of ordering... so, if you get in online, this is the place to do that.
