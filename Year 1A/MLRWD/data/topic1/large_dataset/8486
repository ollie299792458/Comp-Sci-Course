I wasn't sure what to expect with this film. One thing that I didn't expect was the court room drama. I was more hoping for the lines of the Exorsist. But having said this, it was a very good and very well put together film.

This film is about a Father (of a church) put on trial for the death of Emily Rose. The court room drama suggests Emily Rose as being mentally ill, with seizures to boot. The Father's side of the story was that she wasn't mentally ill at all but rather her body/soul was taken over by demons (six of them) and the reason why the exorsim failed was because of the medications that the doctors put her on.

Intwind with the courtroom drama was the true story of Emily Rose. How she became pocessed by the demons! Again, as other reviewers have pointed out, the film is about faith, what you believe, what you don't believe. What could possible be, even if we don't want it to be! I think I would have loved the film moreso if there wasn't so much courtroom to it but I recommend the movie nonetheless!! Therefore I still give it 4 out of 5 stars because it can make you think!
