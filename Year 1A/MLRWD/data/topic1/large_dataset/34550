The Castle of Cagliostro is one of the greatest animated features of all time, sparking with adventure, wit and even humor. It's visual impact is expansive, and it's characters have a life of their own...
Which is why  this DVD is such a tragedy. This is not the Caste of Cagliostro, as raved  about by the likes of Steven Spielburg. This is a second-rate parody of it.  The entire vocal soundtrack to this DVD has been removed and replaced with  one which may well have been written by a first-timer, with no knowledge of  the story - and performed by vocal talent that couldn't get a job on a  Wendy's commercial.
The end product is entirely unwatchable. Gone are the  snappy quotes, and well-paced vocal patter of the film's stars.. it almost  feels like the script was improvised on the spot, with the actors having  never even seen the film beforehand, let alone been given a storyline to  stick to. 
I waited paitently for two years for Cagliostro to come back  onto the market... and it appears that I'm still waiting. The only bright  hope I have now is to locate a pirated copy of the real version of the  film, because I'm not keeping this one. 
By "The Real Version" I refer to the 1979 dub, sold by Streamline Pictures. Only released on VHS in the american market, it's far superior to the MANGA version. That's the version of the film that won all the awards, and catipulted this film into the history books. That's the version to get. 
This DVD has been in my  posession for a little over an hour now... just eough time to get it out of  the box and into the player - to see the devestation wrought by MANGA  Video, and to decide to not only return the thing, but also to warn  potential buyers that they're being gypped. 
This is not the film as  advertised. Don't watse your money.
