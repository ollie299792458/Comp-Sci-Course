With very few exceptions, movies are considered the "property" of either
the director or the leading actor/actoress.  Ray Harryhausen is one of
those few exceptions.

His master craftsmanship in the use of stop-motion photopgraphy as a special-effect propells Mr. Harryhausen far above anything produced
at a computer work-station, in as much as that he wasn't striving
for "realism" in his efforts; Mr. Harryhausen was just giving form to the
viewers' imagination while extending their 'suspension of disbelief'.  The
Oscar he received for his work on "Jason and the Argonauts" was both well
earned and well deserved.

"20 Million Miles To Earth", as well as Mr. Harryhausen's earlier works,
doesn't have much of a plot, but quite frankly, it doesn't need one.  His
special-effects are more than adequate to please the pallate of this genre's collector.  To emphasise my point, when Mr.Harryhausen put as
much effort into the plot, as well as the special-effects, he earned his
*first* Oscar, for "Jason and the Argonauts".

"20 Million Miles To Earth" is another gem in the collective works of
Ray Harryhausen and a definite "must-have/get" for this genre's collector.
