This movie is definitely worth buying. I have never been a big fan of Billy Bob but this is by far the best movie he has ever made. Throw in a convincing story line, Bernie Mac in another great role, an appearance by John Ritter and a very likeable kid named Thurman Murman and you have a very entertaining movie, one which will make every one of your christmas's complete. But this is not your average christmas movie. The underlying story throughout is of a sad and lonely alcoholic named Willie, who is also a professional thief, who along with his sidekick elf crack safes and rob department stores once they have closed for trade on christmas eve. We witness Willie's slow but steady path of self detruction and alcohol abuse, which he makes no attempt to hide from the world. Along the way Willie meets Thurman, a lonely kid who is the target of bullies and in search of a friend of his own. He takes an instant shine to Willie thinking he really is Santa of course.
Special features include Deleted scenes, bloopers and a behind the scenes special. There is a lot of swearing, vomitting and general crudeness on behalf of Billy Bob's character Willie.
Billy Bob is very convincing as an alcoholic, he has obviously had lots of practice!
Put this one in someones stocking this christmas.
