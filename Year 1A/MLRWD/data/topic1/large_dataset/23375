Hellsing is the perfect mix of style, music, talent and idea. It takes place in Britain (where most bad things seem to happen) but present day. To mix things up though they add old school story, basic vampires controlling the world kinda plot... they add a twist though, at the head of fighting off this horde of demon vampires is a grand vampire called Alucard... as you find out he is not any NORMAL vampire in any sense... he shows off to be one of the most evil, heartless, intelligent and powerful characters of all time... villain and hero alike... the series combines excellent music, voice acting and animation. Great detail was given to each character and such. The weapons are awsome and the fight scene brilliant... the only complaint I have is under development... the series is 13 episodes... 13... from what I understand thats IT... FAR too short... no one, not even Alucard had any real development... you didnt' have time to get attached to the characters or story like that of the great Cowboy Bebop. Alucards powers were pushed, laying out everything he had within 13 episodes... Victoria had a huge story setup for her... but again within the 13 episodes nothing was done with her. Many MASSIVE characters were brought up and quickly passed from the show, the Valentine brothers for instance come in and leave in three episodes... HUGE characters that could last a good 30 episodes alone delt with in three... or Incognito... a villain of massive perportions delt with in 3 or 4 episodes... a vampire that matched Alucards power delt with so quickly?... he could have gone for some time... the entire series was rushed... none the less... it's worth the buy... wether your a Vampire fan, action, horror, fiction or just a anime fan... this is for you.
