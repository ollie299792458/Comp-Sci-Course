Wow!  I didn't expect much from this movie since it received such a mixed critical review.  I have to say this movie delivers in so many ways.  It gives you tense and brutally realistic action scene.  It shows you a glimpse of Saudi Arabia that is torn between religious tradition and modern liberalism.  It makes us question about our war with terrorism and our cultural difference that will continually makes us demonize each other.

This movie is not based on any true event.  So don't expect history lesson on fundamental Islamism.  This movie is not trying to resolve our complex and diabolical relationship with the Middle East.  This is a political action movie first.  It is meant to entertain us.  And if that's what you want?  You will not be disappointed.  From opening scene to the climatic ending, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't know why I didn't hear more about this movie.  If you are fan of good action movie (action that is based on some realism, like Heat and Bourne series), than you'll love this.
