Hocus Pocus is one of those films that didn't have much of a life at the box office, but which has become a Halloween staple in video form.  Hocus Pocus' has a lot going for it - including a well developed plot, likable characters, the acting talents of Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy - not to mention Omri Katz and an early appearance by Thora Birch (of American Beauty fame).  It even includes a rather fitting musical rendition of "I Put A Spell On You" by Midler.  But Hocus Pocus' greatest strength is perhaps that it remains a great Halloween flick for younger audiences.  It isn't to terribly scary, and I don't think anyone over the age of 15 will be holding onto their seats too tightly, but it remains a little creepy for the elementary set, who, after all, might want a little scare on Halloween, but aren't ready for the likes of 'Rosemary's Baby'.  
The story revolves around Max Dennison(Omri Katz), who, having recently moved to Salem from Southern California, is feeling a little out of place and put off by all of the Halloween celebrations in America's first 'terror town'.  Having few friends, he is resigned to spending Halloween night taking his spunky and well spoken little sister, Dani (Thora Birch), trick-or-treating. They meet up with Max's new found crush, Allison, who tkaes them on a whirlwind tour of Salem's world famous witch museum - legened to be the former residence of the Sanderson Sisters.  To make a long story short, Max lights the black flame candle on All Hallows Eve, thereby bringing Winnie, Mary and Sarah Sanderson back from the dead, who must capture the lifeforces of the town's children before the sun rises or be turned to dust.  A scary, witty, and sometimes funny romp through nighttime Salem ensues.
While perhaps not the best film ever made, Hocus Pocus is an entertaining movie that stands as a great family Halloween staple.  For anyone with kids or a Disney video collection, Hocus Pocus is a must.
