I cried when I saw this movie in the theater because it struck so many familiar chords with me as the son of an Appalachian migrant. The fatalism that pervades the culture comes through beautifully in this story, as does the strong ties to kin and the trait of perseverance against tremendous adversity. While the film takes cinematic and dramatic liberties with the story, the essence remains the unscathed. We can moan and groan about the recession and how hard we have it, but October Sky stirs in us as Americans the greatness that has always helped us raise above adversity if we just pull together as a community and help each other realize our dreams. Every seventh-grade student and tenth-grade student in America ought to be made to watch this film.

I visited Coalwood several years ago and had the great honor of meeting and spending an afternoon with O'Dell's father. A real gentleman and wealth of information, he took me to all the sites in Coalwood mentioned in the film and book. I treasure that memory.

If you enjoy this film, be sure to read the other books that followed Rocket Boys. The Coalwood Way would make a fine film. It is a wonderful story, too.

My only wish is that this film would be released on Blu Ray.
