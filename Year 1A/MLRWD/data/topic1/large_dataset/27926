This movie is just one of kind, great fun, very bloody. Not necessarilly really gory, I always look at gore to be maybe alot of decapitation and showing guts, however this movie had some of that but not enough to think of this as the goriest movie ever. But it is one of the bloodiest and wildest. Story of course involves some college students going up to a somewhat abandon cabin and the evil starts from there and how they unleash it, you must see for yourself. The acting was well ok, however Bruce Campbell himself did awesome I think he is a great highly underrated actor. This movie is very scary, or exciting if you will as it is also very funny sometimes, like when the possessed women say funny statements like (kill her if you can loverboy, and Were gonna get you not another peep, its just so corny yet funny.) Gets you back to enjoying the movie instead of wanting to get grossed out or terrified. The work on the demons or zombies, though they didnt seem like major flesh eaters, just demons in human form are quite excellent, the rough sketching and so on. Anyone that doesnt like this filmin my opinion just doesnt like horror in general because this is a damn straight horror classic and will stay that way. If you like entertaining, quiet, keep you guessingtype of horror movies then see evil dead. I lovethe whole series but the first one is more of a major horror movie then the others,  however they are all outstanding. Dont be fooled by the ending, there is more of that too come. Also I think I figured out why Evil dead 2's storyline was so similar to this one, find out my theory on my Evil dead 2 review. Well enjoy this completely great horror movie, its one of the best.
