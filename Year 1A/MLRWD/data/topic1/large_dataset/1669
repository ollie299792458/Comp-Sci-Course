I really like this film, it has a great cast, fun story, good acting, great scenery
and lots of action.  I think that this film and Rio Bravo are probably Wayne's best offerings from his later years.  I really didn't like the Rooster Cogburn efforts.  These are much better.
The Duke is Big Jake who has been wandering the country while his estranged wife and kids take care of the big ranch, his wife once again portrayed perfectly by the beautiful Maureen Ohara.  The ranch is raided and Big Jake's grandson (who he has never seen) is kidnapped.  Big Jake is summoned by the wife to handle things in his usual competent and ruthless manner.  It all plays out the way you would expect of a John Wayne western and it is truly enjoyable to watch.
John's son Michael plays his oldest son in the movie and they have some great moments together.  There is also the contrast of old and new since this is set after the turn of the century so there is some conflicts between the characters, cars vs horses and so on.
