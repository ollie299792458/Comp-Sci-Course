This is the funniest movie I've ever seen.  By far.  In it, Kurt Russell elevates sleaze to an art form.  The other actors, especially Jack Warden, turn in maybe the best performances of their careers.  But what really separates this movie from the pack is the quality of the writing--way, way better than what you see in even above-average comedies.  The jokes are set up with care and precision, and the punch lines always score a perfect "10".  The sub-plots all get tied together.  The characters are well drawn.  There's a perfect mix of physical and verbal humor, of wit and profanity.  Certain scenes, like the patched-in commercials, should have you laughing for days.  And even though the movie goes back to the Carter administration...it's fresh.  All this is testimony to a great script, perfectly executed with first class acting and direction.  Warning:  it drags a little at the end, but you won't mind, because you'll be laughing so hard at that point you won't really be paying attention.  Please, drop whatever you're doing and go rent this.
