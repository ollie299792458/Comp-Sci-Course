They Don't Want Her To Testify...against some big shot, so they send burnt-out loner cop Eastwood, who's also on the expendable side, to go fetch her.
  (do you ever wonder who "they" are? I suppose it doesn't really matter.)
  Some people have pointed out the, er, implausible elements in the storyline, and I will grant you, they are there.(such as the House On The Outskirts of Town that gets blown to shreds by the bad guys' overwhelming firepower when they think they have Sondra and Clint cornered, and our heroes take off in one of their cars because,somehow, the bad guys always seem to leave their keys in the ignition...)
  But I think those who object kinda miss the point: after all, what are they saying,that the entire "Dirty Harry" series, by contrast, was filled with plausibility? Please.
  Still other have pointed out "symbolism" in the storyline.
(Like heading to Phoenix for redemption. Or, perhaps, how Eastwood doesn't need a huge gun here because he's got such a big bus with which to ram the bad guys.) Yeah, whatever. These are the kind of issues pseudo-intellectuals fight over at Denny's in the wee hours, while the exasperated waitress waits to clear the table, hoping the tip wont be as crummy as what the last bunch left. Come to think of it, how do I know this?
  To be fair, I'll admit that it IS awfully tempting to try to find deeper significance in pulpy action pictures. For example I'm tempted to see this as Eastwood's populist apologia for the reactionary quality of the afore-mentioned **Dirty Harry** series, given how the "establishment" is the enemy here, and how the original **Harry** was made when Nixon was facing re-election(and before Watergate), whereas **The Gauntlet** was made shortly after Jimmy Carter was elected. Is this significant? Maybe. But I remind myself of what Clint himself might say, quoting Goldwyn: "If you want to send a message, call Western Union." 
 This is my favorite Eastwood action pic ever. I really like the chemistry between Locke and Eastwood. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is they didn't stop to help some nuns on the way.
(Then, they could've looked at each other, as if for the 1st Time. Then, in the next scene...)
  It's very simple: Eastwood and Locke and a bus against the entire, apparently corrupt establishment. Gee, who do YOU think's gonna win?
