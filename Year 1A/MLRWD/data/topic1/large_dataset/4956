Restorations of a number of great German Lang films have recently been released on DVD (Metropolis, Niebelungen, Mabuse).  Given the enormous stature of these early works, one is tempted to search carefully through his numerous Hollywood projects to find the forgotten classic even more accessible to the modern viewer.  The idea of a collaboration with Bertolt Brecht would seem to hold considerable promise at capturing the best from two masters of Weimar expressionism.
  There is a lot of good stuff going for "Hangmen", with its dark, shadowy vision and rapidly evolving storyline.  However, the plot is plagued by war-era propoganda, which only weakens what should already be the compellingly tense situation of the Nazi occupation of Prague.  Such sentimentallity is, of course, understandable, and was easily overcome by at least a few other contemporary Hollywood pictures.
  Unfortunately, this film was consigned grade-B status by the studio, and it is the lack of acting talent (save a very effective job by Walter Brennan) that really hobbles the film.  It is a bit disconcerting when the actors playing the Nazis exhibit much more personality than the wooden faced Czechs who we're supposed to be rooting for.
  Not bad, there is so much interesting stuff that it deserves a viewing.  But it's no masterpiece.
