(NOTE:  If you don't like people giving away all of the plot details before you see something, be sure to give the review of "Eric Pregosin" (12/25/05, below) a pass until you see it.)

I am a long-time fan of this wonderful import, which of course gives me a rose-color view.  Even though all the acting was up to the usual standards, it was hard to overlook that the "young people"--especially Alistair and Judy--are a bit long in the tooth (but not as tired looking as they were toward the end of the series' run, for some reason).  Therefore, the plot points involving them had an unintended level of humor, which you just have to accept and pass over (or enjoy on that additional level, as I do).  But as I say in the title, the reason I have kept watching for all these years is to see the priceless repartee between Jean (Judi Dench) and Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer)--especially Judi Dench, she is BRILLIANT and hilarious.  They both have such a keen sense of who the characters are, they hardly need the lines at all.  The rest of the cast were just as you wished them to be and it was nice to find out "what happened" with all the characters.  Rocky (Frank Middlemass) was a bit sad without his faithful Madge (the late Joan Sims), but Mrs Bale kept up the side.  Truly a worthy ending (and I think it might be) to the series.
