Did anyone who was part of this picture ever see the television series guess not. If your looking for a movie about going back to hazzard county and seeing some of the things that made the dukes of hazzard great you can forget it. It's TERRIBLE and casting STINKS!!! let's begin with boss hog was he not a rather large person that enjoyed food not some skinny dude that was a bit smarter than the original boss hog can anyone say danny devito he could have been perfect. Rosco was rather funny in the original which made the show a bit humerous big problem the new rosco stunk!!! and i know i'm being picky but didn't daisy have brown hair hmmm sounds like someone forgot to catch an episode of the original show way to go casting director.

  My second complaint is about uncle jesse was he not trying to keep the dukes out of trouble and not in it. smoking pot in front of daisy way to promote drugs in motion pictures guys. Jesse never would have done that not that i care what he does but my kids may thanks. Folks i loved the original dukes of hazzard and was looking very forward to a bit of the same presented on the big screen if you never seen the original than who knows you may not mind the movie too badly however for those of you out there that loved the series on television beware of the remake it is far from it from a fan of the original series the remake is TERRIBLE. no stars if it was possible.
