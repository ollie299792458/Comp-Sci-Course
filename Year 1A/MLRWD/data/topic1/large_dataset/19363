ADDED IN JULY:  If you watched "Sherlock" on PBS, you have not seen all of it.  In order to make room for some of their own material, PBS had something like 8 minutes cut from each episode (including some entire scenes).  The DVDs have the intact episodes.  Near as I can tell, the Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs are identical (except for the PBS or BBC logo that plays when the disc first loads), so if you have a Region 1 player, by all means get the Region 1 DVD (this product!), now that it's actually available.

MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS FROM FEBRUARY:  The British (region 2) DVD is already available on Amazon UK (just scroll to the bottom of this or any page, to the line of countries under the Amazon logo, and click on "United Kingdom").  You will need a region 2 or region-free DVD player.  (Hint: The DVD players on many laptops are region-free.)

The British DVD has subtitles, commentaries for the first two episodes, and a featurette.

Often the second year of a popular series will rest on its laurels, but that is most emphatically NOT the case with "Sherlock."  If anything, season 2 is even better than season 1, and the ending leaves me more than ready for season 3!  (Yes, there will be a season 3 -- the BBC has already authorized it.)
