Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU !
