This film might turn out to be one of the underrated movies of our time. Here, one can find some of the best works behind the camera lens. One would also be hard-pressed to find a single bad performance. I must admit one of my reservations from outrightly buying the film was because it starred Brad Pitt, (good looks, lightweight acting) but I was wrong. He did pretty well though I believe he was really unsuited for that role. His Austrian-German accent is not perfect, and it does not have to be as it is an English language film anyway. If it's lengthy (and I was warned about this) it had a story to convey and essential to the progression of the film. Jean-Jacques Annaud's direction goes a long way in bringing reality to the screen, without the fantasy usually associated with Tibet brought on by works like John Huston's "Lost Horizon" (made into a film in 1937 to wide acclaim). But then, Heinrich Harrer's story is no fantasy. The purification and redemption of an Austrian Olympic mountaineer/adventurer's life, from overweening self-assurance, a Nazi party member (and a decorated one at that) to hardship and disappointment and privation...and never trying to attain nirvana but merely trying to make one's way in an uncomprehending world is his journey to self-discovery. The film gives a superficial though intense contemporary glimpse of Tibetan history and life/customs like one would normally encounter in the old editions of National Geographic. But if you like travel and adventure to exotic places and can find some clear philosophical thinking by witnessing unadulterated cultural differences along the way, you are a lucky one--and this is a film for you.
