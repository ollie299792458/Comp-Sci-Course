"Patriot Games" is my favorite of Tom Clancy's novel, a taut thriller in which the hero is caught in a moral dilemma. He wants to protect his family, but worries that at some point he might become just as bad as the terrorists he is fighting. There is action, and there is a soul.
How upsetting, then, to find the movie has thrown all that away  and turned it into a shoot 'em 'up. Somehow they managed to keep all the events more or less intact and still sacrificed everything that made the book so satisfying. Even Jack Ryan's wife joins in, urging him, "Get 'em, Jack." What a travesty!
In place of the nuanced moral quandary of the novel, we've been given something with no more soul than one of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. It apparently doesn't matter what kind of people we are, only who's fastest with a gun.
Harrison Ford is OK as Jack Ryan, although even here he's getting a little long in the tooth for the part, and this is supposedly the first of the stories, the events that took place before "Red October." Frankly, I liked Alec Baldwin better as Ryan, although I'm apparently the only person in the universe who did.
It is absurd, I know, to complain that a movie "wasn't like the book." They are completely different experiences, and sometimes you're bound to be disappointed. But "Patriot Games" goes beyond disappointment. By the time the credits rolled I was actually angry.
