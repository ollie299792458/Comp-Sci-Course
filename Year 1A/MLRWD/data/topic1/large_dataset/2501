At the end of the Eighties the action movie genre, which had flourished throughout the decade, began to stagnate. Cinema goers had seen enough explosions and gunfights cloned from the same formula made popular by Arnie  and Sly. Both of these men were moving in the direction of comedy and  action movies needed something new.. something fresh. In stepped John  McTiernan and Bruce Willis with DIE HARD. Willis, most famous at the time  for the comic T.V. Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect  ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believeable  as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He blead and felt pain, a  first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great  wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit  should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action  flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while  never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must  go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to  this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and  collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than  utterly ruthless and calculating.  Die Hard is a great movie for a number  of reasons but adding three dimensions to the action genre is this films  finest achievement and anyone who has not sampled its delights before now  would be wise to get a copy as soon as possible. But don't see it on T.V.  oh no, because it is never without significant and completely unnecessary  extra editing for violence and language. Enjoy it on video or DVD if you  can, see it in all its original splendor, it is arguably the greatest  action film ever made. And then go see the sequels.. they rock too!
