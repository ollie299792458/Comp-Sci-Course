Wow.  I first saw Princess Mononoke during its limited theatrical release (twice).  Many people have issues with the dub, but this is by far the best dubbed anime ever to be released -- I, like most anime fans, normally insist on subtitles, but Neil Gaiman and the cast succeeded in putting real emotion into these characters.  The casting of Billy Bob Thornton and Claire Danes might rub some ears the wrong way, but in my opinion the emotional impact is still there regardless of the odd accents.  In any case, the Japanese track is included, and it's phenomenal.  As for its content, most arguments about its violence and length can be dismissed by viewing it as a film, rather than as a cartoon.  It's not Disney.  The plot is a complex and delicate exercise in shades of gray.  Don't expect Akira or Macross either -- it's really not of the same genre.
The video and audio quality is the sort that you would use to show off your new home theater system.  In fact, I found the Japanese soundtrack to be richer and better dynamically balanced than the English track (!).  Disney/Miramax really took advantage of the format by including BOTH the Japanese and English opening titles and credits -- they are automatically selected depending on your choice of language via an angle switch.  Transparent and ingenious.  There are two sets of subtitles -- one for the English track, and the other is the literal translation of the Japanese (since some liberties were taken in creating the English script).
Disney was originally going to release "Mononoke Hime" without the original language track, which created an outrage among anime fans (who, myself included, signed a massive internet petition which eventually turned the tide).  I applaud this decision, as well as the splendid attention to detail.  It has made this incredible movie an even better value.
