The only time I can imagine anyone ever wanting to watch this movie is if they have kids that they want to watch a movie with and don't want the kids to be exposed to any swearing, sex or violence.  Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is a tame family movie with tame jokes, predictable plot and is overall an uninspired movie.  Still, your kids will probably enjoy it and you will have a tolerable time watching it with them.

The plot is simple, Steve Martin's family (I can't even remember their name) goes to the lake for Labor Day and meets up with childhood rival Murtaugh played by Eugene Levy.  Levy's also has a big family and the entire movie consists of a rivalry between Martin and Levy.  There are snippets of scenes between the kids, who all seem to like each other.

Now for some quick comments on various parts of the movie:  All of the kids have gotten a few years older and less cute.  Some of them are lucky to be in the movie at all.  Hilary Duff looks like a skelaton with skin.  She looks gaunt and kind of creepy.  Tom Welling deserves to be in much better movies that his.  He is too good of an actor.  I cringe everytime it is brought up that Steve Martin is athletic, or a football coach.  He plays neither convincingly.
