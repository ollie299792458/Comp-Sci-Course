Modern makers of "action-adventure" films heavy with digital "special effects": humble yourselves and be CONQUERED!
For here is a FILM!
Brilliant in conception, cinematography, casting, acting, and directing; "Aguirre the Wrath of God" overwhelms all other efforts in the "action-adventure" genre
(except of course, Herzog's other Amazonian masterpiece "Fitzcarraldo") because it is all REAL!
Imagine going on a SERIOUS whitewater rafting trip in the Amazon jungle
dressed in full Spanish armor and period costumes with a cannon on rickety log rafts.
They actually DID IT!
They had a great adventure, all of them, the actors and the native extras and everybody.
And they filmed it and they got THIS,
this masterwork, this gem.
"Aguirre the Wrath of God" is a tour de force of artistic brilliance and personal courage.
It is a film that once viewed will haunt your dreams and days for a lifetime.
OK so it's in German with English subtitles.  But the subtitles are clear and yellow and well-placed at the bottom of the screeen so as to never obscure the action or dialog.
And the action and dialog are so gripping that you will soon forget you are even watching a German-language film.
Unparalleled cinema.
