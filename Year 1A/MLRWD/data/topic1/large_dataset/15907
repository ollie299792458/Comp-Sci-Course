That's the 1st thing that came in my mind when I 1st watched this movie some years back, seeing Tom Selleck play in a baseball movie. Yet I find it hard to believe it how underrated this movie was & still is.

As there's already a brunch of reviews posted on this, I'll just explain the highlights- Selleck plays a baseball player whose team the New York Yankees trades him off to the Nagoya Chunichi Dragons where he befriends fellow American Max "Hammer" Dubois (played by Dennis Haysbert- the current spokesperson for AllState) & gets into a culture clash with the Japanese with how they play the American pastime. ("...ball game can't end in a tie.") In all this he falls in love with the team manager's daughter Hiroko (Aya Takanashi), who's my favorite character in the entire movie- a beautiful & charming lady who while does show interest in Selleck's character Jack, does not put up with his nonsense. A shame this would be the only movie Ms. Takanashi will appear in.

In terms of special features, there's just an extended trailer for this movie & "Fancy Curves", a sports reel from 1931 (judging from the Roman numerals used in the copyright notice) starting the legend Babe Ruth teaching women how to play the American pastime. A very interesting sports reel indeed, esp.  seeing the legend himself in action.

Since 1st watching this film yesteryear, it has became one of my favorites, & I'm not a big movie person.  This film should appear to both  baseball & non-baseball fans alike.
