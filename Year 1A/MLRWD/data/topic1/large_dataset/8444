Well still to this day, The Legend of DrunkenMaster (originally Drunken Master 2) is still my favorite Jackie Chan movie. Its actually one of the Top 10 out of all the movies I've seen. 
The only reason I had to give this particular movie a 4 star instead of a 5 is because they cut out the last scene in the movie and like many kungfu movies that has be re-released in the US, it doesn't include the original chinese Audio version. Always English and French. I usually prefer the original everything with subtitles. 
Anyway, this movie includes everything from dramatic scenes to mind blowing action scenes and many funny scenes as well. Even the title "Drunken Master" sounds funny if you really think about it. One thing I would recommend though is watching the Original Drunken Master movie. Although the original movie was was made like 20 years ago and so its not a very high adrenaline pumping type action movie, it does however show how and why Jackie (Wong Fei-hung) leanred the drunekn boxing martial arts. 
I strongly recommend this movie for any Jackie Chan fan. And if you are one of those people who want the original chinese dvd copy, I would recommend you buy it soon. I know of three companies that have made this movie into DVD (that has the original title) and I only know one that still manufactures the DVDs.
