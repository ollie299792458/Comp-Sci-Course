I'm giving this one two stars, in part because, I suppose, there is a certain technical sleekness to Firewall.  Kind of like showing up for class and getting a C minus (or D plus).  But I'd love to go ahead and pull the trigger and give Firewall one star, just for the pure cynical calculation behind the making of the movie. Firewall is yet another PG-13 movie, playing it safe, staying within the bounds of whatever Hollywood deems as "conventional" thriller (which now includes food allergies for the kids).  Harrison Ford, as Jack Stanfield (strong name alert), wheezes his way through the connect-a-dots plot, while Virginia Madsen, as Stanfield's wife, looks glad for the paycheck, but that's about it.  She's supposed to be carrying on an affair with one of Stanfield's associates - which is tacked on as an afterthought.  Heavens!  Being a super soccer mon (and architect!), when would she have the time? Yes, ladies, in a PG-13 world, you can still have it all.  That said however, Madsen at least seems to have a pulse as she mother-hens the kids and the family dog through the danger.  Ford, on the other hand, just looks alarmingly gray most of the time (skin, not hair).  Paul Bettany is OK, I guess, as the villain who puts together a rather ridiculous high tech plot to steal money.  But I've seen him in much better films. Like Madsen, he's collecting a paycheck.

As an alternative, consider watching Spike Lee's Inside Man (which I watched the same weekend), and see what a well-scripted, well-acted, thriller can be.  Skip this turkey.
