Is anybody really all that surprised over why this was so poorly received? The movie gets two generous stars from me simply because, on a cheesy popcorn level, I thought it delivered. But "Battlefield Earth" is nowhere near a top-shelf film, nor should it ever be considered as such. I consider myself somewhat more forgiving than the average viewer mostly because, having read the entire novel, I possess a prior understanding of the vast plethora of material that was shamefully omitted from Corey Mandell's menial screenplay.

Put another way, this whole production was inspired by a 1,050 page novel. By shrinking down such a gargantuan story to accomodate the parameters of a meager two hour motion picture time-slot, you're sacrificing monumental chunks of vital subplot and fleshed-out character development that would have improved the finished product by unfathomable leaps and bounds.  This exact same tragedy nearly befell Peter Jackson with "The Lord of the Rings," before New Line Cinema wisely allowed him to seperately adapt all three of those books in the manner they were intended. Patrick Tatopolous certainly deserves some measure of credit for his exemplary production design. But what happened with those Psychlos, and who ever decided they should look like overgrown jacked-up Klingons?

I think this ultimately should have been granted the multi-part miniseries treatment, with a totally different cast and a respectable screenplay that didn't so recklessly dumb down Hubbard's work. There actually exists a far superior eight hour abridged audiobook adaptation, read by the late Roddy McDowall, that I believe would have served the purpose of this film so much more. Why that script was never considered over Mr. Mandell's is something I may very well never understand.
