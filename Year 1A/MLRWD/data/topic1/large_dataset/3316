These words written above according to my Dad. I was a 15 year-old when this film came out. I recall heading out the door one saturday afternoon in Chicago (1968). My Dad asked where I was heading. I said to the Biograph to see Bonnie and Clyde with my chum Bob. He told me to sit down while he called Bobs Dad. I heard him say "Do you know your son and my son are going to see that movie concerning Bonnie and Clyde? No? I did not think you knew.....yes it's about time we put our foot down on this nonsense. Goody-day."
He said he recalled the real bonnie and clyde. They were "Hillbilly punks that joy-killed and got what they deserved." (But to him and many other Chicagoans John Dillinger was a folk hero, and Al Capone was a misunderstood criminal that only hurt other gangsters.)
I saw the movie about a week later anyway and loved it. I did not grow-up to become a robber of gas stations or banks or break any laws that I know of. I still love the film. Is it camp or serious?  Jim C. DeKalb, Illinois
