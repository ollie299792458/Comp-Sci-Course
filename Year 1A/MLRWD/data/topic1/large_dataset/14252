Jojo Mayer is like Jesus of hand technique, and this is one of the most important DVDs a drummer could ever purchase. BUY IT!.
  While this is a must for beginning and intermediate players, even very advanced players could learn a thing or two from Jojo's instruction, and I would suggest that they at the very least they check it out on Netflix.  Jojo basically aims to exploit physics as much as possible in order to obtain impossibly fast hand speed.  This DVD does not cover coordination technique- it only covers hand/stick technique ...for three hours.  A lot of Moeller and Gladstone type stuff.  Jojo's instruction is very clear and somewhat humorous, and the video production is not distracting.  Considering the computer-generated visual aides, (I can't believe I'm saying this about a drum DVD) I would even say the video production is helpful.
  This DVD could have been formatted a little better if it had been split into "comprehension" and "practice exercises" sections.  That way the viewer could watch the comprehension sections a couple times, and then play through the practice exercises without having to skip through the talking each time.

On a separate note, I really REALLY wish Jojo would produce a video covering (or expand this video to include) his foot technique.  It's basically the same physics-based principals he uses for his stick technique, only applied to his feet in order to get mindblowing super-fast double-kicks.
