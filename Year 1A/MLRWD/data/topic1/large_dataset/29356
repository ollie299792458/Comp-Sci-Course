I have to admit at first I was not happy with Rose McGowan playing Paige Matthews.  I swore to never watch the show again!  But after a couple years of being stubborn I have watched season 4 and really enjoyed it.  Paige brought a whole new perspective to the show.  To me she has a lot of Prue's charateristics...very independant and always trusts her instincts.  How many times did Prue have instincts that Piper and Phoebe didn't believe?  Paige is the same way...especially when it came to Cole, Prue never trusted him either. In episode 16 when Phoebe confronts Paige about not liking/trusting Cole...Paige is honest and tells her the truth and then both Piper and Phoebe walk off leaving Paige by herself and Cole has really turned into the Source! That drove me crazy!  Then in epsisode 5 Size Matters, Paige had bad feelings about that house and Piper didn't believe her.

But one of my favorite episodes is episode 3 Hell Hath No Fury, Piper is still battling the loss of Prue and trying to accept Paige as her new sister...ends up turning into a Fury. Leo and Paige orb her to Prue's grave forcing her to "let go" and try to move on with her life.  Very touching and emotional episode especially at the end when Piper goes to Paige's work to make up for trying to kill her...leaves telling her boss "Paige is my sister".

All in all season four is just as good as seasons 1 - 3.  Even with such a drastic character change the show is obviously doing well they are on it's 8th season now!
