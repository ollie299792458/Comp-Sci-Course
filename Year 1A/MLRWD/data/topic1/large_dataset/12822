I utterly detested this slick and glittery but pretentious and shallow attempt at a "buddy film," first of all because it reminds me of the scores of insufferable, nauseating, viciously condescending yuppie "wine snob" phonies I have often encountered.

Jack and Miles were just utterly loathsome and completely pathetic characters; their whiny immaturity,  aimless self-conscious materialism, fierce self-absorption and utter cluelessness was just awful and quite unfunny for a film that claims to be a sophisticated and deft comedy/satire--the tragic thing is that scores of people here in Southern California these days are just like those two if not worse; like Miles and Jack, they seem to quickly grow old without ever really growing up. Worse, these overgrown boys are quite thoughtlessly destructive; blithely creating meaningless tragedies all along the way while not learning much of anything useful or life-changing.

What's most unfortunate is that this picture had great potential to be a clever and brutal satire lambasting the greedy, pretentious snobbery, barely concealed sadism and exhaustingly neurotic phoniness of so many upper-class (and upper-class wannabe) Southern Californians, but the director, Alex Payne (whose prior films, "Citizen Ruth," "Election" and "About Schmidt" were superb) seems to have dropped the ball. Two grown, unmarried, presumably heterosexual men going on a "wine tasting" road trip together? Face it, it's absurd, but with a different director (say, Christopher Guest or Alex Cox) it could have been hilarious, a male version of the wonderful Britcom "Absolutely Fabulous," perhaps.

In view of films like "Sideways," it appears that over the past 30 odd years the time-honored American "buddy film" concept, sadly, has degenerated significantly, falling from the heights of deep, gritty and often amusing and touching studies about male friendship to the pathetic current lows of castrated, juvenile, prissy, lily-livered, mutual whining. I think of such "buddy" films of the past, the best of them from the 1970s (e.g., "Scarecrow" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman; "Thunderbolt & Lightfoot" with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges; "The In-Laws" with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk; "Bang The Drum Slowly" with Robert DeNiro and Michael Moriarty) and they easily stand head and shoulders above transparently self-indulgent yuppie trash like "Sideways."

I give "Sideways" two stars only because it had done a fine job of capturing and reflecting the bucolic beauty of California's largely still-rural central coast.
