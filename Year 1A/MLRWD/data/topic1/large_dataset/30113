This collection is better than the first one. It contains all second season episodes. The special features could still be better but they are stepped up a little bit. There is optional commentary for the episodes, The One With The List and The One With The Prom Video, as opposed to just the commentary on one episode from season one. Like the first season's look into Central Perk, there is an interactive view of Monica and Rachel's apartment. There is a quiz on how well you know your Friends and after completing the quiz, Phoebe's Smelly Cat music video plays. There is Friends of Friends which shows clips of guest stars that appeared during season 2. A new feature is What's Up With Your Friends? This shows clips of each of the main six characters. Not a great feature, but some of the best clips are included. P>Season Two of Friends has many key episodes, such as when Ross and Rachel get together, Richard is introduced, and Joey moves out. The factors of no commercials, extra footage seamlessly edited into all the episodes and some special features added to all the great episodes of season two are enough to make any Friends fan buy this collection.
