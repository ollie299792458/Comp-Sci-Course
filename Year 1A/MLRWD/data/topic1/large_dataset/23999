First let me safely say this is a fantastic film. I saw the 2009 version and loved it. This 2011 version, though different, is just as excellent and is actually in many ways more faithful to the book. It is written, acted and directed brilliantly.

Here is my beef:
The movie looks horrible. It was shot on a high tech digital camcorder, a Red 4k using Zeiss lenses. You would think this would mean something, and it does, a washed out lifeless, colorless, contrastless blah. This made the movie so hard to watch. This is such a well made film, whoops, I mean "video" that it is such a waste that it was shot on this immature medium. If this video had been shot on "real film" it would have been wonderful and rich with every scene complimenting in luxurious richness the power of the performances. But this was not to be.

I have seen the Red digi cams on other movies and the same problems abound. However I have seen movies and programs shot with the Arri digital cameras and they are astoundingly rich and lovely. So what is wrong with the Reds and why do they suck? It is just such a shame that directors are jumping on the digital bandwagon before the medium has solved all its dynamic range issues. As a result be prepared to see a lot of great movies that are really ugly.
