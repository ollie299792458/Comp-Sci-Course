This film is boring and very disconnected. The highlights for me were hearing Cate Blanchett (brava!) and Giovanni Ribisi (also bravo, but work on the `chiesa') speak Italian. In Gone in 60 Seconds, Giovanni, who must be a second generation Italian-American, plays Kit's little brother. In this film, he's a carabiniere that translates for Cate Blanchett, the (British) English teacher of Giovanni's brother.

The setting is Turin, or Torino as the 2006 Olympic Winter Games are officially titled. Cate Blanchett speaks excellent Italian. Unfortunately, though, neither of the Americans really speak enough Italian, and both of them revert to English or awkward silence (e.g. Ribisi mumbling `grazie' to their host on the farm) throughout the film.

I read the back of the DVD case and had dramatically different expectations about the plot. Like, where's the mafia, the drug dealers, the husband? The movie revolves around Cate's inadvertent slaughter of innocent children and her eventual getaway with Ribisi. Thumbs down. Uninspiring end.
