are invoked by watching this movie.  I too saw it in the theaters when it came out, and saw it several times.  I had the hugest crush on Philip Alford, who plays Boy, and cry every time at the end when he hobbles into the church.  My best friend had the soundtrack of this movie, and we would listen to it often.  This is one of my favorite movies, and it is seldom on TV, but I caught it on AMC last night.  Of course, the importance of the subject matter didn't hit home completely when I was a young teen, but now I am able to see what a marvelous Civil War movie this is, and how it reflects so perfectly my own feelings about the subject of war.  James Stewart is one of my favorite actors, and I see Tom Hanks following in his footsteps with the ability to equally portray comedy and drama and to make us believe and care about his characters.  A great example of a "war" movie that really showed very little actual bloodshed, and yet conveyed the horrors of war and the inexpressible sadness of a country torn in two.  I give it my very highest recommendation!
