When I mentioned to a friend that I had watched this, he asked if I could feel the heat and the sweat in the photography. As a matter of fact I could, but there was so much more to feel that, like the characters, the heat was the least of my problems.

A band of people on their last legs and last chances comes together in a remote hotel in Puerta Vallarta. A reverend in trouble for fornication and drinking, the hotel owner, recently widowed and burying her grief in sex and rum coco, a middle-aged street artist, alone and broke except for her ancient grandfather, a lesbian in denial and her petulant teenage charge. All of these meet at the top of a hill in Puerto, but the insights and the outcomes are profound and unpredictable.

Acting, writing, cinemetography - well, when you have some of the greats of the twentieth century involved in all of these aspects you are unlikely to get anything other than gold and expectations are more than met. Tennesee Williams is generally a playwright of tragedy, but Night of the Iguana has the perfect blend of mature hope and despair. A Streetcar Named Desire may be a bigger and more shocking play but Night of the Iguana gives a takeaway message of hope and endurance that is more subtle and memorable than his masterpiece - at least for those who wish to go on living, even in the face of life's depradations.

My favorite Tennesee William's play, a great Huston movie with wonderful performances by Richard Burton and Ava Gardner among others. Highly recommended.
