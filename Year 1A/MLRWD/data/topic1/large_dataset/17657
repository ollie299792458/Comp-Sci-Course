I LOVED this movie, so much, I need to have it in my small collection of movies I love. I think people are overanalyzing messages in this movie. Really, it never occured to me that Mother Gothel is a twisted rep for psycho moms that tells young viewers that moms are not genuine figures? Really? I think people should step back. Yes, there is a stab scene. No, it is NOT gorey at all, no nothing beyond a knife going into Flynn Rider's side. But people should think about this; kids are kids, sure, and they should be allowed to believe in fairytales? Of course. But somewhere, kids need to know; I think that Mother Gothel stabbing Flynn is a scene, not necessary, but adds much to the story by showing that you can't trust just anyone you meet, even if they've been in your life forever. They could still be bad people trying to tear you down; Mother Gothel is that. It shows a reality where people can be bad, and try to take away from you, but I think it also shows that the power of love overcomes people who hate you. In the end, Flynn survives and lives happily ever after with Rapunzel; see? Still a happy ending, a ridiculously adorable movie, and it teaches a valuable lesson that people are not always what they seem, that there is evil in the world, definitely, but there is more good than bad.  Kids cannot go through life believing it's okay to trust everyone (kidnappers and molesters ?!) and that everyone is a good, genuine person, because they're NOT. This movie shows that message! Stop trying to peel down all these little meanings, yes it's showing a mother being a horrible mom and being selfish and using Rapunzel, kids should feel loved and know they are loved. But they should also understand they are LUCKY to have a loving mom (and dad?) because some parents do a horrible job with their children.. and look what happens to them ?! Really, take a step back; this movie overall, I find, POSITIVE, and MEANINGFUL, and POWERFUL. It's an adorable, fantastic movie.
