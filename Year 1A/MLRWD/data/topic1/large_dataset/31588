I did it.  I bought a Disney movie -- I mean a kids-oriented one.  And then... I actually showed it to my kids (first I watched it again, just to make sure).

This is so totally out of character for me, that it *does* deserve a gasp of surprise.

Because Disney.  DISNEY!  No positive male role-models DISNEY!  Every male character is a fool, a tool, a slob, or a villain DISNEY!  Forget about little boys, because only girls are celebrated DISNEY!  And yes, I still think that is the case for Disney.  And I wonder who all those little girls will grow up to marry, when all the boys are fools, tools, slobs, or villains.

But Julie Andrews.  JULIE ANDREWS!  Mary Poppins!

So I cracked.  And I bought it.

And I had a few twinges on my view-through -- the put-down of men as "rather stupid" in Mrs. Bank's first number; and the presumption that Mr. Banks' flying a kite with his children was somehow MORE valuable than his daily providing for them (I do appreciate the value of kite-flying, just not the value judgment); and the idea that the kids will respect a nanny who is sweet and pretty, but not one who smells weird.

But I went ahead and showed it to the kids, and I'm so glad, because we have been singing the songs like crazy and laughing a lot.  The absolute fantasy of it is marvelous, and the songs are beautiful.  I like how Bert treats Mary.  I like how straight Mary is, as though she isn't magical, when she clearly is.

Very nice.

Now I'm wondering about Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Would anyone be so kind as to enlighten me about whether that one is as good?  Thanks!
