First, let me say that I am a huge Schwarzenegger fan, so that helps the score.  If anyone else other than Arnold was doing the role of Gordy in this movie, I wouldn't rank the film that high.  The DVD contains some extra features, all are fun to look at and is interesting.  The film is very good.  Many may not like it, but I do.  Arnold plays as a fireman the loves his family, and loses them to terrorists.  Arnold plays as an action star in a different way, and I think that most don't expect this from Arnold and don't rank this movie so high.  You can easily put yourself into Arnold's shoes in this movie, and see how victims of terrorist attacks truly feel.  You see Arnold come home and sit down very depressed as he lost what is most important to him, reporters call him wanting the story(they sound ever so excited to get it from him too) while you see Arnold angry and not wanting the calls.  Eventually, you see him go and take matters into his own hands, because the government wont.  This is where business picks up.  While the movie is not up to standard in most of Arnold's films, it still contains more story, suspense, twists, and wonderful acting.  Many can also relate to this by recent terrorist attacks in the U.S.  i.e. the 9/11 attacks, or the sniper attacks.  It is worth viewing, and should not be missed.
