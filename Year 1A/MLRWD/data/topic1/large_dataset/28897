'Domino' is hard to categorize, it's said to be a bio and an action flick, but when you're watching it feels like a graphic novel come alive, like a video clip, and like a visual and auditory acid trip.

What gives if not all is 'realistic' and a 'portrayal of true events', if it's a fantastic, dazzling event that leaves you gasping for air? That would be like blaming Dali or Picasso for not painting a realistic picture... Rather silly, no?

The reason that opinions seem to be so divided is simple, 'Domino' is not for everyone. Traditionalists and lazy minds will hate it because they don't get it. Free Spirits and investigative minds however will most likely love it for the great ride it is.

Keira Knightley is superb as 'Domino', hard as nails, and sexier than ever. I loved to see Mickey Rourke as her Boss (Team Leader), what a great choice! Relative newcomer Edgar Ramirez is also well cast as the sexy, shy-ish 'latin lover'.

If you're open for a new experience 'Domino' will grab you and not let go. It's a post-modern masterpiece; the visual style is simply brilliant, and it's all supported by a hypnotizing soundtrack. What a Trip!
