Okay, before I begin, I should tell you that this isn't a review of the movie "Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs". I'm gonna be talking about the bonus stuff included on the DVD!
"Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs" is the most advanced DVD I have ever seen. Even though that alone might not say much, (Our family curently owns only 5 DVDs) I can tell it's great judging by what the other people are saying. The movie itself has been fully restored, and it looks better than it ever did before! 
Disc One of the DVD contains the film, as well as audio commentary by Walt Disney himself (I know he would be proud of just how great this DVD is). The forty minute "Making Of Snow White" is also great. And the new version of "Some Day My Prince Will Come" is so good, it might put Snow White herself to shame. 
My favorite part of the DVD just might be the great trivia game, "Dopey's Wild Mine Ride". Players have to help Dopey gather the other dwarfs from the mine to help him save Snow White. It's a thriling experience!
Disc Two of the DVD is also great. The deleted scenes just might be the best part, and there are surprisingly alot of them. Some are fully animated! Another treat is the "Disney Through The Decades" film: It not only let's us see what's been hapenning with Disney through the years, but it also let's us see "Snow White's" original trailers. The first one doesn't even show any actual scenes from the film.
There's much, much more on this DVD, but I don't want to spoil it all for you. But I will tell you that after watching some of this DVD, I have a new respect for "Snow White" that I never thought I'd have!
