I have been doing Pilates for some time now - 6 years or so...and have actually taken the steps to get certified to teach someday (after the baby - I'm 7 months along.) I love this routine because it is taught similar to a class format. It is the closest DVD that I've found to taking an actual class - which is what I wanted.

I am a fan of "pure" Pilates - classical - if you will. I love the fact that this routine is "PILATES" - it is not a yoga/stretch/cardio/weight-lifting/put your hand on your belly and breath class.

This routine is "movement."  Joseph Pilates, himself, taught in a way that emphasized precision, flow, movement with the breath, and concentration.  I am so happy to have finally found a video that has incorporated these principals into a routine designed for pregnancy.

The first section is every move from the "intermediate" mat routine that can be done while pregnant.  The second section is the entire side leg series - love it!!

I have continued to use this DVD again and again. It is definately one that I highly recommend!!
