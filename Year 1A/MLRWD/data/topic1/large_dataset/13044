I must admit I waited anxiously for this to come out on DVD as I wanted to know if they finally actually go through with it. To be honest I always thought Mr Big didnt deserve Carries unwaivering devotion and always thought she should have ended up with Aidan he was the far better man. But no one chooses who your heart longs for and in the end it was Mr Big who owned Carries Heart!! The scene outside the church where she beats him up with the bouquet was priceless. Amanda not telling her what she said to Big the night before the wedding until months later was so wrong. Her own jaded view of marriage nearly kept them apart. But without that scene the movie would have never happened. It really was very well thought out and written in tune with who the characters really were. In the end I was disappointed they didnt end up in there dream home but was glad to see the wedding went from being over the top to intimate and private as it should have been all along. Very well written and acted I thought. Loved it!! I think they need to do one more with them having children and with Samantha finally getting married and becoming a Mom too that is bound to be hilarious!! Glad to see Steve and Amanda back together as I truly think he has always been the "ONE" for her. Great acting on all their parts! Thumbs up!!
