First of all, I'm not a fan of remakes. I think it's just proof that today's generation of horror makers have no new ideas. And I can give you a list of horror remakes that just make my blood boil, especially the remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I mean, what's the point of the remake if you basically change everything about the original film.

  Well, maybe it's because this remake is produced by the original director, Wes Craven, but this is how you do a remake.

I understand that it is necessary to change some things about the original, simply because we live in different times, as well as the opportunity to tell a better story with better technology. And while this remake does take some liberties with the story, it remains remarkably faithful to the original. I was very impressed. The changes that are here are actually an improvement on the original. Overall, if you like horror, you should love this one.

  My only complaint is while there are plenty of gross moments, I felt like there were only a time or two that the film felt scary. I think this movie could have been a bit scarier, if some of the killings were more thought out. This doesn't deter the film much, but I think it keeps it from being a true classic. That said, this remake "Hills" is by far the best remake of a horror classic that I've seen, and all of those new generation directors should pay attention to this one, because this is how you do a remake the right way.
