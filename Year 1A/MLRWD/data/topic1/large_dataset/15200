The movie is almost 3 hours long (in DVD version). It is really capturing your attention from scene one till the end keeping you hooked all time long.
The obvious pluses are:
1) Incredible scnenery, great acting and very expensive set design.
2) Intention for viewers of all ages groups, so it's safe to be recommended for family and kids.
3# Impeckable authenticity of ethnic and cultural presentation in places where movie was chosen to be shot #Chinese part looks exactly like historical China of chosen time in all features, Syria looks like Syria, stc.).

The obvious minuses are:
1) Quite distant depiction from the authentic "1001 nights" stories, which might lead the unexperienced audience in a wrong direction about the actual classical story lines (Al ad-Din never was a Chinese thief and the whole story can't possibly be happening in China since "1001 Nights" embraces only Arabic realm; Kasym, the brother of Ali Baba, did not live with him in the same house and Ali Baba, besides his servant, had a wife; etc).
2) Vanessa Mae as a Chinese princess is an obvious commercial trick based on her popularity in pop-music in the year when movie was made: as for starring she is very poor choice both by appearance and by acting.
3) Arabian epic in reality is one of exteremly erotic examples of classical literature, while the movie is so God Damm innocent that one could preach watching it.

Overall I would certainly recommend obtaining this film for your home collection, provided you don't take everything you see as the actual "1001 Nights" epic.
