Disney's Oliver and Company fully deserves the five stars.  I first saw the movie on video in the early nineties, and I must have been in a bad mood, because it didn't stick with me.  But I just saw it again, in fact I watched it two times in a row.  My husband watched it the second time with me, and he loved it. I think that this video should be in every child's personal collection.  It has such a wonderful message of believing in yourself during tough times, compassion, friendship, love, and doing the right thing.

Set in Manhattan, the backgrounds and art of Oliver and Company are a treat.  I did not appreciate the art of this movie the first time I saw it.  The backgrounds and scenery are brushed with dark browns and blues, evoking the simultaneous urban grit and inexplicable pull of New York City.

Based on Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, Oliver is a homeless kitten who falls in with a gang of stray dogs.  The gang is led by Fagan, voiced by the irreplaceable Dom Deluise.  (What would animated movies be without Dom Deluise?)  Oliver soon meets Jenny, a lonely, loving little rich girl, and he is torn between his two families.  The evil Sykes, to whom Fagan owes money, has plans to hold Jenny for ransom.

Billy Joel and Bette Midler provide their speaking and singing voices as Dodge and Georgette.  The original songs in this movie are so special.
