But not the best, of course. The movie always did look funny when it was in theaters, but I was too freaked out by the horrid make-up job to give it a whirl. But alas, my friend, who claimed of the movie's humorous qualities rented it so I could finally see it. And that make-up job was still so terrible.

All in all, it was an "okay" movie. I'm one who still appreciates gags, so of course the most hilarious scene was definitely the bathroom fart scene.(I'm a 24 year old female too, so quite grown up). I'm neither black nor white, so the only little "poke" at racism that kinda bugged me for a short minute was at the beginning when Shawn's character claimed his IQ was "lower" as he was dressed in Hispanic garb.

As a whole, though, I don't think the movie was really well thought-out. I mean, it did have its several funny moments, but eh...not enough to make it a great comedy.  It was totally stupid, but in a funny way, so you can't really take a movie like that too seriously. Some of the humor was tasteless and corny and kinda disgusting, like the girl slumber party scene. I'm not sure which version I was watching, but the humor in that scene doesn't have a place in even PG-13 movies, so I'm guessing the uncut version was rented.

Anyway, I recommend this movie only for people who don't take movies seriously, for those people who appreciate the stupid funny movies, for those who like gag humor, and for those who can truly make themselves overlook the fact the make-up is horrible but characters stupidly never notice, etc. But if you just happen to be a rich, but sensitive white girl, then you might want to look elsewhere! The real blonde characters in this flick were more gag-worthy than even the men's portrayal of them.
