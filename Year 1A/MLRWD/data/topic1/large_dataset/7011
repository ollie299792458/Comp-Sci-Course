One reviewer here said that Monte Wildhorn, the elderly author played by Morgan Freeman, comes to this rural locale to cure his writer's block; his stated purpose at the beginning of the film was to cure his life, either by drink or by his sixgun (he does have one and later fires it; he used to write westerns, after all).  He show this pretty clearly in his consumption of sour mash at the start of the film with the comment that being a drunk is a full-time job and leaves no time for writing.

Apparently, the author of this screenplay is a drunk.

Freeman is, as always, charming and believable in his role.  The social situation of Belle Isle, not so much.  When Wildhorn comments to his pianist neighbor after hearing her play, "I have never heard Beethoven's Pathetique played with so much feeling," her response is, "Oh, you know the piece?"

Obviously he does, or he would not have come up with the Title and Composer.  A clever writer might have given her a better line, but not this one.  Much of the dialogue is at this level.  Wildhorn wheels into a roomful of mostly white strangers at a wake and nobody introduces him, yet people all behave as if they somehow knew each other from grade school.

Wildhorn is redeemed as an author through his mentoring of a little girl (played by Emma Fuhrmann) who wishes to become a writer:  their scenes together are some of the most authentic and genuinely moving in the film.  Otherwise, the piece moves from the trite to the sentimental, and pretty much sinks in bathos.
