From a quality point of view, both video and audio are 5 stars as many have stated. As for the diverse lineup of artists, I think that pretty much depends on how eclectic your tastes are. I personally didn't have any problems with Steve Tyler and Yo Yo Ma being on the same stage. But that's just me. You would have to listen for yourself.

I had 2 issues - one of which led me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars. The performance of the Ennio Morricone piece from Cinema Paradiso is both captivating and intense. Yet in the middle of one of his solo, inexplicably Chris winks at someone in the audience. This just ruined the whole piece for me. (juxtapose this with the comment he made at the end regarding needing a drink...) This is one of my favorite all time piece but because of this, I will only listen to this piece on CD. This is a case where listening is truly better than seeing.

The other issue was with the disc itself. The initial disc I received was defective in that the "special feature" wouldn't play back properly. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement which worked fine; typical kind of A+ service from Amazon
