Most of us acquire a "wound" early in life that says "we aren't good enough". When my parents divorced at age 5, I was given such a wound that was demonstrated as a "shyness". Society easily gives us that wound, particularly to a woman: "am I beautiful? Am I beautiful with one breast?"

I too initially found my self worth in numerous relationships: they told me I was good enough. And then, if one is unfortunate enough to build a "super Ego" as in the case of Kingsley's character, one can sorta continuously keep artificially "filling this wound" with ongoing relationships with "beautiful" women. Unfortunately the only thing that will truly fill that wound is Love, and sometimes we don't figure out what love is until everything else is gone.

Those points described above actually are not well portrayed in the movie, except the part about finding love when all else is gone. But that point alone makes the movie for me. Kingsley, getting old, and other than an only "sorta friend" that shares his womanizing", has essentially nothing of value in his life, when he is given a beautiful "flower" to behold. He really has no idea of how to handle it, no idea of what true love is until the end of the movie.

How many of us go home alone, and live out a life with no intimacy? And we  do it because we don't know what true love is.And we do it because we are wounded and afraid we aren't good enough. Love is everything good, it is friendship based on knowledge (that we are good enough), understanding(that we aren't perfect; we will screw up), forgiveness and responsibility(to learn from our mistakes, to apologize for our mistakes). It is a commitment, not a feeling. And, as I write this, it is compassion for so many that do not know.
