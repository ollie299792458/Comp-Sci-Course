I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing. I didn't even read the back, but from the cover art, expected a lighthearted family comedy(like The Family Stone maybe?). That is not what I got...

I'm on the verge of saying I hated this movie, but honestly think its one of those films where everyone will take away something different from it. I'm 29, so I don't easily relate to having grown children and being retired. This movie made me really sad because I find it be so true to life these days, where people seem to rarely make time for each other. It was difficult and upsetting to watch a father try so hard to really get to know his kids, while they were usually just lying through their teeth to him.

The redeeming parts for me was the ending, which made me feel better, and the actors. Robert De Niro(Frank) was spectacular and entirely convinced me of his character's good intentions with raising his kids, that maybe fell a little short. His grown children were a little one sided, but that may be how you were suppose to experience them, from Frank's point of view.

On the whole I would say if you go into it knowing what it's about, give it a try and you might really enjoy it. But I found it too painful and depressing for my taste.
