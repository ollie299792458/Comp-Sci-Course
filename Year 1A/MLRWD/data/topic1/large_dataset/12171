This is, simply put, the best movie ever made.  As a huge fan of zombie movies, when I saw the preview for 'Shaun of the Dead,' I knew I had to see it; it completely lived up to my expectations.  This movie, unlike some other horror parodies, perfectly blends humor with gore.  Also, not only are there plenty of subtle horror movie references for the hardcore horror fan, it's a movie with enough jokes and gore for the average citizen.  As if this killer movie wasn't enough to make me go out and buy the DVD the day it came out, the DVD also includes lots of hilarious bonus features.  Personally, the extended scene of Coldplay promoting Zombaid, a play off of Liveaid, is the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Also, the commentary is not only informative, but unlike most commentary on DVDs, it is interesting to listen to.  To sum this up, anyone who doesn't want to immediately go out and buy this DVD, must have already had their brains eaten by zombies because, again, this is the best movie ever made!
