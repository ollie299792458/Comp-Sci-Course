There was something about this movie that made me want to give it more than two stars, but y'know that ain't gon happen. The reason is that they had a great premise and a great action star, but they let the air go out of the movie somewhere near the beginning.  It never recovered.  
Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, especially the spec ops like fire fights and the nicely done super human abilities that Jet had.  Still I blame whoever for allowing the movie to rest soley on those aspects and never exploring the full potential of an Ultimate ONE. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to make my own movie.  If you hear about some guy dying in his own basement trying to film a sci-fi flick that was me. That is, I can't do it, but they could have accomplished soooooooo much more with this movie.
Still I enjoyed it at the $1 flick and I'd see it again if I was in an airplane on my way somewhere. So if you like Jet Li, action, and want an escape this does all of that.  But if you are super creative and think you're going to get a mixture of creativity and action...I am sorry. Say it with me...It ain't gon happen.
