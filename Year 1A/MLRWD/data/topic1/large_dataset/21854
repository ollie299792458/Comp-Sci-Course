Wow. What can I say - that I was blown away on every level?!!

What really lifted this movie for me was the exceptional acting and the dialogue - the script was superb. It was poetic and original. Im a writer and director myself, so the sheer quality of this movie is no doubt due to the incredible director Ham Tran. I have to applaud him for presenting this story in such a fantastic way. Every scene was beautifully shot and it was never OTT.

You have done such a lot for the Vietnamese community with this contribution. I am Vietnamese myself and was born in the UK, but the tales about the departure and the pirate attacks is very real and authentic - so many people never made it- you just never hear about their stories.

This is a film I will never forget and I am going to watch it once every year to remind myself of the real values in life - to put everything into perspective.

The soundtrack was wonderful too. I loved the Vietnamese songs in this and have already tracked them down on Youtube.

I have never cried so much during a movie - but 4 times during this one!

A big thank you to all the cast and crew and Ham Tran for writing and directing this. Whatever else you have coming out I would definitely go and see/buy.

My only complaint (not really a complaint) is that I wish this DVD was more commonly available - Ive had to order it from the USA. OK so I watched it online for free but it's so beautiful I want my own copy to treasure.
