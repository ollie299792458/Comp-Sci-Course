I am partially biased to this film because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I will put that aside for this review.  This is one of the greatest "Rock Opera" movies I have ever seen (if you even consider it a  rock opera).  It has brilliant cinematography.  Great effort was put in to  attention to detail.  In this film, everything is where it is for a reason.  The story is wonderful. I believe that it is something everybody can  relate to.  Building up an emotional wall to attempt to combat the horrible  things that occur in all of our lives, and the trauma that comes with the  building of this wall.  There is so much more to it than that though.  So  many references, so much deep symbolism in every scene.  Some anti-war,  anti-establishment undertones.  On top of all of this, the DVD is  wonderfully put together.  Every menu screen has been put together with a  different pink floyd song and scene from the movie.  There are many great  features, including director commentarys and makings of, interviews, cut  footage (the "Hey You" scene that was cut out of the film),  original trailers, production stills.  It is wonderful.  This is a  wonderful DVD to own in my opinion.  I have had it for a while now, and I  still have not finished going through everything that is on the DVD. You  won't regret this purchase.
