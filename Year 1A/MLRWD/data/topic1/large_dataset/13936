As far as I am concerned John Adams and Peter Sellers are  THE most important creators of total theater in this young century.  Adams' music is breathtaking, and Seller's libretto and direction are beyond compare.  Why is it a flawed masterpiece?  The dancing, which helped at first and then became distracting. And, after the Vishnu episode, which should have introduced the explosion, one had to wait forty five minutes of wasted time (and wasted, gorgeous music) for it to take place . . . and it fizzled. But Findlay's rendition of Donne's poem must be the most dramatic moment of my operatic life.  So what if, as one reviewer said,Oppenheimer was Jewish? Jews feel the burden of submission to their Sadistic God just as Christians do. I played it twice and howled in pain throughout.  One last thing.  Those wide eyes, making the singers look like lemurs. On the other hand, I was could share their visions!  What absolutely magnificent singing of a most difficult score!  Wait, I just changed my rating from four to five.  This opera points a finger to those who initiated the atomic age, and why this country is so afraid of it.  It might just reap what it sowed.
