Unlike March of the Penguins, Arctic Tale is reminiscent of the old True Life Adventure animal series of the 50s--except that they were entertaining.  I almost expected Rex Allen Jr. to start the narration.
The animals were given human emotions and thoughts which is totally ridiculous.  I could almost abide by this simply as an entertainment factor, but that, coupled with the constant interjections on Global Warming and how all of the Arctic will soon disappear, was a little more than distracting.  In fact, it was quite irritating.  If you like apocalyptic prophecies in a movie, you'll love Arctic Tale.  It becomes more of a commercial for An Inconvenient Truth.  If our world is truly in this terrible condition, then we need to make immediate and drastic changes.  Unfortunately, I don't see it.  How come the Arctic is loosing its ice while, at the same time, they are up to their elbows in snow in Colorado?  Anyway, as unwelcome as this comment may be in a movie review, it shows you how irritating it is to hear someone else's political commentary while trying to enjoy a family movie.  I won't be watching this movie again.  Now, you know where the "Not Helpful" button is...
