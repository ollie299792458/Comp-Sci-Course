Smallville Season 3 continues the epic story of the teen that would become The Man of Steel: Superman. This season the show took a darker direction that turned off some hardcore fans. Mostly the younger demographic. Personally, being a lower twenty-something, I thought Season 3 was the best written, acted and looking season of the show. Or any current sci-fi show for that matter. Lex and Lionel Luthor, portrayed brilliantly by Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover, took lead spots this Season in the overall arc. Such heart-wrenching and beautifully directed episodes such as "Shattered" and "Memoria" showed Michael Rosenbaum is one of Televisions most talented/underrated actors. The greens and purples and steely blues that permeate "Asylum" and "Exile" give the series a distinct cinematic look far superior to most other shows around and will look fantastic presented in widescreen on the DVD's. And not to be outdone Tom Welling continues to grow as an actor and seems more comfortable than ever as young Clark Kent. Each season shows him improve with leaps and bounds and has even generated a rabid following of fans clamoring for his casting as Superman in the upcoming WB feature film. And let's not forget a return appearance for the original big screen Man of Steel Christoper Reeve in "Legacy". Bottom line: For fans of the show Smallville or Superman in general- Season 3 is worth every penny and there's no reason it shouldn't be in your collection. For those that aren't already fans? Well Season 3 just might win you over.
