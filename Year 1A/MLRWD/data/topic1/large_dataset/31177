Some of the key issues from Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice -- in my opinion the best novel in the English language -- are preserved in this version, but it makes other contributions she might love if she'd lived 200 years to see the Bollywood song-and-dance homage to her story of an intelligent woman trapped by the social mores of her time. I've seen almost every version of the Austen novel that has ever been filmed and have read the book many times. Very few of the films capture the intelligence, the fun, or the passion of the original. This one does. Most of the films dumb down Austen's class commentary and complex relationships, both of which are well done here. Watch for the quick but pointed discussion of American imperialism if you like politics. Although all the music is thrilling, my favorite is "No Life Without Wife," a subtly feminist rejection of men who think they are owed pretty wives -- yet it preserves the Austen irony that even women make ridiculous mistakes in matters of the heart. The young people are gorgeous; the older people are great actors. It will make you laugh.
