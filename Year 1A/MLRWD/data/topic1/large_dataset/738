One of Hitchcock's best British films (his first Hollywood film came two years later with Rebecca) and certainly my favorite from his pre-Hollywood days, in The Lady Vanishes Hitch brings together three genres to create one classic that manages to display some of the best post-silent Hitchcock has to offer.

The Lady Vanishes tells the story of Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), a train passenger who befriends an older woman named Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty) after taking a bump on the head. When Miss Froy goes missing, Iris becomes obsessed with finding her, first to prove that she isn't crazy - none of the other passengers believe Miss Froy exists, you see - and then because she finds herself pulled into a much larger mystery. A relationship between Iris and another passenger, Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), adds a touch of humor and romance to the proceedings.

Hitchcock manages to open with a highly comedic first act, pulls the audience into a slow-burning suspense story for the second act, and catapults us into an action-filled third act, all in just under 100 minutes. Through it all Hitch populates his train with a wide cast of varied and interesting characters, all of them quite memorable. Fun and engrossing, for a peek into Hitchcock's British era, The Lady Vanishes is the one to see.

When seeking this on DVD, settle for nothing less than the Criterion Collection release of this film.
