I remember one evening back in 1995, I was still in middle school, and a movie came on ABC. It was a long movie, almost 3 hours, and it was called Waterworld. I loved it and I asked for it for Christmas. That Christmas, I got a VHS tape of the movie and immediately sat down to watch it.

Much to my disappointment, the movie I saw on that tape had been heavily edited -- and, as I found out later, so had the version shown in movie theaters. Now, most movies are edited, everyone knows that, but the way this particular movie was edited made no sense at all.

It turns out I was lucky enough to see the UN-edited version on TV that night, and so I knew when I saw the edited version that they had edited out some of the most important scenes in the movie -- and I don't just mean scenes that gave the characters depth, or revealed interesting side plots, I mean the scenes that make the whole damned movie make sense. To this day I have no idea what they were thinking, but clearly that was the reason this movie got poor reviews back in the day.

Well, lucky me (and lucky you, if you're reading this review), 14 years after the movie came out they finally got around to releasing the un-edited version on DVD. (I would've settled for VHS 14 years sooner, but whatever.) If you saw this movie and you kinda liked it, or kinda didn't like it, but are willing to see it again, BUY THIS DVD. The extended version is the one shown on ABC back in 1995, and take it from someone who's seen both versions, this is the only version worth buying. This is the version that makes sense.

I loved this movie back then, and I still do now.

Oh, and I want that boat. I was pissed that they torched it. ;)
