The second effort of the series from the writing team of Curtis & Elton,

and they equaled, or if possible exceeded Black Adder I.  Of course I

like, understand English humor, I think it may be part of the blood,

seeing that I'm a mix of plantagenet and burton, by way of Canada.  But

even for my American cousins, there is enough slapstick to go around,

with the humor that comes from twisting the Bard's beak, and an almost

criminal hijacking of English history.  Seemingly working with a

smaller budget than Dr. Who, and a very young, and very cute Miranda

Richardson.  Also it has the benifit of an episode and a half that

PBS was to uptight to air, yes my lovlies, something that you may have

not seen.  That I really don't understand, the deleated episodes,

"Chains", the half deleated episode, what PBS found offensive you could

see on any channel these days, and "Beer" the fully deleated episode,

on most cable channels.  But that is not the point, the PBS which says

it stands against suppression of art, suppressing it.  But that is not

the thrust of this review.  This is very funny stuff, not only will

your sides hurt from the slapstick, but the right and left areas of

your brain will be stimulated to exhaustion by the time this 200

minute fractured history lesson is finished playing.
