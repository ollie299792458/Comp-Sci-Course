One Day in September is a documentary like no other. Good documentaries will leave you with a sense of what a specific period in history was actually like. One Day in September goes far beyond just giving you a sense of the events which occurred during the Munich Olympics, it seems to immerse you in those events. Before unfolding the actual chain of events in the Munich Crisis, the film does a great job of depicting the political, social, and emotional state of the early 1970's. Then, the film proceeds to lay the hostage crisis out in a seamless sequence of events. Throughout the film, one feels the events escalating and the desperation building. None of the incident is left un-inspected and unreported. In addition, the film is made even more complete by the insertion of present-day interviews with the Israelis and Germans involved, as well as the only surviving Palestinian terrorist who took part in the operation. To hear commentary by those who were personally involved, proved extremely powerful. If this film doesn't give you a true sense of the gravity and horror of the Munich Hostage Crisis, I'm not sure what will.
