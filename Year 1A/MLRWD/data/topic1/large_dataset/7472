In my humble opinion, some of the best movies I've ever seen were good old classics like this one. Although I am only 22 years of age, Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorite actors, and this is my favorite of Hitchcock's works. Doris Day outdid herself as the mourning mother, and the two of them did a very good job playing a married couple. I think this movie, as far as the acting is concerned, was way ahead of its time. Method acting was still in its infancy (if that) but the two of them did such an outstanding job, especially in the scene when Jimmy Stewart's character first tells Doris Day's character that their son has been kidnapped. The boy was my only complaint about the whole movie. Kids really didn't know how to act back then. So if you're looking for a good mystery/suspense as only Hitchcock can deliver, then this movie is definitely for you. Oh, and the ending will definitely make you giggle like a maniac. All I can say there is: Wow, there were actually people back then that were pretty cool! Imagine that! ^_^
