Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, "Extradition: British Columbia" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.

I also enjoyed "A Very Juliet" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message "this is you". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.

If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add.
