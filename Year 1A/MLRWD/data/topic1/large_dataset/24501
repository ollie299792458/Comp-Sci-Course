The mini-series is unfortunately nowhere near as good as the book, with most of the best story lines, e.g. KGB and Servin being omitted. The focus is totally Par-con, Gornt and the Tai pan. The 355mins running time just isn't enough to do it justice, they need 24 45 min episodes to cover the scope of the book. The Australian DVD release can hardly by called re-mastered. It's better than VHS, but not as good as DVD should be. The MPEG-2 compression is ok, I haven't noticed any drop outs but its obvious that the master was most likely a badly looked after Beta SP and there are some sections where the picture distorts. Having said that it is still completely watchable. It is just not the DVD quality we've come to expect from Hollywood releases. The DVD is all regions but is PAL, so not much use to any one in the US with a DVD player that doesn't support PAL. There is a biography on Pierce Brosnan but no other extras. The DVD is definately a better option than the VHS.

The acting is awful by everyone except Pierce Brosnan - only really for big fans of the book. A shame as the book's got amazing potential for an excellent tv drama series.
