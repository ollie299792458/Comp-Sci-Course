The beginning of the movie was slow. The film has too many flashbacks. I couldn't tell whether we were in the present or the past. Diane Kruger and Josh Hartnett acted very well as well as Rose Byrne. Jessica Pare didn't have much scope in the film and that's what I didn't like. The story is based on how a crafty friend spoils the relationship between the two lovers. I wasn't convinced that tiny bits of lies spread by other people can make lovers hate each other. The  camera picks up some nice spots in Chicago, my beloved city. 'The Drake Hotel' reminded my stay there. The wind of the windy city, the familiar skyscrapers, the snow and fogging breaths of the people. All shown very nicely.
The music score is good.
But the story and the flashbacks confused me. It became too stressful to find a meaning in the story,made me yawn several times. I saw it only because IMDB rating was 6.9. I can't agree with that rating. I'd probably give only 4.0
I've to see some great movie today to compensate for the loss of time yesterday.
