This movie is on my top 10 list of favorites. True, Lateef is a trouble-maker; but the tender side of him is genuine; and his love and sacrifice for Baran is well...heavenly. I did wonder after watching it, if there's such a man out there like him.
I was moved to tears when Lateef cried and begged for his money from Memar (his boss). What a man! Yes, I refrain from describing him as a kid because, he was actually a man deeply in love.

There were too many scenes that were moving; that I found myself skipping back to the scene to see it again. But I will list a few scenes:

~The tea and sugar for Lateef scene
~Lateef waiting for his bread from Baran during lunch break
~Finding the hair clip with a strand of hair
~The hands scene near the end when Lateef helped Baran pick up the  vegetables from the ground
~The shoe scene as if it was a Cinderella story

Here's a quote from the wise shoe repairman: "From the hot fire of being apart comes the flame that burns the heart."

I would have liked that both characters stared longer at each other during the "hands scene". Heck! Lateef should have asked for Baran's hand in marriage.
Oh well...I didn't write and make the movie and it's still 2 thumbs up for me. I loved the movie.

"The Children of Heaven" is just as beautiful.
