For critics that enjoy seeing films that are intelligently entertaining than this might be or become your favorite film. Mostly others will enjoy it's special effects, acting, originality, and comedy. This would definetly be one film that one could watch more than once and obtain new ideas or parts that one looked over when seeing it the first time. Surely this is Michael J. Fox's and Christopher Llyod's milestone and movie of remembrance! One will enjoy the film's approach to the theory and portail of time travel and it's traits. This movie captured the minds of many and still intrigues many people today. The first installment went so well that Zemeckis made two additonal sequels and Universal extended its enjoyment and boundraies of stimulators when Back to the Future the Ride was built. The most amazing aspect is that Back to the Future lives on today thanks to Universal Studios.  If Back to the Future wants any revision or remembrance to furthur bounds then release of this film and it's installments to DVD would be one of it's only hopes. Universal may not always keep the Back to the Future ride, therefore by releasing it to DVD would bring back the magic once more to all that never had the chance to enjoy one of film history's greatests classics.
