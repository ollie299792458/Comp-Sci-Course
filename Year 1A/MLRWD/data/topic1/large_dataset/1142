I first saw "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" months ago when it was first released, and was stunned for the duration. For hours afterward, I could hardly think of anything else. This magnificent film is an emotionally draining experience, but worth every minute. The fight scenes-- I hesitate to call them "fight scenes," as that description hardly does them justice-- are indescribably beautiful, and magnificently choreographed by master Yuen Wo-Ping. Many people unfamiliar with Chinese film regard "The Matrix" as the pinnacle of action choreography, and "CT,HD" is hard evidence that this is not so. "The Matrix" is a fine film, but the balletic battles of "CT,HD" are far beyond anything that film achieves. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" has become my second-favorite film of all time; my all-time favorite is "Casablanca," so that should give you an idea of the distinguished company this film can keep.  From the very first chord of Tan Dun's magnificent score, "CT,HD" is an enthralling cinematic experience. The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat and the ever-delightful Michelle Yeoh, along with the captivating Zhang Ziyi, make up one of the most incredible casts I've ever seen.  Keep in mind that I've seen several thousand films, ranging from "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" to "The Usual Suspects" to "Hello, Dolly," and beyond those. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" has a well-deserved place among the very best of them, and will stand as an all-time classic.
