I am an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes. I love the original stories by Doyle, having read quite a few of them. And I must say that this film contains the most accurate rendering of Doyle's famous detective I have ever seen on screen. Ever. That's not an exaggeration, either.

The Holmes in Doyle's stories was not just a man of peerless intellect - he was also a boxer, could shoot and fence well, and knew an early form of martial arts. He also had serious bouts with depression, was often unpredictable and blunt, and kept an untidy apartment. It may sound odd, but Holmes was the epitomy of oddness, and this film shows him as such.

The people who complain about this are generally the ones who haven't read the original stories. They're just drawing on what they know from the 1940s feature films starring Basil Rathbone. Not cool. Rathbone is a fine actor, but his representation of Holmes as an austere, ultra-thin brainiac is disappointing at best.

The movie also scores points with its accurate portrayal of Dr. Watson. In the aforementioned TV series, Watson was depicted as a bumbling fool who kept getting in his partner's way. Not so in this film: Watson is a muscular, intelligent Army doctor... just like in Doyle's stories.

Of course, it's not a perfect adaption - I don't think Holmes ever encountered that many explosions and fist-fights during a single case, and the character of Irene Adler is much different than the one Doyle created. Everything considered, however, it's a refreshingly satisfying mix of action, adventure, mystery, and humor.
