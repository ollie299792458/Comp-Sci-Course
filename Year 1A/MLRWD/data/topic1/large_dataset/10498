At one level, this movie is about a South Asian actor with the hysterically funny misfortunes of Inspector Clouseau. Peter Sellers carries much of the film with his great comedic abilities (with some side-splitting help from the kitchen staff, the waiter, and a cowboy star named Wyoming Bill Kelso), but there's more to it than that.

Where Sellers plays Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films as a bumbling idiot, Sellers' character here (Hrundi Bakshi) is ultimately a very kind and remarkably sweet fellow who has stumbled into a party where he just doesn't fit in with the pompous Hollywood powerbrokers. He tries desperately to mix and mingle, but fails miserably for the most part. There's clumsiness (both physical and social) to be sure, but it's generally played as horribly bad luck mixed with naivite (rather than Clouseau's arrogant idiocy). That said, watching this party is a riot.

If you've ever lived abroad and struggled to "fit in" mingling at social events where you are the only foreigner (or simply hesitated to ask someone where their bathroom is), you might just see yourself in Peter Sellers' role.
