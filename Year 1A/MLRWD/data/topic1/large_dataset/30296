I would recommend this film to anyone, not just Johnny Depp fans. It is wonderful and he is a true artist. Dealing with the mentally ill is never easy, on film or in real life but it is dealt with here. The difficulty of understanding how people feel and what they need. Mary Stuart Masterson was probably born for this part and this film no doubt, was supposed to make her a big star. Sadly for her, being in a film with Mr. Depp did not help her. He is so much more talented than anyone else, that he dominates the action and makes the rest of the characters look like, 'also featuring' extras. Julianne Moore has the worst lines ever and I did feel for her but Johnny Depp's 'Sam' is so much more interesting, that you hardly pay attention. There are also many actors in smaller roles, who will go on to greater things. Oliver Platt, William H. Macy, Danny Hedaya and Aidan Quinn, as Benny, barely manages, once again over-shadowed by our boy Johnny. Yes, I am an intense Johnny Depp fan but he has made a lot of terrible movies. This one is great. There are a few scenes that parents might not care for their young children to see but the PG rating is just fine. Buy it today!
