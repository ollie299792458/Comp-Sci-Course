This is one of those movies which puts you exactly in the events, and feel and witness the same events and plights of the movies "hero".

Eriksson is a US soldier, who like all soldiers in vietnam it seems just wants to get home with all his god-given limbs and bits and bobs in place, but unfortunately for our hero, fate isnt so kind to him just yet.

His 5 man patrol ends up kidnapping a vietnamese girl from her village in the dead of night, and the first horror were treated to is a heart broken mother watching her screaming daughter being carried off.

Over the course of the movie the 4 other members of the patrol, lead by a possibly psychopathic soldier played by sean penn, rape and abuse the young vietnamese woman, while PFC Eriksson watches on helplessly....desperate to help, but scared of his squadmates turning on him in the vietnamese jungle.

One of Eriksson's squadmates initially has the same concerns of raping the young woman, but after bullying and peer pressure by his squadmates, he gives in and "takes his turn", therefor becomming one of the bad guys and leaving Fox's character alone with his desperation to stop these crimes, it seems throughout the movie the urge to stand up for the young woman is always just beneath the surface, but knowing full well the dangerous situation of being trapped in the jungle with enemy's on all sides, including his squad-mates should he push them too far, he is stuck with his desperation to help, always just below the surface, but never quite strong enough to do somethnig at his own risk.

To sum it up it ends with the horrible murder of the young woman....what i personally considor one of the msot powerful scenes of the movie, after being stabbed twice by a trigger-kill happy member of the squad, and probably the Sarge's closest ally in the movie, the vietnamese woman pulls herself to her feet, ill, emotionally broken down, abused, and now bleeding from stab wounds, she seems to stagger along slowly, in a zombie state, as the American unit around her engage a vietnamese enemy in the valley below, alerted by Eriksson to stop the initial murder of the girl.

Penn stares in disbelief as she staggers past him, at this point penn's character gave me a bit of hope that his disbelief would allow her to just walk away...but not to be, he calls for his men, and shouts to them she's getting away...not that this matters now and if someone had any snippet of human decency left they would allow her to go, in the final act of creulty and inhumanity, Penn's character rifle-butts Erikssons head, leaving him grounded and slipping into unconciousness, they turn on the girl, and shoot her.

Throughout the movie i often expected something to happen, unfortunately this movie acheived its aim, these were based on a real event and in the realities of American wars there is never a saviour to save the abused civillians from some soldiers who have no moral fibre.

One scene i expected her to be saved was near to her death, Eriksson was helping her escape to safety when one of his squad-mates returns and asks what he's doing...he pauses, and then claims "nothing" thus foiling his escape attempt, normally, the hero in this scene would shoot the squad-mate and make good his escape, but this movie doesnt play around with war-movie feel goods, and gives no releif to the viewer from the emotion and torment of the girls suffering....ultimately her fate is sealed.

The movie finishes up its last scenes portraying Erikksons character trying to get justice for the girl, while his immediate superiors dont care, and his former squad-mates from the patrol try and kill him....eventually, with the help of an army chaplin, he gains justice for the girl, the men of the guilty unit are sent to a court-marshall and sent to prison....its finally over....or is it?.

The movie finishes with Erikssons character bringing a scarf from a bus left behind by a strangely familiar looking asian woman.

She seems to relise he has had a bad dream, and then states "its over now", the movie finishes with a scene over a lush green and sunny american park, the asian woman walking away into the distance.

The ending didnt seem to fit for me personally, it wasnt the end, the girl was still dead and the memories still in erikssons mind, i thought the ending was cheap, and cheapened the entire movie, the movie went to great length to make you, the veiwer feel the same plight as erisksson and desperation to help the vietnamese girl, who ultimately died, yet the ending trie's to convey a sense of "everything is hunky-dorey again" when it isnt...the girl is still dead, though she got some form of justice, and eriksson still carries the memories of those horrible events, it seemed the movie could have done with the type of ending that other war movies have had, in which...yes the war is over...but the memories and pain of the soldiers isnt.

All in all a good movie, it touched me so much i could still see that girls face when i closed my eyes to sleep, suffice to say i dont envy the veterans who have had to carry such burden of memory, the movie allows common joe, those of us not there, to feel what eriksson felt, and to come to the same conclusions...that if we cannot maintain our principles and humanity in war, then we are no better then the enemies we fight.

Suffice to say, dont watch if you want an all american feel good war movie, even for a vietnam movie this is a deep and touching one that portrays the realities of war rather then the all american hooha feel goods.

I ask myself the same questions eriksson's character asks himself...is it really all over?...im just a viewer and even i find it hard to forget the movie, its meant to imprint itself on you and effect you, and it does.
