I saw this film in a cinema and was struck by several things. The first was the paucity of material on which it was based. Sure, the bank giving out guns in it's main lobby was a setup, but so what? The insanity of an organisation (that robs people blind in the first place) giving out guns full stop was given dramatic license, and I thought well done.  It was a dramatic trick of presentation, but the essential message was the point. These folks are just shooting the messenger, and they look soooo cheap doing it.
  There were a few other things, bits of fluff really, but in the main the most interesting thing was, of all things, the musical score. Sitting there in the cinema it seemed to me the music was out of all proportion to what the filmmakers were actually saying. Listen to it sometime without being distracted by the fluffy content. It's very creepy, ALL through the film. It says: 'this man is not to be trusted. Do not trust him. He has lied to you, he is an illusionist', or sentiments to that effect. In other words, the music is out of proportion to what's being said, which is not much, and certainly not worth the film used to say it. It's like a Trojan horse: the feeling from the music is totally out of proportion to the facts articulated. It tries to turn the viewer against him, but doesn't present a compelling enough reason why -I hope you're getting the point at this stage! So one has to wonder where these fools got the money to make it. Ever hear of Cointelpro? Look it up. And I'll leave this review at that.
