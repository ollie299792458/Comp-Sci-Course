*** 1/2 stars rating for "Beetlejuice". This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: "Batman".

 "Beetlejuice" is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.

 There are several memorable scenes in "Beetlejuice", among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song", another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.

 "Beetlejuice" is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.
