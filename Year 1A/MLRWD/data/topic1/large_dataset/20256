I first picked up a copy to rent. I was first introduced to this movie; only through seeing it on the shelf in the drama section. I have: My Own Private Idaho (Collector's Edition), and have seen other movies in this "genre". Basically it was a natural for me to see this movie. I find the fact that they focus more on being ambiguous with the sexuality aspect...kind of refreshing. I did watch this movie w/ an assumption of how it would end up; however, it was a curve ball. Then again that's what you want a movie to do. You actually want twists and turns. The intelligence of "Howie" is believable, and his acting was very good w/ such a complex character he had to play considering his age. I agree w/ the director when he says that (in the director's commentary); eventhough, this kid was the 8th to come in, and he had hundreds more to see, that he knew immediately; that he should play the character of "Howie". I will have to make sure I watch the original NC-17 version as well. The ending of this movie is a powerful lesson. I appreciate "pushing the envelope" in a movie. This a very good movie. I'm not just saying that, because I used to live in Long Island when I was

little. (SMILE)
