I first viewed this movie when I was a small child and thought it was a  wonderful film. I dreamed of having just such an aunt as Mame Dennis. So  after watching it again recently through adult eyes, I've come to the  conclusion that this seriously dated film is highly overrated. 
The cast  is really an excellent one and each is a fine actor in their own right but  in this version of this much beloved story, they all seem to be in  competition to see who can eat the most scenery. The acting style is highly  stylized and overbearing with Rosalind Russell leading the way. Her attempt  at portraying a warmhearted, wacky character is pretty much counteracted by  her phony aristocratic accent and the very snobbish treatment of other  characters in the film. The child Actor who portrays Patrick Dennis is an  incessant whiner; I really wanted Mame to spank his rear after listening to  him drone on and on for most of the film.
I felt the blackouts used to  convey the passage of time really got old after the fourth or fifth time,  and they succeed in giving the movie a kind of eerie feel. I realize that  Mame is loved by many but for me, the second time around, I found it to be  a major disappointment. 
I personally find the musical version with  Lucille Ball a much more enjoyable film. The acting isn't quite so  over-the-top, the sets and costumes are a far more accurate depiction of  the period, and even though Lucy's singing voice was gravelly, it is  exactly the kind of voice I would expect from a woman like Mame.
