First of all I'm still emotional from the final portion of the show, but I won't spoil it. I will tell you that this is the most amazing series of Robin Hood. I have never seen one I liked for every instant, no movie ever made of Robin Hood including Disney's version of it with the fox. Ever moved me half as much, ever inspired me to sit up till late into the night for one more episode.

They never tore at me and made me cry half as much as this one did, nor did they in turn make me laugh half as much as this show. The show is not a flat series at all, there is such depth in every character, not one of them is flat and boring, and I appreciated that so much.

This series is well worth buying, and something I promise you will NEVER forget, and never regret.
I don't care if you are a 'stay by the book Hood fan' or someone who wants historical accuracy blah blah. Whatever, you....will love this show no matter what, watch it, give Robin and his merry men and women a chance to enter your all time favorite memories from a show that deserves high status.

To Robin Hood!

We Are ROBING HOOD!

As long as injustice reigns, we will fight it with every fiber of our being"

So anyways some of the things mighta been said me rewording some of it. Whatever its a great series and I have deep DEEP respect for the people who made this, the actors put their hearts and souls into this piece.

Brava and Bravo.
