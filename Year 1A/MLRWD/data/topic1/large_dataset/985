This is a decent film but its not Planet of the Apes, it doesn't equal nor surpass the original, it is its own story and piece of work and Burton should have marketed it as such.  Visually the film is stunning though I found some of the apes to look more fake than the original.  The storyline is devoid of any philosophical framework which we cannot say for the original.  Burton paints the apes as practically evil and devoid of humanity save one or two characters. In the original you could actually identify with the master ape race as they were 'practically human' or rather they behaved and reasoned like humans, which is how the first film began the dialectic of what it means to be human or have humanity.  Burton's film does none of this and almost seems to try and avoid it all together. Where this film really fails is in the story arc, it fails to explain itself.  Whalberg's character doesn't seem to know he has passed through time and he goes back in time to see the 20th century ruled by apes which hints to a parallel universes more than time travel however it never makes this quite clear.
