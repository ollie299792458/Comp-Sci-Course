The interviews are candid.  The music is priceless.  The band is U2 before they were the megaband they are today.

The video is good quality, well edited and the sound mixing is done well, especially considering the fact that music is intertwined with voice throughout.

The albums covered on this are, of course, the resulting "Rattle and Hum", "The Joshua Tree", and all of their previous work.

You can see what existed in Bono, the humanitarian, before he was nominated for a Nobel Prize for his work in charity and relief work around the world.

The video shows the 4 guys, Bono (aka Paul Hewson), the Edge (aka Dave Evans), Adam Clayton and Larry Mullin Jr. being four guys from Ireland on a tour of the U.S.  The coolest thing about this video is how it shows U2's discovery of American music; specifically the blues and jazz.

Best song on the video is by far "When love comes to town" with THE B.B. King.

The entire video is fantastic and I have watched it literally hundreds of times.
