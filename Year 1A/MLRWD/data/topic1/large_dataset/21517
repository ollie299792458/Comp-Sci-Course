Director Fritz Lang was one of the truly great artists of World Cinema. While he created a number of excellent films after coming to this country when the Nazis took power in his native Germany (especially film noir, SCARLET STREET, WOMAN IN THE WINDOW and THE BIG HEAT are prime examples), it was the epic that he was best known for in the Twenties. Specifically METROPOLIS, the first great science fiction film, and DIE NIBELUNGEN, an ambitious two-part sword and sorcery saga. Hero Siegfried slays the dragon and bathes in its blood, thereby rendering him invulnerable, except for a spot where a leaf has fallen on his back, behind a shoulder. Warrior Hagen learns of this, and uses his knowledge to exact the fatal deed. But little does he realize that his act will set in motion events that result in a terrible toll for all involved. Viewers more accustomed to CGI and more modern depictions of fantasy may have a hard time with this, but for the seasoned cinephile with an appreciation for classic black and white cinema Kino's release is a feast.
