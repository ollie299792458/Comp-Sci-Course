Simply put, the film was really good.  Reminiscent of 28 Days later, and nearly all the Romero flicks with some Steven King thrown in (though as one reviewer put it, "this is no zombie fest"). I consider it more comparable to the remake of Dawn of the Dead in how it intentionally seeks to connect to the viewer through "Middle American" imagery and settings to the mayhem that can unfold.

Of course, the film is very violent though not really in a gratuitous manner.  In a way, it seems as if the classic horror flicks of the 50's heavily influenced the film making.  I found the acting good to really good.  While the film was predictable (almost unavoidably), it was interesting nevertheless.  Of course it involves a government conspiracy, military experiment gone wrong, bad decisions, a side-kick, etc..

If you liked 28 days later and/or Dawn of the Dead (remake), you will surely like this movie.  If you like horror movies such as Hostel (too violent/gory for me), you may not like the movie as much.
