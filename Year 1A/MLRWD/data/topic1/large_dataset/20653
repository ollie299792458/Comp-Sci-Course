When I was given this movie I did not know what to expect. As a fairly young guy I had never even heard of Errol Flynn let alone had any desire to watch the film itself.

As soon as I started watching though I instantly was drawn into the movie. Errol plays Gentlemen Jim Corbett, a fighter who turned boxing from its roots of brutish fights into an art. You watch as he grows in his career until the match with John L. Sullivan the toughest competition around.

The movie was exciting to watch and Errol's character's charm is easily seen on the screen. The only piece of the movie that really hurts it is the fact that many members of the audience today will not adapt well with the movie. While very fun to watch it doesn't have the flair of movies today. What's worse is it also seems to lack any form of real plot twist --- while it's fun to watch Errol win fights you never really see anything that makes you feel like he'll have trouble outside of his fight with John L.

Either way, the movie is a gem and while most people will not enjoy it today if you're into fun exciting movies and can put up with some inability to adapt to the times then this is the sort of movie for you.
