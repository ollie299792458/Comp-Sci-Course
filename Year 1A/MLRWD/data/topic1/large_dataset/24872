This movie is almost, but not quite, bad enough to be good.  The Beast of Yucca Flats is easily more inept than anything Ed Wood ever did (and, appropriately, one of the stars of Yucca Flats is Tor Johnson, who is better known as one of the monsters in Wood's legendary Plan 9 From Outer Space).  But even though the movie is less than an hour long, it's staggeringly boring for most of that time, with only a few enjoyably awful things to keep the attention of the bad movie fan.  One is that no microphones were used to make the movie -- all the soundtrack is done by voice-over, even the dialogue.  Francis narrates the movie in a grim, ponderous monotone, repeatedly making random comments involving the word "progress".  The most hilarious of these comes when two young boys "not yet caught in the whirlwind of progress, feed soda pop to [some] thirsty pigs" (I am not making this up).  Francis also has a fascination with parachuting (a subject he explored in his next film, "The Skydivers"), despite the fact that it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  Another fun touch is that because of the lack of microphones, whenever characters do speak to one another the camera studiously avoids looking at their faces.  But in general, this movie is a waste of time for anyone who isn't a very hard-core bad movie fan.  You have been warned.
