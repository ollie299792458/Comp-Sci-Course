This is not on a par with any of the countless other VeggieTales films of the last decade or so, quite possibly because this represents a corporate takeover of the formerly independent Big Idea. Not only does the central story lack the strong Christian foundation of ALL their other videos, but worse still they have invented a compromise by inserting a *very* religious mini-segment on St. Patrick. (Odd, because the DVD came out months before St. Pat's day) The problem is, this "religious" segment was clearly not written by Christians. It feels like the theological waffle of armchair Catholicism with only the vaguest sense of sound doctrine. I was appalled that a film from a series widely marketed to "Christians" would seek to enforce such uniquely Roman Catholic doctrines (not held by a vast number of Christians) as the separation of persons in the Roman "Trinity" concept and the posthumous elevatuion of mortals to Sainthood by Church authority. Not only are these doctrines which are *guaranteed* to cause division among adult viewers (how many *parents* have seen these films a dozen times each?) they are also so far above the understanding of the pre-school audiences the series targets that it is incomprehensible such things were included. Add to that a ridiculous polemic against Paganism (not offensive to me, but hugely inaccurate) and a main storyline which positively promotes fighting as a good thing, and you have something utterly unfit for Christians OR children. If I want my kid to see positive portrayals of fighting, I can put on a road runner cartoon. At least I know Wile E. Coyote is not going to try and indoctrinate her into Papal Theology, and make a mockery of God and the Bible in the process.
