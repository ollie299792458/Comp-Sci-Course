Stanley Kubrick, the mastermind behind many landmark films of the last half-century, and the director who can't seem to make up his mind on what kind of movie to direct, is honored in great fashion with this awesome set of movies. Included are the six following packages:

-2 disc 2001: A Space Odyssey
-2 disc A Clockwork Orange
-2 disc The Shining
-Full Metal Jacket
-2 disc Eyes Wide Shut
-Kubrick Documentary

This is a great set of movies, but there are some odd things about the set itself. Firstly, The Shining package doesn't fit in with the other four. The cover features the famous picture of Nicholson's face as opposed to a small picture in a field of black, which is what's featured on the others. Also on the Shining spine, the font is different from the rest, and also Kubrick's name is in red as opposed to white. I don't understand why the Shining is an oddball in the bunch, but it's only an aesthetic difference. Another interesting thing is the fact that Full Metal Jacket is not a two-disc set, as the other movies are all 2-disc sets. It would be nice to see that second disc with some more special features. Finally, while there are five great movies in this package, I can't help but feel a gaping hole in the box where Dr Strangelove should be. I believe this to be Kubrick's best film, so the lack of inclusion strikes me as bizarre. But what am I going to do. If I find a box-set with five great movies for 50 bucks (at BJs) from one of my favorite directors, I'm going to snatch it up. This is probably my second favorite box-set of all, next to the artful 12 disc Lord of the Rings set. Definitely worth a purchase.
