Watched every episode multiple times and must admit some of the episodes were great entertainment while others fell on their face.  A couple of problems throughout the series were  the constant inclusion of angst generated by the two love interests  (especially the first 10 or so episodes of season 3 although the later episodes salvaged the season), which got a little boring, and the lack of continuity in story lines. Although some individuals blame the lack of creative thinking by the tv audience with the  dissatisfaction with the conclusion of the final episode it is really a weakness in the creativity of it's creators.  In the end the fact that Chuck has the intersect in his head seems to be no big deal.  Based on previous seasons there is no shortage  of villans seeking the intersect and since Chuck is alone his eventual demise would be unavoidable.  Sarah's lack of enthusiasm during the last kiss on the beach indicates she will be running around possibly bedding other spys or people of interest inspite of her marriage to Chuck.  They did not mention divorce leaving everyone hoping they would eventually get back together.  Sarah is given a copy of her reports to the CIA to stimulate her memory, of course had she given those reports to the CIA she would have been reassign as they would not tolerate a loving relationship(per several other episodes).  You also have to wonder how Sarah was manipulated to forget her relationship with Chuck when the villain did not have a copy of the intersect.  I could go through several weaknesses in every season however let me just say that as a result of my lack of enthusiasm for the finale I give away my complete Chuck collection of all episodes.  Knowing the disasterous conclusion ruined the enjoyment of repeated viewing.  I will stick with viewing episodes of "The Closer", a vasttly superior viewing experience.
