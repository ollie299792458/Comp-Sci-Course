There is more story than action in this one, but it serves as a mediocore trek film.  The picture is great, especially space scenes.  The Sound is ok, a smidge over video but could be sharper.  I was hoping for more special features, but Im assuming once each film is individually released, they will make a special edition boxed set with features included.  However this is still a great film to own...just wait for the box set to come out.  This is the first film featuring the Next Generation crew.  It starts out with Captain James T. Kirk, Lt,Commander Pavel Chekov, and Commander Montgomery Scott helping to Send welcome a new crew aboard their starship the USS ENTERPRISE.  They head out for a quick trip around the block when a distress call leads them into battle with an energy ribbon travling trough space.  The ribbon cripples their ship, and they suffer minor casulties.  70 years later the next generation crew takes over the mighty enterprise.  Only this time a madman played by Malcolm Mcdowell, plans to change the course of the energy ribbon.  However his plans will send the ribbon right into a planet that if destroyed would alter other systems as well.  Rather than let this happen, When Captain Picard learns of this, his team races to stop him, only the Klingons are on their way to stop the Enterprise, dead in her tracks....... Though not too action packed its a good one for all TREK fans.
