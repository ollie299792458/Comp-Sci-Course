This is your typical 90s action film that doesn't hold back.  To say the least the film doesn't leave you wanting any more action and at well over two hours it's a good thing that it has such a penchant for the genre.  Chase scenes, guns blazing, explosions, Travolta, Cage, what's not to like?  In the very opening credits we are greeted with a sinister deed dealt out by the lunatic anarchist Castor Troy to our hero of the film: Sean Archer.  What follows is a heart-racing, action-packed film of revenge and, more importantly, duality.  Can we comment for a moment on the 'Troy' 'Archer' reference.  Achilles was taken out by an arrow to his one weak spot, his heel, in the siege of Troy in Homer's grand epic work.  It seems that the duality and the interwoven lives of Archer and Troy do not just lurk beneath the surface, but in plain sight as well.

In a sense Archer must become Troy in order to save the day and what results is a spell-binding story that has you overlooking the sometimes overly dramatic scenes that can set even the  most die-hard romantic to vomiting.  That is my one complaint about the film: it is often too dramatic.  Otherwise we are greeted with a superb control of the underlying difficulties facing the characters of this thrilling movie.  Once their roles are switched their true nature comes to the forefront of who and what they stand for and how they view each other's lives.

Stunning camera work, use of dialogue, and suspenseful drama make up the core of this intense film and give us over two hours of excitement that are hard to forget.
