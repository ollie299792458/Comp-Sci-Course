Now Bette. Even today, decades after her death, Davis' contribution to cinema can never be over-looked. Hers (and Garbo's) are the names one mentions first when great acting is discussed. The 30's and early 40's are Bette Davis' golden era. Her method of acting is of the highest order that even today, with the exception of Meryl Streep, her performances are considered the best ever captured on screen. The intensity of her acting could burn her at the stake.

  This film always makes it to the top films of the century. It is Davis' film all the way, from the moment she made her grand entrance shooting Newell ,down to her  pulsating eyes revealing  pent-up frustration and anger as a lover who was burned. Davis' performance is simply superb, a must-see for those who want to analyse the craft of professional acting. Davis is the consummate actress.

  Even her English accent is flawless (something she has mastered/mustered on "On Human Bondage"). This film is almost 70 years old but doesn't date a bit. It is marvelously directed with a breathneck pace, but ultimately satisfying.

  Key scenes for Davis fans and non-fans alike; Lesley fainting when the letter was read to her by her lawyer, dropping to her knees to the Eurasian widow ...and lastly, her immortal lines she uttered to her husband: "with all my heart I still love the man I killed!." Clearly,this film was flawlessly performed by an actress not contented with just two Oscars. Smoulderingly perfect.
