I vividly remember going to see this movie for the first time in theaters. My mom and dad took me when I was 7 (now 24) and i loved it. I has everything a good movie could ask for. It is my favorite kids movie of all time, but even as an adult I enjoy it beyond the sentimental value. Some may complain that it's not truly a kids movie because there is some cussing (I have news for you parents, your kids cuss) and Squint Paladoris playing it smooth with Wendy Peffercorn, my darling lover girl. All in all this movie is awesome. It's about baseball. It's about a giant dog. It has Darth Vader in it. It's about a guy with no business getting with the hottest girl on the market taking matters into his own hands. It's got fat gingers named Ham calling his shots then having a chew at 9 year old. This movie is everything good about America, and to not like it, would be un-American. For parents the message in this movie is clear: confidence defeats being a wuss, never mess with the Beast, and if you sit in your room and feel sorry for yourself, you will never get the be in U-571.

BAM.
