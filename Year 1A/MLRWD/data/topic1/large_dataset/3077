I saw Sade in St. Louis, Missouri and I was in the second row center. I was transported to a whole new world and it was the best concert that I have ever seen IN MY LIFE!. I was so impressed that I followed her to Louisville, KY two weeks later!! Sade is a true performer and she gave her audience an experience to remember! The band was beyond belief! The performances sounded better than the recordings and when she sang Love is Stronger Than Pride, I went insane! Sade is one of those rare performers that can get the audience up and dancing one minute and then transfix them when she sings such heartbreaking songs such as PEARLS. I hate that Sade only tours once every decade but it is worth the wait!!! I will follow her to the moon for her next performance and I hope and pray that she will tour again! Until then, I will watch this Blu-Ray until it wears out and when it does, I will buy another one!
SADE RULES THE WORLD OF MUSIC! She is like an oasis in a desert of pop-friendly but utterly talentless drivel.
