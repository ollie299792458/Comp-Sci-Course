The movie begins with a thud...and only gets worse.  
Rosina da Silva (Minnie Driver) is about to be married off to a man that she doesn't love when her beloved father dies and leaves the family without much money.  A good Jane Austen setup, right?  It only goes downhill from here.
Rosina thereafter seeks a position with a wealthy English family, the Cavendishes.  However, to do so she must hide the fact that she is Jewish (this is the late 1800s, and prejudice against Jews is rampant).  She therefore changes her name to Mary Blackchurch and goes to live with the Cavendishes as the governess to their daughter Clementina.
Rosina continues to practice some Jewish rituals (we see her, for instance, saying the blessing over a candle on Shabbat and trying to have her own Passover seder), and it's just a matter of time until she's found out--which, predictably enough, she is, by Cavendish son Henry, who has fallen in love with her.
But that's not enough plot, so director Sandra Goldbacher has Rosina fall in love with Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson of "The Full MOnty"), who is attempting to become a pioneer in the new field of photography.  Rosina begins to help Mr. Cavendish with his project, and the two begin an affair despite the fact that there is absolutely NO chemistry between them.
The best moments in the movie involve little-seen characters Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet Walter, the evil sister-in-law Fanny in "Sense and Sensibility").  Driver is woefully miscast, mispronouncing Hebrew words every time she tries to do so and striking no sparks with Wilkinson.  The scene at the end where Mr. Cavendish breaks off their affair (trust me, I'm not spoiling anything here) is downright embarrassing as Driver wails and clings.
A movie that fails to live up to its Jane Austen-esque promise....
