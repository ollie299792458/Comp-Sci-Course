ABWH released thier self-titled cd in 1989, and to go on tour put together a mix of cd tracks along with Yes classics.

They chose to intro the show with their solo sets, leaving the group performances uninterrupted.

Anderson sang a medley of Yes hits, Howe performed "Clap" and "Mood For A Day" on acoustic guitars, Wakeman mixed a small medley of his catalog, including bits from "Madrigal", and as the whole group took the stage for "Long Distance Runaround", Bruford went crazy on his electronic drums.

The ABWH material is highlighted by "Birthright" "Themes" "Brother of Mine" "The Meeting" and a rousing version of "Order Of The Universe"

The YES Material is highlighted by what to me are definitive versions of "Heart Of The Sunrise", "Roundabout", "And You And I", an extended jam of "(I've Seen)All Good People", and an excellent "Starship Trooper".

The show's defining moment, however, is what may be the single greatest live performance of a YES song...

"Close To The Edge" defies description from the opening salvo fired by Howe on his Gibson 345, through the syncopations of Bruford, fill in bassist Jeff Berlin covering Chris Squire's bass runs note for note, Anderson's soaring vocals, and Wakeman's remarkable keyboard solo, this performance makes time stand still...

The audio is not mixed properly, just as it wasn't the night of the original pay-per-view broadcast, and except for CTTE, Steve's guitar is all but missing.

There is a cd version of this in existence, and if you can find it, get to suppliment the DVD.

The performances still are phenominal, and rate 4 stars, just subtract one for the audio or it would be a 5.

Great stuff, though...
