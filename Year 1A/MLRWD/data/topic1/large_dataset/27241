This is very strange to me but...
The book on which this film is based is my all time favorite...The movie pales in comparison but I still love it!
The film is certainly more fiction than fact...There were 4 trials...the movie lumps them together in one, the Cusack character is pure fiction and (without giving away the ending)this is not how one of the main characters ended  in real life but Savannah is as stunning on film as it is in life! As for Kevin Spacey, well, he is brilliant as usual and Jack Thompson and Dorothy Loudon head a supporting cast that also included Jude Law that is just great. Now for the Lady Chablis. As a gay man I have always found drag and female impersonators just too much too take but THE LADY is just great playing of all people, HERSELF! Due to the lengthy time frame of the actual events and a host of eccentric real life people I think the book should have been made into a mini series but certainly on a cable channel so nothing would have to be edited...
