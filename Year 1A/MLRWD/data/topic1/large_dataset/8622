First of all, I think that this is in itself a good film. I applaud Brian Singer for the serious, respectful tone. (RE: X-Men 1 & 2) Really, this is the most serious Superman film to date. The thing, I think, and the reason that this was not a totally huge hit, and that WB is rebooting the franchise, is that this did not capture the hopeful, uplifting rush that we generally expect from Superman. The story and the visual look are both kind of muted and thoughtful, which is not a bad thing taken alone, but it is a little short on the "primary colors" that put stars in your eyes and a smile on your face.

I would like to have seen more from Brandon Routh, certainly more dialogue. I don't have a problem with him. However, both he and Kate Bosworth seem young for the roles when you consider this film as a "sequel" to the first two Christopher Reeve films. Kevin Spacey is a good actor, yes, but I just don't see him as Lex Luthor. Also, the plot is very similar to Superman I.

I think that Superman Returns coulda/shoulda taken a cue from Smallville, which for its occasional silliness *really* captures the essence of what makes Superman great, in addition to updating the cultural aesthetic to present day. Superman Returns seems to be paying homage, visually, to early incarnations (architecture, costumes, etc.) which, again, is classy but the nostalgia can be unnecessarily limiting. Summary: this is a good film, totally worth checking out, but not as great as it could have been. I have not yet gone through the special features, which look to be good.
