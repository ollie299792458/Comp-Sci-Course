Very good acting!  These actors are convincing in their roles and dialog.  I once saw this movie on TV and had to hunt it down to purchase a copy of part one, then I saw part two from this double disc.  Part one, sure it's probably not exactly the most original movie ever but it's a movie that you don't want to stop watching once you're sitting through it.  But that only counts if you're interested in the classic vampire horror themes.  It's probably not the best movie in the world, but the characters seem like they believe in themselves and what they're saying, completely unlike the cliches of today that already know that everything they're remaking isn't worth trying.  The whole tone of this movie is creepy.  I wont even spoil the storyline.  There's probably not much to the storyline anyhow, basically a vampire count who was transported to America and you can guess what his motives are.  Part two isn't as good but it's not horrible.  I could tell you a whole lot more about it but it's not like this is some total waste of money.  Add it to your collection if you're not familiar with these two films.
