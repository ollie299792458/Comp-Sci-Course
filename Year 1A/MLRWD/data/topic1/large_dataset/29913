Wide screen movies (for that matter, widescreen TV) owe their existence to Cinerama, an odd format that premiered in 1952. The high def film process required three cameras for filming and three projectors for exhibition on a deeply curved screen. It was a cumbersome, unwieldy method of moviemaking more appropriate for travelogues in the 1950s. Hollywood struggled with the process when they made two narrative films using the system. HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the better of the two. For years it was poorly served when shown on conventional television. The standard 4x3 aspect ratio and diminished resolution couldn't begin to showcase the power of a movie that once sparkled on 96 foot screens with surround sound and gut-wrenching visuals. Along comes BluRay technology with its superior resolution and sound reproduction, and Cinerama finally gets a chance to demonstrate why it was so revolutionary in post World War 2 moviemaking. This version of the movie has a second disc that offers a new letterbox version called Smilebox. The film is presented in the same curvature that moviegoers experienced in the early 1960s, when they were engulfed by the enormous curved screen. New computer technology is put to even better use with the virtual elimination of the once-visible lines that separated the three panels. If you are a widescreen buff, a film historian, or just someone who appreciates the kind of daunting challenges that brought out the best in Hollywood's craftsmen, I strongly urge you to check out this spectacular BluRay.
