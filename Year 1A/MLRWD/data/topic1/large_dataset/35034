This movie caught our eye when it was in the theater.  The list of actors is very impressive.  These are actors who can each make a movie, and there are a lot of them.  The idea of the movie, retired people coming back to work their jobs, is alluring to the baby boomers who are retiring in droves.  And lots of guns and action is what movies are so very good at. Somehow, we never did end up seeing the movie in the theater, in part due to some lukewarm reviews.  Well, those reviews were wrong.
  The movie starts with Bruce Willis talking on the phone about his Social Security check to a young woman at SS.  All of a sudden he is facing assassins.  And it goes on from there.  He recruits his old co-workers to help him.  In the process of dealing with high tech bad guys trying to kill him, a great time is had by all.  There's lots of shooting the bad guys, but somehow, we don't think about that.  This is not a transcendental film, just a great good time.  There is lots of comedy and action.  Get this DVD, play it on the biggest screen you have, and bring on the popcorn.
