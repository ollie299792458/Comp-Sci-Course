K, well this review will probably be a little bias since I have been a Prince fan since about 1982.  IMHO he is one of the most talented musicians, writers, performers, producers, and overall musical talents that have ever lived.  He's not everyone's cup of tea, but he is what he is.

Now, for the video.  The movie is what it is.  The value in this package is the additional material.  There is old MTV material (when MTV was actually worth watching and played videos), there is commentary from The Revolution members and you can see and hear what they are like now. I think my favorite addition to this set is the piece on First Avenue & Seventh Street Entry.  It goes into the club itself, its history, the different acts that made it big out of there, and what it is doing now.  It's neat to see how much truth and reality was put into Purple Rain itself.

I'd highly recommend this set to any Prince fan.  It's a blast from the past and you can live that awesome time all over again!
