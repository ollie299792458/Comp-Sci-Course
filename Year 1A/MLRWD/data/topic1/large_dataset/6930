I just rented and watched this movie and also before hand read most of the reviews here. For those of you reading these reviews and wondering if its a good movie to watch please continue to read. Almost every negative review I read seems to have come from someone with a political view of this movie, which almost did have the intended effect of making me pass this film up. What I want to say is don't let these people try and stop you from seeing a good Matt Damon movie. This movie (with all political views set aside) was a good action, suspense, and intrigue movie plain and simple. Even the claims of horrific rocky, headache producing, camera shooting (which also seems to suspiciously come from those same reviews with political motivation) were mainly false. Yes, the camera did move about some but nowhere near as much as some reviews would have you to believe, and personally I didn't even notice it with all the good action going on. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT INSULT OUR SOLDIERS OR THE GOOD WORK THEY DO WORLD WIDE IN ANY WAY I COULD SEE!

For those of you who feel compelled to blather your political views on us all in the form of a simple movie review please don't bother. I think most of us here just want to see a good movie and "Green Zone" was a good action flcik.
