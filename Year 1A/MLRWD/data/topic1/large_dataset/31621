Recipe for "Lost Children:" 1-Take generous helpings of Oliver Twist and Dune and mix well. 2-Stir in some Twelve Monkeys and add a dash of Frankenstein. 3-Lace sparingly with The Matrix, and garnish with a little Freaks.
If you enjoy the work of Lynch, Gilliam etc, and indeed other Jeunet & Caro offerings, this wonderful film will also be for you. 
At first, the experience is confusing and nightmarish, but so compelling. (After a second viewing I was in love!) You feel much better about the film when the pieces start to fit together, and then you can really get into all the positive, optimistic aspects of the story. The tender, heart warming friendship between the streetwise young orphan "Miette" and the gentle giant "One" is just delightful. All the characters are unusual and interesting, but the evil "Krank" is wickedly entertaining.
Angelo Badalamenti's score is hauntingly beautiful, and perfectly suited to this film. In view of his collaboration with David Lynch who also makes films that are dark but full of beauty, he was the only choice for this production.
The DVD package is pretty good with lots of extras.  The two most enjoyable and impressive features are the commentary, and the language selection, which has the options of French, English and Spanish soundtracks and subtitles.  The default setting is the film as it was originally intended: unsubtitled in French.  If you do not speak French I strongly recommend that you switch on the subtitles.  If you go for the dubbed version a lot of the magic will be lost.
