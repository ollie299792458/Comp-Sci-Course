A cheap, sensationalized interpretation of Hitler and his axis of evil, which proves to be one dimensional in every respect. There is little here that has anything to do with history and documented facts. In fact, for kids these days, they might think the character of Hitler a bit of a joke, like one of the "bad guys" in all these action films - he's just not believable, a cartoon character of the evil Hitler he really was.  Unfortunately, young modern audiences will not appreciate through this film the "banality of evil" that Hitler represents, and which surrounds them every day.  The warning to beware such men and their evil is lost in the melodramatics of the performances.  Much conjecture is utilized to fill in rather sparse historical facts relating to earlier periods of Hitler's life.  That being said, Carlyle's over-the-top rendition of Hitler is quite entertaining if you ignore who he is mean't to be, and the historical inacurracies. If you like Carlyle, buy it to see his performance.  If you want history, I recommend "Hitler's last ten days", with Alec Guiness masterfully playing the role of the Fuhrer as no other could or ever will again.
