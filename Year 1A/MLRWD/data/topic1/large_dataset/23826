This movie is similar to A Long Way From Home.
It's incredible what some people are willing to do in looking for happiness--(the thing that we've got when we were a child,we've lost it or forgotten)then we have to make a hugh round trip to get it back.Some who failed lead themselves into drugs.Some earn money by selling it.Death kills them all.The Big Fish is not caught.What a pity.
(If you really do love animals,don't buy a furcoat.Then there shall be no more extermination of minks,foxes,etc)
If you want to change the world,you have to change yourself.Execution is never a wise solution.It renders the world more unhappy.
In Switzerland,people have voice and voted for life,not death.it's easy when it's not your child.It's a country of Free churches--Free nation.We protected even our animals,we don't shoot stray dogs.We don't hang around people.We jail the defendants for few years even if he committed murder.We'd send him back to his hometown after serving jail.
In some countries, prisoners are tortured.Maybe they even beat their wives and children so to them,you are nothing.It's not necessary to act sadish.In Switzerland,we can't even beat our pets.This IS the real paradise and civilization.
Buy this movie and enjoy bamboo beatings!!
