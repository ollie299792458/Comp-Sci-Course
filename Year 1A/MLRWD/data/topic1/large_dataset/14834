A British institution (shown there on TV almost every Christmas) this is a movie not to be taken seriously but with a pinch of salt. If you don't understand that statement then forget it! Be aware - especially if you have seen the remake first - that this is a comedy first and foremost with some classic chase scenes. Some reviewers complain that it is dated, well that because it is - get over it this and enjoy a 60's romp with Michael Caine in full Alfie mode. This is not a film for those looking for social messages, deep meaning or plot cohesion, but one for those appreciative of British humor, ingenious car chases and who do not get hung up over the (nowadays) politically incorrect cultural stereotypes. There are some great lines ("the only way to get through it is, we all work together as a team - and that means you do everything I say" ) and the special features are worthwhile checking out. Could be considered more of a lads' movie but goes down great with kids too. Get your skates on mate, grab a beer, sit back and enjoy.
