Finally a movie that respects the process of adapting a successful graphic novel ('The Ultimates') to the big screen.  Not only did the producers respect the incredible original designs of Bryan Hitch and the storyline by Mark Millar but they chose to animate this movie in classic 2D hand drawn animation with such a flair that CGI lovers will do a double take.  This movie is quite an achievement as not only is it Marvel's entree into feature length animation but it aims to please fan boys and general audiences alike...and it does so successfully.  Fan boys will appreciate the homage's throughout while all will love this action packed, well paced debut piece and it is destined to be a classic as it is just the beginning of Marvel's commitment to this new genre.  The choice of using working actors and not 'stars' to voice the characters is a winner as the true stars of this movie are the classic marquee characters Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Giant Man, Black Widow, Wasp and the Incredible Hulk.  This non-stop, smart, fun ride is the first time the Avengers appear together in a movie and they don't disappoint.  This is no extended TV episode ala the Batman DTV films, but a truly emotional, hard hitting story. Without being gratuitous, a strong and engaging story with surprisingly balanced screen time for its ensemble cast.  The music and sound design are on par with any major studio feature.  In fact, this movie seems to be all that which $100million live action studio pictures try to achieve but would never be able to as this movie would be unproducable in live action ...which is all the more reason to appreciate the producer's choice of animation.
