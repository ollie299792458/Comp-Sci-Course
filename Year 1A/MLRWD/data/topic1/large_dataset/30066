Considering when filming for this began (1998), Nicole Kidman's star quality is already extremely obvious.  Whilst her accent may not be spot on it certainly does enough to convince viewers of her nationality for the 90 minute duration of the film.  I have no qualms with the acting or storyline, all are solid in my opinion.  However, what does lower my appreciation of the film is the portrayal of the City of St. Albans.  As a resident, I can safely say that St. Albans is a city, not a suburb or 'small town' as billed.  Neither is it attached to London in any way but in fact is in a separate county (think 'state' on a smaller scale).  The fact remains that the St. Albans scenes were only shot on location for a few months, when production moved to Australia where Kidman could stay with her family during a time of personal crisis.  Therefore the St. Albans scenery is decidedly unrealistic and lacklustre.  Despite what this film suggests, St. Albans is a city with a rich and colourful history spanning over 2000 years and home of the first Christian martyr in Britain.
However, if you are looking for an entertaining film and really don't care about the factual details (and lets face it, movies are supposed to be escapism), then watch this.  It's really quite a darling film.
