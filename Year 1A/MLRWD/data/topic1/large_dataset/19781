This is my only review - I've not had the inspiration to write one but I cannot stop watching this movie. I find the absurdity hilarious - including the ridiculously unbelieveable aspects of two black men dressing up as spoiled society chicks and not being called out by their big hands and feet, their masculine mannerisms. This takes one back to the comedy of Abbott and Costello, Milton Berle, even Monty Python, etc. However, I find this so much more funny and original (with the exception of Monty Python, who were the greatest at hilarious absurdity). My favorite scenes are the dance-off (so hilarious and well done), the restaurant fart scene, the face off "your mother" jokes, the bathroom scene, and the take off on "One Thousand Miles" - really hilarious. I read all the negative comments and don't find this movie racist at all (and I'm white). It is a situation comedy in the mode of Bosom Buddies - two guys passing as women so far removed from themselves, they go into outrageous character.

The movie was so entertaining that I didn't care about the sub-plot of the kidnappings. I just wanted to see more scenes of Marlon and Shawn - very good comedians, especially Marlon. I'm not a movie buff and have a hard time having my attention focused on anything too long - this movie was able to keep me at attention and wanting more.
