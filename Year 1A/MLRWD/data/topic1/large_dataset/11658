I, like many of the other reviewers, am not a fan of remakes. I mean, how many different ways can you tell a story without eventually corrupting its original intrigue? All too often, the remade product is a watered-down version of the original, barely resembling the initial plot and hardly worth the ridiculous ticket prices or the two hours of viewing time. Then we have the exceptions to the rules, which The Fly (1986) certainly is. This movie is a complete remake in the sense that Cronenberg's screenplay did not attempt to copy any of the elements created by Neumann and Clavell in their 1958 thriller of the same name. Instead, he incorporated 80s era scientific subject matter--DNA recombining, high-tech computers--with a touch of romance and changed the tone of the story but without abandoning the "don't-try-to-play-God" theme that made the original worth its salt. Of course, he did have his moment when he included the most famous line from the `58 version--"help me"--into his movie but who could blame him? I said that line for weeks after seeing the original!

The stars of The Fly (1986) help move the plot along at a steady pace and keep you wanting new information. Though the chemistry between the leads is unmistakable, Jeff Goldblum carried this film above and beyond what it should have been and placed it in a category all its own. Just watching him morph into the fly was so intense! His physical contortions, his ticks, his dry sense of humor and his understated demeanor truly outshined the other cast mates.

This flick is one of my favorites, as is the original, or should I say the first version, since The Fly (1986) is a new story all its' own. You'll find nothing water-downed about this film and nothing lacking. Well, almost nothing. I could have used another scene or two with Goldblum's shirt off but hey, that is an entirely different topic!

Enjoy this movie.
