I started out with little hope for this show. It seemed in advance like a very poor continuation of the Terminator franchise. Another female Terminator? Played by the tiny Summer Glau? How is this ever going to work.

Season 1 gradually won me over and had me watching the episodes avidly after a while. It had glitches, never really cared for Lena Headey as Sarah, John's mother. But the introduction of Brian Austin Green, plus especially John Henry in season two, plus the story arc of the show emerging clearly in season 2, made this show captivating. There are some interesting sci-fi touches, it's intense and tense throughout, though there is room for quiet moments as well. I liked what they did with the A.I.'s. The enemy was very interesting, I'd love to have learned more about this brother A.I. to John Henry, John's future enemy, plus we finaly get to see a stunning T-1000 Terminator at work again for the 1st time since Terminator 2. This is one show I wished more people had watched, they were clearly ready for another season and it's a very sad cancellation.

I rate it up there with Battlestar Galactica as the best SF show this decade, by miles.
