I hesitate to use the word "horror" because as Boris Karloff pointed out, there is a distinction between "horror" and "terror" and this film definitely involves such distinctions. This is a "terror" film - a masterpiece of low-budget suggestion and fear, as opposed to the more disgusting gory motion pictures common today - an essential possession for anyone who cares anything about the genre that creates an eerie atmosphere and a sense of pure "fear."
Perhaps the reason for this is that the director, Herk Harvey, found a truly poetic inspiration in the source of his story - the haunting Saltair resort, which has been cursed by fires and floodings since it was first constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. This DVD features marvelous additional material, including a segment of postcards from the era, which, seen from the vantage point of the 21st century, are so strangely evocative of the later "dead" atmosphere that Harvey capitalized on. Candace Hilligoss is excellent in evoking sympathy for the heroine trapped in a frightening nether-world, and the scenes where she visits "The Pavilion" are among the eeriest ever filmed in creating a vivid sense of the supernatural.
