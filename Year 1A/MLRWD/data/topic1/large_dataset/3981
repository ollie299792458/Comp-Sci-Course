Trailers built me up for this film and then you sit and watch it and realize you have been duped. The beginning had potential. I was excited from all the Action sequences seen in the Trailers. It then gets quite slow. I personally could not stand his accent! Ray Winstone was EXCELLENT in his usual type roll he was cut out for. I really was expecting something along the lines of Payback or Braveheart (what I mean is in terms of revenge). What I got was Mel looking sad and depressed. Disappointing as I think he is a top notch Actor! Ah, the days of Lethal Weapon, etc are gone I guess...

***UPDATED after viewing for the 2nd time. Ok, perhaps my first review was a bit too harsh. I watched this last night again and really enjoyed it this time :) Sometimes I need to watch a film twice as I seem to build films up and set expectations too high and am then let down. Upon my second viewing I got into it more and tried not to compare it to his (Mel Gibson) previous films. I admit, the accent still annoyed me lol! I did however enjoy it much more and will most likely purchase it. Thanks to all who commented for your insight and discussion :) Cheers!
