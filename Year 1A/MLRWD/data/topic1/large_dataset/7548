I never thought I'd enjoy a made for tv war movie since most are cheaply  done, poorly acted and scripted. But this is different. This is the best  war movie I have seen to date. It's full of misplaced guts and gory. The  prinicpal character Pvt. Manning rose from private to lieutenant in three  days, not because of the desire for glory but merely to survive. The  primary consideration among the troops that "nobody dies" is  brought home with sheer realism. The entire cast performed brilliantly and  the directing is top notch. Unlike "The Longest Day" where the  viewer is merely a spectataor to the events of war, or "Saving Pvt.  Ryan" where he feels to be an occasional particiapnt, this movie hits  you where its at. You're down there with the squad feeling the danger and  tension of fighting and the fear of getting killed . There is a lot of  action and excitement in this movie despite the fact that it also a  cerebral cinema. This is definietly ONE of the BEST.
