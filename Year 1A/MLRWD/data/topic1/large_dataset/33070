I did not read the novel this film is based on. So I did not have any preconception of what to expect from the story.

I watched the film only knowing that the main characters are going to study an 'alien' craft that crashed on Earth.

In a good way the film was not what I originally expected. Without giving away the story, you kind of get thrown in another direction of what you expect based on the first 1/4th of the film. The story is good, and intriguing. Character performances are good here and there, some characters lacked personality and some didn't. Dustin Hoffman does a good job as a believable shrink, while Samuel L. Jackson doesn't play the most believable Mathematician, but he does a job good aside from that.

The film actually made me jump a few times, it has a lot of horror elements to it that I did not expect at all. The film also has a wonderful atmosphere of solitude and silence. The crew spends the majority of the film over 1,000 ft underwater in a underwater base; this magnifies the suspense in the story.

Character personalities could have been fleshed out more, too many of them seemed dull and not real. That would be my only complaint. The cinematography is well done and the movie looks great on blu-ray.

My final thoughts:
It was a surprisingly good film, not what I expected from reading synopsis and mostly negative reviews. This film definitely gets a positive review from me and I recommend it to any fan of the sci-fi, space, deep sea or horror-suspense genre.
