Through the high drama of the deliberations of the jury on a slum kid's murder trial, this surprisingly intense film illustrates how the American court system helps protect individual rights through objective law, while at the same time glorifying heroic individualism through Henry Fonda's character, at first the sole juror to hold out for reasonable doubt.

All twelve jurors are perfectly--i.e., intriguingly yet consistently--characterized. The plotting is masterful, as key points are revealed at a suspenseful yet breathtaking pace. Throughout the deliberation, inconsistencies in the case are subtly revealed so that the viewer can arrive at some of them before the jurors get to them. The only flaw is that, probably in an attempt to maintain suspense, the key point casting doubt on the testimony of the key witness is not available to the audience until the last moment so that it sort of comes out of nowhere, unfortunately having the opposite effect on the suspense of the film's climax. It might have helped if they had shown the key testimony during the trial itself for the first five minutes or so of the film. Nevertheless, it's amazing how much drama and tension they manage to put into a film that's essentially just twelve men sitting in a small room talking for an hour and a half.

The Ox-Bow Incident, also starring Fonda, makes an excellent companion piece to this film, as it shows the importance to the protection of individual rights of objective law from a negative perspective (i.e., it more directly shows the evil of anarchy and mob rule).
