This movie is best experienced over and over.  I've seen the movie about forty times, and my husband and I quote it frequently. (Great quotes for all occasions:  Dieting? "Wanna chocolate?" ... Someone cut you off on the freeway? "Stupid is as stupid does." ... You're an executive subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury? "That's all I have to say -- about that.")
Forrest Gump, a loveable innocent with an I.Q. of 75, stumbles through life pretty much without a clue ("Would you believe it? After five years of playing football I got a college degree!") -- yet he somehow manages to become a football star, a war hero, and a successful businessman.
Only in America.
The special effects in this one are absolutely amazing.  Forrest shakes hands with JFK, peeks over George Wallace's shoulder, and shows Linden B. Johnson his butt-cheek.  It's all totally first class stuff.
Adventure addicts will love the war scenes (which were bloody, but not nauseating)... Comedy buffs will love Forrest's ability to be funny without meaning to... Romantics will love the unconditional adoration Forrest showers on Jenny (a confused and often abused girl who only too late realizes that what she was looking for was there all along)... History buffs will love figuring out what year it is by what events are going on at the time... This movie has something for everyone! 
(Due to the violence, partial nudity and foul language, however, parents should see this first.  I wouldn't recommend viewing by anyone under 13.) 
Don't rent this one -- BUY IT for your video/dvd library and watch it often.
