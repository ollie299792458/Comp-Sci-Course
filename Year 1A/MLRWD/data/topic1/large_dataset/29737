This is a great DVD release of a bad movie. Brutal animal killings, a silly script, diabolical acting, and laughably phony special effects deflate Umberto Lenzi's "serious" attempt at racism. It would be a lot more offensive if it was executed (no pun intended) more convincingly; as it is I had a hard time taking it seriously.
That said, I was real impressed with the way it was packaged. Along with a fold out replica of the U.S. poster and Umberto Lenzi's filmography, the DVD includes a fascinating audio commentary from Lenzi and star John Morghen (their take on the movie could not be more opposite), the original Italian, German, and U.S. theatrical trailers, a photo and poster gallery including recent photos of Lenzi and Morghen (who I hardly recognized) set to the soundtrack music, an on camera interview with Lenzi, which is mostly Italian), and liner notes by Bill Landis. There's even an easter egg of a premiere in San Francisco (which gauges the audience's reaction to the movie). A job well done!
If you can take the animal killings and the degrading of women (of which there is a LOT of it) you might enjoy this movie. Certainly to me it hasn't looked or sounded so good in any other incarnation. 
Otherwise, steer as far away from this sucker as you can.
