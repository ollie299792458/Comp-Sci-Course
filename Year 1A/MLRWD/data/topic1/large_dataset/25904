....if it weren't for the fact that you don't care a thing about any of the characters.  All three are lifeless and 1 dimensional.  There's your steretypical animal like character, your stereotypical character that overthinks things, and a female who represents a balance of the two.

If the movie had started from the end and gone back to the beginning, then you would see it as a rape revenge piece.  But the way the movie was shot you're thrown right into the action, great.  But there's a lot of confusing dialogue throwing you off as to what's going on.  The depiction of homosexuals in these scenes is that they're just a bunch of perverted monkeys looking to hump each other at all times.  Then as you go back through the story, the action is less and less until finally there are entire scenes of filler between the three characters.

I was looking forward to a good artistic piece, and so many people had raved about it, I thought I'd try.  Then again, some people get excited by watching some really brutal scenes of rape and murder.  (The rape scene is over 10 minutes long, and the murder scene is a painful 2 minutes.)  These scenes are shocking, make no mistake.  But the film just seems to fall flat, and so do the characters.
