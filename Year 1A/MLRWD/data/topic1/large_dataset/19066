i was really excited to see this movie after watching the first one several times, however i did not think i would like it.  But i loved it.  It starts off with a guy stuck in a face trap to mirror the jaw trap from the first one. There is a face plate with rusted nails inside that will snap on his face if he doesnt find the key in time.  But the key is inside his eye. Not being able to take out his eye for the key, it snaps shut on him, killing him.  When the investigators find him, they also discover a message that says "look closer" to the detective. They soon find jigsaw killer, but he is not able to do much of anything anymore, due to the cancer he has that we found out aobut in the first movie.  But the detective soon discovers monitors which show 8 or 9 people trapped in a house full of traps, his son being one of them.  All the people in the house are connected somehow, and you find out something about the detective as well.  Amanda is also trapped in the house.  For those of you who dont remember, amanda was the girl from the first one that survived the jaw trap.  Soon they all begin to go crazy, and the deaths are much worse than the ones from the first one.  The scene that made me cringe the most was the one involving the pit of needles.  The ending is amazing with several differnt twists. I predicted the main twist about 3 seconds before it was revealed. The ending throws so much at you that i need to watch it again before i actually completely understand what is going on.  The endig is directly related the first movie.

Great movie, i recommened to anyone who enjoys psycological types of movies
