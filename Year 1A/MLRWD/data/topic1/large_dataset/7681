POINT BLANK is a worthy, simple gangster picture that tried to turn revenge into movie art.  The artsy vehicle employed in this attempt was the flashback.  Unfortunately it did not do the trick.  The flashbacks were distracting.  They added nothing to the story dimension of the film.  Despite the flashbacks I enjoyed this film.  The star lead, Walker [Lee Marvin]is not a hero, but a righteously revengeful mobster: revenge because his pal leaves him for dead and steals his share of the "take."  Marvin was the ideal star for this film; taciturn, quietly heroic, and good with the fists. Lloyd Bochner and Michael Strong are well cast as the socially acceptable members of the modern Mob. You'll never forget two splendidly directed scenes.  First, when Walker manages to bypass the goons guarding his ex-pal, then kills him in a penthouse--the first revenge. A second splendid scene that didn't mean much to the revenge angle, but spiced the film with a sprig of romance--was Angie Dickinson pounding  Lee Marvin unrelentingly with both fists in a fit of scorn until she falls to her knees.  Although Walker manages to gain some revenge the story-plot is unresolved at the end and the so-called "Twist" does not make sense. What does make sense is this modern underworld film without gutter profanity.  That is a treat worth not hearing  in POINT BLANK.
