Even the non Special Edition of Boxcar Bertha from the Martin Scorsese Collection was presented in Widescreen , but alas New York, New York is only Letterboxed.

It  only includes the  so called restored version of the film which is in reality only one of three versions released.

If any film is more deserving than The Abyss for a "watch it the way you want to" DVD release it's New York, New York.

 The deleated / alternate scenes included do not  represent the differences between the first and third versions of the film, nor do they include the  scenes deleted from the first release to shorten the running time for the second run release.

The Laserdisc Special Edition release had more bonus material  than is included on this DVD.

Guess we'll have to wait for the Ultimate Edition Boxed set for a truely special edition .

In the meantime this one will due.

Sept 2007: Pre - order pages are appearing for New York, New York: 30th Anniversary Edition, Reportedly 2 discs.  Hopefully  it's a vast improvement on this one. Buy it instead.
