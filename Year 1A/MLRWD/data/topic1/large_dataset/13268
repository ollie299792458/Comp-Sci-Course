Bridges of Madison County isn't just another "Love Story" that should be overlooked. The feelings that are portrayed in this movie, are very much real. I'm sure many of us have experience or even fantasied  ourselves in movies, taking on the role of the character. Moving your self  into the screen, imagining life, love, everything about the movie.
 Both  Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood were selected to become Francesca Johnson  and Robert Kincaid. Personally, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the  roles!
 Clint Eastwood cultivated the role of Robert Kincaid. He proved  to many that he had/has the ability to feel the authors character. Mr.  Eastwood's talent shines in many roles through out his career. In BOMC, he  reinforces the feelings of many through the eye of the camera, both on and  off screen.
 Meryl Streep proving to women and men across the country  that she has the serene beauty and talent to portray an Iowan Homemaker  reaching within for inner feelings that she at the time, needed to  experience. Ms Streep, has the natural aura of intensifying the character's  she represents.
 Share the lives of Francesca Johnson and Robert Kincaid.  A photographer lost in Iowa looking for the Roseman Bridge and the woman he  asks directions from . . . which eventually changes both their lives  forever.
