I'm on my second time viewing the episodes of Season 3 on DVD.  I remember being disappointed by Season 2, but after seing it on DVD decided it was not all that bad, just not as intriguing as the first.

But Season 3 irritates me.  I feel like the entire Orson storyline was forced.  I started out intrigued, but when everything was explained found it ridiculous and that it did not fit with the information that had been previously provided or hinted at early in the season.  I wonder if Marcia Cross's pregnancy and forced bedrest had anything to do with the storyline change - but it felt as if it were not thought out at all, or the writers completely changed courses on the direction they wanted the storyline to take and then had to shove a square peg into the round hole they had created.

Other than that, I liked the Gabby/Victor thing, Mike-in-a-coma-out-of-a-coma thing, and can't wait for Season 4 to start and see what happens with Edie's apparent suicide.  If only the Orson storyline had played out a little better, I might have found this season more satisfying.
