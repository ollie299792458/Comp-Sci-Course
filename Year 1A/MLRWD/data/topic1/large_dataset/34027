This is my second pick for "Best Movie of the Year."  Dad is just so darn DARK.  The pastor is just so darn, "...of the Light."  The movie is just so darn, pretty close to reality.  It gave me an almost, "...been there, done that" feeling.

Dad had made bad, bad decisions all his life.  His family suffers...especially the son.  There is something special with mom for putting up with dad this whole time.  (This is NO "Love DARE" movie!!)  Or perhaps it is the very dark side of some of the characters in that movie....

The pastor/co-worker is just so wanting to do the right thing.... sometimes he tries and screws up... other times in a perfect opportunity, he doesn't try  when he should... Wow!! Huh!! Duh!!.... Kinda, just like me and how I witness to folks......

Where Clint E. had "The Unforgiven"... This flick should really be re-named "The Forgiven, The Forgiven, and Re-forgiven"...OR;  "Forgive, Forgiven, Forgivness is Free."

This is the movie to keep you on edge with a mixed bag of feelings and surprises;  "Is he that dumb?"  "Is he really going to do that?!"  "Is that really going to fix the problem?  "  Boy, he'd better fix that one before too long!!!!  Can't any of them at one time or another see what they are doing to someone else?

You will all see yourselves in this flick at one time or another.  See how the "pro-s" do it......

See this movie.  See it several times to really see it all.
