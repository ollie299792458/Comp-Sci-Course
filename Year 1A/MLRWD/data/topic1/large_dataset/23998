The first time I watched it, the plot line was so complex, it was difficult to formulate a coherent opinion. I watched it second time with a fair minded friend, and it was a lot easier to understand after a lengthy discussion. First thing first...if you're sort of a person who likes to be told every single detail in a movie, this probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you like brain teasers, puzzles, and likes to solve little nuances of a movie, this is exactly what you're looking for.

The plot line is simple: two engineers try to make a levitating machine (they call it "diamagnetic")in their garage, and actually succeed in doing it. The machine however has a special side-effect; any object that enters the machine can travel back in time. This is far different than a "time machine" because it only works one way, travel back in time, not forward. Carruth provides a very elegant and yet simple explanation of how the machine is able to achieve such a feat, but I wont go into that. The two engineers initially use this machine to make money off of the stock-market. But, as all time travel story goes, the frailties of humanity comes into the play that changes the lives of the two engineers. I wont give away the plot line, but it is definitely worth watching multiple times to fully understand the complex question that the film is proposing, such as cause and effect and time travel paradox.
