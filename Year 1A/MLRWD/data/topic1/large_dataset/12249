I love this film. I first saw it as a kid and I'm familiar with most of the cast, so that'll at least partly explain my attraction to it.

Highlights here for me...
- Intro with Lamborghini police chase in desert.
- Real camels in desert intro scene with the sheik.
- Any scene with Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, or Jamie Farr, with their corresponding theme music.
- Jackie Chan's 1st intro to mainstream America, not including his earlier Big Brawl.
- A great cast of stars & neat cars, including a red Ferrari, a silver Aston Martin, and a white Rolls Royce.

Kids today may actually recognize Jackie Chan & Terry Bradshaw before they recognize anybody else. Roger Moore playing Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore, is fantastic to me. He along with his gadget-filled Aston Martin & near James Bond music is almost single-handedly the reason I prefer this 1st film to the sequel. In this 1st movie we also see a lot of the great Lamborghini, whereas in the sequel, the Lamborghini is ditched near the beginning due to a breakdown.

I actually appreciate the humor in this. Jamie Farr as the sheik here is impressively politically incorrect, as is much of the film, but in a mainly tame way. I re-watch this a lot, with my favorite sections being the beginning to Bert Convy riding a motorcycle out of an airplane over Arizona, and then from when Jackie first enters the desert to the end of the film. These beginning & end sequences simply have the most replay value for me.

In the audio commentary, the directer & producer incorrectly state that this is Jackie Chan's 1st American film. The producer later clarifies this, saying it's Jackie's 1st exposure to a broad, American audience. This is mainly true. Jackie's 1st American film was actually the Big Brawl, which was released a year earlier, in 1980. Because Cannonball Run was a huge hit, and the Big Brawl was a huge flop, it's logical that Jackie's 1st widespread introduction to America would be considered Cannonball Run. It actually was my introduction to Jackie Chan, although I didn't become fanatical about him & his movies until I rediscovered him in the mid-90's.

- Product tie-ins... many brand-names are mentioned or seen here. A partial list: 7-11; Budweiser; Camel; Coca-Cola; Dr. Pepper; GMC Trucks; Goodyear; Hawaiian Tropic & the Hawaiian Tropic Girls; and NASCAR; not to mention the various main auto makers. Some people like this product placement- I think it adds a nice element.
