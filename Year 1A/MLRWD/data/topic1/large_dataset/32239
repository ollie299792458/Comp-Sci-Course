Army of Darkness is an extremely rare movie in one regard: it's a silly movie that knows it's silly; it has all the gloriously pathetic one-liners that can be asked for, wonderful acting and physical comedy on Bruce Campbell's part, and battle scenes that are both fabulous and cheesy  looking at the same time.  I am, though, rather dismayed with the  "R" rating this movie received - it's just too silly to be seen  as offensive.  But, I'll leave my critique of the movie rating system for  another time (heh, heh)....  The Limited Edition is worth every penny.  The commentary by Campbell and the Raimi brothers is side-splittingly funny as well as informative.  The "making of feature" is also interesting, as are the story boards, trailer, deleted scenes and creature drawings (its obvious that everyone had a lot of fun making this DVD).  Its also interesting having the two versions of the film, but it left me wishing that there was a third cut.  The battle scenes in the Director's Cut were much better and - as pointed out in the commentary - make much more sense.  Overall, the directors cut should have been used as a base, with the theatrical version's vastly superior one-liners and ending and prudent lack of a sex scene (Raimi pointed out, and I agree, that the sex-scene was completely inappropriate - it just makes the movie WAY too serious.  Ash and Sheela's relationship really was much better left at "Gimme some sugar, baby.") Overall, an extremely fun movie that stays funny with multiple viewings.
