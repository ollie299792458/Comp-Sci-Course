I could hardly finish this movie. There was so little dialogue, and so little action. Most of the scenes were silent, and we were just watching people walk around or cook. I was bored sick, and I don't reccomend this film unless you want to fall asleep.

I love Catherine Zeta Jones because she's so charming, Aaron Eckheart was likeable, and Abigail Breslin is a brilliant little actress, but none of them could save this movie. It was a waste of money and talent. It seems like they used the script for another film, but just took out what they couldn't use instead of re-writing it. The trailer makes it look entertaining and fun, but it wasn't. I was disappointed, and I wanted to turn it off before we were at the end. I just kept thinking that it would be over any time, but it dragged on and on.

There are no surprises and no scenes that are worth watching the movie for. Everything was bland and boring. Don't bother watching it. If you read a review of it by a good writer, that will be more interesting than the film itself.
