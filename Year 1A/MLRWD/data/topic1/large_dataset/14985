I was lucky enough find this on DVD recently, so I snatched it up. Anchor Bay's version has some small glitches in a couple places, but they are very minor and hardly noticable. The transfer is from a good print, so unless you are looking for extra's I see no reason to get the over-priced Criterion version. I am proud to add this movie to my Hitchcock collection, which so far includes Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest, To Catch a Thief and The Birds. This movie with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, ranks among his very best. For those of you who shy away from Hitch's older B&amp;W pictures, don't despair. After about 10 minutes of this movie you will be thoroughly engrossed. This moivie was way ahead of its time in my opinion, and you can clearly see elements in it that movie-makers are still stealing from today. Ingrid Bergman (Alicia Huberman) was never more beautiful and turns in a wonderful performance as the daughter of a Nazi spy. Cary Grant (Devlin) plays the American agent who enlists the help of Alicia to trap a top Nazi mastermind. Hitch doesn't let us down. It's a great mix of action, suspense and romance done in a sort of elegant style that makes this the unique and entertaining movie that it is. Notorious is a great film that you will want to watch again and again. Highly recommended.
