Maybe my expectations were too high. I was hoping for greatness with this film; but it just doesn't quite get there. It is still a very good movie and is highly enjoyable. It just doesn't quite make the 5-star list. 
"An Ideal Husband" is one of my favorite DVDs. So, when I heard that the same people were making an adaptation of "Importance of being Earnest," I couldn't wait to see it. Then I heard that the cast was going to include some of my favorite actors, so my expectations went up even more. 
For the most part, the cast does deliver in a big way. Judi Dench, in particular, is marvelous. Firth does a great job and Frances O'Connor is very good. 
The two other main cast members (Everett and Witherspoon) are a bit of a disappointment. Especially Witherspoon! She is completely mis-cast in this role. She seems too old for the role. And though it seems that she spent long hours with a voice coach to develop an English accent, it doesn't ring true. Her whole presence on the screen has a feeling of wrong-ness that I can't get over. Everett - who was so good in 'Ideal Husband' - does a passable job here, but just does not quite nail it all the way through. 
As for the other aspects of the film, I give it high marks but not the highest. The direction is very good. It basically suceeds in getting all the comedic timing and pacing right. But the witty Wilde dialogue does not come across with the crispness that I had hoped for. It's ok, but it doesn't grab you the way that it should. Costumes, sets, supporting cast are all excellent. Some of the departures from the original Wilde text are a bit maddening; others though are quite funny (I admit that I laughed out loud at the tatoo scenes). 
In summary: I enjoyed this film. However, it is not the kind of movie I'm going to watch over and over again. It's pretty darn good, but does not achieve greatness. A good rental; but maybe not worth buying for your library.
