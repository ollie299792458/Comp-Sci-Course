It's an action movie that won't be as good as the previews made it look. Other reviews say "The best movie ever by far" and things like that - well, maybe they're used to movies like Relic, Narc, and Kiss of the Dragon. Compared to them, sure the movie is good. But next to top rate action thrillers like The Recruit, Bourne Identity/Supremecy, Terminator movies, etc. it just feels like an average trek through action territory.

At leaste the guy from the Matrix renewed his name a bit - his stunt on the tanker Biker Boyz looked like it could have been his last role. Hawke is fine for the part, as is Ja Rule for Smiley. The cast fits the parts, but the movie overall fails to leave a lasting effect. The end is very cut and dry, let's wrap this up style. Cliche, immediate "semi - happy ending" (somewhat happy ending, but no spoilers here so I won't be specific) with a twist of mystery.

Recommend to rent, but not to buy. If you aren't afraid to spend some extra and aren't expecting a revolution, maybe even catch it at the theater if it's still on.

Note to concerned - Rated R for repeated strong language, drug content (beginning), and violence (head shots, etc.).

Peace out.
