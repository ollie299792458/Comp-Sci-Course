I bought this film never having seen a Bergman film before... I don't think, and wondered if I'd appreciate it on its own merits rather than for being a "BERGMAN" film.  The opening is depressing enough and I almost turned it off but was soon drawn in by the quality of story telling, acting and film making. I wasn't struck or impressed by the genius behind the curtain but by the newness of the film. It also has common sense woven in with tragedy, comedy and vindication. I also enjoyed the extra interviews with Bergman. His story of an oriental pedestal maker struck a truth for me that I needed at the moment. I couldn't believe how appropriate it was for me and Bergman looking right into the camera (at the viewer) while telling it.  I realized then how he loved story telling and film making of course far beyond being 'Bergman' whom I prejudged as being out of reach and out of touch with his audience only because of his persona.  Now I have to get my hands on all of his films but where to start (?).

  The movie is set in what feels like nineteenth century Eastern Europe.  The film opens with the band of entertainers taking a break on a hill beside their horse drawn carriage. They still wear makeup and period clothing as if not having time to remove them since their last performance or are they on the run? Is the make up so bad in this movie? This type of question runs to deeper and deeper levels but all at a digestible pace. Truth seems to be in question much of the time but doesn't seem to suffer never surfacing especially at the end. Some parts remain unresolved but this also seems of little consequence as in real life. Who can answer such questions - what is 'truth'?
There's more integrity in not attempting it and a reality is restored.  What does seem of consequence is the survival of integrity which has, as a finale, been evenly given to all the characters - or there would have been trouble. (Happy ending).
