The first time I saw Enternal Sunshine, I knew it was something truly special. First, the opening sequence got my attention. I thought, "What kind of crazy neiborhood is this" as Elija Wood inexplicity knocked on Jim Carey's car window. What a delightful surprise to learn later that I had already seen the plot twist I had wished for during the middle of the movie. The last scene was truly supercharged. By then, of course, you love the characters and desparately wanted the relationship to succeed. By the second viewing, I began to notice more and more details, appreciate the beautiful musical score, the complexity and humanity of the plot. The emotional impact, if anything, was greater the second time because I better understood the relationships in this complex story. During the third viewing the dramatic tie in of the beginning and ending really hit home. Small details became clear which made them even more delightful. Close to the end of the film, why did Clemintine look at her ass in the mirror while Joel waited in the car? Of course, she fell on her butt on the ice in the opening sequence. She was looking for a bruse. How did Joel and Clemintine know to met in Montauk? They had arranged to met there during the escape to Joel's childhood, when detection and eraser was less likely. In short, by the third viewing you begin to appreciate the richness and genius of the details. The ending, of course, is quite remarkable. The emotional response actual increases with each viewing. You hear and understand what Joel is saying on the tape recording in the background and comprehend Clemintine's reaction. You understand the importance to the plot of Kirstin Durst's character. The great acting ability demonstrated by Jim Carey and Kate Winslet during this film made these these characters seem real. These truly were the performances of a lifetime for all memebers of the cast and crew.
