First, I want to note that this disc didn't work in my Sony Bluray player.  I was deeply disappointed, but I didn't want to give it up, so I set it aside in the hopes of getting it to work someday.  I eventually figured out that I could connect the player to the internet and update its firmware, and that got Baraka working.  If your player has trouble with this disc, see if any firmware update is available!

As for the movie. . .  I see that people who buy it often get 2001: A Space Odyssey too.  Good call!  With Baraka's stunning cinematography and lack of any dialog or narration, I was reminded of 2001, especially the opening "dawn of man" sequences.  Maybe this film should have been called 1993: An Earth Odyssey.

Most of the images are beautiful, some are stunning, many are thought-provoking, and the soundtrack is an excellent match for it all.  I shouldn't have to repeat the praise that many have already heaped on Baraka -- it's all true.  However, I also have to quibble with Baraka, because it has philosophical axe to grind.  The unsubtle theme is that industry destroys the Earth, modern life is dehumanizing, and we'd all be better off returning to the forest and becoming oh-so-wise-and-happy stone age hunter-gatherers.

In fact, one of the best ways to describe Baraka is by telling what it isn't.  If any of you have seen the TV series "Modern Marvels", just imagine the polar opposite of that.  MM is homely, Baraka is beautiful.  MM is prosaic, Baraka is sublime.  MM explains, Baraka shows.  MM thinks, Baraka feels.  And then there's the underlying message. . .  Modern Marvels is a paean to technology, industry and progress.  Baraka is a condemnation of those things.  My own philosophy, I have to say, is more in line with Modern Marvels.

In short:  I adored Baraka, but I also have to take it with a grain of salt.  I suggest you do the same.
