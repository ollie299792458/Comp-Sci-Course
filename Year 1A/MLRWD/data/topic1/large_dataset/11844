If you are one of the unfortunate few to not have been able to experience the Coop live in the last few years, or will not have the 2006 tour come to your area, then don't miss out on this fantastic two disc combo.  Or, if you have, re-live the evening with non-stop stage antics and a frenzied blitz of classic favorites and fresh material.  If Alice was yonger, his most recent albums would top the charts with "grab ya by the neck" hooks, and trademark lyrical lashes that keep you begging for more.  Alice has never sounded better and is indeed on top of his game with energy to spare. Superb production quality abound on both discs, and do a fine job capturing the synergy and excitment of arguably the best live band touring today bar none.  The line up is electric, with the frenzied Ryan Roxie, speedster Damon Johnson, thunderous Eric Singer, gothic Chuck Garric, catatonic Calico Cooper, goulish gags and stage performers and of course... ya gotta see it to believe it. Buy it for yourself, buy it for someone else.  Awsome.
