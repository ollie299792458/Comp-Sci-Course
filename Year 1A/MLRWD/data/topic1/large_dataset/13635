I absolutely loved this movie! The whole thing was entertaining. I think the only part that annoyed me was that our hero only had to dig a little to find THE CHARLET. And, if the ship had sunk why wasn't there any water left in the ship? Everything was ship-shape. But other then that it was great! Only Nicholas Cage could pull this off. You don't think he is related to Harrison Ford? Although, this will never take the place of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it stands as a masterpiece. To me, that is. Not bad for PG. Disney seems to be moving up in the world. I've seen the reviews for this movie and IT IS NOT A FLICK! Just though I'd make that clear for any of you who have not seen this yet. This was a pretty clean movie. There were some threats made but no one died. It would have been nice if it had a little more action, though. Jon Tureltaub does it all with touches of humor. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure has its share of Romance. But, they don't throw it on thick. That is usually the downfall of and excellent movie. There are enough clues to keep you guessing. Once again here is another one with a stunning cast. But, cage is the one who made it. Without him I don't think the movie would have surfaced. It still would have been good but not superb. From the start the director feeds you with little bits of the story, and then he gives it to you. I won't tell you the ending, but it's really good. You will be satisfied, I promise! So, if you have nothing to do this holiday season, I would go see this. I think you'll find it's a lot better then you think.
