I was so happy to see this title come to Blu-Ray.  In general, it's a great release.  Three versions of the film are presented: 1929 silent in two versions, and the original 1925 version (taken from the same old 16mm print used before, but it's the only source for the original release version available).

All of that said, I have only one question about this release: who the Hell authored the disc itself?  From the main menu, you can't choose the version you want to see!  Instead, there are options to play the film with various and sundry musical scores.  When you DO choose a score, it's pure Hell getting back to the main menu!  Try it yourself, it's quite a puzzle.  I would explain how I figured it out, but it would take too long to go into here.

Anyway, other than the goofy authoring, it's a great release.  Maybe they'll reissue this one day with choices for the various versions of the films presented on the main menu.  This is a David Shephard of Blackhawk Films release.  There are rumors that Milestone is preparing their own Blu-ray version for 2012.  Maybe they'll fix the problems with their old DVD release.
