Right off the bat I have to say that Vesta and I almost hit the reject button on the DVD player. This movie started out stupid and dumb and we were pretty sure it had nowhere to go. Time to get up and watch something on Hulu.

"You wanna do it?" She said.

"No, I got the cat." Scruffy, our mangy tom was sitting in my lap and I was comfortable in my recliner.

"Somebody has to get up and get that bloody movie out of that player." She was comfortable in her recliner too. That's the problem with these things, get a glass of wine in your hand, recline and you just don't wanna get up.

So we let the movie play a bit longer and son of a gun if I didn't start laughing on occasion. Vesta too. Then more laughter, then I was into this silly story and it was silly, but somehow, I don't know how, we wound up being entertained and that's what movies are supposed to be about. They're supposed to take you out of you're life for an hour or two and this one did.

Maybe this movie was made for younger people. Vesta thought it was made for guys who like to get together with a few beers and laughs. But whoever the intended audience, we wanna sign up with `em, because though this movie started out stupid and dumb, it wound up being campy and fun. Yes, it was lewd and crude, but heck, it was sort of a romantic comedy too. Sort of a coming of age story as well. All in all, I gotta say, this is an unexpectedly good movie.
