When I first saw Terry Gilliam's "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen", It was 1989 and I was in my last year of college in Columbia, Missouri, though I didn't know it would be my last year at that time (Alas, I'm a Dropout).  I remember running into a few counterculture acquaintances that night, and feverishly describing the entire movie to them-spoilers be dammed.  I've never done that with another movie before or since, which speaks volumes not only of my enthusiasm for the film, but of the film's narrative pull (There are tons of infinitely more linear movies around, but I would be hard pressed to recite a plot of any of them as easily as I did this one.  Maybe that's why I'm a dropout).  This isn't the kind of blockbuster movie that is generally made nowadays, where CGI takes the place of a soul.  This is the old way, with models, trick photography, and ingenuity.

The movie itself I would give 5 plus stars in a heartbeat, the DVD probably warrants about a 3.  Brief bios of Gilliam and Eric Idle, and the theatrical trailer, which, considering how badly this movie was publicized, isn't much of a bonus.  The Baron needs someone like Criterion to come along and give him the royal treatment, as Gilliam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" has gotten recently.  This is the second Terry Gilliam film whose troubled history inspired a book ("Losing the Light").  Also, few filmmakers give better commentaries on DVD than TG, so one of those would be welcome.  An upgraded image and sound transfer would be in order, also.  This version is okay in those departments, but only just.  I bought this for the same reason I bought "Local Hero", because the movies are necessary, but in both cases, a nice special edition is long overdue.

My final star rating is an average, by the way...
