As the title states... I don't own any of the recently released DVD's of this fine show. However my comments are from what I recall from Memory of its original broadcast dates.
Being only 12 during its first season my opinion may be somewhat jaded but that doesn't deter the very fact that this show had some excellent episodes that weren't surpassed until the fall of 1987 when Star Trek TNG came out.
I wish I could remember specifically which episodes of this series were because SOME were (story wise) just so rich in its content and overall production. Sadly though - the series did suffer with the introduction of the shapeshifter. It was a idea that was ahead of its time BUT the way they decided to show the shapeshifting process was laughable at best.
I also question on why (from technical reviews) on why they didn't put the needed $$ to do it right the first time and release (remix) the sound in 5.1 surround sound? Most certainly the technology exists to do this quite easily so why the delay?
I hesitate to buy these DVD's for that simple reason. There is no excuse for this poor decision. Now IF it couldn't be done then that would understandable but we all know that it can.
