To be concise and summarize - Great value!  50 movies (I paid about 25 bucks; so 50 cent movies - how can you complain?)

Transfer quality generally awful, most but not all are slightly out of focus (won't notice on little tv!) but watchable.  If you are a perfectionist you will not want this.  Some scenes from some movies have been cut but nothing major so far (have seen maybe 26-27 so far).  Sound generally poor, mono, (2 were in stereo).  The B&W movies generally not so bad but many of the color films have serious quality problems IMHO.  All are full screen; no wide-screen (that I have seen).  This is OK since all movies before 1954 were approx. FF anyway.  The ideal customer wants a sample of the 20's-60's Horror/Mystery/Action B movies with 3-4 real classics and 15+ total duds.  Still, fantastic value.  Absolutely no frills.  All movies have small number of selectable scenes, no trailers or ANY other stuff.  Packaging is 12 d/s single layer disks each in cardboard cd-type sleeve.  None of the disks in my box was scratched (maybe lucky?).
