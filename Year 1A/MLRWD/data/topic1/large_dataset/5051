The trailer is horribly misleading. They make it look like another Devil's Advocate type movie, yet it is nothing of the sort. It is a not-so-thinly veiled Christian movie which isn't a big deal, but the trailer does NOT portray it as such (deceit?). Almost all of the movie takes place in the courtroom, and is almost totally dialogue. Again, not a big deal when the dialogue is good. The arguments presented on both sides are just awful. Neither side could win a High School debate with the arguments provided, much less prove ANYTHING in a court of law. In fact, neither side does any good at presenting any kind of a case, so the entire "judgement" is based on the devil's ranting confession, most of which is in the trailer. I did mention The Devil's Advocate, and it wouldn't be fair to mention that movie and not mention the fact that this movie SHAMELESSLY quotes that movie (without reference) on more than one occasion. If this movie is meant to move people, it completely fails. I award you one star (because I can't do zero), and may God have mercy on your soul. (thank you Billy Madison)
