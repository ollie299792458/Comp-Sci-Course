I've only barely scratched the surface of this double disc DVD and feel compelled to brag about it already.  Good DVDs should always contain this much material and should take several days/weeks to get through.  
The movie itself is brilliant.  Other reviewers have emphasized that already (and better than I could anyway).  But a film like this one is so incredibly enhanced when intelligent, entertaining supplimental material is provided.  Criterion and Spike Lee have compiled some of the best extras I have seen in a DVD package so far.
In a behind the scenes montage, Spike (and his brother) filmed a large portion of interviews and read-throughs with the cast members.  We are able to see these actors question Spike about the script to understand their characters better.  We see them interacting (sometimes awkwardly) with each other, attempting to establish comradery.  And, as Spike clarifies things to the cast, we the audience receive clarity as well.  
Of special note is the transformation of Rosie Perez.  Her "character development" (that of herself, not of her film character) is amazing.  When the interviews begin, she seems to be a detached outsider, frustrated by the others who might not have experienced the Bed-Stuy neighborhood as authentically as she did.  When the featurette ends, she is close to tears, reminiscing on how much she will miss everyone.  Seldom are we able to look into the lives of the actual actors as intimately as Spike has allowed us to do here.
I am highly anticipating the release of Lee's BAMBOOZLED on DVD, as well.  I expect the extras (though not as much will be included as is found on DTRT) to be quite enlightening.  That film, like this one, begs for further discussion and interaction.
