Not sure why this is listed under two ASINs (the other, with picture and details, is B000BDGW0I), but what arrived is also the Special Edition released in 2005. Packaging and features are identical, as far as I can tell.

The six-part documentary is an engrossing look back at the making of this exceptional film. The film has been cleaned up nicely, right down to its theatrical trailer (notice the difference between the trailer's opening moments and the quality of its remainder).

GALLIPOLI remains a poignant film, full of engaging characters. Gibson had done MAD MAX at this point, but this is primarily Mark Lee's show. Lee's Archy Hamilton is keen on doing what's right and honorable, but Gibson's Frank Dunne can't hide his equally doe-eyed innocence behind a city-slicker's cynicism. They are two mates, going off to war.

If your son or daughter is as gung-ho to join some war effort, GALLIPOLI is the film to watch with them before they trot off to the recruiting office. The film takes the view of youth, not the heavy-handedness of aged wisdom.
