Well, what can you say about "I Love Lucy"?  As a die-hard Lucille Ball fan, this is from the time where she was at the top of her game as a comedic actress.  Mostly everyone has seen at least one episode of I Love Lucy and this second season collection has some of the most memorable episodes of the entire series.  Little Ricky's birth, the "Job Switching", the first time Lucy is seen playing the saxophone, and the list goes on and on.  There are a lot of episodes with Ricky singing down at the club too.

As for the collection itself, I am glad that CBS reduced the pricing but not the content.  As with the first season, you get Lucille Ball's radio program, "My Favorite Husband", one episode per disc.  All of which were episodes later turned into "I Love Lucy" Episodes.  That's the added bonus that made me buy this set.  The digital remastering is fantastic, with the video quality looking better than ever.  The sound quality is excellent and the chapter navigation through the episodes is quite convenient and easy.  And you get to see each episode uncut.  It is amazing to see what was cut out in the syndication versions, some cuts were more than three minutes long.

This is a must-have for any Lucille Ball fan.
