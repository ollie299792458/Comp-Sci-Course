Mouse Hunt is truly a feel-good movie. It will make you smile and genuinely laugh in places. If you've had a bad day, put this movie on and it will raise your spirits. The storyline portrays a series of confrontations between an underestimated mouse and two opposite-minded brothers who have been willed a house occupied by the mouse. In order to sell the place (which they discover is worth a fortune), the boys must evict the mouse. The mouse proves to be an able adversary and gains the upperhand more often than not. The humorous scenes have a logical progression to them that makes the movie absolutely funny. You find yourself thinking: "That's what I would do," only to discover the mouse still gains the advantage. Others have described this movie as "hiliarious" but I would prefer to call it "absolutely funny." The humor will never go out of style.

This movie will not disappoint you. It even has a happy win-win ending which is what everyone wants when they cheer for "the little guy." This is an excellent addition to any home video library.  I highly recommend it.
