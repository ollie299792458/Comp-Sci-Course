28 Days is a fabulous movie that stirs many emotions associated with addiction, immaturity, and insecurity. Sandra Bullock plays a character that demonstrates how many perceived strong and "vibrant" people in our lives, are too often driven by hidden insecurities and emotional pain. The movie centers around a beautiful and charismatic woman about 30 years old, that has surrounded her life with equally colorful and insecure people that routinely gather and celebrate in public places, all attempting to demonstrate that they are part of the "in-crowd". Although these people can be perceived to be having the time of their lives, it turns out they really have no life at all - and do a great job of indirectly hurting themselves and their family. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a common outcome, and I am guessing that we all may know people like this.

The movie makes you laugh and cry, and really makes you think about those people in your lives that may mask an internal pain, with external friendliness or happiness - maybe even ourselves. I can't imagine a better actress than Sandra Bullock to play this role, and have to say I really enjoyed the intelligence of this movie.

GREAT MOVIE!
