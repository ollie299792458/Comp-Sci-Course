I think that this film made for less money than the cost of a single explosion in the truly horrific film XXX (starring Vin Diesel, who incidentally could have starred in this film, considering its general talent level.)The difference between this film and XXX is deeper than dollars and cents, however.  I walked out of XXX afer 45 minutes.  I have seen this film 37 times.  That total would be much higher, but I foolishly lent it to a cooworker of mine who (understandably) never gave it back.  I miss my movie.  To paraphrase George C. Scott in PATTON: "God, help me, I do miss it so."  From the turkey basting pan (later used by Florence Henderson in her Wesson Oil commercials) that the head is placed in to the chunky strippers having a cat fight on the floor, I miss this film so very much.  Don't read anymore.  Don't wait anymore.  Buy this film and watch it over and over and over again.  If you don't like the film then you are both wrong and irresponsibly stupid.

Nobody like Van Gogh's paintings while he was alive.
