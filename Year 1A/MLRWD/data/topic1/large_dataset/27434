Using entirely archival footage plus the narration of William Shatner, and musical score by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, this award-winning film is a powerful and frightening chronological close-up look at the amazing power of nuclear weapons from previously classified footage.  Included are viewpoints of scientists and officials who made it happen.  I have two versions of this DVD:  the original "Digital Collector's Edition," and this newer "Widescreen edition," also referred to as "The Atomic Bomb Collection 60th Anniversary Diamond Edition."  This widescreen edition has the advantage of being a much sharper-looking release generally than the original.  However, since all the original footage was shot in 4 X 3 aspect ratio, the widescreen edition crops off the top and bottom of the archival footage in order to fill the screen.  This does not usually present any obvious problems.  Further, the widescreen edition does not include the audio only tracks of the great stereophonic score produced by the Moscow Symphony, available on the original release.  The anaglyph 3D portions can be expected work better on a flat screen digital TV than on an analog tube-type TV.
