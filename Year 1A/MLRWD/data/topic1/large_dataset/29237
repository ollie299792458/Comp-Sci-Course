I love Poe -- so much that I use four of his works to teach the reading skill of visualization in my classroom.  I use graphic novels and adapted versions to help my students, but finding video of Poe's work has proved very difficult in the 6 years I have been teaching Poe.  Until I found this movie.  This is an awesome telling of "The Black Cat".  It is almost exactly the story; it even uses some of the exact wording from Poe's writing.  It is visually exciting and the kids LOVED it.  I also love the fact that it is told from the perspective of Poe and how he came about to writing the story "The Black Cat".  It was fun to tell students that there were other of Poe's stories noted in the movie and have them find them ("The Raven" when Poe looks over his dead wife's body and says, "Nevermore"; the eye of the man he is selling his stories to from "the Tell-Tale Heart").

I HIGHLY recommend this movie, as it is almost exactly how Poe told it.  I do want to warn that there are a couple of graphic scenes (when he plucks out the cat's eye, when he buries his axe in his wife's brain)....
