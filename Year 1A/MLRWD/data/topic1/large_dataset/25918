This is yet another example of someone trying so hard to tell a story, yet failing miserably in all aspects. Case in point:  What in the world was Liam Neeson's character supposed to be doing in all the mobster "negotiations"?  Was he a deal broker?  Was he a casual observer?  Was he on the side of the New York Mafia?????? Another observation:  What possible chemistry could be developed between Sandra Bullock and Liam Neeson as she gives him an enema, that would lead them to be lovers?  At one moment, he is writhing on the examination table; the next, the two are intimately involved????????? Lastly:  What was the whole point of the gay Colombian couple, that suddenly surfaces at the end of the movie?  And the whole line about "you should design clothes"??????  Did I miss something here????  At one moment, the man has broken ribs and can barely crawl--we next see him swimming along in the (East??) River....?!?!?! I was ashamed that I had spend the 3 bucks and change for the video rental....Instead, see "Get Shorty" or "Analyze This".
...Shy away from Gun Shy--believe me, you'll be glad you did.
