This movie is so awful, the responsible parties should be punished.  Being a huge Samuel Jackson fan, I took a chance and bought this DVD, figuring at worst, I'd get a good dose of him.  Well, not even SLJ can save this turkey from utter failure on all levels.

The "plot" is completely empty, and hardly worth discussing at length here.  Some surfer dude accidentally sees a gangland execution and becomes a reluctant witness against the mob; they proceed to try and take down his plane from Hawaii to the mainland by stowing a huge assortment of poisonous snakes in the crago hold.  The snakes are freed from their packing case when the pressure-sensitive lock releases at a certain altitude (gee, somehow that missed the cargo inspectors...) Then these snakes slowly make their way through the plane, and the killing and stampeding begin.

You know you are in trouble when the filmmaker sees the need to devote two scene segments to a guy getting trampled in the stampede, and showing a woman's spiked heel plunge into his ear.  I guess when you don't have a plot, you fall back on gruesome sight gags.

There's simply nothing redeeming about this movie.  Samuel Jackson ought to be ashamed of himself.

If it were available commercially, I would recommend the censored version of this movie, because the TV-edited version contains the greatest censored version of a line in the history of film.  I won't give it away, but it occurs near the end when Jackson's character announces that he has had enough.  Seriously, the absurdly hilarious edited line is worth more than the rest of this movie put together.  They should have included it as a bonus scene.
