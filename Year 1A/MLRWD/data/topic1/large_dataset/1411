Here is my take on not just SAW III but all of them. A man who is faced with the concept that he knows he is going to die, an average guy at that, makes a choice. He makes the choice to teach other people a lesson. A lesson about how valuable the gift of life is. So he sets some rules. He never truly sets out to kill anyone. That is the brilliance of the whole series. He puts you in a situation. One where you have to fight for the life you have "wasted away".

He chooses the drug users, rapists, voyeurs, pretty much the lowlifes of society who basically have chosen an ugly life and are just wasting away because it is what they chose. Jigsaw, in his amazing wisdom, asks you either you fight for a better life because of the one you had chosen, or die the way you will be remembered as, a rapist, drug user, murderer, and so on.

The challenge asks you to destroy some of your body but to learn a lesson. The lesson is:

"Why was I put here in the first place?"

Answer: Because of what you chose.

Now he makes you make the ultimate choice, fight to live, or just chose to die.

He wants you to win. He wants you to live. He wants you to realize that you are wasting away, so fix it.

A lot of people would view Jigsaw as a villain, probably one of the most intelligent in movies, not just a hacker and slasher, but in the heart of this, he can be considered a hero too. He wants you to change your life for the better, and avoid forever being condemned for the crimes and choices we all make. He knows someday he will die of something he has no control over. So if you don't have that burden, why push towards an early grave.

He is a hero.

That is what makes these movies amazing. The SAW series isn't your average hacker or slasher, it has deeper meanings.
