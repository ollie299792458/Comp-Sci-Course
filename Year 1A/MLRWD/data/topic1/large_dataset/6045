Just a note about cinematography.  This is the most amazingly natural look in a film that I have ever seen, and to have assisted at a talk given by Conrad Hall it sounsd like he was more pleased with his photography work in this movie than that in "American Beauty" for which he received an oscar for Best Photography. The beauty of this film is that you son't realize how beautiful it is untill you watch it a second time, the first time you're too occupied with the story and the sheer "naturality" of it, but look at it again, look at the scenes in the boy's bedroom, the first time you saw it you were probably induced into thinking that they got the this kid's room in an actual house and just pointed the camera and shot, the second you realize the excruciating care put into lighting this scene. But also, and more importantly, the scenes in the Chess halls, when Ben Kingsley instructs the child the contrasts between background and foreground, dark areas and bright area is absolutely perfect. Just beautiful!
