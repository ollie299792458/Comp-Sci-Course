I think Once Upon a Time in Mexico surprisingly blows away Desperado. It's full of clever stunts and action, interesting characters and a great cast. Johny Depp especially steals the show once again like he did in Pirates of the Carribean. He loves playing strange and un-usual characters and he does it well.  It's hard to tell if he is good or bad but you still root for him. The guy is simply one of the best actors around and could make any movie worth watching. His character has more screen time than El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) but who am I to complain about that because he's great in this movie. 
  I actually expected the movie to be an action/romance movie from the trailers. When you watch it you see that the plot is  just about revenge like Desperado's was. That's ok with me though because the action and Depp's performance just carry you away and you don't care what the plot is. Salma Hayak doesn't get as much screen time as you would think from seeing the previews. She shouldn't of had second billing actually. The movie is full of so many characters that even Antonio Banderas's  El Mariachi seems like just a side character. All the characters and actors that play them are so good though that I didn't care though. I mean you have Johny Depp, William Dafoe (Spiderman), Mickey Rourke,and Ruben Blades and they're all good. The movie is just a total good time. It's supposed to be the last one but it's so damn good that I wouldn't mind a part 4.
