Being a fan of the original NotD i was excited to hear about a remake of this cheesy classic.I avoided teaser trailers and pics at all costs to fully enjoy this when it came out.When the day finally came i rented it and waited for nightfall to come.
 As soon as I popped it in to the main menu i heard cheesy halloween rock music.I somehow had a feeling i was gonna hear it throughout the movie.Turns out I was right.Don't get me wrong I love rock music and if the occasion should rise I will endure the halloween rock as well.But for a movie like this I didn't think it was necessary for the music to be throughout.
 As for the acting I didn't feel very convinced by anyone of the actors or actresses.Except for Linnea Quigley in her deja-vu cameo.That's how bad it was.There are a few ha-ha moments but they are very brief.There is plenty of gore,sex and even drugs if you're into that.But the atmosphere of the movie in general never matched the orignal to the point of almost watching an action movie but with demons.
 All in all I do think that if you seen the original you should give it a try to watch it.But i would STRONGLY recommend renting it.
