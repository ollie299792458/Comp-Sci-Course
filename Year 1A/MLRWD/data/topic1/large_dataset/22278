do not pay attention to the other reviewer. I ACTUALLY AM COMMENTING ON THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I OWN THIS VERSION OF THE FILM. I ALSO OWN THE DVD VERION. #1 the dvd version is inferior to this version. This verson has clarity and sound is amazing. The sound is DTS-MA and sounds amazing. You hear every little "dink" or "dent" in the movie. the video quality is great, beautiful color images and the beggining scene and bright daylight scenes. You have to undestand that the aspect ratio is 1:78:1, that is formatted to fit your flatscreen panel as it should, not 2:35:1 where you have the bars at top and bottom of your screen. Let me tell you the disadvantage of those bars is it in fact takes away from your pixels on your screen. so if you watch a film without the bars you are getting full 1080p/ or 720p, with the bars it cuts into your pixelation (i[...]). Also movies "seven", "boiler room", "A Man Apart", "running Scared" came out looking great and so much better than the dvd versions. I promise you when these titles get released in the U.S.A the picture quality will be identical. Dts-ma sound is the bomb and is the sound master recorded intended fo rthe viewer to hear. dts-hd is the same except it is at a higher bitrate and you may hear a little extra something here and there.
