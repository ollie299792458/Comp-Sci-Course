"Far From Heaven" is the perfect antidote to all those right-wing reactionaries who hold the 1950s as a time of perfect peace and tranquility. As this film clearly shows, for many people the time was "far from heaven". I would say that the main theme of this film is repression. There is the closeted gay husband who is forced to undergo psychiatric treatment in order to cure his "illness" and the interracial friendship that creates such scandal. And nobody ever gets angry (Julianne Moore's character still calls her husband "dear" even after he's hit her)! The way the movie is filmed is worthy of note as well. An emphasis is given to soft colours and hues, as if it were all something out of a women's magazine from the period. The one glaring note in it is the portrayal of the children, particularly the requisite boy and girl of Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid's family. They are little more than caricatures, fresh from a Norman Rockwell painting, saying things such as "Aw shucks!" and "Yes sir." Perhaps that was a deliberate move on the part of the screenwriters and it would be difficult to find time for better characterization, but watching the film it began to irritate me.
