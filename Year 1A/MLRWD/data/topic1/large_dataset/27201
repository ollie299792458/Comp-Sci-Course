I watched this without voiceover commentary, then watched it with Branagh's commentary, and he was so funny in places, it was as good or better than watching the film. Very dry self-deprecating wit here.

It's a nice combination of suspense, humor, and romance, but there are a few flaws near the end that force one to accept things that don't make sense. In other words, you have to have willing suspension of disbelief, or in one case, re-interpret what has happened from the way it originally seemed.  Neither Branagh nor the producer nor the screenwriter seem to satisfactorily explain these in their commentary in the Special Features.

There should be some explananation to the other character or characters if very implausible things happen. For example, one character does something requiring very strong physicality right after being seriously if not fatally wounded! Again, I would not care if this were addressed in the script.

Branagh, Thompson, Jacobi and Robin Williams are all very enjoyable to watch so it's annoying that this insult to the audience was in the film. I still enjoyed it though. Branagh and Thompson do a wonderful job with dual roles using German, American, and
British accents!
