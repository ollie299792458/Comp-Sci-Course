This movie is a love letter to cars, drifting, and Japanese culture (as interpreted by an American).  The plot is a classic Bad Boy Makes Good, with a face-off battle to win in the end.  It's simple, direct, and accomplishes its mission very well.

Other movies in the Fast & The Furious franchise come off as cheesy.  They try to be gritty and realistic, but with poor acting and contrived situations, they end up looking cheap and silly.  Tokyo Drift, on the other hand, takes advantage of a setting foreign enough that the ludicrous elements work well together.  Also, it involves exhibition of more real driving skill than any of the others.

The production value is generally quite high.  Nearly all of it was filmed in the United States, but they did a very impressive job with sets and location selection, such that it really feels like Japan most of the time.  The "Japanese" in the film are primarily a conglomeration of various Asian American ethnicities, but really, it was done so much better than most other mainstream films which contain supposedly Japanese characters (e.g. Memoirs of a Geisha, which featured strong Chinese accents).  The soundtrack is extremely well selected and help keep the tempo up throughout the film.

If you think it's ludicrous that Yakuza mobsters would attend the local high school, or that street racers would have drift-offs in the local parking garage, stop and ask yourself how realistic any show or movie about teens has ever been.
