Join the avant-garde composers, Soviet politburo members, and eccentric millionaires who compulsively watch this movie over and over again because it is the single best movie ever made.  It has the perfect formula:  Submarines + Ice + Rockets + Patrick McGoohan + More Spies + Stunning Landscapes + Ernest Borgnine.  Plus a moral too!  And the most beautiful photography in any spy movie.

McGoohan is fantastic -- playing his standard type of character, but smoother than the original Danger Man, and not as paranoia-inducing as The Prisoner.  And I'll tell you, I had to stop watching the Prisoner, not because I got too paranoid, but because I should have been more paranoid about the REAL dangers around me, and not puzzling over cute philosophical problems of identity.

One recent review here calls it a "guy movie."  Now I'm not sure if that's true, but in my experience I HAVE found women not to appreciate it as much as men.  Yet it isn't crass or trivial like other great guy movies.  It might be -- and I'm sure this isn't "politically correct" -- that women don't see as stark a divide between being the good guy and being the bad guy, between honesty and treachery.  Maybe for good reason!  Maybe being put in a bind all the time means you need to be a bit more flexible.

But the key spy-hunt aspect left all my women-friends that I watched it with cold.  This is even true for the last one who -- honest to goodness -- basically was a spy.  How could a woman who was "dating" me as part of her private investigation business (or partnership, she worked with three others) as a way to get (successfully) incriminating evidence -- how could she fail to get worked up as the noose closes on the TRUE Russian spy?  She fell asleep on the couch.  Whereas even though I've  watched it at least 50 times, my heart pounds anew in the same places.  It's that good a movie.  And with Patrick McGoohan now passed on, it is unlikely that there will ever be a spy movie this good. [59]
