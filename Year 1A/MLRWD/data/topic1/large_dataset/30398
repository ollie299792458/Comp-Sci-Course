Don was the initial appeal for me in this movie to begin with. He literally carries the backbone of the whole movie. But thats just my opinion. The movie of course as you already know takes place in Brooklyn the one and only. And this movie takes on a trinity sight theme where the movie revolves around the points of view of three men all living working and interracting amongst each other without actually knowing of each others' existance (to a point anyway). There is a build up of little moments where one person's actions are shown and involve an effect on another character's actions.

Theres a lot of action in this movie. To the point where it is ruthless and it definitely delivers at the end. The characters are very deep, emotional and complex ( while still remaining their sense of masculinity(sp). Within the storyline) You can actually feel for these men and their problems and their agendas. there is the undercover, the hasbeen, and the religious crook .

Each actor delivers their role excellently.
