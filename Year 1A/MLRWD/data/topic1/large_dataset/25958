The plot is all about Nick(Mel Gibson--who has never thought about how women think) has an adventure into the women's mind. Nicky used to be a man's man (a man who is admired by other men, and who never think about how women feel). Somehow, he changes after obtainning a kind of skill that he can listen what women think).
Nicky works for an ad agency. He thought he would be promoted. However, his boss is concerned that the domination of the maket is all about women. Therefore, Darcy (Halen Hunt) was hired to be a creative director instead of him since she is a woman. After he got that special skill, he trys to get rid of Darcy. (Indeed, he wants to be a creative director) However, the more he learns about her, the more he loves her and understands her.
There are 3 subplots in the movies--about his love life with Darcy, his daugther(Alex), and a girl (Erin) who is always sad and upset.
These plots are all good. Especially, the last one (about Erin) reminds me that I used to be like her.
If you have time, this is a good movie. It's worth watching.
