When "Driven" was announced as a cutting edge, behind-the-scenes look at the world of Formula 1, I was fairly interested. My hopes were somewhat dashed when I heard Stallone would be the movie's creative engine. Needless to say my optimism was not restored when viewing the final product (free, thank God), which had somehow mutated into a melodramatic, contrived, and unintentionally funny action (?) movie grafted onto something vaguely resembling the CART circuit. "Driven" is of value purely for the accidental laughs it incites, featuring announcers who seem to be less than familiar with their jobs or the typical spectator's intelligence ("One of the keys of winning these races is knowing when to make a pit stop...") and a wheelchair-bound Burt Reynolds, sporting about four inches of makeup on his face. Not only that, but we are also subjected to very little raw racing footage and more of the same badly done CGI that makes about half the film resemble a Playstation game, right down to the false tension and generic aggro-rawk blasted loudly in the background. Starting off with a concept that had serious promise, "Driven" arrives with a whimper, coming off as nothing more than a flailing attempt to entertain and teach a NASCAR-crazed America that there's more to speed than stock cars.
