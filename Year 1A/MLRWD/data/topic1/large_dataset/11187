This is, very simply, one of the funniest shows on TV. More and bigger laughs than The Simpsons, and more offensive than South Park, Drawn Together has a good chance of being your favourite, or most hated, TV show ever... seriously.

 The premise is simple: Drawn Together takes wildly exaggerated stereotypical cartoon characters and puts them together in the world's first animated reality TV show. Hilarity ensues. Everyone will have their own favourite form the eight diverse characters, who include Clara, a bigoted fairytale princess, Foxxy Love, a sassy black mystery-solving musician, Captain Hero,an immoral super hero, Xandir, a gay video game adventurer and Toot, a self-harming, overwieght 20's sex symbol. But I suspect most viewers will find that Ling-Ling, a homicidal japanese battle-monster a la Pikachu, steals the show.

 Plots range from Xandir's coming out party to Foxxy opening up Clara's bigoted mind (and mouth) with a musical kiss in the hot tub. Some viewers will be shocked by just how far this program dares to go; one example of many is the scene in which a Vietnamese sweatshop child and his fifty siblings morph into a giant robot. But if, like the program makers, you don't take any of it seriously, you'll find yourself laughing til the tears run down your face.
