catherine deneuve was great in 'Belle du jour'.Here she plays what she is -a classy beautiful woman and the film was sexy too.She seems to be miscast in this film.The woman she plays breaks down into a dis-associated pyscho but apart from looking mournfully beautiful throughout she just doesn't add any other dimensions to the role.Her eyes never look dis-associated- more alarmed and dreamy.So wooden acting.I watched and kept lamenting that the industry no doubt by passes by many talented actresses because they don't have perfect eyes,lips,cheek-bones,nose.Obviously many roles require beautiful actresses-movies are escapism after all-i just wish they weren't cast when beauty not particularly required.It would have been enough for Deneuve's character to have been fragile and abit too vunerable attracting a certain type of predatory man and her paranoias of this.Indeed her boyfriend leans this way-apart from whining and trying to kiss her he doesn't seem to make enough effort to get inside her head:She's a blank slate to foist himself upon.This could have been a great film with a demanding role for an actress with more acting depth and versatilty.But it was't.Dissappointing.
