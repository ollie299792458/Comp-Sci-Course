I am an avid watcher of movies, and "Narc" is one of the best cop films I have ever seen. Unlike most of its big-budget Hollywood counterparts, this film shows what I feel is a gritty and accurate account of what it is like to be a cop. Ray Liotta and Jason Patric play their roles to perfection, and since they are both such great actors they are able to play off each other to make their characters' shaky relationship work well.

Aside from the great, natural dialogue and excellent plotline, one of the things that I thought made this movie better than the standard cop flick is that the two main characters were actually made to LOOK like cops. Ray Liotta gained 25 pounds and wore a fat suit to give his character a more realistic, aged look, and Jason Patric looked sufficiently scuzzy, as he was portraying an undercover narcotics detective who was required to look like a criminal. What most Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to realize is that real cops don't look like Colin Farrell or Josh Hartnett, they look like real people who don't have the benefit of make-up artists and hair stylists, nor do they necessarily look like Playgirl centerfolds.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a change from mindless big-budget explosion-fests like "SWAT" or "Bad Boys."
