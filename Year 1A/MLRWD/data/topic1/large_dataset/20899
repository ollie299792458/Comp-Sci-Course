This is a Spielberg movie that came out before Schindler's List, and I wonder if that has something to do with the lack of critical respect that it deserved. While it had some of the classic Spielberg whimsy and flash, the storyline and acting were excellent. Though not on par with the likes of Out of Africa and a A Passage to India, there is something in this movie that is just as epic as those two films. Christian Bale's performance was amazing; nothing like the films that he is known for these days. John Williams soundtrack for this movie is one of his best.

This movie was filmed in Shanghai in the 1980s - before China's economic boom - and in the extras of the DVD version that I own Spielberg notes that they couldn't as easily replicate World War II China with a 2000's Shanghai as the could with the way it looked in the 1980s. Europeans caught in between the Chinese and Japanese during World War II is an interesting aspect of the movie, duplicated somewhat in a more recent movie The White Countess.

I can't help but think that if this movie had been made after Schindler's List that it might have received a lot more acclaim. It really is a good film and I highly recommend it.
