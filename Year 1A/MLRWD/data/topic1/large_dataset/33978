...Many reviews here... cover most of the ground.  I thought that I would make a few comments on some other issues involved...

...First, Hollywood tried to destroy this film... They wanted to cast Van Johnson in the lead role!  A decade before Johnson looked too old to play the role... and otherwise a hideous miscasting... Murphy still looked like a kid a decade after the fact (check out Google for WWII photos of Murphy to see just how much like a child he really looked)

...Murphy had blown most of the money that he had made in Hollywood... bad loans, investments... other...  He had a strong feeling that this was the role of a lifetime with some of the best money...  For once he disciplined himself and used the money from this film wisely...

...Murphy made countless "B" westerns (his comment was, "Same westerns... different horses...")  But he could act when given decent material... in an "A" western as Jimmy Stewart's kid brother... and most notably with Bill Mauldin (look it up) in The Red Badge of Courage.
