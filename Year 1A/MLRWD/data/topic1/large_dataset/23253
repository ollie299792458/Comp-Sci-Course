This film is important, as it was the first mainstream attempt to educate America about the horrors of the African Holocaust. My ancestors were brought to America against their will, but I don't call myself an African-American, but an African-IN-America, and I will do so until I get my reparations and restitution.

"Roots" is a bit watered down. It wanted to instill pride in Africans here, but also wake up the conscience of white Americans, without making them TOO upset, so of course there are plenty of "good" whites, like Mike Brady and Ed Asner. And Africans like Louis Gossett Jr. are more accepting of the slave system. Now I know this was true, but I just wish the show would have more of the Nat Turner anger, as that was another facet of the slave experience which is only alluded to here.

The actors are mostly outstanding. Lavar Burton perfectly captures the confusion, rage and innocence our magnificent warrior ancestors must have felt during the long middle passage. I was pleased to see our High Priestess, Dr. Maya Angelou, in a cameo back in Africa. She is the soul and heartbeat of our people!
