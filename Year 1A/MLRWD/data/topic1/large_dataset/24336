This review is only on the Deluxe Edition, Iam not taking anything away from Ladies And Gentleman The Rolling Stones which I would give 5 Stars. My issue is with the Third Disc, which is the only reason I bought this Deluxe Edition. I feel that Eagle Rock could I have put a lot more effort into the 3rd disc which any Stones fan would feel ripped off.Eagle Rock should have  watched  the Bootleg copy from 4 Reel Produtions of ladies and Gentleman first to see what Stones fans may have wanted.Eagle Rock put (NO EFFORT INTO THE 3rd DISC). I was really looking forward to seeing the (whole) Dick Cavett show, Eagle Rock cut the backstage footage and on top of that they didnot include the footage of the opening song which was Brown Sugar and the closing song Street Fighting Man. They only showed the interviews with Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman, the live performances were cut out!!! I know there is plenty of outakes of live performances from the 1972 tour which should have been included with this deluxe edition.
Again am not taking anything away from Ladies and Gentleman, I dont want to see anyone waste there money on this Deluxe Edition!!!! (Just Buy The Single Disc)
