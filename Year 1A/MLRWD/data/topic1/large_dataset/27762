This was the first video that we bought for our daughter when she was less than 6 months old.  When we first started to play it I was very disappointed.  To an adult, it seems like it's just a bunch of video shots of toys in motion, with music in the background.  To my surprise, my daughter loved it.  She was fascinated by it and looked forward to watching it every evening.  The movement, colors, and music really held her attention and she never tired of watching it.  About the time she turned one she did seem to lose interest in it and preferred other videos.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a very young child.
The only negative about it is that there is a commentary at the end of the tape where the producers make various claims about how listening to Mozart's music can boost a child's IQ and other abilities.  Most research that I've read indicates that these benefits are overstated or nonexistent.  Buy the tape because it's fun, not because it will turn your child into a genius.
