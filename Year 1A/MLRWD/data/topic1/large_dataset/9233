Are you a college kid or under the age of thirty, like me? If so, let me tell you a little about how this wonderful miniseries has gotten me hooked! I was only one when it came out on ABC over Holy Week 1983. I had some free time over this Summer of 2003, and watched this miniseries in its entirety. At first, before the experience, I did not know what to think. Afterward, I was hooked and bought the whole VHS box set to add to my unique movie collection.
When I came back to school, (a Catholic school mind you) and brought my tapes back, all my friends watched and now everyone of them is in line to get the DVD this Tuesday (Feb 3rd, 2004), including me. I want it for the special interviews with the cast. Like Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward, who are married for 20 years and have three kids. They met on the set and fell in love. Since both of their acting careers are not what they used to be, it will be awesome to see their viewpoints on the show almost twenty-one years after the fact.
Passion, sex, drama and suspense. You'll find it all here. Watch the passion build until the third part where Meggie's and Father Ralph's relationship is consummated. Watch the tragedy and the ectasy they go through. Trust me Gen Y'ers, this will top any Dawson's Creek, 90210, or the O.C. that you've ever seen. Our parents made this the second-rated all time miniseries ever. Find out the reason why. 
Heck,..., how can you go wrong?
