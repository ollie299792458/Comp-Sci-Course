Although I am a big fan of Japanese Animation, one doesn't have to be to enjoy Princess Mononoke (also known a Mononoke Hime). There is certainly a reason why this film is Japan's top grossing film ever, not just animated film, film period. 
Mononoke has a fabulous story line, set in Fuedal Japan, this movie is primarily about the struggle between nature and man in an industrialising world. It doesn't limit itself to that though, another main theme is dealing with conflicts and hatred. I really respected the way that the characters were represented. Since I consider myself close to nature, I naturally felt more sympathy for San (who is the Princess Mononoke), and the forest gods. However, her enemy, Lady Eboshi, was by no means an evil character, and was very good to people, such as the lepers that she cared for. This emphisised that there is no firm line between good and evil, and theme that I always like to see in movies.
The animation of the characters, and especially the sceney was incredible. No animated movie has ever posessed such quality in my opinion, Disney and other american companies pale greatly in comparrison.
I have shown this movie to many of my friends, most all of whom are not fans of animated movies, and not one has thought it anythign but spectacular. This film is not only one of the greatest animated movies of all time, or one of the greatest foreign movies of all time, it is possibly the greatest film of any kind, ever.
