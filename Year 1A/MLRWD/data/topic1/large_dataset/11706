The Wall is probably one of the greatest rock-&amp;-roll movies of all time.  It tells the story of a character named Pink(The name is sorta a joke about the name of the band Pink Floyd.).  Pink's childhood was a  traumatic one, his father died in W.W.2 and was raised by an over  protective mom and was beaten by his school teacher.  Later he became a  rock star and got married to a wife that cheated on him.  The movie shows  how Pink completes his "wall" that he started as a kid. This  "Wall" would shut him off from harsh reality and make him  "Comfortably Numb".  "The Wall is a stunning film filled  with intense and striking visuals and animation.  One such scene shows an  anmated dove exploding into a german eagle or a British flag collapsing to  make a bloody cross during the song "Good bye blue sky".  It's  amazing soundtrack will have a firm grip on you as you watch.  The high  ammount of symbolism will also keep you thinking.  The interesting thing is  that "The Wall" is based on the life story of it's composer Roger  Waters.  If you love the film "Tommy" you'll love Pink Floyds The  Wall. -Ren
