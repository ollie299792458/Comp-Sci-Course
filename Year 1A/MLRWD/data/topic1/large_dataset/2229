Showtime, who produced the long running, honest series Queer as Folk, continues to break new ground in the GLBT world with the amazing series, The L Word. Focusing on a group of women friends living in LA, this show is not about being lesbian, rather it as about life, love, and relationships that span the sexual spectrum.

It's difficult to build on the success of the first season, and season 2 for the most part starts out slowly. Tina has retained a high power attorney and is suing for support, while hiding her pregnancy from Bette. Bette is spiraling deeper into her own private hell. Jenny moves in with Shane and Shane meets a new girl, Carmen, who quickly impacts both their lives. Dana is still with the overbearing Tanya, but has trouble resisting her attraction to a lovestruck Alice. Kit seems to be the only one doing well, as she is able to purchase the Planet. As the season progresses, things get darker. More about Jenny's traumatic past is being revealed through flashbacks, Bette is forced to watch Tina with another woman, who coincedently is the woman who rejected her grant, causing her problems at the CAC. Ollie, Kit and Bette's father, is dying. Shane attempts to fight her unexpected love for Carmen, who is dating Jenny. What brings some light to this darker season is the interplay between Dana and Alice. They are sweet, sexy, and just so damn adorable together.

The usual panapoly of celebrity guest stars appear, including a fabulous Camryn Mannheim. Others incluide Sandra Bernhard, Kelly Lynch, Melissa Rivers, and Arianna Huffington. Overall, this season is solid. It sets up for an interesting third season, and the addition of Carmen is like a breath of fresh air. This season may have been darker, but then again, so is life, which is why this show feels so real.
