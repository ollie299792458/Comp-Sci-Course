This Robin is older and looks more like a grown up Greg Brady than Robin Hood, and he certainly doesn't look, and isn't, very athletic.  And he is not particularly charming or charismatic.  In short, he isn't my idea of Robin Hood.  That I could forgive if he could act, but he mostly grimaces makng odd faces.  Uma Thurman makes a fine looking maid marian, but her acting, as well as most of the other majors, is horrifically hammy and not very good.  I realize in today's society we do not care or even see good acting much, so it's probably a non issue for most people.  I give an A to the sets and the photography and costumes, of course.  I love the historical accuracy as far as the sets and costumes, but historical accuracy can only take you so far.  I hate to be harsh on the artistic work of anyone, it feels wrong.

But having just seen what is for me, the definitive Robin Hood, the 2006-2009 BBC series, there is no comparison.  The BBC series is probably the most INaccurate production of Robin Hood ever, Robin wears a hoodie, speaks with a perfect Lancashire accent, modern day terms are sprinkled everywhere, Little John can be seen to be wearing jeans, and everything has been made accessible to a modern day audience by design.  In short, before I watched it I was sure I would hate it.  I never thought a TV series so designed would be more enthralling than one that was historically accurate, but it is.

Don't get me wrong, this version isn't terrible, and is certainly better than the simply atrocious Prince of Thieves, but the acting is still not top notch.  No good acting = no believability, historical accuracy nonwithstanding.  I cannot recommend it.
