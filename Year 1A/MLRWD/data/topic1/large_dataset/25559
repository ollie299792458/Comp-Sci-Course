Well, you know the rest. That's the great thing about this movie, it's uplifting and entertaining. Makes you want to believe a man can fly (hence the tagline used in the original promotional campaign). And what this DVD does best is show you how they did that. Three full-length documentaries take you back to 1977, when there was no CGI and computer animation to create breathtaking stunts in mere days. Back then you had to do it with blue screens, wires, gimbals, some trick photography, and months of work (the film took two years to make), and still you had to cross your fingers that the result would turn out right. It's truly fascinating to see how different things were and how well they pulled it off. Other bonuses are the screen tests featuring actors such as Stockard Channing and Lesley Ann Warren reading for the part of Lois Lane, as well as a young and skinny kid named Christopher Reeve in his first screen test in the red and blue suit. The documentaries also feature present-day interviews with the director, special effects crew, and the actors. If you saw this movie when it was on TV in the early '80s you'll remember most of the additional 8 minutes of footage (including the "gauntlet" where Lex Luthor tries to shoot, burn and freeze Superman, to no avail). I do somehow remember some more scenes which are not here, such as Otis wiping his arm across his forehead and smearing the missle codes (which is why he messes them up) but two additional scenes are provided which are not integrated into the movie: Otis feeding Luthor's "pets" (whatever they are), and Superman rescuing Miss Tesmacher from same "pets" after saving Lois. The audio quality is incredible, and the video is crisp and clear (which, unfortunately, tends to highlight the limitations of the blue screen technique). The disc is double-sided, with the documentaries and screen tests on "side B" (although it is not so marked which can be annoying). Overall this is a great addition to any DVD collection.
