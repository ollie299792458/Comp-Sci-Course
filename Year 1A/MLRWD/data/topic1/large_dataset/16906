Take a simple bet to go from Georgia to Texarkana and back in 28 hours with an 18-wheeler.  Add in 400 cases of illegal Corrs beer being transported across multiple state lines.  Enter Burt Reynolds driving a black T-top to run blocker giving law enforcement from Texas to Georgia the chase of a lifetime.  Let Jackie Gleason (Sheriff Buford T. Justice) give chase to Renyolds while giving everyone else lip.  Mix with Jerry Reed's singing and you've got a smash hit movie.
It may surprise some to learn that the only movie to beat Smokey and the Bandit at the box office in the year of its release was Star Wars.  There's a reason the movie was successful and that is simply because it's such a fun ride.
If you like car chases that always result in destruction, trucking, CB radios, outrageous sheriffs, sarcasm, country music, bar fights, or any combination of the above, then you will likely enjoy this movie.
Jackie Gleason steals the show on this one.  Eager to work in movies again at the time, he worked for a lower salary so the director/producers would give him more lattitude with his character.  The result was a lawman no one in their right mind would ever want to run into and you have to see the movie to really appreciate it.
The movie was made in a different era, so don't expect it to be exactly PC.  There are one or two moments of racist/sexist/whatever overtones, but they are mostly the rantings of the out-of-his-mind sheriff engaged in a nine-hundred mile hot pursuit, and it's strictly for comedic effect.  I don't believe that most people (other than actual law enforcement) would find this movie offensive.
