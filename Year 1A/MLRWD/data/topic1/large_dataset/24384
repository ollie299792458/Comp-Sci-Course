Gandhi has been widely recognized by many world-wide as a worshipful tribute to one of the 20th century's greatest leaders. The film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming Gandhi's complex life story "No man's life can be encompassed in one telling... least of all Gandhi's, whose passage through life was so entwined with his nation's struggle for freedom. There is no way to give each event its allotted weight, to recount the deeds and sacrifices of all the great men and women to whom he and India owe such immense debts. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record of his journey, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man." The film begins with Gandhi's assassination on January 30, 1948, and his funeral. After an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. Gandhi was highly portrayed as private and humble man, a thing which was so well exemplified by the actor playing Gandhi. The actor truly reflected the tender care of Gandhi. His dialogue is not extensive, nor does he engage in long, rambling speeches. His eyes speak humility, his movements speak love. He is the embodiment of everything Gandhi was, or was supposed to have been, without the need for showy displays of acting talent or loudly proclaimed diatribes.
The political story told by Ganhi seemed pretty unintelligible to me, and I never got much of a sense of what Gandhi was like as a man. But I don't believe Attenborough had much interest in those aspects of the story; I think he wanted to tell an inspirational tale about one of the most unusual men in world history. As U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall said, "Mahatma Gandhi has become the spokesman for the conscience of all mankind. He was a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than Empires."
