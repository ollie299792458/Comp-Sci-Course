What a touching movie.This movie star's Denzel Washington(a terrific actor ), he plays the role of a caring father that would sacrifice his life for his son.
John Q. lives a normal life with his wife and 9 year old son.John's whole life is about to change all at his son's baseball game.at the game he uncovers that his son has a physical problem.he rushes his son to the hospital.the doctors tell him that his son has a deadly heart disease and  will need a heart transplant.JOhn will stop at nothing to get a  heart fof his son.It will cost  $250,000 to do the surgery the down payment is $75,000 ,he cant come up with that amount of money.He makes many sacrifices but still does not even come close to that amount of money.
He decides to keep the heart surgeon hostage untill they put his sons name on the donors list.he ends up with the whole hospital hostage,all of this is happening while his son is dying
This movie has a great story and a terrific ending.Their were  short scenes of a woman in a car accident she ties up with the whole story at the end.the interesting thing about this movie is that it is a true story!
a great quote is when John wants to kill himself because the chances for his son's heart is coming out pretty slim he says "I will die, but my son will live......"
