Yes, this film is a long one, but it does have a story worthy of its length.  This film unravels just like the great American novel, with characters you grow to love, and a culture you just might wind up understanding.  This film is a prime example of European traditions and perspectives, primarily Italian.  Communism vs. Fascism, when viewed from the peasant worker's point of view, Communism is the lesser of the two evils; while viewed from the wealthy land owners perspective, Fascism offers a defense against rising peasant rebellion.

This movie actually does a pretty good job at illustrating the heated political environment that enveloped Italy from 1900 to 1945.  The impossible situations our protagonists are plummeted into, placing their life-long friendships into dire peril as circumstance raises its ugly head to strike venom into their hearts, forever making them enemies at two sides of a bitter war that would wage for half a century.

Alot of heat has been generated by this movie, primarily of its rustic and frank depiction of human sexuality.  I find the sex in this movie to be completely natural and realistic; as opposed to our Hollywood conception of simulated perversions, this film actually depicts sex in its mundane and normal practice.  No scene is pornographic, and the European bluntness of its nudity is a refreshing change from the toxic exploitation our American culture has us saturated in.

Give this film a chance, I promise you that you will not regret it!  Keep an open mind as to other cultural perspectives and you will find an entirely different approach to the human experience than has thus been taught to you by American public education systems.
