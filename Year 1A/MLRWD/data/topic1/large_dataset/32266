I had searched high and low for years for the next hidden great classic sci-fi film for me to watch and I finally found it right under my nose.

Enemy Mine and me go way back...way, back to the first time I saw it on cable back when I was barely a teen and changed the channel after only attempting to watch only a few minutes of it. Since then, every time I saw it on cable, I would change the channel shortly thereafter. I used to wonder why it seem to have always pop up every now and again either in name or display. After watching it tonight, I discovered why.

It is a great film.

When I first saw it, I could not appreciate what makes this film so great, a story of loyalty, friendship, and good characters. This film is not your high speed  space chase with with lasers blasting all over the screen and I think this is why I never gave the film a chance initially but I am glad I did tonight. The second half of teh film really gets even more interesting and was pretty moving.  Great job by Louis Gossett Jr. and Dennis Quaid.

I highly recommend this film. Forget that the special effects are dated and just enjoy the characters and story.
