The first time I watched The Cell on DVD I wasn't very impressed and lent it to some friends to watch. However, with each subsequent viewing I have grown to like it more and more. I finally realised how powerful some of the imagery in the film is when I had a night of 'Cell' style dreams that were obviously influenced by the movie. Now that is saying something - I can't remember the last time a movie made such an impact on my subconcious! I've had a DVD player since Christmas and so have been rather gluttonous buying discs which means I've sat through a lot of Hollywood guff since then. What's refreshing about The Cell is that it looks like no other movie to come out of Hollywood before. So the story is not the most original - it's still more original than the majority of tripe coming out of the big studios. The DVD itself is top notch - some great extras - especially the special effects pieces that allow you to watch interviews with the creative talents behind the movie and flick between 2 more angles of footage and storyboards. There's also a nice little feature and a couple of commentary tracks. It is obvious from all involved that they enjoyed their experiences making this movie. Ok so it's not the best movie of all time but it's certainly one of the best to come out of Hollywood last year for me. Obviously not everyone's cup of tea but this is recommended to anyone who loves creepy surreal horror, lush visuals and especially anyone interested in the digital arts and moviemaking in general. I look forward to Tarsem's next offering.
