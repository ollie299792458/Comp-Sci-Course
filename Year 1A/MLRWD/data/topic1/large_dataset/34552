This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen in a very, very long time. All the movies lately that I have been watching have very stupid endings. I don't like to be on the edge of my seat and then get let down at the end. But with this movie, you had all kinds of different emotions for it. I cried, I laughed, I even got mad. But that was the good thing about the movie, it kept you on your toes.
Besides I love Eminem's singing, actually what he sings about. He sings for real, about real life and that is what I like so much about him. No offense to him. But I am not one of those crazed fans who would trip all over him because he is a star. But I am one of those fans who admires his talent and mind so much, that it would be an awesome opprotunity to shake his hand and tell him how proud of him I am and how much his words mean to me. The director of this movie knew what he was doing when he cast Eminem for the part.
I congratulate everyone in this movie and that had anything to do with this movie on their awesome work. I would watch this movie over and over again and not get sick of it. There are not to many movies out there like this one anymore, that could get me to want to do that.
I hope everyone else likes it as much as I did!
Yours truely: Nanci!
