This is the movie that got me hooked on Soderbergh.  From the freeze frame of George Clooney slamming his tie into the ground in the first scene I was hooked on this movie and this director.  It's stylish but not overly-arty; in a twist of typical hollywood conventions the style helps convey characters thoughts and emotions rather than just showing off.  The plot revolves around the romance of a male bank robber and a female federal marshal.  Clooney and Lopez show staggering chemistry that makes other on-screen couples seem tepid and worthless.  The intricies of the plot are too many and varied to go into, but it's a fractured narrative that has quite a few threads that get all wrapped up.  It's extremely entertaining the entire way through.  There isn't an extraneous scene, everything needs to be in there.  It's a beautiful film that I still watch regularly and it only gets better.  The last thing is that I miss Jennifer Lopez in movies, she is so cool.  Everytime someone says she is a horrible actress to me, I ask "Have you seen Out of Sight" the answer is always no.  She has been overshadowed by her music career and thats a shame.  This is still Soderbergh's best, it isn't as insanely pretentious and preachy as Traffic and not as overwrought as Erin Brockovich, and I won't even go into Ocean's Eleven which is good but frivolous.  All in all, just buy it and buy it now.
