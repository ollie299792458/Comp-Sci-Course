This movie takes a look at the fear and paranoia that was present during the mid-50's, and many people will find that extremely surprising.  We tend to think of the 50's as the Good Old Days, when everybody was happy, wearing their school sweaters, going to sock-hops and driving cool cars.  Not so.  "Blackboard Jungle" is an eye-opening snapshot of the class warfare (including women!) and racial strife (including Hispanics!) that was eating away at the overall good fortune that most of postwar America generally enjoyed.  These were the beginnings of the disenfranchised youth who became the iconic juvenile delinquents (but nothing like Fonzie) and paved the way for similar movies about hot-rods to hell, motorcycle gangs, and James Dean's work.  And in my opinion...all this paved the way for the Beatnik era and then the Sixties hippie culture, but I digress.

The actors and actresses (future stars!!) are good and realistic, the storyline is taut, and the setting (Anytown, USA) is depressing, just as it should be.  It's both a movie and a documentary, but it's not silly and campy like "Reefer Madness" and some of the other youth-culture flicks of the era.

I highly recommend this movie.  You've never seen anything like it.
