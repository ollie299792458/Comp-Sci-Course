Due to the personal problems that Jay North had with the series as well as copyright issues has kept the series from being seen. Just like with the Patty Duke Show, its star had issues as shown by her two autobiographies. I tried contactin Patty by email but never heard back. I remember well the interviews that Jay North gave and in particular with Phil Donohue where he told how much he hated the series and that his TV Parents loved him more than his real Parents. Originally, I believe the new Attenae TV Channel, launching at midnight said they were going to show it but it was not on their released schedule. I will enjoy seeing it again. I can understand how Mr.North feels but I believe he had to sign-off before the DVDs could be made. For some reason a lot of the older shows hold up better than current programs because as Carl Reiner said of the original Dick Van Dyke show the material did not feature current event themed episodes. The exception to this rule was The Cosby Show, that featured episodes about the death of Dr. Martin Luther King and the Black Baseball League. It contrasted how these events affected the Huxtible family. As to the question about some of the classic tv shows like Leave it to Beaver and My Three Sons not being uncut again it might be needing to the actors signing off and rights vs. public domain. Enjoy the shows and be glad they are back in some form.
