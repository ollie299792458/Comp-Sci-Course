I haven't watched this movie, but just reading its plot on wikipedia, I hate it.  I just hate how movie producers all have to link everything to sex and lust as if there is nothing else better.  To me, piano music is sacred, or at least it feels that way.  It brings more content than bodily pleasure.  It brings more than what a movie can portray, and so instead, they have to use sex appeal to entertain the audience.  I liked the main piano theme.  In fact, it was because I was looking for the song that I was linked to the movie.  But after learning the title of the song and learning about what this movie is about.  It just really make me wanted to throw up.  It makes me disgusted to have this song stained under such a title.  What more, the piano in the movie was to be chopped by an axe and the pianist index finger chopped off as well.  That's a nightmare to anyone who plays piano.  Why would I wanna watch that sick scene?!

If you're interested in piano.  Go listen to the real piano music.  Go play the piano.  Don't just "watch it", and definitely don't watch this movie!
