Y'all the criticism ain 't nothin' new...Now I'm 30-sumpin' years old and I 'member when Prince came out with Purple Rain...and the actin' was boo-boo..but we didn't go to see no academy-award type acting...we went to see PRINCE and the Revolution and THE TIME do the dang thing...and we got what we went for...and the movie was still a hit! same here...dem dere boiyz ripped the screen with that dancing...and I mean e'erybody ('cept lil saint and the girlfriends)...I agree that the plot coulda been a lil thicker had it not been watered down with the drug-money junk and killin' off the lil' dude (that was just unnecessary drama)...i coulda even tolerated the lovey-dovey (that's just good formula, we females need the love story)...but over-all it's about that dancin'! The dancin' took me back to my teens when breakin' and poppin' was all about it. It thrilled me to take my 11-yr-old son and show him...it reminded me how we used to kick it like that back in the day! I was dancing in my seat! And I will have this one in my DVD rack along with Purple Rain. "Save the last dance" was an actor's movie with a lil' bit of dancin' (and it ain't on my DVD rack) but this here is a Dancer's flick...period...actin' be doggone.
