I liked the first Rush Hour a lot.  The second one wasn't as fantastic but since they changed the location it made things kind of fresh.  I think they went for the same formula on the third one by taking them to France after being in LA for a while but it just wasn't entertaining.

Sure, there were a few spots of humor here and there.  When a French cab drivers insults Halle Barry in front of Chris Tucker his reaction made me laugh out loud.  However, this movie just never grabbed me.

To be honest, this reminds me of this great teacher I had.  When I first took his class he was funny and entertaining.  What made him really stand out was his great repertoire of one-liners that had the classroom rolling.  So when he was teaching another class I was excited to sign up and found that his silliness started wearing off on me and his "great repertoire" was actually the same old jokes from the previous class.  Though there wasn't anything different, it was just boring anyways.

This movie is like that.  There wasn't anything to keep this fresh, it was just a rehashing of the first two movies again.  Even references to "Mu shoo" were there like the makers thought we would still be laughing at that joke.  Come on, its old now.  The only thing they did to try and keep this fresh was filming it in Europe but I think this movie needed more.  Even Shrek needed to bring in new sidekicks to keep things fresh.

In the end, I never finished this movie.  Halfway though my son asked me if I wanted to play Guitar Hero and I thought that would be more entertaining.  After a few days I realized I never finished the movie and then realized again I had no desire to.

Unless Rush Hour still tickles your fancy I'd just avoid this one.  Others described it as watchable and I think that is the nicest thing I can say about this movie.  I mean, it wasn't horrible it just wasn't good.
