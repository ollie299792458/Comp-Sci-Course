There is not a bus large enough to throw this film under.  It qualifies as a Drive In second feature when the fourth film playing is the one you paid to see.

Dialogue is incredibly poor.  Written at a third grade level, this movie danced around the homosexual side story while continually pandering an ongoing three person relationship.  While these two ideas are irrelavent to the main story of law breakers dealing out justice to one another they become annoying through redundancy.

Benicio Del Toro, who is both capable and always worth watching, could not draw this bucket of trash movie back from the abyss.  Taylor Kitsch fans have another performance to enjoy but his character is not sympathetic. Selma Hayak, at the waning end of her sex appeal, fared no better with this script writers poor attempts at dialogue.

This should be the last time Oliver Stone is given money to put a film together.  This 28th attempt at entertaining us has fallen far short of the mark as to aggrivate all the viewers in the theater,

Seriously, save two hours valuable hours in your life by refusing to waiste them watching this.
