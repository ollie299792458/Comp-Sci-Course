There are really two parts to this film.

The first one is a beach and underwater film with the characters portrayed by Paul Walker and Jessica Alba.  If you look at the cover of the blu-ray, that picture is worth a thousand words, and that's pretty much the first part of the film.  This blu-ray also features Scott Caan, from the current TV series "Hawaii Five-O".  It's a fairly peaceful life on an island paradise.

The second part of the film involves discovery, temptation, guile, violence, guns,  danger, betrayal, and death.  You also have the introduction of a bunch of crazy, nasty, wicked, vile and murderous characters.  Who wants to watch all the gore and pain?  Sometimes, you just don't want to see blood everywhere.

You can summarize it as a Garden of Eden theme, with knowledge, temptation, and a fall from Grace, sending them from a peaceful paradise into a twisted hell.

Needless to say, I prefer the first part.  I give five stars for the first part and just ignore the second part.
