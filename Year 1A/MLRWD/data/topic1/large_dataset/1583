A vivid and well-acted display that is only enhanced by DVD. A controversial film in its day (it was written by blacklisted writers), it survives today as a classic and one of the best films of both Kirk Douglas  and Stanley Kubrick.
Based on the true story of a slave rebellion that  rocked the foundations of Rome itself, the picture follows the life of  slave Spartacus (Douglas) from the rock quarries where he continuously  attacks guards to the gladiator arenas to a final battle against a superior  Roman army. The supporting cast includes Peter Ustinov (Best Supporting  Actor), Anthony Hopkins, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier and  Woody Strode, who provides the films pivotal scene. Strode, as Ethiopian  slave Draba, battles Spartacus in the arena, but refuses to kill him,  instead choosing to attack the Romans. His sacrifice prompts Spartacus to  lead the slaves in rebellion. The fight scene had to be rehearsed for six  weeks by Strode and Kubrick. All the hits and bruises are real. Even the  scene where Strode cuts Douglas with the tip of his trident is real,  requiring Strode to get it just right without opening Douglas up from  kidney to kidney.
All in all, a great movie spectacle. Enjoyable on VHS,  it is much better on DVD.
