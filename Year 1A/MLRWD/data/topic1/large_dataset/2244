This "30th anniversary edition" of "Night of the Living Dead" is obviously somebody's idea of a joke.  The print is marvelous.  The new scenes and new music, however, destroy the mood and pace of the movie--a movie that was pretty much without a plot to begin with.  Here, it may as well have none.  The new music is the same repetitious, "Halloween"-clone droning heard in a million other horror flicks, and many of the new scenes feature a very poorly played fire-and-brimstone preacher apparently intended to function as a parody of a fire-and-brimstone preacher.  Why, is anyone's guess.  The prologue, in which the cemetery zombie climbs out of his coffin just before he can be buried, destroys the impact of the scene that formerly opened the film.  Before, the ghoul had appeared out of nowhere, and we didn't know who, or what, he was.  Now we do.  Way to go, new producers.  This 30th-anniversary farce demonstrates how easily an effective film can be destroyed by ill-advised alteration.
