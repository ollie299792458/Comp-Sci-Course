Austin Powers is one of the funniest characters to every grace the big screen. You have to love what Mike Myers has to put together and this movie just adds to his resume.

Austin Powers(Myers) is in the future now. He no longer lives in the 60's but the 90's. He's married to Vanessa(Hurley) and things seem great for Britians greatest agent. That is until he finds out Vanessa is a fembot and Dr.Evil(Hurley) is loose again.

Dr. Evil has used his time machine to go to the past. He uses a time machine to steal Austin Powers mojo and he goes back to the 60's. Austin must get his mojo back so he pursues the evil Dr. When he gets back to the 60's he teams up with Felecity Shagwell(Graham). It's up to the two to get Austin's mojo back, and stop Dr. Evil's deathstar before it destroys the world.

Mike Myers is the man. I laugh every time I see this movie. The jokes never get old and neither does Myers. The man is a comic genius. He can use all the comedic elements. Even if you don't like the joke, you'll laugh at how dumb it is. His duel performance as Powers in Evil is great. Fat Bastard is also great. Get into my belly.

I liked Heather Graham a lot in the movie. She does exactly what shes suppose to do, and thats to look great on screen. It's her best performance behind Rollergirl, and if you liked her there you will here too. It's a fun character, and she is hot in the movie.

I loved all the cameos in the movie. Tim Robbins as the president is great. Will Ferrell being back as well is funny. You'll have fun watching them.

This one can hold it's own with the first movie. The jokes are great. The spy spoof stuff is awesome. If you want to sit down for a fun 90 minutes then pick this one up. If you don't like stupid slack stick comedy then don't watch this. If you do go get it now.
