I think the French really know how to make a crime movie. We seem to go for the thug angle, whereas they bring on the elan and panache.
I am a real Bridget Fonda fan, even though I hate her mother and every movie she made except when she played herself in "Klute." This is, a one reviewer stated, virtually a frame-by-frame remake of the original French. So are a lot of films from Hollywood, but that does not make it inferior.
This is movie is not inferior because the acting is not inferior. Gabriel Byrne isn't as good as in "Usual Suspects," but his portrayal is still excellent as Fonda's (Maggie's) tutor. The one to watch is Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner. His version is much superior to that of Schwarzenegger's concept. Don't you just like how he gets rid of the irritating guy banging on the trunk of his car? Wouldn't it be great to do the same thing at a super market? And how about those glasses? It's all in the acting.
The minor irritant is Mulroney as the boyfriend. What a limp biscuit. It's like he knew the only way he could get Fonda in bed was by acting with her in a movie. I think I was available in 1992, but nobody called me, meaning they had to settle for him.
