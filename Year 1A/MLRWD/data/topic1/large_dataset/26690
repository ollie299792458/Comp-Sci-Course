... a waste of time, that is!

This is one of those movies where you will probably figure out the plot within the first 20 minutes. After that, the question is simply whether the action, the stunts, or the star-power (or any combination there-of) is enough to keep you in your seat for the remaining 70-odd minutes. For me, it just wasn't.

In fact, the plot here is so predictable that they did not even try to keep it a secret for long... there is a dead give-away half-way through the movie.

The stunts and car chases are pretty good, but not quite in the same league as any of the half a dozen other recent action movies which this one liberally borrows from.

Of course, this is a 'check your logic in at the door' movie, so I won't get into all the different things that are inconsistent or implausible in the story. Mercifully, the action does keep moving along at a fast enough pace to help you over-look the obvious flaws. The acting is decent but unremarkable... pretty much what you would expect for this type of movie.

On the whole, unless you are a big Shia LaBeouf fan, give this one a pass and catch a re-run of 'Live Free or Die Hard' or your favorite action movie instead.
