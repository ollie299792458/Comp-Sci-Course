Like a lot of people, when I first saw the previews for this movie I was expecting a horror film about a killer Crocodile. The croc ended up almost being a sub-plot amidst the civil war torn area in which it hunts. I think this is why so many people were disappointed with it and for this, as always, I blame Hollywood producers who don't have enough faith in their product to market it as is. This is what happens when studios are run by people who went to business school instead of film school.
The film follows a news crew trying to document the capture of this unusually large (though exaggerated compared to the actual croc it is based on) crocodile in the area of Burundi which is suffering from a civil war which happens to be as much a part of the story as the croc hunt. This is loosely based on the PBS documentary 'Capturing the Killer Croc.' I'm not a big critic of acting talent. I've always taken the view that as long as the acting is not so horrible as to make the movie unwatchable then I'm happy. That said I had no problem with any of the performances in this film. The story kept me hooked and the special effects were pretty awesome. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good film that goes beyond just being a gore fest, though there is plenty of gore to be had here.
