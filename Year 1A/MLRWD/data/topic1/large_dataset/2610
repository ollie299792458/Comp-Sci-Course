Although the series takes some liberties with the story lines of the books, I found the production to be wonderful.  I read the entire Hornblower series many years ago, but viewing the tv programs renewed my interest in them.  In addition, the skillful acting of the various cast members brought the characters to life for me.  (In rereading the books, I found I now had a new appreciation of the characters.)

Ioan Gruffud was excellent as Hornblower.  Robert Lindsay's portrayal of Captain (later Admiral) Pellew was first class.  Sean Gilder played the not-too-bright Styles to perfection.  One of my favorite characters, Styles' friend Matthews, was superbly played by Paul Copley.  And of course, one can't forget Mr. Bush, ably played by Paul McGann.  It seemed to me that McGann's Bush was a sharper man than the Bush of in the novels, but I appreciated that and thought he was an excellent character for the series.  Other actors and actressess were quite good as well.

The staging, costumes, and ships were superbly created.  The scenes at sea, the ships themselves, the actions scenes, etc., were very convincing and authentic.

I realize the 'purist' might object to some parts of the series, but I think it was outstanding.  Very well done!
