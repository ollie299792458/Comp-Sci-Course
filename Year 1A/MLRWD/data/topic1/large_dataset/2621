I haven't seen a vampire film as good as this one since "Nosferatu".  All the actors did an excellent job portraying vampires, especially Kirsten Dunst.  This was not an easy role for a child actor in their first film.  It was about a man named Louis(Brad Pitt), who was bit and turned into a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise).  Louis is having a hard time coping with drinking blood and murdering people.  However, he can't fight his urges any longer and he bites a little girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), which turns her into a vampire as well.  Soon, Lestat, Louis and Claudia become a little family and shares a house.
  After a considerable amount of time, Louis and Claudia can no long bear to live with Lestat any longer.  So, Claudia tricks Lestat into drinking blood from a corpse, which causes him to rot and sort of go into a coma.  At that, Louis and Claudia run away together and live a pretty happy life for a while.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I am going to stop talking.  You should see this if you like vamp movies.
