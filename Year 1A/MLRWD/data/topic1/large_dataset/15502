Have never written a review but I don't want others to suffer as I have.
The story was so implausible it was bizarre--script written by monkeys at typewriters (but not enough monkeys/time put into it.)

--> The character's careers could not possibly be careers.  And their relationships with each other were inexplicable and odd, yet still boring.
--> The director seems to have kept telling the actors, :"More, more, MORE!"  Because they gave too much all the time.  And yet, every second was BORING.
--> The childish editing and cinematography rendered some scenes senseless (made me wonder if they used stand-ins constantly b/c of how it was cut) and I was usually unable to understand how much time had passed from scene to scene.  (Or from the beginning to end of the movie, for that matter.)
--> The world they inhabit is not quite the real United States, although all signs point to that location as the one they were trying to represent.
--> The sound and music is atrocious!
Zero redeeming qualities.  Not a moment did I enjoy.

P.S. Something happens to Sigourney Weaver's part way through. . .I strongly  suspected this was a result of her contacting her lawyers when she saw the rushes.
