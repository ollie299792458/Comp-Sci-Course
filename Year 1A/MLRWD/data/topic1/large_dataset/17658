If you can,patronize this movie! It was a wonderful film with a smart, strong-willed, plus-sized, smart-mouthed teenage girl as its protagnist(Ana played by America Ferrera with wonderful realism). Although it is set in East L.A. and deals with the Mexican-American experience, there are none of your stereotypical elements--teen pregnancy, gangs, killing, or your general socially irresponsible behavior. 
It had realistic family dynamics. Many of the people left the theatre stating that the mother in the movie (or the sister or the grandpa) reminded them of their real life equivalent. The general message of the movie was to accept yourself for who you are and not be afraid to live outside the box--whether it's being a fat girl in a thin-obsessed society or deciding to go to college instead of the family tradition of going to work after high school. (Ana and her mother clash over the place of women in society. Ana's mother selfishly belives that Ana should go to work and skip college, although she's smart enough for a full scholarship, because she had to start working at age 13.)
The best part of the movie is at the sweatshop/factory where Ana strips off her shirt because she's so hot.(They're not allowed to turn on the fan because dust will blow onto the dresses.) Her mother is aghast because Ana is such "a butterball." The other women there then start whipping off their clothes to show their "flaws." Soon, you have 4 women on the screen who are wrinkled, fat, flabby, celluite-laden standing in their underwear. Why was this the best part? Because they were all beautiful. Ana says she doesn't want to change her size because it's a big "f*ck you" to the skinny-obsessed society. All the women in the theater clapped at this point. It was a feel good movie that was well made.
