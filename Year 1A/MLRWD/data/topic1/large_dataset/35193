I have the book, and tried the exercises a couple of times but ultimately lacked the patience to get through the one hour program.
I'm in my early thirties and have always exercised. I've developed problems with my lower back and joints.  My metabolism crashed - I gained so much weight that I had my thyroid checked.
I worked out doing circuit style training all summer - until I literally vomited - and didn't lose any weight, just bulked up.  My joints were suffering from all of the workouts over the years, in spite of meticulous attention to proper form.
I bought the video as sort of supplemental explanation/motivation for the one hour program.  I highly recommend reading the book.  It gives you more insight into Callan (if you find her annoying) and the "Portfolio of Proof" (unretouched photos of clients' hour to hour progress) is inspirational.
I was pretty much ready to give up exercise entirely.
I'm about six hours in.  My jeans fit better after three, in spite of holiday bingeing.
It's nice that the exercises incorporate a lot of stretching. I don't like to do yoga because I feel like it yields little in the way of results and I'm not flexible.
And my libido is back in full force.  It's almost embarrassing.
Callanetics is miraculous. It's nice to not have to jump around like an idiot. I'm just too old for that now.
