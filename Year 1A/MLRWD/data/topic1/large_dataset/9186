She is a good example of what makes old adventure films good and bad. It alternates between wooden acting by Randolph Scott as the thick-jawed hero Leo Vincey and beautifully bombastic work by the ladies in Leo's life, She (Helen Gahagan) and merely mortal Tanya (Helen Mack). It features too much exposition in its first moments, but then kicks into high gear, flying the heroes from a tedious conversation in Vincey's uncle's house right to the Arctic. Despite my modern sophistication, the build-up to the climax was so strong I even found myself literally on the edge of my seat. There's romance, jealousy, religion, secret worlds, and mankind's fateful quest for immortality.

Classic film lovers and fans of serials, old adventure and sci-fi movies, and H. Rider Haggard's over-the-top John Carter of Mars adventures will lap up She. The new colorized version, overseen carefully by an aged but imaginative Harryhausen, is a sight to behold. As a purist, I stuck to the black-and-white, but Harryhausen says producer Merian C. Cooper surely would have done it in color if he could have afforded it.
