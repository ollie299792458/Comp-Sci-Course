Onegin is a relatively short movie that's a joy to watch. It's a love story, or more correctly, a lost love story. She loves him first. He subsequently returns that love, but he's too late. Timing is everything. She loves him when it matters, but he squelches that love. He's a cold fish, melancholy, with his own warped ideas about real commitment. So we have a beautiful country girl from a wealthy family with a taste for books and a love of the outdoors. Hmmm... this doesn't seem too hard to figure out. Hey, Onegin, perhaps you should give this romance a little more consideration. But he seems immediately repulsed by the idea, tosses her letter into the fire. He's a tragic figure, basically a knob, remote, somewhat depressive. Thinks he's got it all figured out, too clever by half. Probably needs some good strong coffee and a lithium tablet or possibly a whack upside his head. He lets an angel slip through his fingers, breaks her heart, mortally wounds her. That's not something heaven is likely to forgive or forget.

The movie does what it intends to do very well. It's got a rich gothic mood, often rustic, sometimes opulent, sometimes slightly creepy, but always interesting. The old Russian mansions and the wardrobes are spot on, simply magnificent. His dead uncle looks like Dracula asleep in his coffin. There's even a fortune teller who reads wax drippings from a candle. But the duel is surely the turning point of the movie. One man will die for love in an act of madness, and one man will simply walk away from love. Quite a contrast, but both are ultimately tragic figures. Neither man has a wholesome perspective on human relationships. And neither gets to spend a lifetime with the woman he loves. Paradise lost. The climactic scene in the palace music room is absolutely classic in all respects. Liv Tyler's finest five minutes on film. An enjoyable movie that I wished was another hour longer.
