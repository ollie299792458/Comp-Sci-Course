This is a great movie.  It is well directed and the graphics and sfx are convincing.  As far as sticking to the comics, it is cleverly inconsistant.  Unlike the Spider-Man and Fantastic Four movies, which try to depict an origin believable to new fans and familiar to old fans, the Ghost Rider movie is a retelling of the main theme and feel of the story, rather than the story itself.
Instead of an adult Johnny Blaze who summons the devil through a ritual, he is a troubled kid who unwittingly sells his soul to a stranger.  Though it is not the original origin of the rider, it could be debated that it is a better beginning to introduce the innocence and strength of Johnny's spirit.
In addition, the movie skips all of Johnny's trials trying to discover his powers and dives straight into the shared-body experience of his more recent comic books.
Finally, the appearance of Carter Slade, who is the original Ghost Rider, before Marvel, adds a respectfull tone to the true origins of the "Spirit of Vengeance."
