This review is to inform those that want to upgrade there standard DVD to HD verson.  Buyer beware..

1st off the back of the box says 5.1 EX audio (Not on there)only TruHD and I must say for a suppose upgrade loseless audio it seemed weaker the the standard DVD, which does have 5.1EX and 5.1 DTS,unlike the bluray edtion.  The picture is not bad,but is not a 1080P HD quality transfer.  There is noticeable grain and scartches and imperfections across the screen.  Since this movie was shot 2000 it looks good, but I was expecting a sharper image on Bluray.  Newline usually spares no expense when it comes to issuing content on DVD/Bluray, but this time interms of audio and video, I guess the price represents the amount that went into the transfer.

I know the bonus features are very good, very extensive, but do not buy this edition.  Just keep your DVD and play it in your Bluray player for the 10% upgrade and you will just fine.

I do not know about you, but I am tired of buying older movies 1970',80's and some 1990's on bluray, for the most part there is no difference in quality,alot of the old transfers are used and no expense goes into the remastering of the picutre or sound.  It seems like (Besides a small amount of tittles that get a A++ trans/remaster)Bluray is meant for newer movies from 2000 and above to enjoy real HD piture and loseless audio.  For a better expierance than the theater on your home theater.  Maybe in the futre some upcoming tittles Jaws,Back To The Future, ET, Star wars 4,5and 6 ETC will get a good HD transfer worth buying again???  Mike
