The "still on TV" in the tittle of my review of course refers to the horrid cancellation of TV's best comedy Arrested Development. Yet this review is about Scrubs, which for five years has remained TVs most consistently funny comedy - season three is the best out of the five by a hair. Unlike a comedy series like `Friends' which dipped in quality throughout its run. Scrubs has stuck to Its formula and delivered consistent laughs.

Season Three of Scrubs for me is the best. I feel that this season delivers both the heart and laughs more superior than any other season this show has had. Take for example the Brendan Fraser episode `My Screw Up' or the Michael J. Fox two-parter. The always entertaining ensemble has now mastered there characters to perfection.

The only downside is the appearance of skanky Tara Reid and the lack of dream sequences which appeared in the first two seasons, though there are still some hysterically funny dream moments - Turk throwing himself out of his car and onto the freeway then getting repeatedly run over in the background is my favourite, (It has to be seen to be believed). This box set features some interesting behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the show, but the commentaries are a bit of a let down.
