I'm far from a fan of Nicholas Cage, I feel he shows no range of emotions in his performance and almost always comes off as if he's reading his lines with much difficulty at that.  Here is really no exemption.  Its funny how once Joaquin Phoenix shows up you can see the caliber of acting rise, for even though at the time Joaquin was relatively unknown; his ability to display emotion and just plain act natural far outweighs the amateurish talent in Cage.

Well, that aside this film is a good one at that.  It's dark, mysterious and serves up generous helpings of fear and suspense.  The subject matter is grim and depressing and may even evoke emotions such as trauma and sadness, for what happened to that poor young girl and the complete disregard for life these creeps have can weigh heavy on the easily emotional, and even those not so easily prone to compassion.  As Tom Welles, Cage plays a PI hired by a recently deceased millionaire's wife who has found this pornographic film in which a young woman is murdered.  At first they all pass it off as a fake, but in order to be certain he investigates, and finds out the `snuff films' aren't necessarily myth.

Slowly declining into absurdity, this film does, by the end, come off a bit unrealistic (ha, if you can imagine that *spoken with pure sarcasm*) but it still works, it still delivers the goods sort-of-speak.  If you're looking for an effective thriller that will keep you glued to your seat and shaking in your skin long after the credits have finished rolling then this may just be the film for you.  If nothing else it gives you a chance to see Phoenix in one of his first scene stealing roles.
