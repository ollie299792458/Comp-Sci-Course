When I went to see the Crossroads movie, I just wanted to see what sort of acting would Britney do and I thought it was an easy-going teen movie. I definitely didn't expect it to be a terrific movie, but when I saw it, Britney acted better than I expected and the whole thing was really cool, not only being at some places fun-loving, but also with a good plot which made you think seriously about your friends, your ambitions and dreams and feelings. It certainly wasn't shallow. 
The movie was about three friends Lucy (Britney), Kit and Mimi who are very good friends in the beginning as little kids but over time stop being friends until they don't really like each other. Then, after their Graduation ball, they go to a place where they digged in a box with all their "dreams". Mimi decides to go to Los Angeles to go to an audition for singing, Kit goes with her to visit her fiance and Lucy then too in search of her mother. Mimi's friend, Ben, takes them there in his car. Then it's a road trip in which the three friends find out their true selves and get together as friends again, never to separate. Lucy and Ben have feelings for each other. No dream actually becomes true - Lucy's mom doesn't want her, saying she was a mistake, in the end, Kit's fiance is actually a bad guy who is cheating on her plus he made Mimi pregnant. Mimi's dream was also to put her feet into the Pacific Ocean which she does and in fact, instead of Mimi, Lucy goes to the audition as the singer (she wrote the lyrics and Ben the music), but Mimi and Kit are her vocalists. It ends in a happy end but through some tough times. 
I think the movie was really interesting and you won't be disappointed if you go see it. So check it out, cuz it's gonna be worth it.
