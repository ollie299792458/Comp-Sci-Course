This is an outstanding piece of film work.  I am a student of history, but such means little or nothing regarding my understanding of very specific events of WW II.  I was informed and enlightened with each episode, and with the last, I finally understood (may not agree) my parents' position concerning the atomic bombing of Japan, and why my father was so upset with the war protestors in the 60s (of which I was one). I watched this last episode with my mother as my dad died 16 years ago. I cried for reasons far different than for her reasons for crying; nevertheless, we shared this moment. I attended the dedication of the WW II Memorial in Washington w/ my adult son. After viewing this series, I am reminded of the privilege I had in sharing that weekend in 2005 with the brave men and women who were THE WAR generation. Not that war is the only measure of a generation,because clearly it is not,  and not that my generation failed to give 50,000 of its finest to a war that should have never been, because we did. I have my doubts however about we self-absorbed boomers living up to the courage exhibited by  our parents' generation.
