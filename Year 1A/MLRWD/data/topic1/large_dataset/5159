This is a terrific summer show. Very, very rare today. I tivoed every episode from day one. And I really hope they bring this back again next summer! This show is not really about swinging married couples. It is about how intertwined adults become in their friends lives. It's set back in the 70's in Chicago. I was drawn to this show due to Grant Show (who knew he would look that hot in a stach?) and Molly Parker (who was phenomenal in Deadwood) I kept watching because i was so intrigued in the characters and their lives. For the prudes who protested this show because of the swinging.... there are only seconds long clips of the actual swinging in darkly lit rooms. Most of it is implied instead of shown. The characters are richly written and resonate as true. The family dynamics are real to life with the children and times of the excessive 70's. The costumes and settings are so 70's its like watching your own town, driving your old family cars and your own homes. I was surprised that CBS had the balls to bring this for viewers. This is more like the quality shows you get from HBO or showtime. I promise you will love this show. And there are way too many loose ends to leave it dangling.... Bring this back!
