I first saw this film in the theatre when it came out and I remembered that I squirmed in my chair through some of the scenes. Never before had I ever watched a movie that was so blunt with regards to family members and their inner issues and struggles. I was not sure if I liked it or not once it was over. However, after purchasing a copy of the DVD last night, I watched it again. Now I understand why this movie did not do so well at the box office; this is a film that takes a simple plot with amazing actors and turns it into quite a remarkable experience laden with grief, regrets and bleakness of the self. The movie is quite dark and yet there is hope mixed with a dash of redemption for all. Nicole Kidman as Margot was simply stunning in a quiet way, as was Jennifer Jason Leigh as her sister, Pauline. The chemistry between the two actresses can only be found in a handful of films, in my opinion. This is a film not to be taken lightly but rather savoured slowly, even relishing in the pain portrayed. I make no claim to be a movie snob; I simply like what I like. If you enjoy sleeper films that take on deeper meanings, watch this movie.
