I caught this movie on TV a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have several episodes of The Shadow radio drama on CD and catch the program on the radio as often as possible, so seeing this movie was a real treat for me. I was away from home when I saw the movie on TV, so I couldn't record it for later viewing. At least now I can enjoy it whenever I want and as time allows.

While this movie is more of a family movie it really isn't for the younger set as it tends to be a bit grim in a few places, no blood and gore just a bit dark for the younger kids to enjoy. If you have listened to The Shadow on the radio as I have, and still do, then you will really enjoy watching this movie. When Lamont Cranston is the Shadow, he virtually does disappear in this movie, being seen only as a brief blur during moments when any rapid motion on his part is required.
All of the scenery and vehicles seemed appropriate for the era that this movie is supposed to have taken place. I usually don't watch movies to catch any bloopers unless I see one or two that are obvious the first time through, then I go back to see if any others may have made their way into the movie. Unless the bloopers are blatent and poorly done I usually still enjoy the movie. I haven't caught any bloopers in this movie, but that is due to not having really looked for any.
