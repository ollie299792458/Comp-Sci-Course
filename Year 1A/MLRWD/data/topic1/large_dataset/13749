My hopes were high for this one, after the turgid "Hollywood After Dark." Unlike that film, "Killers From Space" is a delightfully bad, hence intrinsically more entertaining grade-C sci-fi cheapo, and so should have been perfect for the Crew. But the old "MST3K" spark is simply missing. There are some really good one-liners along the way, but they are too few and far-between. Set-up skits and interstitials are boring. The print, by the way, is terrible, although there were excellent prints of this title still being shown on local tv through the 80s (I know, I edited one for tv, a pristine print from Paramount, which held distribution rights). The heavy scratches and splices are annoying and distracting. I feel, reading other reviews, that the Crew is simply coasting on goodwill left over from MST3K, and here I must agree with the hated SCI FI Channel executive Stephen Chao, who killed MST3K because he felt it "wasn't funny enough." I disagreed then, but find his critique sadly appropriate here. I won't be buying future releases, should there be any.
