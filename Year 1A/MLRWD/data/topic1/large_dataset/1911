First of all, I love Jim Carey.  I remember him from the days he was in the Fox comedy sketch comedy show "In Living Color."  I'm glad to see his comic genius flourish to the mainstream movie audience.  Dumb & Dumber is by far his best comedy yet and is definitely #1 on my list of all-time favorite movies.  The "dumb" nature of this movie allows Carey (Lloyd) to indulge in his personalized crazy humor.  Giving an equally great performance was Jeff Daniels (Harry).  These two were made for each other!  Lloyd Christmas, a limo driver, and Harry Dunn, a dog breeder/groomer drive to Aspen, California errr I mean Colorado to deliver a lost briefcase owned by the lovely Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly).  However, the briefcase was not lost at all.  Instead, it was meant to be a ransom payoff in return for Mary's husband who was apparently kidnapped.  A roadtrip was just the perfect adventure for these two tweedle dumb's as they encounter and confuse many people with their innocent and childish stupidity.  Not only is this movie chalk full of fart and poop jokes (and it is) but they are also tasteful fart & poop jokes!  Only Jim Carey could pull off the wickedly funny facial expressions required to show his relief from whizzing into a beer bottle while driving in Harry's sheepdog van.  I'm sure everyone has seen this movie already as it is an intergral part of American culture!  And if not, what are you waiting for???
