8 Mile, directed by Curtis Hanson of "L.A. Confidential", is the story of Jimmy Smith Jr., or Bunny Rabbit (Eminem), a young man who expresses himself through the art of rapping and writing raps. The story involves his best friends Future, Cheddar Bob, Sol George and a cast of other interesting characters. The story of this movie is basically Rabbit coping with his depressing trailer-park life in the slums of Detroit. One day, working at his his dull, strenuous job at the car factory, he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy) and begins a relationship. Despite all these other details, the main point of the story is Rabbit and how he raps to deal with life.
 I enjoyed this movie alot. Eminem's suprisingly good performance raised my respect for him alot. Of course, I still think he is arrogant and obnoxious, but that's besides the point. Other fine performances include a great trailer-trash drunken mother, played by Kim Basinger. Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, and all the other members of Rabbit's circle of friends gave great performances as well.
 My only problem with this movie is the relationship between Alex and Rabbit. It was a tad unconvincing. They did not have many scenes together, yet it was made out so they knew each other so well. Don't let that put you off though. This is a truly remarkable urban drama with great directing from Curtis Hanson and some great performances. For fans, there are some great rap scenes in here, even though you've probably already seen it. Check it out.
