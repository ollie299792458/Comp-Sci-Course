Having seen the original release well over 100 times, I was dying to see the editing as well as the previously unreleased songs.  "Celebration Day" was one I have always wanted to see - purely because of the monster guitar solo.  It did not dissapoint.  I would have preferred to see a direct guitar shot for the whole solo, but overall, the song was filmed and synched up with the music very well.  "Over the Hills And Far Away" was stunning.  I was suprised how well it came off live.  "The Ocean" was the same version that was on "How The West Was Won" as was "Misty Mountain Hop".  The best part of the new release is definitely the re-synching of the video and audio - a much better job than the original, although still not perfect.

My fantasy for this movie is to have all the live footage released WITHOUT those stupid, drug induced, amateurish, fantasy sequences that ruin the best parts of "Dazed and Confused", "No Quarter", Moby Dick", "The Song Remains The Same" and "The Rain Song".

Ultimately a big improvement and a must have for any Zep fan.
