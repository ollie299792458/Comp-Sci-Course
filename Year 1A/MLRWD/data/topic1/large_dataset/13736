I SAW THIS MOIVE AS A YOUNG TEENAGER WHEN THIS CAME OUT AT THE

MOVIES.I WAS IN AWWW!.I DID NOT NOTICE THEN,BUT HOW COULD I,I WAS

TO WRAPED UP IN THE MOVIE THEN.TILL IT CAME OUT ON VHS.I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING THINGS,SO I KEPT REWINDING THE TAPE BACK TO THAT

POINT,AND REPLAYED.SURE ENOUGH,THERE IT WAS AGAIN.THEN,THE NEW

EXT:VERSION,"THE COLLECTORS 2 DISC SERIES CAME OUT,AND THERE IT

WAS AGAIN,BUT MORE CLEARER THAN THE OLD VHS.CASE IN POINT.THE

FINAL FINALLY,WHERE "CLINT" HAS TUCO STANDING ON THE CROSS WITH

HIS HEAD IN THE NOOSE,THERE ARE I BELIVE 8 CLOSE UP SHOTS,THAT

BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH FROM TUCO TO EASTWOOD AND BACK TO TUCO.

ON THE FOURTH CLOSE UP SHOT,IN THE BACK GROUND WHERE THE TREE

LINE AND THE TERRAIN MEET AND JUST TO RIGHT OF TUCOS EAR,NOW

PAY ATTENTION!!A MAN POP'S UP OUT OF KNOW WHERE,"WHAT?-WHO IS

THIS GUY?.THEN IT GOES BACK TO EASTWOOD,WHERE HE TAKES AIM AT

TUCO'S ROPE,THEN BACK TO TUCO AGAIN.IT IS A LIITLE BLURRED,BUT

YOU CAN STILL SEE HIM,ONLY THIS TIME HE IS WALKING BEHIND TUCO

IN THE BACK GROUND TOWARD'S A GROUP OF TREES,TO THE LEFT SIDE OF

TUCO,THEN HE DISAPPEARS.NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS ACCIDENTAL

WHERE NO ONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION AT THE TIME OF SHOOTING THIS

OR IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THING'S THAT NOBODY EXPECTED,NOT EVEN

SERGIO,IT JUST HAPPEN'D BY CHANCE,OR MAYBE IT WAS THE GHOST OF

"ARCH STANTON"WILL NEVER KNOW.I JUST FIND IT AMUESING EVERY TIME
