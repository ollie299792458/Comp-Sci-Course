[This review is of the "Unrated Director's Cut"]

Look, Shimizu wasn't trying to make "The Godfather" here.  He was making an Americanized sequel to its Americanized predecessor.  And considering he was working with a pretty shallow script he did a damn good job.

The Grudge movies (Japanese and American alike) are about atmosphere, creating an eerie motif.  Shimizu does this splendidly.  The out-of-sequence plot certainly helped to distract from its lack of depth.  Some of the acting was adequate while other performances fell flat but, hey, it's a horror movie for crying out loud.

Where this movie shines is in its overall creepiness.  While a few of the kill scenes were tension-less, most were not.  That damn ghost, Kayako (?), was scary as hell and there was a lot of originality in the execution of her scenes.  The camerawork was of Oscar caliber which elevates what should be a "C"(ish) movie to a strong "B".

Very few movies make me "jump" these days and the Grudge 2 did it several times to me.  Not to mention there were a few scenes that deeply disturbed me (i.e. when that girl threw up the milk and then DRANK IT!).

If you're a fan of any of the other Grudge movies then certainly check this out.  If you didn't like the first one (I was not a fan of the first American one until I saw the unrated cut which added just the right amount of gore for this sort of movie), then this one probably won't win you over.  But if you dig ghost movies or supernatural thrillers then be sure to at least rent this one.
