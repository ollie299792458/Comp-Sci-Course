Darkwing Duck was coolest cartoon I ever watched as a kid.  So I think it's awesome that Disney has begun to release the episodes on DVD.  For those of you who are new to this cartoon, good for you for finding this page!  There are so many things that make Darkwing Duck stand out among past and present cartoons.  For examples, the hero is a single parent to an adopted daughter, his girlfriend is a reformed criminal sorceress, the sidekick is a crossover from another oldschool cartoon, one of the bad guys is a Disney version of The Joker, and the top antagonist is a crazy chainsaw-wielding doppelganger of the hero (and probably the most psychotic villain ever created by Disney).  It has been 18 or 19 years since the last time I sat down and watched Darkwing Duck, and I have to say that I appreciate the witty, hilarious scriptwriting more now as an adult.  All those "I am the terror that flaps in the night" lines I didn't understand when I was little now make a ton of comical sense!

For those of you who are old fans of Darkwing Duck, go ahead and buy this volume.  Be aware, though, that there are no special features and the episodes are organized according to when they were aired, rather than when they were produced.  FYI for anyone concerned about minor editing: "Darkly Dawns the Duck Part 1" leaves out the opening chase scene, which is a pity since it was quite thrilling, but you can probably google it.  Don't be discouraged by these negative aspects, though.  At least Darkwing Duck has been extracted from the vortex of almost-forgotten Disney cartoons, so buy it while it's available...before it goes out of print.  Relive the adventure and humor of this beloved show.  I am sure you'll find it funnier now than as a kid.
