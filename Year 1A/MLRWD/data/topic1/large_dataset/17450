If you are looking for a film with characters you can empathize with, moral redemption, and a happy ending, this film will leave you unfulfilled.  I must admit that this film caused a serious argument between myself and my SO within a half hour of watching it.

This film is a social commentary about relationships, how people deal with unhappiness, and the constant search for answers in situations where there are NO answers to be found.

Its easy to be seduced by the beautiful scenery, wit, and gag comedy that pops up thru out.  In the midst of this I found myself becoming increasingly unhappy by the choices made by ALL of the women in this film who found convenient reasons to lie, cheat, and deceive.  First they deceive themselves and then everyone else around them....for what?  Is that the question of this film.... What are we searching for and what are we capable of during the search to find and ACHIEVE it?  Secondarily, do we even understand ourselves well enough to define our happiness when we so easily toss away the things we search for once we have them?

If character development is your thing, this could be your film.  If you wish to feel good afterwards, RUN RUN RUN from this film....
