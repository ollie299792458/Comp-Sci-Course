The old MGM may be long-dead, but as long as the films survive, its golden age will live forever, and nowhere is there more proof positive of this than in the spectacular THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT TRILOGY that Warner Home Video has assembled with obvious passion, affection, class & pizzazz. WOW!

The three compilations have never looked so good. You get over 200 great musical numbers starring the greatest legends of the Metro lot, with colors that burst off the screen and sound that betrays its age.

As if that wasn't enough, WB has included hours and hours of mouth watering extras. SEVENTEEN OUTTAKE MUSICAL NUMBERS!!!!...vintage TV specials, and a new documentary that heralds the unsung heroes of the genre. Arrangers like Conrad Salinger...choreographers like Hermes Pan. This is cinematic nirvana.

JUDY, FRED, GENE and the gang are all on display here, and have made my new home projection system glisten. If you have a widescreen TV, the moment when the ATCHISON TOPEKA number goes wide is astounding. If you don't yet have a widescreen TV, WB has provided a fullscreen version. No matter what set up you have, the disc is ready-made for your best-possible viewing experience!

BRAVO to all involved! A PERFECT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR ALL AGES!
