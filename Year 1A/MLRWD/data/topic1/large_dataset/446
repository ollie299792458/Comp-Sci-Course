This is an excellent film, however the subject is heart wrenching.  The film isn't about a girl masquerading as a man or about a confused lesbian. These terms have unfortunately been equated with the film and are  inaccurate.  Brandon was an FTM, a transgendered person/transexual who was  pre-op. The film does deal with Brandon's affirmation of his  (yes--editors-HIS)true SELF (read Jung).  Chloe Sevigny portrays a young  woman who is able to see beyond the physical and into Brandon's true SELF.  Unfortuately, 2 disturbed men, who have many issues in themselves, in their  limited vision and supposed masculinity are challenged by Brandon's  transgenderness.  They project their own insecurities out on  Brandon--brutally raping and murdering Brandon, a young mother, and an  African American (not shown in the film).  Warning: this film is  emotionally upsetting and demonstrates the issue of violence on many  levels--all folks can relate.  In many respects, this film ranks on the  levels of Schlinder's List and Platoon.  Please make sure you see the film  with someone so you can talk afterwords. Trust me, I conducted a panel  after a showing of the film for an audience of 40-50 individuals.  Let the  pain in and feel it.  It's the only way you can truly understand the  film.
It's too bad that Kimberly Peirce was not nominated for an Academy  Award for her direction. The film is EXCELLENT!
