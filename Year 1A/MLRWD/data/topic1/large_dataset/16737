Some people like Woody Allen's early movies like Sleeper and Bananas, full  of slapstick, puerile sex jokes, and silliness.  Others like his later  movies like Annie Hall and Hannah &amp; Her Sisters, full of neurotic  dialogue and strange relationships between men and women.  Love and Death  was characterized in a review I read as a movie situated directly in the  middle of these two styles.  This is wholly accurate.  There are a lot of  amusing slapstick bits in the movie, and lot of silly jokes and scenes.  But also there is a lot of that humorous Woody Allen dialogue where people  spend a lot more time talking than doing.  And above and beyond all that,  this is a fantastic spoof of 19th Century Russian literature.  Anyone at  all familiar with Tolstoy will find the familial situations (Diane Keaton's  character falls in love with Woody Allen's character's brother, but Woody  Allen's character loves her, etc.) very amusing and true to the genre.  One  of the funniest dialogues manages to work in a character from or the name  of many of the major Russian novelists of the 19th Century.  This movie is  so funny and it works on so many levels and I highly recommend it.
