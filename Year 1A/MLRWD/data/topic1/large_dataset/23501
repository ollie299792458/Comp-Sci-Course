The first "Jeepers Creepers" was a bit of a creepy surprise. While it did follow somewhat of a formula, it stood on its own. What I particularly liked was how the film delved into the history of the Creeper.  It wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining enough for a Friday night Horror flick fix.

I had heard good things about "Jeeper Creepers 2," so I expected a continuation of the same theme. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. With "Jeepers Creepers 2" we get nothing more than a "Friday the 13th" pick-off-the-teens-one-by-one storyline. Gone is any further information regarding the Creeper. Instead we get a bunch of snotty teen jocks stuck on a bus stranded in the middle of nowhere, each being carried of to someplace we never get to see. Does the Creeper fly them off to a nest to feed a batch of little creepers?  Is it to build another mosaic of bodies? We never know.

If you haven't seen the first movie, you'll be wondering what all this talk about feeding every 23 years is about. It's touched on in the first movie, but in JC2, you never find out why the Creeper feeds at these intervals. What's its motivation?  Where did it come from?  Why does it stay in this little town?  Why does it wear those dark clothes? I had lots of questions that the movie ignored. Had the movie delved into any of these questions, it might have been a better film. But in this case, you're stuck with a by the numbers slasher flick that goes nowhere.
