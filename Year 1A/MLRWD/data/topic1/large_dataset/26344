If there was a zero star rating this movie would have gotten that. Well, okay, the Dragons looked pretty good, so I'll be generous and give them 1/2 a star. This movie is everything that a good fantasy movie like Lord of the Rings is not. Most of the special effects pretty much stunk. The 'artifact' looked like apiece of plastic on a stick. The deadly 'dungeon' (see the name) had a pit trap which dropped the hero right in on the treasure... Who in the world would do that? Monty Haul? The script was terrible and made very little sense, the acting was worse. Given that there were at least two good actors in this movie, the quality of acting was rather shockingly bad. In fact the only good thing I can think of about the movie is that it had Tom Baker (of Doctor Who fame) in a cameo. The plot was rather terrible. In fact the Heroes go to retrieve an artifact that could destroy the queen before the villans do. Upon reaching the resting place of the artifact, NO ONE ELSE COULD ENTER BUT THE HERO. Okay, call me crazy, but if nobody else can get in, JUST LEAVE THE DAMN THING INSIDE! Instead they get it, it gets stolen and we have to endure anther 45 minutes of pain and suffering because of this.
All in all it seemed like the makers of this movie decided to just toss in a little of everything, shake and hope they rolled a natural twenty. Sorry guys, you got a critcal miss on this one.
