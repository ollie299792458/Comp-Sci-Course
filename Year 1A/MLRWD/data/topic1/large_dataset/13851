I saw this 3 times in the theater and just knew i had to get this once it came out on DVD. Hope they bend and are able to make a soundtrack, but with so many different music on this dvd, i'm sure it must be the hardest thing to get the rights to put all that music on the same cd. I, like many others was just starting to get into Jack White. I already loved Page and The Edge and thought i knew them, but this movie really introduces these guys(all three) to music lovers. It is fun and wonderful seeing the love of music these gentlemen have. I guess we all can think of other past, present and now guitarists that can be in these men's places in this movie, Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton and so on. But for whatever reason, these three just seem to have been able to hit it off, their chemistry together is a once in a lifetime happening with three greats. It is a wonderfully inspiring film, for music lovers all around. Thanks Mr. Page, The Edge and Mr. White for a lovely time and teaching us and showing us what true musicians really are. Thanks.
