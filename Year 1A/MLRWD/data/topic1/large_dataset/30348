This was my first experience with a movie from the "Heroic Gun Play" genre.  I'm not a fan of American action pictures, so I had always shied away from John Woo's Hong Kong action flicks.  I now see that I have definitely missed some great movies (I'm female, so a bunch of guys shooting guns at one another was never something I thought I would get into).  I decided to give the movie a look because Tony Leung is my favorite actor at the moment and I knew that he co-starred in the film.  Actually, Leung and Philip Kwok Choy (the killer Mad Dog in the film AND the action director) steal every scene they share with Chow Yun-Fat.  Now I want to check out some of the Shaw Bros. films Kwok Choy was in to see more of this martial arts actor.

Maybe it is the surprising emotional complexity Leung brings to the film and the exhilerating action sequences (and that the killing looks so fake), but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  As a neophyte, the commentary and 3 interviews added to my understanding and enjoyment of the film.  Since this is a cult film, I understand that die-hard fans of Woo and this particular film might be disappointed in various aspects of the presentation (this isn't a Criterion 2-disc premium treatment, afterall).  But, as an introduction to this film, to Woo 's heroic gun play pictures and to the world of Hong Kong action films, it is as good a place to start as any.  I am definitely looking forward to viewing other John Woo HK films.
