I just wanted to add my comment of DISGUST at the SO called ULTRAVIOLET Digital copy that is advertised with many Blu ray Disc's now.

I have a number of Blu ray's that are advertised to come bundled with an Ultraviolet Digital copy of the movie to watch on a computer/portable device.

Well I have not be able to even get to the stage of trying to download as when I try and goto the web site shown on the download instructions, nothing comes up at all.

With iTunes digital copies it's mostly been a straight forward process, although Warner Bros iTunes Digital copies have come up with error's in the redemption code and I REALLY don't like that all the movie studios still advertise a digital copy when they have an expiry date and after that date you may not be able to download the digital copy to iTunes. The best system I feel is at Universal Studios through iTunes, they seem to have it together the best.

What amazes me is that both the majority of Movie studios and Record Companies have bitched non stop about people pirating movies/music and yet they appear to be completely unable to come up with an effective way to distribute digital content the way people want it.

Incredible that such talented people appear to do nothing other than drive customers away.

Check out Apple you guys and perhaps one day the penny will drop that you NEED TO MAKE THINGS FAIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD for the consumer. Particularly at WB's you guys seem experts at upsetting consumers!!!

Pretty well much everyone will play ball when the rules respect the consumer!!!!

WAKE UP!!!
