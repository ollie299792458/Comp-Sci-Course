This is a great film, possibly the most brutal violence and gore ever seen in a martial arts film. When Ricky is sent to prison for killing a drug dealer, he must fight an assortment of thugs, monsters, and prison guards including the two evil wardens and the dreaded gang of four. Ricky has supernatural power and is able to heal injuries that would kill a normal person (he has 7 bullets in his chest). When he hits somebody, his fist goes right through their body, he becomes a killing machine. 
 Riki Oh features many creative scenes of extreme gore and crazy mayhem that will have you standing up and cheering... Some of the best deaths ever filmed! Heads are completely smashed and destroyed, eyeballs are popped out, there's intestine strangulation, razor blade torture, people skinned alive, submerged in concrete, buried alive, disemboweled, impaled with broken glass and knives, punched and reduced to chunky crimson mush, decapitated, crucified, dismembered, and blown to bits. I love this movie. The meat grinder climax is one of the goriest moments in movie history, right up there with the lawnmower assault in Dead Alive. Please, stop reading reviews and buy this movie NOW, you will be happy you did. Avoid R rated version.
 If you like Riki Oh, also look for Dead Alive aka Braindead, Bad Taste, Premutos, and the Toxic Avenger.
