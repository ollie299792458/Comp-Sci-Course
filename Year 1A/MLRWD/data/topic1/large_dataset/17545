Is there room on here to fit all of what Forrest Gump means to me and possibly others? Probably not!  Forrest Gump mixes so many styles of film in one movie it is incredible.  It is a comedy, drama, war movie, love story, one of spiritual enlightenment, but most importantly it is about a life.  We all walk this earth and from the beginning of our life, we grow, we laugh and love, we have pain and heartache, and eventually we die.  How will others remember us?  How in a positive way have we touched others during our life?

The Blu-Ray version of this film is like watching it again for the first time.  There are little things in the background that stand-out unlike the regular version.  The battle scene is visually striking.

In the play Hamlet, Hamlet is in the graveyard and comes across Yorrick's skeleton.  Yorrick was the king's jester and Hamlet spent a great time with him when he was younger.  As he holds his skull, he speaks the lines, "My gorge rises at it (his skull)" meaning his throat rises at it.  I always took this to mean his spirit was moved to the point of being choked up!  There are quite a few scenes in this film that bring me to that point.  To me these aren't superficial feelings, as in other films, but touches the spirit, and that is why I feel that Forrest Gump is more than a film, but a life lesson.
