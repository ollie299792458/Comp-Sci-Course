First of all I would like to say that Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton are two of my favorite actor's. Both of them are very believable in their parts as I would expect from them. My problem with this movie has nothing to do with the characters or acting.

The movie was just so incredibly boring that I could hardly finish it. About half way through it I found myself wanting to turn it off. There is nothing to get excited about and really no action at all. The whole story is just a dud in my opinion. I found it to be a huge disappointment considering DeNiro and Norton are the main characters. DeNiro and Norton were both in "The Score" and that was a fantastic movie so I guess I was expecting much more.

This IS NOT a movie to watch with the kids. There is nudity and a lot of really nasty language, I mean a lot.

Another thing that bugs me is the horrible scratching background noise throughout the movie. It really gets annoying after a while. The noise is supposed to be the noise that Norton's character is hearing in his head but it really got on my nerves.

Not to mention that the ending is horrible and leaves you hanging and wondering. It's almost like the movie just stopped in the middle. At the end we were like that's it?

I know that some will certainly disagree with me but this movie was a waste of time in my opinion and I wouldn't recommend it.
