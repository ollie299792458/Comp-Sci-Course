Episodes 4 and 5, the last two of the series.  Other's have explained what happened in these in more detail then me, but I will give my review on the series.  The animation was great throughout the whole series, it didn't "die down" as the series progressed like I have seen in other series.  Belldandy is a truely beutiful character that I think just about any guy would love to have as a girlfriend.  Both for her looks and her personality.  The voice over actors on the english dub were very good throughout the whole series as well.  
The story itself was ok.  It was really good at keeping your attention.  I couldn't wait to see what was in the next episode or how it was going to end.  Although some parts were very predictable to the outcome.  The lack of violence and nudity is what makes this series a must have.
Since this is the end of the series, how does it transition to the movie, Ah! My Goddess?  I actually watched the movie before the series, and both are seperate from each other.  You don't HAVE to see the series to understand the movie, and the series offers some closure so you don't have to see the movie, although I highly recommend it.  Although you probably should see both because there are a couple references in the movie that a lot of people might not understand if they didn't see the series.
This series is a highly recommended addition to any Anime fan's collection.  The humor, the romance (and I am not even a romance movie person), all make for a great series you can enjoy again and again.
