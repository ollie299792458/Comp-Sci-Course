This movie has to be the best of all sequels. First off, it is a theatrical release and not some out of tv land, bad movie production like the rest of the sequels.

The very first Crow movie is of course, the BEST.

And when I first saw City Of Angels, I was doing what everybody was and comparing it to the first with Brandon Lee.

But really, this movie is actually pretty cool in its own respect.

The visuals were great, color toned this time which is a nice variety to the first film which was more blue and bleak (which was excellent). Vincent Perez was actually not bad as the new Crow and since he's not supposed to be Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)

I can totally forgive the fact the he doesnt carry the original's trademarked personality.

MIA KIRSHNER IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!

She plays a good roll of the now grown up version of Sarah from the first movie.

Iggy Pop is awesome and though hes no actor, he definitely plays the sleezeball a$$h@le very very well.

Judah Earl is an ok villain but not much in comparison to Top Dollar from the first film. He's not as charismatic nor really tells anything about his origin.

The horrible tragedy is good enough to push viewers with the Crow to have his revenge on the bad guys.

The ending of the movie is pretty good, but Id have made it a little more dramatic to contrast the harshness of the film.

The music, again, a very cool selection of rock music throughout which brings more quality and movement to the atmosphere.

Overall, I do recommend the purchase of this film unlike the last 2 that recently came out.
