Though the movie shows the Algerian war for independence from the Arab side, it is remarkably fair at showing both sides in the confrontation between the Europeans/French and the Arabs. 
This is not a good guys vs. bad guys film - it shows the horror and terror of war, particularly the horrors of terrorism against civilians. You watch as the French, the most civilized, cosmopolitan of any Europeans get dragged down to the brutality and hatred of the Arab terrorists (which is the terrorists aim) - then you watch in admiration as the French Army marches in and deals with the situation.
I was rooting for the French army against the terrorists and the politicians back in Paris. This is a good movie to learn about the struggle that America now has with Arab and Muslim terrorists. One must be as tough and as brutal as the terrorists, but also keep the honor, civilized standards of our higher culture. 
I highly recommend this film. Perhaps the director will do a new film on the horrible state of Algeria now that it is ruled by the Arabs - Islamic fundamentalist terrorism - the carnage goes on today.
