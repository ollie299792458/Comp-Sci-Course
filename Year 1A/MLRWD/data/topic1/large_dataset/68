this old fashion western  movie "Silverado" was extremly exciting with lot's of action. If you a kind of person like me who likes movies with action and adventure, this moving is the right one for  you. This movie has everything anyone wants . "Silverado"has comedy, action , and adventure . this movie is wonderful, it makes you feel like you are the one in the movie. telling you ,you must watch it!!!
what  makes movie good is making it seem real and Silverado  has done it . Also that it has to be exciting and this movie has done it .
"Silverado"  was great you should watch it.
also the sound track was off the hook  it went along with every scene that had a  sound track in it.
this western movie was different  compared to  other  western movies because this one wasn't confusing or boring. I think the soundtrack was awsome.
I think that the little extra sences helped me understand  the movie more.I recommend this movie to anyone and  everyone, even to people who don't like westerns  because I hated westerns too.
