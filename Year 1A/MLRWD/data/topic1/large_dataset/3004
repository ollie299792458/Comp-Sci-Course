I wanted to like this film.  I enjoyed Get Shorty a great deal- thought it was clever and fun.  I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer and Vince Vaughn, but this movie does not work.  At the beginning of the film, there is an inside hollywood joke about sequels- the people who made this film should have listened to their own joke.  James Woods is in the movie until he dies very early- which is the best role for anyone in this film.  The film, which takes Travolta's Chili Palmer character from the movies into the music business feels thrown together, and terribly long.  There are music performances by the Black Eyed Peas and Aerosmith, which sound and look great on the DVD, and Vince Vaughn has his moments as a white guy trying to be black but for the most part- it is just long, silly and pointless.  There is a subplot about Russians who are trying to kill Palmer that does not need to be in there and Thurman, who plays Woods' widow, really does not show the spark that comes out in Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction or any number of her other roles.  One small bright spot is The Rock, who has a nice role as a gay, driver, thug actor wanna-be.  Add this movie to the list of films which prove that sequels are a bad idea.  Although Thurman and Travolta dance together again, skip this one and watch Pulp Fiction again.  F. Gary Gray, who directed this mess, had a good effort with the Italian Job, but he should take note of this film, since he is working on the sequel to that movie as well.
