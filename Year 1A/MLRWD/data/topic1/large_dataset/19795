Jaime Foxx gives a sensational performance during his portrayal of the musical legend Ray Charles.  As someone who often focuses on non-verbal communication, I was most impressed by Foxx's mannerisms.  With Foxx's acting and musical talents (he went to college on a classical piano scholarship), he truly is by far and away the best actor for this role!  Foxx's tone, voice infliction, and commitment to be blind (his eyelids were shut using silicon synthesis during all shooting days) during the role were also astounding.

Taylor Hackford (director and producer) shows you Ray at his most vulnerable times (addiction, possible loss of family) and at his most successful times (Ray inked a record deal that was better than Frank Sinatra's at the time).  In the bonus footage, Hackford comments that the film was 15 years in the making; more directors would gladly wait 15 years if they were certain to make a film as memorable as Ray.  The music is astounding and the supporting characters are memorable.  Overall, this film is as enjoyable to watch on the 9th time as it is on the 1st.
