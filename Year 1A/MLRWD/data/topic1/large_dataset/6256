When seeing this movie for the first time during its initial release my first thought was, "What are they thinking?!" I HATED the film. It was simply too different from the previous outings.
Then something happened that I can't fully explain. For some reason I watched the movie a second time...and a third...and a fourth...the off-beat humor and storyline seemed to get better with each repeated viewing.
This movie is now one of my favorites in the Superman series. Richard Pryor is a comic delight, and Christopher Reeves is superb as always. A scene in which a deranged Superman straightens out the Leaning Tower of Pisa (much to the chagrin of the Pisa souvenir stand operator) never fails to bring a smile to my face.
If you take the Superman legend seriously, avoid this movie. If, on the other hand, you have fond memories of the 60s version of "Batman," give Superman III a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.
This being said, I will not be purchasing the DVD. Warner's has chosen to release only a 2:35 anamorphic transfer of the film. This will no doubt look superb on a large-screen digital set, but such transfers look pathetic on standard NTSC. The DVD player must perform its own "letterboxing" for such a transfer if you don't have the proper set, and this degrades the image even more.
Warner, how about releasing a full-frame version for those of us who can't afford a state-of-the-art setup, and have no desire to sit three feet from the screen?
