This entire movie is fun, from start to finish, while never losing it's characters or it's overall theme. This is one trilogy the directors never screwed up on and let "lag". Indy is there and recognizable throughout all three movies, with memorable and often hilarious sidekicks of various ages and nationalities.
  Also worth mentioning is the care that the directors took with the plot development, taking place roughly around the time of World War 2. Usually always, searching for the grail and other sacred objects are Hitler and his minions. Hitler was supposedly very interested in the occult, and they take it to a very hilarious level during a particular book burning scene in Berlin, which is perhaps one of my favorite scenes in all the Indiana Jones movies.
  In this movie, the supporting characters are particularly memorable. Indy begins the search for his vanished father and when he finds him, the action does not lag. They argue throughout the entire film. Indy is also understandably horrified to find out that they shared a particular love interest which had me rolling on the floor laughing in certain parts.
  This movie also treats us to flashbacks of Indy's childhood, (boy scouts) and attempts to explain his fear of snakes and when he first acquired the whip and his famous hat. We see a more vulnerable Indy as he is constantly hilariously and unintentionally taken down a few pegs by his absent minded father.
  "I thought we named the dog Indiana?"
