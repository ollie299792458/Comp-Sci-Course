A previous suggestion that the customer has a possible illegal copy is not likely to be correct.

However, the releases to date of this movie exhibit a very poor low resolution grainy image. I can't imagine with the technology of the year which it was shot it being as bad as it is.
No, it wasn't created this way to portray the era, it's just bad.
Not only the vision, but the audio also suffers from extremely poor dynamics and sounds flat. Strangely the CD Soundtracks of the movie are fine?
A review on the Amazon UK site states that the releases in France and Australia are good. Sorry, the Australian release is the one I have reviewed here.
The release in France is not known to me, I looked on the French site for possible reviews but alas I cannot read.
I loved this movie mainly for the music, even with the poor quality and am hoping for the Bluray to become available which may be created from more skillful hands!

Edit: Have just received and viewed the very recent Blu-ray release. This is fabulous in all respects and I don't understand how the DVD was ever released in such poor condition.
This new BR however was well worth the wait and will become one of my favourites. Seeing it now with such an improvement in quality has made the tremendous scope in the making of it much more apparent.
The latest sound mix in DTS HD Master is fantastic and the video reflects very much the feel of the time.
