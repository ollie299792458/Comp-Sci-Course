I usally don't like re-makes...

...but when you are remaking films from the early era of movies, before people had a concept of how to act, how to write a script, etc. Then it is alright with me, ecspecially when it comes to Dracula, Frankenstein, and of course The Fly. All of which have been recently remade, and done to capture what the original films failed to from the books or just could not given that the original actors and effects were so drab.

 Willard is light years ahead of the original Crispin does a PERFECT job, infact this role must have been made for him!

 If you are looking for scary, that you will not find, unless of course you are afraid of rats. On the other hand, if you have ever been the underdog, the guy who takes crap from people all day. Be it your co-workers, your boss, your teachers, what ever. If in general you have been treated unfairly and been given the shaft by "the man", or just hate our corrupt system in gernal. Then this movie is for you, the underdog! It is the horror/drama equivilent of Napoleon Dynomite, Angus, Revenge Of The Nerds, etc. :)

 The acting was perfect, the sound track VERY amusing. There is VERY limited use of CGI! What more can you ask for!?

That's all I can say, just watch it!
