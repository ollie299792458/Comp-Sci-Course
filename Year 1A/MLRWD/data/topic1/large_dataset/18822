Commando does for action movies in the 1980's what The Dirty Dozen did for the same genre in the 1960's. It totally reinvented it. First of all, you can't take it seriously like so many critics have, because it's so  hilariously absurd. The bad guys, and I like to refer to them as "the  bad guys" since they are perfect comic book material, kidnap  Schwarzenegger's daughter and he goes to get her back. In the process he  shoots about 500 guys all by himself and comes out with a single shrapnel  wound and his daughter. Lots of machine guns, grenades, stabbings, tons of  shooting, stuff blowing up constantly every couple minutes - all that's  here in rapid fire progression, so there is NEVER one dull minute.  Schwarzenegger also delivers some terrific one-liners, as other viewers  have mentioned. 
  One of the really great things about Commando is the  actors. While not an actor's movie, like JFK or Hoffa, the actors really do  a good job. Dan Hedaya is sadistically inept - probably more inept than the  bad guys in Last Action Hero. The first four or five that he kills are the  most stumbling, fumbling serious looking villains I've seen on film.
  Other attractions: Arnie gets wiped out by a car while running through a  mall parking lot and gets back up via his momentum and contiunues running!  Arnie jumps out of an airplane into a swamp while in air! Arnie punches  the, I guess, dashboard of an airplane - and makes it magically lift up in  time to clear a boat after an uzi battle! Arnie also swings from the  rafters of a shopping mall like Tarzan with somebody shooting at him. Then  he chases the guy into a phone booth, picks it up, and press slams it!
  If you're an action film fan, there is NO going wrong with Commando - it  will satisfy the hardest to satisfy for action.
