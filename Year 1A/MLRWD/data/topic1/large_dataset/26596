This the movie that earned Ben Kingsley a best supporting actor nomination. He played Gandhi but you'd never believe it after seeing him in this part as a psychotic Cockney crook. He is so intense and scary -- really spooky! It's an English film about a couple of retired crooks and their wives who are enjoying a leisurely life in Spain. Then they get a call from London from one of their former cohorts, who intends to make one of them an 'offer he can't refuse' to go back to London and take part in a job. The former crook REALLY, REALLY doesn't want to come out of retirement and there is the crux of the matter. The four ex-patriots are really likeable and it's hard not to envy their idyllic lifestyle, so it makes you feel the intensity of their desire NOT to stir things up and get caught up in the old, bad times. It was really a good movie, very different, with some unexpectedly likeable characters and some actors that have always been likeable in previous roles who definitely are NOT likeable in this one. It isn't so much violent as very tense with a slowly building anticipation of violence to come that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is great and this is that rare thing -- an original movie.
