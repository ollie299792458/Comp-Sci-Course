I've always been a fan of this movie ever since I first saw it years ago. Unfortuantely, it looked like it was a forgotten gem among the slasher craze of the 80's. This underrated gem didn't see any love for it's first DVD, so I was really excited to see that it was finally getting the special edition that it deserves.

The movie itself is a great atmospheric monster flick. Pumpkinhead looks incredibly life-like. The monster FX are amazing, especially considering its age. The cinematography is another plus. The colors used in specific parts really enhance the creepy mood Winston set out to create, as does the music. There is a little bad acting and writing, and the ending is a little anti-climatic, but overall it's a great horror flicks with a nice, creepy atmosphere that makes it perfect to watch around Halloween.

The extras were one of the main attractions here, and they deliver. The "Pumpkinhead Unearthed" 6 part documentary is what the fans are looking for. They run a little over an hour together and have some nice interviews with the cast and crew on specific parts of production. It would have been nice to get more them in the interviews, but it was good enough. The "demonic toys" featurette is just a little interview with the guy who sculpted the Pumpkinhead figures. Nothing real exciting there. The "BTS footage" is pretty cool, but way too short. The "still gallery" has some really nice BTS set pics. Also, I don't know if this is a new film transfer or not, but it looks gorgeous playing on my Sony Upconverting DVD player and Bravia HDTV. The only real problem I have is the audio, which is barely enhanced for surround sound.

Overall, it's a great release for a real forgotten gem. The features are a little lacking, but it's good enough and great to see Pumpkinhead get the treatment he deserves.
