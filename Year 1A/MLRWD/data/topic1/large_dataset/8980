Well, if you HAVE to 'sit alone in your room', why not watch 'Cabaret'?  I saw this movie again for the first time in many years, and I was bowled over by Bowles! Although the 'Sally Bowles' of 'Cabaret' has little in  common with the very English character of Christopher Isherwood's original  books, Liza Minnelli nevertheless delivers the finest performance of her  career as the 'divinely decadent' cabaret singer, caught up in a Berlin at  the VERY worst time.  For viewers who don't enjoy musicals because of the  implausible 'bursting into song', 'Cabaret' confines all its musical  numbers to the stage of 'The Kit-Kat Club', so 'Cabaret' works absolutely  as a 'straight' narrative, too. Much more than a tale of a kooky girl and  her gay best friend, 'Cabaret' has a very dark, very chilling subtext, and  the final shot of a swastika on the arm of an anonymous patron of 'The  Kit-Kat Club' sends a shiver down the spine as we realise the horrific  consequences awaiting - not only the characters in 'Cabaret' - but the rest  of the world.
