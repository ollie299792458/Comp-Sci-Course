Fujishima Kyosuke has got my vote for "Most Sugar-Coated OAV Writer  of the Decade" award (Miyazaki would get "Most Sugar-Coated  Writer"). Even his "villians" aren't very nasty -- more  troublesome than truly evil. A!MG! is so sweet, that you'll want to keep  your toothbrush handy. But I didn't find it sickening. In fact, A!MG! has  the unique distinction of being the first videotape series that we've worn  out to such a point that we've had to purchase three sets of tapes, and  then the LD's. Why? It's because it's so nice, to the point of being  idyllic. Morisato Keichi (Kikuchi Masami) is a fairly typical junior in  college, who can't seem to find a girlfriend if his life depended on it.  When Belldandy ends up being his constant companion, his own uncertainty  and naivete really hinders his attempts to "put the moves" on his  new female room-mate. To top it all off, add Megumi, his younger sister  who's decided to move in because she'll be a junior in the same college as  Keiichi (she has an especially memorable introduction!) Characterisations  aside, the story is very simple -- your typical "boy meets girl  goddess" script. Animation is nothing spectacular, but the detail of  the backgrounds are good, and the colour choices are strikingly beautiful  at times. Both the opening and closing themes are catchy, sung by the  "Goddess Fan Club" (Inoue Kikuko, Tohma Yumi and Hisakawa Aya).  Light comedy -- a good video to watch when you really want to escape. (An  little trivia point to note -- those old temples you see featured in a lot  of anime -- yes, the floors are damnned cold, even in the middle of  summer.)
