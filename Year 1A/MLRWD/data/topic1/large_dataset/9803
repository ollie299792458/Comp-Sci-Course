The Cider House Rules is a movie that is both entertaining on the surface and filled with symbolism on a deeper level.  This movie will please teenagers out for a good time and movie critics looking to analyze a movie rich in meaning.
To describe breifly the plot, a young man, Homer (an orphan from birth), ventures outside of his accustomed surroundings, as all young people eventually do.  He finds himself living on an apple orchard plantation, earning his living as a field picker.  During his time there, he falls in love with a woman who is already spoken for while he's living with the other hired hands in the "Cider House".  The movie's namesake comes from a list of rules posted in the hand's quarters.  Posted by the orchard's owner, the rules hardly relate to the servants or their behavior. By showing how "lower" people are effected by the regulations of "higher" people, the rules encumber the movies entire theme.
Homer is a unique inspiration to the other workers and is well respected in the orchard.  Homer defies the theme because he is a white man thrown in with a group of black plantation workers, yet he aspires to learn and grow from them, reversing the idea converyed by the rules.
Homer's character shines hope on the human race and brightens the movie through his inspiration.  The Cider House Rules is a breath of fresh air and leaves the viewer feeling refreshed.  Homer's good will makes the movie and success - hands down.
