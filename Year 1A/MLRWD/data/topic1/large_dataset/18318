I thought the acting was fantastic! Good story. Good characters. Good morals/values overall.  The family scene at dinner was wonderful - very realistic, in my experience. In fact, the whole movie was realistic, along with being uplifting. I loved the positive way the family of the main character (Eduardo Verastegui) was portrayed. They weren't "dysfunctional".  They actually liked each other and had fun together!

As mentioned in another review, the movie is a bit shakey in the beginning, which I didn't like, but not enough to rate the movie lower than 4.9 stars.  Also, I initially thought the girl in the beginning of the movie was the same little girl as from the main character's past - which didn't make sense, of course - because both girls looked alike and had similar hairdo's.  But again, it's forgivable.

We took several of our children to see the movie (having seen it by myself first).  Our 9 year old liked it, although I don't know how much she understood.  The 12 and 14 year olds definitely got it and liked it. I will let them watch it again.  However - the main female character IS pregnant, out of wedlock, with no father of the baby in the picture - AND - they do show a scene with her going to an abortion clinic (nothing graphic) - which may bring up some touchy subjects, so be forewarned. If you aren't ready to discuss it with your children, you may want to wait for them to see it.

Looking forward to having it in my collection!
