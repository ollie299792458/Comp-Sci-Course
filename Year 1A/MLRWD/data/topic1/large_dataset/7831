I knew some kickboxing techniques before I bought this pack (Kathy Smith's Kickboxing for one, which is amazing), so I only scanned the instructional tape.  But if you have never done this before, then use the instructional tape a few times before progressing.  The basic tape is a solid workout that helps develop the muscles you need to do the advanced tape.  
The advanced tape is a very strong workout.  At first I thought his inspirational motivation was kind of hokey, but as the workout progressed, I really started to like it.  During the floor work, which is very challenging, he really keeps me going.  There is one exercise, however, that smarts and it feels like he talks forever.  But I keep with it and have really seen my body become more developed and my balance is a lot stronger.  
My only complaint is that there is not any streching.  In the advanced tape there is one strech after the leg work, which is definitely not sufficient.  The tape ends with squats which are a great way to cool down, but then it just stops.  I stretch on my own, because I feel that stretching is an integral part of exercising.
Overall, this is a great workout.  When I first started kickboxing workouts, I was frustrated because it took me a few times to get the moves and it took me even longer to get strong enough to really work the moves.  But it is worth it.  I feel stronger, more centered and definitely look stronger and more defined.
