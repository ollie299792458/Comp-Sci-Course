Until this movie came out, the public never got a glimpse of Jack Kevorkian, Man but always Jack Kevorkian, Dr. Death. In this movie which, of course, deals with his euthanasia advocacy, we see the "human" side of him: his hobbies, relationships, eccentricities, strengths, and weaknesses. He is exceptionally intelligent and yet has little common sense (does he, perhaps, have Asperger's syndrome?). Al Pacino was perfectly cast as Kevorkian and made the character equally serious and funny and completely believable. This movie also includes footage from Kevorkian's consultations, and anybody on the fence about the issue of euthanasia, I suspect, would come down to Kevorkian's side once seeing how these patients are suffering and how badly they want to die and why that is best for them. It's also emotionally gripping. You want to yell at Kevorkian for defending himself in court (a fool for a client as they say) and essentially sabotaging himself, but more than that you want to yell at the court that convicted him. This was a horrible travesty of justice. I am certain Kevorkian will be one of those people universally regarded as a hero-- long after his death.

Bottom line: A very important film about a very important issue: everybody should see it.
