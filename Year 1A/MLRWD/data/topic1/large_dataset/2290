This movie describes a time that was and hopefully never will be again. Under the narrative of a love story, it skillfully encapsulates the transition from a Bourgeois era in Russia to Communism and all its dark and ugly faces.  Lean's cinematography is unprecedented and is only rivalled or bettered by that of Kubrick.  Omar Sharif's finest role perhaps, he plays a Russian doctor and budding poet/auteur torn between two worlds and a desire to escape reality just to find happiness even if it is only short lived. Julie Christie plays an admirable role as his 'true love'. The breathtaking scenery mixed with brutal reality, the tragic expressions and the lugubrious wetness in Sharif's eyes, the close-ups that are somehow softened to give an ethereal feel to the whole thing, make this a must see in a person's lifetime. It is a necessity in fact, if one wants to appreciate the visual arts at their best and least controversial. It is a universal film and appeals to a selective audience as well as a more general one. Oh yes, the music throughout is fantastic too and helps to give the film a memorable feel.
