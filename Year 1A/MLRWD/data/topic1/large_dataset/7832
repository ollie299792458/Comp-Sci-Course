Ever since I first saw this film I have been absolutely in love with this movie. I typically rarely watch a movie more than every few years or not often over 3-5 times in my life.
I have probably seen this film over 30 times, and I can't get over how well done this whole film was. The acting is excellent, especially with Scott and Dourif. The thing that grabbed me most about the film was the mood of the film, it feels so creepy throughout. Its got such smart lighting, film shots, and great creepy sounds/noises that really add to the effect to keep you engrossed in the film.
Even the great dry humour in the film really adds to this experience.
Its unfortunate that the DVD is so bare bones and without any audio commentary. Hard core fans of this film have been waiting patiently for a quality DVD release of this film and it seems we will have to wait much longer.
A film like this doesn't come along often and for people who enjoy horror films this one is a must have for your collection.. If nothing else for the hospital scene that scares people like few scenes in horror have.
