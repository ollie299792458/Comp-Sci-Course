Like many people, I've seen this movie many times! It's got a great cast. John Travolta is very proud of this movie too. He definetly makes his mark on this movie. It's still the best movie he has ever done -- as what he has said when being interviewed -- the man himself.

The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, and it has some great moments in it. It's one of those movies where you just watch it for fun.

It doesn't really have a plot, and doesn't need one. Just about people graduating from High School who are happy about the life ahead of them!

Only one thing, the last time I watched it, the people in it look too old!!! They are suppose to be in high school, but they are 10 years older than the age they are suppose to be betraying! I noticed that so much the last time I watched it! It did spoil it.

It's one of those really popular culture things that I do agree with that is great!

I prefer non-commercial things generally, but blast it! If something is good, it's good!
