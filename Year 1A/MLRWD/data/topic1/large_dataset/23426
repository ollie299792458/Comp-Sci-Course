Billy once said that when he's sad and meloncholic he writes the comedies, and when he's joyous and exuberant he writes the dramas. So what state was he in when he and Diamond wrote this masterpiece; not necessarily a comedy and not necessarily a drama - just like life, which is truly Wilder's greatest gift as a filmmaker.  
Perhaps at the top of his game when he made this, Wilder handles every scene with the deft perfection that only a handful of directors could do. I saw this film back in '98 when Curtis Hanson (of L.A. Confidental and Wonder Boys) screened a glorious print at UCLA, and Wilder's command of the widescreen image for a "contained" film is beyond brilliant. It's almost a shame to see this film on a TV (widescreen or not). The snappy writing and honest performances from Lemmon and McClaine easily belong as part of the hi-lites of their careers. Seeing Fred McMurray play the role of the scandalous cad is another masterstroke (remember Wilder first worked with McMurray in Double Indemnity), and the supporting work by Ray Walston rounds out a perfect-pitch picture the likes we'll never again.
Astoundingly based on true life events of Hollywood during the 50s.
