This is a film that started with a clever premise of a good "seed" idea and demonstrates to any serious film buff, just how important having a story is for a film.  It's a classic example of what formula writing is all about as it supports the concept that Hollywood is run by "C" students.
Having been a screenwriter and amateur filmmaker myself for many years now, I can appreciate how difficult it is to make a good movie.  However, you have to know the rules to break the rules, and this film shows that it's still in grammar school.
An entertaining film with no substance and less story, but for someone who doesn't want to be stimulated, it's a perfect piece of work.  There are so many examples of what not to do in making a movie here it's hard to know where to start, so I'll just keep it simple.  Here's my formal statement regarding this Domestic Disturbance:
This movie proves beyond the shadow of doubt that good acting cannot salvage a bad script, although a good script can make a bad actor look good.
My hat's off to John T and Vince V. for their efforts as their acting was strong (not great, but at least they made the effort).  A fine supporting cast, well acted, but an uninspired story that took us nowhere new.  A DVD to add to your collection if you're an aspiring filmmaker or film buff that would like to have an example of what "not to do" in storytelling.
