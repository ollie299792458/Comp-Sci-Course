The only thing that distinguishes this mess of a movie from Ed Wood's amateurish flicks is the sporadically better cinematography... Story line is only marginally interesting with clumsy dialogue, inept pacing, and plot credibility holes you could drive a 13 Spd, 450 Hp, 17 ton Peterbilt flatbed through... with room to spare.  Also lots of shameless steals from George Romero: ground camera angles and direction during first cemetery scene, the catatonic heroine almost a carbon copy of the girl in NOLD,.... etc etc etc.

What really gets annoying is the incessant electronic music (?) score  with quavery oh-so-scary one note 'flying saucer noises' which were already passe by the 1950s. Even Arthur Kennedy embarrassingly chews the scenery; but what else can he do with the high-school level script and dialogue here?

This is ultimately the same old boring hack and slice bloody flick without any redeeming features whatsoever. Don't waste your time and money; stick to Romero.
