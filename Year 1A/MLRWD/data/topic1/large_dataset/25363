Stark "ghost story" that some may compare to "Sixth Sense" yet, in my opinion, the two movies have little in common except on a very superficial level. The title, to me, only made sense upon a second viewing in the same way as its symbolism did. But then, I always watch movies I like more than once: the first time for the plot, the rest for the subtleties... The movie itself has none of the "sophistication" and the slickness of the typical American production. It is a raw and graphic drama set during the Spanish Civil War in a physically hostile landscape that fully complements the story. Although some questions remain unanswered at the end, I did not find this disturbing because, somehow, they were intellectual questions, rather than flaws in the plot. In other words, the answers were, somehow, not essential to the story. I would recommend this film simply because it is an excellent example of a "different" kind of movie making. Beyond that, it is convincingly acted, refreshingly and satisfylingly exotic. And eminently watchable.
