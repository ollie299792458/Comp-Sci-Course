I really loved the first Rambo with all the emotions and action and the sequels were pretty good, but this new one is AMAZING !!!  There's a few slow parts but the rest is pure entertainment =)

It reminds me of the earlier ones where Stallone has left society again to live an easier and peaceful life, than he gets dragged back into fighting because it's what he was born to do.  Now he's helping some christians out in the jungles and once he gets started with the killing it only rests for a tiny bit.

The end scene where he massacres what has to be over 100 people was really fun to see =)  Me and my brother were joking that we saw more people killed in 5 minutes of Rambo than every other movie put together LOL.  It's a really neat and quick ending and after the killing John Rambo finally finds peace in a really beautiful way =)

I can't wait for this to come out!  I keep hearing that the movie companies are going to start releasing DVDs the same day as the theater releases, and this is DEFINATLEY one movie that I would get on Day 1.
