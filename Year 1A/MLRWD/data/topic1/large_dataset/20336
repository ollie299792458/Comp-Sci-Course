This is my favorite John Wayne movie along with Rio Lobo a close second.

What makes Big Jake a timeless movie is the opening comparison of the 1909 world of the west and the 1909 world of the civilized world in cities.

If one examines for example, September 11, 2001. In America on that day you had people living peaceful lives and yet in the world under terrorist rules they were carrying out an attack on America.

This is the base of Big Jake. A group of outlaws cross the border led by Richard Boone in an outstanding performance of old time terrorists who kidnap John Wayne's grandson (played by his real life grandson) and murder the ranch staff.

The Texas Rangers try a rescue and are wiped out..and it all comes to John Wayne, his son Patrick playing his son, Christopher Mitchem (son of Robert Mitchem) and Bruce Cabot (an outstanding actor who was barred from working by the Hollywood left and only got jobs due to John Wayne)

All actors, including a brief outlaw appearance by Harry Carey jr. turn in Oscar performances.

This movie is about family, holding up what is right and not rewarding wrong and it takes people with true grit to get things done and not the squeemish. (quote from the movie)

This is a wonderful movie that in a fanciful way you always thought Mr. Wayne reacted with his children in real life, loving and strong.

You will not regret watching this movie nor under appreciate it's nuances.
