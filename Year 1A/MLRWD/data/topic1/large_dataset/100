One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time. This movie has it all. It has murder mystery. It has misunderstood young men. It has hoodlums. It has flashbacks. And it has cussing cause it's cool. Although none of these actors, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland, went on to make very major careers, maybe in River Phoenix's case because of his suicide, they all gave very convincing performances. The story was phenomenally captivating.From the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun. It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor. All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities. The only thing I didn't like was the end where they told us what became of the boys as adults, and said the "bad boy" was going to turn his life around but was stabbed. Stephen King seems to like to kill kids (another example of this is "The Mist" where the father is forced to shoot his own son). This movie is a timeless classic. I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children.
