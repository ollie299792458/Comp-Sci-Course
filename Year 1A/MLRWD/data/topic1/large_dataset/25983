*Suddenly* is an intriguing little film about a plot to assassinate the POTUS (President of the United States).  The premise is groundbreaking, considering the period it was made in, the "I Like Ike" years.  
Frank Sinatra is pretty good as the wack job hired by some unknown plotters for the job of whacking the Prez.  There's some decent acting from a few of the supporting players, especially the one who plays the old retired Secret Service agent.  Sterling Hayden, whom I really like in *Asphalt Jungle* and *The Godfather*, doesn't shine for me in this one.  I'll bet he was bored.  
The trouble with *Suddenly* is that it's a low-budget thriller that set its sights too high.  You simply can't believe that a big-buck-backed assassination plot could really transpire like this.  It's just too hokey.  At the same time I give the film credit for making the old college try.  'Cause that's what *Suddenly* feels like--a film-college noir, strong on bold concepts but weak in the pocketbook and experience.  Having a gang of desperados headed by a maniac impersonate a team of FBI agents so as to knock off the president was a brilliant idea for a film of '54, but this idea, great as it was, is stillborn in *Suddenly.* If it had been about a train heist or a small town bank robbery, it could have worked a lot better. 
I'm a personal friend of Alan Wexler, son of the late Paul Wexler who played the deputy sherrif, Slim.  He gets shot (but not killed) when trying to arrest one of the gang.  Al has a lot of cool stories about growing up in Hollywood during the '50's and 60's.  He was just a little runt when *Suddenly* was made so he doesn't remember much about that one.  Still, it's a part of his life, and as his good buddy, it's a part of mine too.  Get *Suddenly* and get nostalgic.
