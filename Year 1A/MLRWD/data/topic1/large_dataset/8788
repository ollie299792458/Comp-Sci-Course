I'm a freethinking moderate, leaning toward liberal ideologies because they make more sense. I didn't really like farenheit 911 because of the irrelevant personal story of the lady at the end, but at least that story was TRUE. celsius starts out good, pointing out the fact that liberals try to brainwash people just as much as republicans do. they also pointed out france's real motive against Iraq war, which was as economical as America's assertion for iraq war. however, the end of celsius was terrible: they talk about the threat of iraq, bush as a leader, and kerry as a flip flop, but no evidence was provided, which makes them all republican propaganda. No true evidence was provided, and only a bunch of republicans were giving their opinions about why it was necessary to go into iraq. this one guy said, "There are WMD, period." Of course, even Bush says now there isn't, so you see how biased Celsius can be toward the end. Basically, farenheit would be more convincing to a rational person. Moore provided DOCUMENTS that DIRECTLY relate Bush to Saudi Arabia, and those things trouble me more than anything mentioned in celsius.
