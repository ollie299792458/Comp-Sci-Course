Ok, so I looked at the Boston Globe's 50 scariest movies list. Some titles on that list are pretty good: Evil Dead, Amityville, Poltergeist, Hills Have Eyes...

Thus when I saw this one on their list, and their review said it was pretty scary, I went for it.

The beginning doesn't start too bad, things start out slowly in the house. There is the scary dog, the kid going slowly down the stairs leading to the basement... In an earlier scene the mad parents scream at their girl about a missing fork. While the parents look away shortly, the girl retrieves the fork from a vent in the wall, given to her by a hand.

But then later, the movie falls into a banal bad guy shoots the good guy kind of thing. Yeah, there are some people living in the basement and crawling between the walls, but their story is never known, and they are not even scary. Just some makeup, that's about it. Are they zombies, are they alive, we never know. The scare factor doesn't go very far. In a later scene, the police comes to the house, in which the owner already shot hundreds of bullets. Miraculously, the house is intact, and the owners give tea and cookies to the police officers who remark that "you have very nice furniture". Duh. How about a scene where a hand sticks out of a vent and grabs a cookie while an officer isn't watching? Nope.

Wes Craven has done better. I didn't even like the house setting. Oh well.

You have been warned. At the end of the movie, I was yawning. No wait, how can you dynamite a house and it still remains standing, though the chimneys fly like rockets? &lt;yawn>
