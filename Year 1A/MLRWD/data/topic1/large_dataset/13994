So many people have commented on the humor, philosophy, cinematography, acting, and other aspects of Groundhog Day.  To avoid belaboring it, I will simply say that this movie is excellent in all of those ways!

I just want to speak about some funny things that aren't usually mentioned first when speaking about this movie.  There were humorous moments - both blatant and subtle - throughout the movie that just add to its masterpiece quality.  For example, the whole scene where Murray is dressed like "Bronco," and he's just purchased an EXTREMELY expensive car in which to take his date (dressed like a French maid) to a movie that he's seen "a hundred times" just splits my sides open every time I see it!  The Spaghetti Western music, and the expressions on Murray's face in this scene are just over-the-top funny!  And don't forget Murray's line at seeing Nancy, a previous one-night stand to whom he proposed marriage: "My old fiance.  She doesn't remember me."  Hilarious.

Murray's dialogue during several "tapings" of the Groundhog festival are worth mentioning.  Examples include (forgive me if the quotes aren't word perfect):  the crowd "waiting to worship a rat!";  "You're hypocrites!  You used to take the hog out and you used to eat it!";  "A large squirrel predicting the weather";  and of course "Your winter is gonna be cold, and it's gonna last you for the rest..of..your.. life."

And finally, the segment with Murray and the two guys from the bowling alley going on the rampage in a car, being chased by police, is worth the price of admission by itself.  I think the "flapjacks" guy is a candidate for the funniest minor character in ANY comedy!

And, to quote the flapjack guy, "That about sums it up for me."
