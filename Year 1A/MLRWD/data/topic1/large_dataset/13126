I have always loved this film ever since I first saw it. It's a sort of black comedy, and doesn't hold back on the weirdness aspect. A big evil plant that drinks blood, some fun broadway songs, and in surprisingly good audio and visual quality makes this film a ball for me.

I could understand why some people might not like it though. It's weird. Very weird. Its darker humor, particularly with the dentist, might not be that funny to all audiences. I enjoy it though, then again I watch stuff like Torchwood and Rocky Horror.

Fans of the musical might not appreciate the altered ending. This dvd doesn't seem to have the original ending (which is bizarrely existential), but others might. If you want to see it I think I saw it on YouTube a while ago, so it might still be on there somewhere.

If you're a fan of musicals, I would definitely recommend seeing it though, just to get a taste of it. It's a cult classic, so you might be able to find a friend who has it before you buy (to see if you like it).
