The Road Warrior is a pretty incredible film that is not only the best of the Mad Max Trilogy, it's actually the only one of  the three that can be called a film of true quality.  The first Mad Max was nothing more than laughable B-movie fodder, while Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was simply a watered-down mutation of the second film for the gullible American audience and the greedy Hollywood executives hallucinating on dollar signs.  This second film, The Road Warrior, stands on its own two feet-and it stands the test of time.
  The Road Warrior is far from your average action movie.  Unlike the glamorized violence of movies like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, this film presents us with violence that is brutal, ugly, and unapologetic in its nihilism.  Dr. George Miller's direction is ungodly in its brilliantly calculated madness.  One can say that it has its own Chaos Theory.
  The Road Warrior succeeds, not just in the action, but also in the acting.  The cast manages  to flesh out its off-beat characters with a script of very little dialogue.  This is especially true with the character of Max, who is at the center of all this mayhem and who must have the least amount of dialogue of all the other main characters(the Feral Boy being the exception).  As Max, a charismatic and very young Mel Gibson gives a strong performance of quiet rage and smugness that gives his character the self-possession of a watchful cobra.  It's easy to see, in retrospect, how this young actor became a star.
  I know that as of late, many people have been hurling various expletives towards Mr. Gibson since his 2006 DUI arrest, and he may very well deserve them all.  He may be a drunken bigot and all-around jerk.  So what.  If I were to care about the character warts and blemishes of these artists-some of whom were racists, sexists, and even criminals- then my library of books, CDs and DVDs would be pretty anemic indeed.
