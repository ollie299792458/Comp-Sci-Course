After watching the film and reading many reviews here even the ones who gave the movie a 1 star, I have decided to write about what this movie meant to me.  Please if you have not watched the movie DO NOT READ THIS)To me this movie is about a life changing experience for the main character Nicholas Van Orton  Michael douglas). It is all about HIS journey that will teach him many things about life itself. He went from being in control of everything  finances, safety, commodity, friendships, trust) from being a millionaire to being a no body, to be humbled , to feel hunger, to feel insecurity, to feel despair, to feel fear, to feel poor. He gained a life changing experience and I only wish that money could buy what this man got from this "game." At the end of the movi you could feel he was not the same. You could feel his love for his ex wife.  in a "I apologize for everything" way) I think Nicholas at the end was very thankful that he had such an amazing journey. I mean ALL the things he experienced are things WE TOO should be able to experience once in a while. Maybe it will humble us to find a journey where we have no control over our lives.... yes it will sure be painful but worth it . It would be like taking everything we once knew JUST SO we could appreciate it. Wouldn't you love that?
