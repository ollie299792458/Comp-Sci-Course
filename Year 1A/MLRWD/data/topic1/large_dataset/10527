An American Werewolf in London is basically John Landis' take on The Wolfman.  (There's even an Easter Egg preview of the Wolfman on this Special Edition disc.)
  Instead of having the wolf walk on two legs Wolfman style, however, Landis hired famed makeup artist Rick Baker to design a werewolf that ran on all fours.  The results are much more frightening indeed.  While by today's standards the wolf may look tame, the transformation sequences and death scenes are very tense.
  And Landis, who dirceted many of the National Lampoon movies, doesn't forget to add in a healthy dose of humor here and there, and it works quite well.  The movie is somehow both very scary and very funny.
  This special edition disc is loaded with extras, including documentaries on the making of the wolf, behind the scenes, outtakes, interviews with John Landis, and recommendations for further viewing.
  It's a great horror film, shot beautifully with good makeup and creature effects.  Worth seeing.
