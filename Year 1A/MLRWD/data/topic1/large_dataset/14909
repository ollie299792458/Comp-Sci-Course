An interesting take on Othello for sure.  Acting was kind of awful through the first half, but got way better in the second half.

**** DO NOT SHOW THIS VIDEO IN CLASS!!! ****

Luckily I previewed the movie first, but it's not a suitable choice for English teachers.  This movie is ridiculously over-infused with unnecessary swearing... It's like swearing just for swearing's sake.  I'm no prude and can surely appreciate some strategically inserted cuss words to drive home a point, but this movie just swears to swear...

Secondly, there's a quite graphic and steamy love scene thrown in here with Desdemona having a full out 5 minute orgasm in slow motion. (Ohhhhh, THAT'S why the movie's called 'O')  Dont get me wrong, it was a hot scene, but again, not something I'd ever feel comfortable showing a group of high school kids. You'd certainly be fired if the principal came in while this scene was on!

THE BOTTOM LINE: A really cool modernization of a classic.  Even the characters names are the same; but it's quite disappointing that the producers went for such an over-the-top "R" rating, because it could have really been a great, educationally valuable rendition of a popular high school text.
