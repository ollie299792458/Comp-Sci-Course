I cannot believe that someone actually gave the go-ahead on this mighty loser.  There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is almost impossible to list them all, but I will list a few.
First off is the acting.  This is some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  Secondly is the editing.  The editing in this movie is almost non-existent.  There are scenes on the boat where it is raining and then the next shot it is not, and then the next shot it is raining again.  The horror/terror is so laughable that it is not even funny.  (if that even makes sense, but since I am reviewing this movie, I don't have to make sense.)
The plot does not make sense, nor do you really care what happens.  Did I mention how bad the acting was?
And again, the acting, it is soooo horrible that I could spend all day and night, and most likely a few more days, describing how bad it is.  All that combined equals the most horrible movie ever made, well, the most horrible movie next to "In the cut".  I enjoyed this movie far more than I enjoyed that Meg Ryan fiasco.
