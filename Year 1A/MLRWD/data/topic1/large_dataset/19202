A great film that I'm glad I finally got around to seeing after years of saying I would!

There is the wonderfully menacing presence of Brando, the complex character of Michael, played by Pacino and the epic ups and downs of the family, played out under the inspired direction of Ford Coppola.

One of the strongest parts of the film is the gradual and irreversable change in Pacino's character; from the respected war veteran at the beginning to a less subtle version of his violent, all powerful father by the end.

2 scenes stuck out for me in showing this beautfully. Firstly a scene in which he is trying to muster up the conviction to shoot the person who has made an attempt on his father's life, the suspense echoed by the sound of an impending train.  Secondly, near the end, the scene jumps between the christening of his own godson (and his own baptism) and the planned killing of all his foes by his design - showing the true extremes of his character and the depths of cold-hearted evil he has now reached.

Great film, worth much of it's hype
