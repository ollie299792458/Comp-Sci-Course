I actually came here looking to purchase movies 2 and 3 in the series and was amazed to find the reviews so negative - especially from previous fans.

How can you compare this movie to today's action-packed and digitally mastered/computer enhanced movies and call it lacking?  It was made in the 70s with a 70s theme.  You enjoyed it then and like giligan's island, bonanza and Sound of Music - or even the original star trek, you cannot watch it today without thinking the scenes are a little bland and, yes, somewhat cheezy UNLESS you put it into perspective.  If you recently saw it again and found it lacking, I suggest you have let the passage of time, today's technology and today's "me" society affect you in unfavorable ways.  I just watched the first movie with my 18 year old nephew - HE could relate to the movie even though it didn't have all of the theatrical and computer super effects.  If he could understand and even enjoy the movie's context despite its 1971 lack of technical effects, why can't you remember - and enjoy it as you did once?
