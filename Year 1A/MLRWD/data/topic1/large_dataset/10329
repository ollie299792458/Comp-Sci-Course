"GoldenEye" is a must-see action/adventure film that combines a legend with a great script, wonderful cast and a spectacular director. First, Piere Brosnan is a great Bond compared to the others and even gets 1st place on my list. He's great as 007! Sean Connery was excellent also. Roger Moore and Timothy Dutton were good, but not great. As you know, Pierce Brosnan ("The Lawnmower Man", "Mrs. Doubtfire", "Dante's Peak", "The Thomas Crown Affair", "Grey Owl") plays the suave, secret 00 agent with a license to kill, James Bond. Bond is out to secure the "GoldenEye", a mass destruction weapon that wipes out anything with an electronic circuit. A Severnaya work station in Russia was already wiped out by this weapon after everybody being killed by Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen, "Celebrity", "Deep Rising", "Rounders", "The Faculty", and in the upcoming "Don't Say A Word") and General Ouromov who work for the double-crossing, evil-turned villain, agent 006, Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean, "Patriot Games", "Don't Say A Word") who wants to use the Goldeneye with the help of a Severnaya level 1 programmer, Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming, TV's "God, The Devil and Bob", "Josie and the Pussycats","Eyes Wide Shut", "The Anniversary Party"). Bond, who gets help from a Severnaya level 2 programmer Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco)learns about the weapon and how it can be stopped. With lives and money at stake, Bond must rush to obtain the GoldenEye and must prevent it from being used to destroy electronic files. Joe Don Baker and Robbie Coltrane co-star. Martin Campbell directs a great cast into the new century of Bond films."GoldenEye" is truly the best Bond yet. Also, 'M' is now a lady and is played by Dame Judi Dench ("Mrs. Brown", "Chocolat").
