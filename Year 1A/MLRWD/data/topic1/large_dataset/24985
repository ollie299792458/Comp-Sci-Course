Bryan Singer was a young director during the filming of The Usual Suspects, and he was working with some of the biggest egos and some of the most talented dramatic and character actors of the day.  Watch the extra features content and you'll see why the combination was so trying for Singer and how one of the best scenes in the film wasn't purposely filmed but pieced together from the few moments when the cast stopped acting like children.  And then there's the controversy with Benicio Del Toro's interpretation of Fred Fenster, which nearly leads to a rebellion by the rest of the cast.

As for the film, almost everything has been said.  This is Pulp Fiction taken to the meta-fictional level; it's aware of its own structure.  Somehow, the film gets away with telling more often than showing the audience the story.  Since information and misinformation are both mixed and hidden in the film, the viewer experiences the rare treat of actual surprise at the film's conclusion.  This is one of those films that, after you have seen it a few times, you feel proud to show it to someone who's never seen it or heard about it.  This is a must for any personal film library.
