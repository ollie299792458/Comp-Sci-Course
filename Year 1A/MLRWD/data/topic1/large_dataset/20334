Excellent film!!. It tells the full story exactly like it was, the way that I remembered it. I'm Colombian and old enough to have seen the complete change in Colombia since the early 80s. If I had to point out something not accurate about this film it will be the following things:

- A lot of clips were taken from the attack to the Colombian Supreme Court in the mid 80s by the guerrillas. Although one more indication of the violence in Colombia, it had nothing to do with Pablo Escobar. It was an attack organized by leftist Guerrillas. At the time, those groups were not associated with the drug cartels. Only until the 90s they became fully engaged in drug trafficking.

- The film failed to clearly point out that when Pablo was being chased, he declared war to the whole country, and the multiple attacks that he orchestraded were aimed at regular people just because he wanted to get back at the whole country. He was a madman. More emphasis should have been given to this fact. While some of the poor people in Medellin cried when he was killed, many millions of Colombians who had to suffer by his reign of terror, were very pleased with his dead.
