As the mother of a child with Down Syndrome I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  We hired a babysitter and went to the theatre and I had to walk out about 15 minutes into it.  The acting of Sean Penn was so convincing that all it did was fill me with panic about what my little one's life will eventually be like.  When it came out on video I rented it and watched it at home alone (where noone can see you cry) I just couldn't get past the fact that while no one doubted that Sam loved Lucy completely he was NOT capable of taking care of her as she needed to be.  The acting was phenomenal by everyone involved but the simple truth that this movie didn't make clear is that love is NOT all you need.  Little girls need security, safety, guidance and discipline as much as they need love.  I wish "I Am Sam" had gone a little further into exploring the alternatives available for Sam and Lucy. I wish it had been less black and white, simplistic and politically correct.  It would have made it a better movie, one worthy of the acting I saw on the screen.
