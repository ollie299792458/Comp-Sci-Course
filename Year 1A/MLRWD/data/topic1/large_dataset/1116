Sadly, we've taught our children to be far too literal.  I honestly wonder if any of the people knocking this film know what drama is about.  We seem to have forgotten the meaning behind our metaphorical systems.  ALVH is, quite simply, one of the best films I've seen in ten years.  It's brilliant on many levels -- it's great cinema, wonderful theater, and a fine mythic contribution to film.  Obviously, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter is using Abe as a metaphor.  The film (and book) is not about vampires at all, but it is about very real and far more dangerous human phenomena that are still with us.  It uses vampirism as a symbol.

The performers are excellent.  Benjamin Walker in the title role is perfect.  His portrayal is subtle where it needs to be and larger-than-life where that is needed.  The film is filled with mythical violence that isn't nearly as bloody as it might have been.  The direction is pitch-perfect.  20% either way and this film would have been howlingly hilarious.  It isn't at all, which is a great compliment to the genius of the director.

Anyone who passes this movie off to a surface assessment is missing the entire point of the film.  I'm buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD, and I buy very, very few DVD.
