OK, this movie is just terrible.  In my opinion movies can get away with a lot. if they are great action movies then they dont need a great plot to be good movies, and vice versa.  If they are suspense movies they dont need amazing special effects or ground breaking science fiction.  But what a slow moving suspense "thriller' needs is content!!!  Be very clear, this not an action movie, maybe for about 15 minutes at the end, but for 1 hour and 45 minutes this is suppose to be a plot based thriller, a situational drama.

I am not going to go into a recap of the movie(thats why this is a "review" and not a "recap").  The main villians in the movies have no background given on them whatsoever, ni fact you dont even know who the agency controlling all the moves is EVER!!!  Who is the kid thats controling everything inside the hostage situation?  I wish I could tell you, but all I can say is he's some messed up punk kid, but what normal person kidnaps a total stranger, so of course hes really messed up.  The movie does nothing to establish a reason that anything in the movie happen, except that the "voice on the other end of the phone" says so.

This movie tried to tackle too much. You get two hostage situations in the plot, but never really know anything about either one of them. The result is that you are left with two stories that you have no idea what or why anything happened in either one of them.  Although I have not read the book, I am sure, like so often happens with book movies, the background required to really get into the movie was cut out to save time, BAD MOVE!!!

The other beef I had with this movie was the whole Virgin Mary thing with the young girl in the movie.  I mean it was a little, and when I say a little I mean way, over the top.  I hate when artsy directors throw things into a movie that have nothing to do with the plot or story, but just want to show their pseudo-creativity.
