I thought this was a great movie, even "glorious".  The film made you think about war in itself, it did not make it something it isn't, but it still made the viewer feel the importance of it.  In every sense the  movie was realistic, historically and emotionally.  I mean this in that it  is an accurate account of the Civil War, but more importantly, it didn't go  overboard in the dramatics; "Glory" let the viewer experience the  feelings that it tried to convey perfectly.  This was achieved with a great  cast, beautiful cinematography, and sweeping sound and music.  My critique  for this movie would be that it (although it might sound crazy) should have  been a bit longer, go further into character, and build a little more  towards the final battle.  The acting was all around good, I felt the movie  brought out some of the better performances from each of them.  I did rate  the movie as a five star, but really it is more like 4 and 4/5 (I have yet  to see a perfect film).  As for it not getting the due amount of awards at  the Oscar's or whatever, I have seen the other movies, and it was a real  mistake to give the awards to those over this movie.  Overall,  "Glory" was not just a great Civil War movie, but a great  achievement as a film all by  itself.___________________________________________
