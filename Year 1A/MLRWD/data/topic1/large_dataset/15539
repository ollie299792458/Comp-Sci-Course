What astounds me about early and silent films is the frequent painterliness of the images you see on film.  The imagery of Symbolist painting seems especially conspicuous.  It seems obvious, for example, that Pastrone's -Cabiria- and D. W. Griffith's -Intolerance- bathed deep in the influence of Gustave Moreau.  Griffith's good girls seem sometimes to have stepped out of the canvases of Puvis de Chavannes or Burne-Jones.
This is a Scandinavian vampire film.  Where else would you look for visual references, than early Edvard Munch?  This is what jumps out at me in this film.  In the scenes with the vampire-contaminated girl on her sickbed, Dreyer seems to be wanting to recreate Munch's -The Sick Girl- and -Spring-.  The sister [?] in the castle seems to have been made up to look like a somewhat scrawny version of Inger Munch, the painter's sister, who modelled over and over again throughout the paintings.
Of course, expressionist movies and expressionist paintings naturally go along hand in hand.  This movie is somewhat hard to watch at times; the pacing is definitely odd and disorienting.  On the version I have, the subtitles are done in large black-letter script.  Fortunately, they do not often appear, and unlike the text insets are mostly irrelevant to what is going on.  This is basically a silent film with a soundtrack added.  The soundtrack cuts out at times. 
Not for everybody, but not awful, either.
