The first 'X-Men' wasn't so much good as it was anticipated. Fans wanted this movie, and while it wasn't exactly what they wanted they were grateful and held out hope for more and better sequels and spinoffs.

'X-Men 2: X-Men United' doesn't disappoint. Brian Singer knew what worked and what didn't in the first film and made sure this one had the kinks worked out. Almost all the characters have enough screentime to get thier personalities across. Surprisingly, the character "Nightcrawler" comes off as both more capable and more sympathetic than his four-color counterpart.

Ian McKellen once again gives an outstanding performance, managing at times to overshadow every other actor on screen with him... even Patrick Stewart, which is saying something. Stewart manages to have his own spotlioght moment however at the end, showing that even the most peaceful mutant can be pushed only so far.

Knowing the books, I have a pretty good idea what the ending means in terms of what the next film will cover; I hope Singer & Co. are up to the challange.
 Someone mentioned spin-offs of the characters and other teams might be forthcoming. While I would welcome them, I'm still smarting from the 'New Mutants' nonsense on FOX (yes, I hate what FOX does to talent. Sue me). So we'll see...
