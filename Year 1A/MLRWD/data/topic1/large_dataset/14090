This movie is one part Pulp Fiction, one part Blair Witch Project, one part Jackie Chan styled kung-fu funny movie, one part Night of the Living Dead, one part Dead Alive, one part Seven Samurais, one part anime and one part cheese. What does all this add up to? A totally unique movie.
  Versus is all of the above mentioned rolled up into one twisted movie. The action scenes are good. They have an anime feel to them but the actors execute them with a Pulp Fiction sense of cool. Lots of gun play, there had to be over 1000 rounds fired in the first half. The sword fighting is really good. Very fast paced and gory.
  At times the acting is a little cheesy. The director is really fond of long dramatic pauses. A little too long for me. He must have gone to the William Shatner School of Film.
  The plot is weird and kind of hard to explain. Guy busts out of prison. Meets up with the Yakuza who have kidnapped some random girl. While waiting for "The Boss" to show up, the guy gets angry with the Yakuza, kills one of them. Guy grabs girl and the chase is on. And once "The Boss" (a 500 hundred year old mystic that kicks serious butt) shows up, the action really gets going.
  This movie is worth buying. But buy the Director's cut. The Special Edition doesn't really offer enough to warrant the extra $10 dollars.
