What happens when the world of childhood collides with the world of art?  This film provides a unique answer to the question.  While the story focuses mostly on 4 year old Marla Olmstead and her parents ("Did she or didn't she REALLY paint all those cool paintings?), I think the deeper story should be "what difference does it make?".  That modern art has become too complex for most people to "properly understand" is a sad commentary on how insecure we've become in the face of "experts". Why should art be so incomprehensible that we don't trust our own judgement in what is "good art".

Personally, I liked Marla's artwork.  Did it show "talent"?  I don't know.  Was it "Good"?  It was pretty to look at, so isn't that enough?

Marla ends up being a pawn the a media ping-pong game while her parents receive extremely vile emails and fend off media accusations of manipulation.  The issue of who painted Marla's artwork is never resolved (although it is still available online), I though the more important issue is "Why should an artists age be important in art?"  Unless you are using it as a marketing tool, an asterisk to a painting, age should not be an issue.

During the documentary, from what I could glean, one ONE person (a child psychologist, IIRC) on 60 Minutes said she didn't think the ouvre looked like it was done by the same child.  One person!  After that came the deluge of naysayers and investigative reporter.

Althought I'm certain there ARE experts in modern art who know what they are talking about, so much of modern art has become a sham, and when a four year old child is caught up in it, it becomes a shame.
