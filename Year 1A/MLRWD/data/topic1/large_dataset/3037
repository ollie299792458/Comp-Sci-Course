this movie wud get 5 stars if it was not for me bein a professional critic, i took an oath vowing i wud never give a movie 5 stars unless it totally deserved it, an example of a movie deserving 5 stars wud be any movie combining van damme with the "actors" of "Big Ballers", but in hell comes reallll close...the only drawbak of this movie is the darn prison scenes where sick, tuff prisoners buy "sukas" aka dudes to sleep with, n do it prison style...that jus grosses me out....van damme aint havin it tho, whenever sumone buys  him as a "suka" n says "ill see u 2nite", he breaks the rules of the prison n gets himself solitary confinement....who says van dam doesnt have brains? well except where he tries to hang himself with a rope thats way too long....the best part of the dvd is the "makin of in hell" ...i wish mr damme wud make a strait to theatres movie but i think the mussels from brussels van damme will be makin strait to video movies till blockbuster shuts down...lawrence taylor is oh so wise in this movie in which he recites his knowledge n ends his thoughts with the word "bullsh;;"....actaully, this movie is dark, n actaully tries to use symbolism n teach morals n stuff, but its still funny for sum strange reason [ van damme , lawrence taylor, come on]
