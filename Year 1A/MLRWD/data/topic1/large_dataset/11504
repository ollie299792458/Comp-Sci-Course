I'd seen Kathy Griffin live at a local theatre, and also enjoyed her on "Suddenly Susan" and particularly when she co-hosted a New Year's Eve show this past December 31 with Anderson Cooper, not to mention her many appearances on TV over the years.  She always makes me laugh, and that's the main reason I wanted to catch up on "D-List," as I don't have cable and the DVD was on sale for a remarkably low price.  I'm not sure it's best to watch too many episodes in a row, as I did when I first got the DVD (four episodes in a row, for example, on my first viewing), as Kathy is one intense woman--at least as portrayed here.  That's not a bad thing overall, as her intensity is part of the reason she can be so overwhelmingly funny, but I would suggest taking a break between episodes.  It's fascinating to watch her hang with her parents, "her gays," as she calls two of her best male friends, her assistant, and her husband as she navigates the clearly treacherous waters of life in Hollywood.  Never has it been both so glamourous and so depressing--it should be viewed by anyone wanting to break into that lifestyle, for cautionary purposes!  But, in the end, the viewer gets the feeling you could survive--and laugh--through most of it if one of your friends in Hollywood happened to be Kathy.  I recommend this DVD if you're a fan of Kathy's or if you're fascinated by behind-the-scenes Hollywood...or if you just like to laugh!
