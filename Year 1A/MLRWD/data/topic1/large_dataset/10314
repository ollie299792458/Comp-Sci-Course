'C.H.U.D.' is one of the many 80's b horror flicks I grew up watching over and over again.  I honestly don't know how many times my folks rented this for me when I was a kid; it's insane haha.  Just staring at the cover art alone, brought a smile to my face.  To this day, I still watch it with the same enjoyment.  First of all, any horror flick taking place in the dirty streets of New York City, or in this case, under the streets, will likely be a winner for me.  Especially if the film dills with over-exaggerated mutated, killer hobos!!!  I even LOVE that echo-like sound from the cheesy synth score when a 'chud' is coming near haha!  The music score is just perfect, in my opinion.  I'm not going to go into detail about the story itself; too many people have reviewed it already, not to mention Amazon, of course haha.  Just wanted to add my two cents in for a horror flick that has brought me a lot of joy over the years.  As a horror fan, be honest; what's not to like about a film dealing with cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers!?  I laugh ever time I hear someone say he or she thinks a person looks sooo ugly by calling him or her (behind their back), a 'chud'.  Especially if that "mean" person makes the echo-like synth score sound when the "ugly" person is walking by LOL!  I'm blabbing but I just had to throw that in.  Anyway, C.H.U.D. is awesome.
