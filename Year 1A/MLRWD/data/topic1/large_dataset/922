I've just gotten into Kundalini yoga, don't know much about it, but I had bought the Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh DVD and noticed that whenever I used it, my body's metabolism would get a little boost.  So if all Kundalini DVDs can do that, then that's my new allegiance.

Before picking Maya Fiennes DVD I had seen a preview of it and thought "Oh my gosh what crappy music"  So I stayed away.  But I am glad something forced me to get this DVD.

The new agey music is really not that bad... I quite enjoy it and I quite enjoy how she integrates the rhythm of the music to the patterns of the workout.... its unique and awesome.  It helps you to get through those harder repetitive segments.  Its like music therapy.

You don't get like a sweat your but off workout like some of Denise Austin's YogaBurn DVDs, but you do feel an internal combustion going on.  Despite it not being an intense workout, the next day I could really feel the muscles having to be worked underneath my armpits, side arms, front thighs and legs!!!  Places no other workout video has well.... never worked out before.

I truly enjoy this DVD.  I get a wonderful vibe from Maya.  She explains things well except for her beath of fire rendition.  If you're new to Kundalini you would not have known you are suppose to create this breath originating from your belly.  You see her doing it, but she doesn't tell you how to do it.

My favorite part is that she allows for little breaks in between exercises.  Also, her ending where you stop and just enjoy the ending of your session.  Its such a powerful body and mind DVD.

Love it!  If AnnaRavi videos are as good or better than this, then I will definitely have to check them out!
