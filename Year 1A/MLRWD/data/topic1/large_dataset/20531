a truly awful film.  the first is my favourite film and the second, although not as good, still gets regular viewings but this is an insult to movie-watchers.  eddie murphy reputedly turned down the role three times due to the atrocious script and eventually only took the part because of the ludicrous amount of money on offer to him.  the absence of john ashton as the perfect foil for judge reinhold is a travesty and his replacement (who's also the bad guy, whoops sorry, spoiled the film, but don't worry, john landis did that for me) is so see-through it is unbelievable.  i urge you not to buy this film.  the first two?  yes.  if you want eddie murphy stuff, go for coming to america or the 48hrs films (not classics, but better than this).  how anyone could say eddie's best role was in bowfinger (see earlier review) beggars belief.  that's an appalling film as well, and possibly eddie's worst ever role.  the first bhc film is his best, just watch the scene at the buffet meal when he says "tell victor that ramone, the man he met last week, found out he's got herpesemplex 10 so he better get to the clinic before things start falling off on the brother" in a camp voice.  genius.
