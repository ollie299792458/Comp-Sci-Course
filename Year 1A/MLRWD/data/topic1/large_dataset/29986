I stumble upon this movie by accident and was pleasantly surprised. I saw it because I liked Jim Carey as a comedian actor and also because it had a gay romance theme which you hardly see alot of in movies nowadays. I recommend it for everyone because it is a beautiful milestone movie about the depth of love of the human spirit that crosses over sexual boundries.
Delightfully entertaining your first viewing and it was the second viewing when I totally fell in love with the film. This is when you can absorb more of it contents because it is such a beautiful spiritual complex movie. You begin to understand the character's motives for love. How he was living his life as a lie but still succeeded in living it true to himself the way he wanted even though all odds where against him. I give Jim Carey my thanks and praise for having the guts to do this film because most high profile Hollywood actors would be artistically challenged and sexually threathen playing this character. His acting and comedic skills displayed in the film makes it transcend and cross over the sexual boundries that puts all predjuices aside.
I must admit most gay theme movies do almost alway end up in a tragedy but I still feel this movie is a milestone for gay cinema for becoming more into main stream entertainment. Hopefully future gay theme movies will have happier endings that won't always fit the destined tragedy mold. I found it a must for my movie collection.
I believe this movie paves the way for more successful gay theme movie that are thoughly entertaining for all masses. It is a sleeping giant and will speak volumes in the history of gay and mainstream movie cinema.
