Truth be told, if you listened to the negative reviews of this film, you would be cheating yourself out of a fun adventure. Yes, it's dated. Yes, the story is tawdry. But the point of this kind of film is about expressing the spirit of science fiction, the flat out incredible nature of the crisis and how people respond. No, it's not at all realistic, but who cares? It's a great little film even with all it's supposed flaws.

I've read the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. I still like the film even after reading them. The whole idea of science fiction in that day, just as with 1950's "Destination Moon", an equally ridiculous film if you listen to the detractors, was to entertain people with the "idea" of "what if" supposition.

Critics of these kinds tend to be exactly the opposite with more modern fare, thinking films like "Red Planet" and "The Astronaut's Wife" are great art because they have a more realistic depiction of space and space ships and alien terrains, but lack the essentials of good story telling.

I find the incredible lack of imagination that goes into modern science fiction films to be disturbing to say the least. Films like "When Worlds Collide" stimulate the imagination to think beyond the possible and to embrace the impossible.

Who didn't like "Armaggedon"? It was completely ridiculous. But I loved it because it didn't take itself too seriously and the pile of improbable events and "They would never do that" moments could make the film unwatchable to the critical eye.

So a film like this to be compared with "When Worlds Collide" is valid because both films not only dealt with impending doom of humankind, but also used, in practical terms, improbable solutions to save humanity. Hurrah for the imagination.

And hurrah for "When Worlds Collide". It's as much fun today as when I first saw it over thirty years ago. If you like good story telling, you will like this film.
