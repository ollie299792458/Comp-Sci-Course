"The Sea Inside" achieves something many foreign films don't: it translates well. So much so that English speakers could forget they're watching a film in Spanish. The English subtitles manage to capture the poetry of the film's Spanish script, with such lines as "I refuse to give in to the inertia where I can only be thankful for what I've been given because I have no other choice than to accept it," as spoken by supporting character Julia (Belen Rueda), who faces a degenerative disease. And for Spanish speakers or the bilingual, the DVD allows you to change the subtitles to Spanish, and the Spanish subtitles are actually the same as the spoken dialogue. (Often DVDs will put in Spanish subtitles that don't match the spoken language exactly, but here that's not the case.)

The DVD features a director commentary in Spanish (unfortunately with no subtitles) and excellent deleted scenes that fill in some of the holes regarding the story of Ramon's lawyer/friend Julia.

The editing and cinematography is first-rate. In a montage, the quadriplegic Ramon, played by Javier Bardem, recalls how his life flashed before his eyes when he was injured; meanwhile Julia, his lawyer/friend, looks through photographs of his past in another room.

The story moves quickly with slices of humor, irony, and tragedy in a film that breaks the cookie-cutter euthanasia narrative. Bardem brings a great complexity to his portrayal of Ramon in one of the most astonishing performances in years. This film has great universal appeal, but is also perfect for someone who has ever been injured for a long time or permanently, or for someone who knows or cares for someone in such a state. It brings humanity not only to euthanasia, but also to sickness and/or injury.
