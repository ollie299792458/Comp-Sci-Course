Unlike a previous reviewer, I am a long-time Gilbert and Sullivan lover who loved this movie--I first saw it some 15 years ago, and I waited for many years for it to come out on video.  Needless to say, when I finally  bought a VCR, I bought this as soon as I could find it.
The three key  roles in Pirates are the Major General, the Pirate King, and the Sergeant  of Police.  All are well cast here.  Tony Azito has a bit less vocal heft  than a true Savoyard would like in the Police Sergeant's role, but he is  superb at the physical comedy the role demands.  George Rose is a superb  Major General (that's, in Anna Russell's immortal phrase, "the little  man who prances around and sings the patter song.")  Best of all,  Kevin Kline turns in a terrific performance as the Pirate King, showing  once again what a wonderfully versatile actor he is.  
Of the rest of the  cast, Linda Rondstadt and Rex Smith, as the young lovers, are good.  As  Mabel, Rondstadt's job is primarily to sing with gusto, which she certainly  does. G&amp;S purists may be annoyed by Smith's casting as Frederic, since  he does not have the pure tenor voice the role calls for, but he acquits  himself well in the comic moments.
All in all, this is a movie to be  enjoyed over and over.  And for any of you out there who don't like it, a  suitable penalty has been prepared.  Something with boiling oil in it, I  fancy.  Yes, boiling oil or molten lead.
