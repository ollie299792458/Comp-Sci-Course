"Who Framed Roger Rabbit" is one of the most important milestones in movie history.  The first thing that blew me away was the unprecedented coorporation of the two biggest rivals in animation, Disney and Warner Brothers.  Until this movie came out, no one but no one ever dared to dream that Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse would appear in the same frames.  Also included were characters from Max Fleischer (Betty Boop), Walter Lantz (Woody Woodpecker) and others.  Great technical strides had been taken since Jerry Mouse danced with Gene Kelly.  The interaction between live and animated characters was convincing and lifelike all the way through the movie.  The film was loaded with innuendos and inside jokes, which only added to the pleasure of watching it.  I thought the casting was perfect, too.  Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom was spot-on.  If I could give this movie seven stars, I would.
  Now about the DVD format itself.  The clarity of transfer is outstanding.  However I do have one little beef about the formatting of the menu.  I would have greatly preferred being able to go straight to a menu instead of having to wait for Benny the cab to go all over the place and then having to go three layers deep before being able to select from the menu.  That old rather fast.  I'm not going to knock off a star for that, though.  On its own the formatting would be two stars out of five.
  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who has any kind of a sense of humor.  For those who don't, I recommend this movie to develop one.
