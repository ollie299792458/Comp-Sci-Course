I have been under the impression ever since viewing my first scratchy copy of Metropolis that this was the movie in it's fullest, not true. In fact the movie was immediatly cut almost as soon as it was first shown and especially when it came to the United States. The basic story was the same but we lose so much as far as getting to know the characters better among various differnt subplots going on along with the main story.

Unfortunatly for us all much of the original footage which was cut from the original screening is lost or beyond repair. However, a great deal of the scenes were in fact found, restored, and reintroduced into the flim for the first time since it's premiere in Berlin. Scenes which were either still missing or beyone repair were still used either by using stills or by text explaining the scene. Along with this beautifly restored picture we are given the orginal soundtrack used during it's premiere.

The making of special feature was a welcomed suprise as we are told of the painstaking efforts by the crew in Germany to bring this most influential of all the German impressionist films. We also learn of the making of the original using brilliant moviemaking techiques such as animation and superimposing.

By far, this is the version which comes the closest to the original version Fritz Lang had intended for us to see.
