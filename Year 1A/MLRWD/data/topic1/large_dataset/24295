I love "Ravenous", it's one of my favorite films in my top ten list. I don't see why this movie didn't get the attention it should've gotten in its theatrical release. It's just that most people don't know  what a good movie is when they see one. The many reasons I absolutely love  "Ravenous" is because of the excellent music score composed and  performed by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn, in fact, I happen to own the  soundtrack. The film is very well-cast with great performances from start  to finish. Guy Pearce was superb in his portrayle of Civil War hero Captain  John Boyd. I especially love the performances of Robert Carlyle as the  show-stealing, cannibalistic Scotsman and Jeffrey Jones (known for  "Beetlejuice" fame) as a wallnut-eating colonel. The  cinematography of Anthony B. Richmond is so striking, giving a great  atmosphere for each and every scene. "Ravenous" is an instant  cult classic and one of the best horror films made in years. I'd recommend  that those with weak stomachs should not watch this movie, for they might  never eat red meat ever again. Best film since Tobe Hooper's "The  Texas Chainsaw Massacre", director Antonia Bird's "Ravenous"  is my second favorite cannibal movie.
