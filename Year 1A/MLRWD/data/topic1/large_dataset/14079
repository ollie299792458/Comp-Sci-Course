I realize I'm only repeating what most have already said about this movie, but it was such an awesome movie that I have to join the chorus.  As has been stated, it is based on real events and people (there is some dramatization of course, but not as much as I expected).  Some don't like the music, which is music from today, and some don't like how it was filmed--again very contemporary.  I personally like it and think it was meant to show that while the particular issue of suffrage was won after a long battle, there are still issues that society and women need to achieve.  This movie made me wonder if there would be an issue that I would sacfrifice everything for--that is what many of these women did.  I taped it off of HBO and everytime I watch it, I feel alive, passionate and awe-stricken.  People need to vote.  It's that simple.  Most don't.  It's that sad.  Maybe when people realize just what the "right" to vote has cost others, they won't throw it away so easily.  Something I also found interesting is that according to recent supreme court rulings (bush v. gore) the right to vote is NOT a federal constitutional right.  Just ask D.C. if you doubt that.  Maybe we need more inspiration and picketing and less burying and blaming our problems.
