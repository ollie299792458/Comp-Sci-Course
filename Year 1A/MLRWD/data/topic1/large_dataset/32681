One of the greatest thrillers of all time, The Fugitive is a textbook example of a thriller that keeps its audience glued without insulting their intelligence.  Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a Chicago surgeon, is  wrongly convicted of killing his wife (Sela Ward), escapes from prison and  heads back to his hometown in search of the real killer, a mysterious  one-armed man that Kimble struggled with in his house after his wife's  murder.  U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his Oscar-winning  role) and his deputies relentlessly pursue Kimble in and around Chicago,  always staying a few steps behind.
This movie works on so many levels,  but it begins with the actors.  Harrison Ford, is one of his best roles,  perfectly portrays the dignity and righteous indignation that Kimble feels.  He should have received an Oscar nomination for the sheer physical and  emotional effort that he put into this character.  Jones is a perfect  choice for Gerard: He is relentless, shrewd and sarcastic in his quest to  track down Kimble.  He always projects a smarmy, superior quality that  attracts the viewer, yet makes us want him to lose his prey.  The terrific  supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Daniel Roebuck,  and Jeroen Krabbe.
Director Andrew Davis takes the audience along for the  chase, and uses Chicago as his landscape, including a busy St. Patrick's  Day Parade for one scene. These locations enhance the film by using the  city as a maze through which this chase occurs.  Another terrific feature  is James Newton Howard's score, which manages to add color and tension to  scenes, even when there is no dialogue. Perfect all around, from acting,  directing, composing and screenplay, The Fugitive should remain a  classic.
