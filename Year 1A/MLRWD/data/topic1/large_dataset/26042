Though not his best, Casino is far from the worst Scorcese movie.  Reunited with the crew from Goodfellas, Joe Pesci, De Niro, and Nicolas Pileggi, Casino is very similar to Goodfellas, though not as strong.  De Niro plays his usual character, the guy who a pro at what he does and seems to have everything under control.  But this time, De Niro is the most sympathetic character which is a change of pace.  Pesci is essentially the same character from Goodfellas, a hot headed loose cannon who ends up causing more trouble than good.  Sharon Stone shines as ex-prostitute turned wife of De Niro.  Stone plays an absoulute terrible person in this movie.  But she does it to perfection and recieved a well deserved Academy Award nomination.  The imagery and pacing are almost identical to Goodfellas,  with the voice overs and the quick jumps from scene to scene, as well as the classic rock soundtrack.  There are a few memorable scenes.  The sledgehammer scene is not easily forgotten.  The corn field meeting also sticks with you.  The movie was alittle long, but the performances were good enough to keep it from dragging to much.  Overall it's not a classic like Goodfellas, but it is an ejoyable watch if you have 3 hours to spare.
