I have been a fan of YES for years. And yes, they have gone through many phases. This concert was captured during their more pop oriented phase, with Trevor Rabin and much of the original lineup. All of the band is in fine form, and some of the songs, particularly "Hold On" and "Starship Trooper" really take off.

What makes this video special is that is was directed by Steven Soderburgh, before Sex, Lies, and Videotape and all of the big movies he has since become known for. So it is not just a straight on concert video, where there are four or five cameras capturing the action. Instead, there are numerous special effects that add to the repeat viewing of the concert.

The video itself has been released numerous times...first on VHS, then on Laserdisc, and finally on a Brazillian DVD, which was adequate. This pressing adds additional songs, clearer video, and better sound.

So, if you are a fan of this somewhat flashier period of YES, you will certainly not be disappointed.
