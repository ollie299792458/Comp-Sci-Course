That is what Denzel shows you in the amazing life of this man. 
After such a long time of fighting to get this story to the big screen I wondered if Denzel would be able to pull it off. I thought Laurence Fishburne would have been a better choice at the time. Denzel made me a beleiver. The life of this man was truly something else.  What he had to go through in heavily racist America during his time as a child, teen and adult was enough to make most just give up an not think of changing. But then to continue on and turn his life around to be something so positive, dynamic, to stand up face the evil and fight, only to have so many forces (inside and out) against him in the end shows the tremendous strength he had.  Denzel conveys just about every aspect of this in this role.  It had to be hard for him to walk in this mans shoes and try not to be consumed by his emotions.  Imagine, the assaination scene. Even as an actor portraying a role his mind had to be at the bursting point completing a scene where the life of such a man was just snuffed out like a candle.  It had to be hard to let go afterward.
The story and his performance make this movie worth getting.  This is American History 101.
