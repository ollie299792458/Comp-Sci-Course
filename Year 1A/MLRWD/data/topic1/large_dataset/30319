At first glimpse this movie may seem like yet another culture clash/immigrant movie. And to some extent that's true, but there's much more that's tackled as well.
Ok first off the Title - David Beckham is to Soccer (or Football as non-Americans call it) as Michael Jordan is to Basketball. (He's also Posh Spice's husband, but that's besides the point for this movie).
The movie is basically about a British-Indian girl's struggle to achieve her dream - to play professional football, and yet still somehow balance her other priorities. But along the way the movie also helps smash a few cultural stereotypes, gives a pro-feminist message and manages to make you laugh out loud all in the space of two hours. What I loved best about this movie is that all the people in it were so real, and so normal, and also how the drama/melodrama was kept to a bare minimum. I also liked how the semi-conservative Indian father's objection to his daughter playing was not that she was a girl or that she was Indian but that he felt that there would be too much struggle. Or how it's not just the conservative Indian family which has problems with their daughter playing soccer but also the English family as well  - "There's a reason Sporty Spice is the only one without a fella". This movie was a hit in England, and also in India, where people of both countries felt that it hit really close to home. Hope you Americans enjoy it too. If you liked Monsoon Wedding, you'll really like this, and if you hated Monsoon Wedding, you'll still really like this.
