I have been a fan of film noir for many years, remembering them from when they were "B" movies supporting bigger features. I appreciated them more deeply in later years, when I could understand not only the manifest plots, but also the latent, socio-political themes that permeated them all, not only the best or select. I have seen dozens over the years, but only recently could I get hold of Criss Cross, directed by Robert Siodmak and starring Burt Lancaster and Yvonne de Carlo, with the almost inevitable Dan Duryea in a supporting role (and Tony Curtis in his first movie as a dance partner for de Carlo). But what I had been missing! Potent acting,with Lancaster at his strongest and yet most vulnerable,  a suitably convoluted plot, the power of the femme fatale to control the destiny of the male, the use of lighting and composition; a film that contains virtually all of the defining attributes of the genre film. And it just bowls along, getting better and better as it develops. You know what will inevitably happen, of course, or at least you do if you have watched enough films noir. But the ending is still powerful and engagingly sad. Why do people do these things to each other? Why cannot they see what is happening to them and who is doing it? Film noir at its finest, and this is the iconic example, helps one to understand human emotion and gain insight into the power of fate. A film that should not be missed, even after nearly 60 years.
