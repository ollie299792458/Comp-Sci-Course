I should have known this movie was a stinker when I realized it went straight-to-video. Here are the main problems: Michelle Pfeiffer as a GORGEOUS, over 40 but youthful successful TV writer/producer cannot find a date? Her ex-husband is Jon Lovitz? COME ON! Paul Rudd playing 29? Sure he has "boyish good looks" but at almost 39 its a little hard to believe he is 29 passing as a 16 year old on a TV show.  I hate to say this but it would have been better cast with someone like Ashton Kutcher who is 29/30-

The whole Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature thing was annoying and distracting. I couldn't tell if she was walking along side Michelle Pfeiffer or super-imposed- and she looked yellow.

The only good thing I can say about this movie was Pfeiffer's character's daughter Izzie, played by Saoirse Ronan (who is nominated for an Oscar for her role in this year "Atonement"). She gave a great performance.

All in all, a big disappointment for Rudd and Pfeiffer fans...
