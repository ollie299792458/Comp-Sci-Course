The Squid and the Whale is the story of two writer/PhD parents going through a separation and how their parents' personalities and attitudes affect their children.

I thought Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney were wonderful.  Daniels' character Bernard was so arrogant and egocentric that his character easily could have turned into a caricature.  But Daniels plays the part with enough gusto without going over the top to keep the character real (though still bizarre).  There were plenty of times where you just wanted to scream at him for being such a self-important jerk and he makes my skin crawl, which is the mark Daniels played the character well.

The reason I didn't give the movie five stars was because I just didn't like the children.  The younger son had a difficult role to play given the increasingly bizarre behavior as the movei progresses.  The situations the young actor had to portray convincingly would have been difficilt enough for an experienced actor, let alone an actor who could barely be called a young man.  My issue with the older son was that he was so ridiculous.  I feel like the part was well played, but I just wanted to punch the kid every time he ridiculed his mother or obsessively loved his father because of his extreme short-sightedness!  I realize he was under a lot of pressure during his parents' separation, but what a jerk...

I disagree with previous reviewers who didn't think this movie was funny.  No, I don't think I would really call it a comedy, but there were definitely funny parts.  Like how concerned the whole family was about "custody" of the cat during their family talk about the parents' separation.  No, it's not laugh-out-loud, bust-a-gut funny, but you kind of have to know that a movie about messed up parents messing up their kids isn't going to be slapstick...
