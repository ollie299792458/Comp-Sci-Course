This is a slow paced, art and gore fest story. Not for the people that want instant gratification or an anime with humor relief.
No, this is a serious, gruesome anime about bitter rivals. The plot drags sometimes but the art direction and the music totally satisfy if you are willing to see it through.
This is such a serious anime that some times it can be stressful feeling like a burden on your shoulders, but that is just how great it is.

[possible kind of spoiler]
Even the ending or lack-of fits the over all feel of the whole experience perfectly.

The cons? There's a few, I would have liked to see some things explained before the abrupt end, and I could have done better with a little less of explicit inner anatomy classes, but that is just nitpicking.
This is a brutal and intense piece of anime art taken fro chapter one by heavy emotions and a true sounding Japanese soundtrack (at least as I am concerned)

If you don't have kids, buy it! If you do... buy, it just keep it away from them ;)
