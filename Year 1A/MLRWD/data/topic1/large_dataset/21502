After reading and hearing all about how great this film was I finally decided to buy it. I'd heard that it was supposed to be humorous and romantic with lots of great dancing.

I found that Yes, the dancing was phenomenal and it was sorta romantic (though they could have built up the relationship a little more, the story line was not backed up enough with character history and how they all fit in. When you finally find out what has all been going on with the parents I felt like I was getting whip lash because I had already formed an opinion of the mom and dad and here I got all this new information that I had to reprocess).

As for the humor I totally didn't get. The Mom was ALWAYS screaming and yelling which really turned me off. I don't know if it's because I'm not used to Australian humor or if it just wasn't really there, but I found it a real bummer.
I had expected a lot more from the reviews that I had read.
So all in all, if you are buying this for the dancing then it's a great buy, but if you're getting it for the story line, forget it and get Shall we Dance (Japanese) instead.
