CAPTIVITY is probably the worst movie of the year.  ROLAND JOFFE' should be ashamed of himself for trying to make a scary movie--just because you see horror movies does not make you know what it takes to be good.  the movie has ingredients from SAW and movies of the like.  the initial premise is somebody stalks a big time model(why?-we never know, sick crush?)portrayed by the beautiful ELISHA CUTHBERT and drugs her and takes her to the torture home.  we then see several kinds of mind numbing mental abuse and the routine sick entrails shake.  as the movie progresses and we find another person being held against their will(the wheels turn?)  the movie cheats the viewer at every turn.  the skin or sin factor is present--NOT!! and if you are going to make a movie with some hottie-GOT TO SHOW SOME SKIN!!--routine, formulaic, predictable and boring.  the best thing about this movie is the trailer!---anymore than that is GIVE ME MY 90 MINS BACK!!!+MONEY.  if I could give this 0 stars I would.  this is not even a good BAD film.  trust me folks, you have been warned.  jh
