I really liked this first season, and can't wait for season 2. This is a nice follow-up to the Gervais/Merchant creation of "The Office."

I didn't know what I was getting myself into because I didn't watch this on HBO. However, upon purchase--and a weekend viewing of all episodes--I really like "Extras." This show isn't so much about movies and the extras required to make these movies. The movies are just a back drop, much like the bar was in "Cheers," or the garage in "Taxi." No, this show is about people, relationships, friendship, love and the discomfort of trying to be polite or politcally correct.

Watching this show (much like watching "The Office") you might find yourself watching with a mouth open instead of laughing out loud. But when it's all over, you might still be thinking about these episodes for many days.

There is a featurette on one of the discs entitled, "Finding Leo." There is a moment in which Ricky shows a doodle he has drawn. I can't remember laughing so hard while being alone at home.

Bring on Season 2.
