Wow finally after years of waiting Beverly Hills 90210 has returned to it's loyal fans in DVD! The show is primarily the first four seasons about Brenda and Brandon Walsh. The teen twins from Minnesota, that have moved to the ultra posh and ritzy world of Beverly Hills with their parents. This first season basically the foundation for a series that would long surpass it's expectations. We meet not only the Walsh family, but Dylan Mckay, Donna Martin, David Silver, Aundrea Zuckerman, Steve Sanders, and Kelly Taylor. And all their trial and tribulations as teens. There is just so much that could be said for this series, but I might as well just let you see for yourself in the dvd. But anyone who saw this show the first time around knows that not only is entertaining but also realistic. A great buy for anyone that is a fan and those that wanna jump on the bandwagon for the first time. As an avid teen drama watcher in the past, I can honestly say that none can ever duplicate the magic of the first few seasons of 90210...This is going to be a great holiday buy and probably a must have on many lists...So grab a copy, pop the disk in and be prepared to go back to Beverly Hills 90210...
