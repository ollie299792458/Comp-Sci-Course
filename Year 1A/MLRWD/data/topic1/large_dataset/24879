Lately, John Travolta--last 3 yrs or so,has bombed in the theater so i wasnt expecting very much when my husband rented this movie--i was greatly and pleasantly surprised at the great lines of humor in this movie-Non stop action and humor all through this movie.The movie had a great cast and they interacted well with each other.Im not much of a comedy movie watcher as so few movies are funny but this was really great comedy.I dont agree with the comment that the scene with Seth Green was child oriented humor--hey, we are all children at heart and this interaction between the gorilla and Seth Green was hilarious.I guess it depends on what type of humor you enjoy as there are all sorts of diff types of humor.Also, i know it took a lot of courage and strength for John Travolta, who lost his only son Jett, to a terrible accident, and was beside himself with grief as were all parents who have lost a child.To do this movie, especially when it envolved children,had to be really hard on him.Interestingly enough, Travoltas daughter and wife--in real life-- starred in this movie.John, you were great in this movie as well as your wife, and daughter.Bless your heart.
