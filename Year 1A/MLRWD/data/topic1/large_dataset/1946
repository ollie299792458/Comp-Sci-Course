This is the movie that turned me onto Jet Li.  Still to this day, I say this is his best movie.  Jet has done around 30 films, mostly overseas, but none have displayed the perfect combination of story and action.  Jet's remake of Bruce Lee's "Fist of Fury" ("Fist of Legend") has superb straightforward martial arts, but the story pales in comparison to "Kiss."  "My Father Is A Hero" had a nice story, but it could have used a few more fight scenes to spruce it up, plus the main villain was cheesy sporting a pair of sunglasses.  The recent "Hero" (Not the "Father is my Hero"), well...was beautiful, but was more of an art/fantasy film.  "Kiss" is raw and a "heavy-subtle" that balances nicely.

The fight scenes are incredible and full of impact.  The story, which carries a very dark tone, never lags.  You really feel a sense of hatred towards the main villain and feel for the prostitute.  Finally, a martial arts movie where the story isn't ridiculous.  There are occasional exaggerated scenes, but in all honesty, they gel well with the flow.

When anyone asks for an action film, I always have recommended this.  I also warn them that this action film contains a plot...so don't be surprised.  There are not many films out there that pull this off...the one other one that really stands out at the moment is the "Bourne Identity."  Only "Kiss" has more martial arts.  Love it!
