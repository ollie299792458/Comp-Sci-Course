James Coburn met the legendary Bruce Lee after he made Our Man Flint, and we can thank Flint for influencing the screen fighting style of the Dragon.  We can also thank Derek Flint for being the only person in the world that would make James Bond sweat.  Our Man Flint is classic fun, and deserves five stars, just as "It Happened One Night."  Much more than a parody, Flint does 007 better in practically every area: dancing, women (he has his own harem), gadgets (his cigarette lighter has 63 different functions, and he makes his own stuff, being a scientific genuis). Even his boss, played by the wonderful Lee J. Cobb, is a grander fellow than M.  He also speaks 60 languages,is a fencing and close combat master, and a master yogi who can stop his heart.  Although tongue in cheek, Flint as a self-evolving man is almost believable, and that's part of his enduring entertainment value. (Mr. Spock was also heavily influenced by Flint, if you'll compare their mannerisms. The Vulcan death grip is first featured in In Like Flint. Spock wouldn't be half as fun if he didn't have an air of believability.)
The villans' (there are three, including a Caucausian named Dr. Lee and a Chinese named Dr. Schneider) nefarious plan also poses a challenge to the Bond films: controlling the world's weather.  Plus, Flint fights much, much better than 007. 
He's also a rebel, unlike the office bug 007, and balks at being hired by the major super powers.  Whoever created the Flint character should take a big bow; James Coburn as Derek Flint is endearing, hysterical (while doing everything with a straight face)and a Super guy, not just a mere super spy.  He's an inspiration for kids of all ages to hit the books, to explore and discover.  
I've heard that James Coburn would have done more 'Flints' but they couldn't come up with good scripts.  A real shame, for with five or six 'Flints,' Coburn would have become a megastar.
Thank you, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Flint.
