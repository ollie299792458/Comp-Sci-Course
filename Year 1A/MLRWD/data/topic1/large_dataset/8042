This is a worthy enough addition to the J-Horror sub-genre and in theory there isn't actually anything particularly bad about it; but, all the same, I couldn't help coming away from it with a sense of disappointment. Thinking about it, I suspect my disappointment stems from the fact that Premonition, as a horror movie, just isn't frightening enough. There are so many moments during the film when the horrific aspects could have lifted it to the level of other, more famous Asian horrors (such as Ringu, Ju-on and Tale of Two Sisters) but the director seems unwilling to allow the horrors full reign. Don't misunderstand me - reticence is a worthy aim in a horror film; but there is a difference between suggesting horrors in order to get the audience's imagination working and actually showing those horrors in such a half-hearted manner that the viewer wonders why they bothered. There is one brief scene towards the end of the film - when our protagonist encounters the crawling inhabitant of a psychiatric cell - that almost reaches the heights of terror expressed in those other films I've mentioned, but it is very much the exception. At the end of the day, however well-made, acted and written the film is, the simple fact of the matter is that floating scraps of old newspaper, even when their appearances are accompanied by unearthly moans, just aren't very frightening. Worth a look, because at the end of the day it's still an intelligent film, but it's no classic.
