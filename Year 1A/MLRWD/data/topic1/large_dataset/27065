In an experience more frightening than their worst nightmares, three friends tour a funeral home with a creepy mortician (Clarence Williams III) in this Spike Lee-produced horror anthology. Along the way, they hear a story about each of the corpses. From cops turned bad to a child with uncanny powers, a bigoted politician tormented by voodoo dolls and a drug dealer who undergoes sensory rehab, all of the spooky tales have racial implications.

As always, there's controversy when it comes to a Spike Lee production. Personally, I understand that when I fire up "a Spike Lee joint" (no pun intended - that's the logo on his films) - I know what I'm in for. A well made, well acted, sometimes imaginative film with some pretty heavy racially biased overtones. That's pretty much it. Such is the case with this movie. It has everything you would expect from a "Tales From the Crypt" parody set in the "hood". The production values are tight and the acting is of a higher standard than Tales from the Crypt (the one with Stephen King).

I was glad to see Clarence (Mod Squad) Williams III working again (he was excellent) and I enjoyed the menacingly dramatic change of pace characterization from David Allen Grier. There were some creepy moments and some humorous ones - what else would you want from this type of movie. So if you're not inclined to whine about heavy-handed prejudiced moralizing and can accept a decent horror flick at face value - this one was worth it.It has its underlying themes of racism, child abuse and gang related murders mixed together with horror style story telling. There should've been a sequel!
