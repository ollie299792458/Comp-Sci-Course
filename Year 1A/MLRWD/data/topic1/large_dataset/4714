As a current active member of the US Navy, few Navy-related subjects appeal to us servicemembers.  Alot of them are poking fun of how wrong alot of the things we do in the movies.  For example, "Crimson Tide".  What submarine allows pets?  In fact, the interior is much too big for a compacted submarine that's already roomy enough for the missiles it carries but not for the crew.  Anyway, "Mr. Roberts" clearly displays an enjoyable and humorous outlook of Navy life.  Even if I've been in uniform for a little over five years, and this movie clearly took place in WWII, there are still Naval gestures and behaviors carried on today.  LT(jg) Roberts is a well-respected officer among his men.  We have those in real-life!  What appeals to me about this movie is the similar camaraderie the fictional crew has to us.  The best part of the movie is the lively liberty they had.  Of course, today it's not a welcomed sight, but it simply reminded me of the good times during port visits with friends.  The laughter, the jokes, the overall good fun and experience of a foreign port is all I saw with these guys.  When I watch this movie with Navy friends, we all have a good time watching.  Sometimes pausing the movie and reminisce about the Navy life.  A great and moving film.  Thank you, Mr. Roberts!
