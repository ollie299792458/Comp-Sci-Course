The Nines is a remarkable film by John August.  He is the genius who wrote the A.D.D./drug addled, raver cult classic Go and Tim Burton's beautiful love story, Big Fish. The movie stars Ryan Reynolds playing three separate, and sometimes overlapping, characters in the three short films that make up this one story.  He blows the top off this movie with his portrayal of a writer, a troubled actor, and a video game designer. This is one of the most original films that I have seen in a long time.  I would have to say that Reynolds has finally broke through as a serious actor and shed the stigma of being another National Lampoons' puppet.  After watching this movie, I had to wonder why he ever did such horrendous trash as Van Wilder. The movie is hard to follow but it pays off.  It's a confusing concept but the director is able to pull everything together solidly by the end of the last short.  I hope this is the new direction that filmmakers are going to take.  Or at least they should.  John August has set a new standard, and it's going to be hard for anyone to keep up with him.
