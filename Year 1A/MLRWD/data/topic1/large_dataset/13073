The film which launched the career of Ewan McGregor was a mesmerising effort, recreating the dark and dingy existance of a group of Scottish heroin addicts brilliantly. Many scenes are wll and truly shocking, especially the dead baby scene and Renton's subsequent hallucination. At times it can almost make disturbing viewing, such as Renton famously diving headfirst into a toilet to retrieve some heroin, and the overdose scene with Lou Reed's Prefect Day in the background. 
Either as a let-up from all this darkness or to make things even mroe stark, here are also sharp moments of humour, such as Spud's Speed-addled job interview and Renton casually talking the parents of Diane, a girl he had just slept with, thinks there her flatmates, before being shocked to see Diane come down the stairs in her school uniform. The way the sex scenes are melded together with video footage of a goal for Scotland's soccer team was unusual, and I challenge you not to laugh when Tommy puts a 'special' tape made of him in action with his girlfriend and is greeted by football, prompting him to think he may have returned the tape to the video shop!
Another standout aspect is the soundtrack. The guy who said he hated all the band son it must peddle a unique taste in music, as many of these tracks are classics. Not only the Lou Reed and Iggy Pop trackswhich may have introduced these veterans to a whole new generation, but also dance tracks like Ice MC's Boom Diggy Boom and Underworld's epochal Born Slippy. Sleeper's cover of Blondie's classic Atomic and tracks from Pulp and Blur add an 'indie' flavour.
All in all I can't recommend watching this enough. And all in all, if after seeing this film heroin appeals to you, you are a strangely sadistic being, as this in no way 'glorifies' heroin.
