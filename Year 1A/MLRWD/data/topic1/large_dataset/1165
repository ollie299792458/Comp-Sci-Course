When the movie came out in theaters, the critics said that this film was not as good as HELLBOY (1), and the director Guillermo del Toro must have had too many creatures left over from the making of PAN'S LABYRINTH, and need a place to put them. I did not see the film in theaters, but purchased the 3 Disc Special Edition. HELLBOY! I think they were totally wrong! HELLBOY 2 The GOLDEN ARMY is better than the first, and there are not too many monsters and creatures in the movie.

I found the movie a combination of THE NEVERENDING STORY and JIM HENSON's "STORYTELLER" series European folklore with John hurt. My criticism of the movie is that there could have been more of HELLBOY in the movie, and we could have done without the character of Johann Krauss voiced by Seth MacFariane. I felt that they should have lost the German or Nazi accent, and used another voice instead. I gew up with the understanding that, "The only good nazi is a dead nazi!"

I hope that director Guillermo del Toro will consider making HELLBOY 3, and be able to slip it into his busy schedule of filming The HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT 2, FRANKENSTEIN, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, and DROOD. Hey, I will volunteer to play the creature in FRANKENSTEIN. I have the body for it. I hope he makes the new FRANKENSTEIN more like the Universal's original FRANKENSTEIN,THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN. Mary Shelley's book FRANKENSTEIN; or THE MODERN PROMETHEUS is just down right depressing. There is a big difference between depressing and one being scary. The book version is just not what us horror fans grew up watching. The character name "Ygor," which appeared in the second and third Universal fils was played masterfully by Bela Logosi.  This is his greatest film characterizations and movie voice of all time. He is not a hunchback or a lab assistant, but diabolically evil. Guillermo del Toro would do better to make a good color version of the GOLEM rather than making the book version of FRANKENSTEIN with a man with scars all over.

HELLBOY 2 The GOLDEN ARMY reminds me of THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS, and what Hellboy found there. If Guillermo del Toro wants to remake a film, then I suggest that he does THE WIZARD OF OZ being more faithful to Baum's original book were Dorothy, a figure heavily influenced by the feminism of Matilda Joslyn Gage. There OZ is meant to be a real place where Dorothy can go back there as a refuge. Guillermo seemed to be inspired by this concept in the writing and filming of PAN'S LABYRINTH.

The 3 Disc Special Edition has better special features than on HELLBOY and PAN'S LABYRINTH. Now the special features is really about too many creatures, but it gives a better understanding of the making and meaning of the film. I can't wait to see the next conception stage of HELLBOY 3. I need to freeze myself so I can awaken at various intervals when they remake some of my favorite movies, such as: LOGAN' RUN, FAHRENHEIT 451, and the sequel to the 1931 version of DRACULA. I already know that I could write a better story line than what the relative of Bram Stoker has planned. The book DRACULA is the first book that I read cover to cover. Bela Lugosi always wanted to do a film remake of DRACULA in color.

The real question about Frankenstein's creature is did Doctor Frankenstein stitch in a soul? Does live automatically grant you a soul, or are they only passed out in heaven?  Which would mean any living thing could possibly said to have a living soul. We know at least HELLBOY has heart. He is red isn't he? HELLBOY has my kind of values: love all cats, eat lots of candy, and drink lots of soda. And that is good enough for me.
