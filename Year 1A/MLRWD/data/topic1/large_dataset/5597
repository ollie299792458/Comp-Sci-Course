Being a former WU Shu and Tae Kwon Do enthusiast and student i remember the first time i saw this movie i was about 12 , it truly changed the view i had on martial arts, i found myself constantly remembering the scenes of this movie when on training and before a real combat tournament i remembered the scene when Tommy Lee was about to leave the team and saying to Alex "Im Afraid" "i cant beat him" referring to Dae Han.

This movie is so realistic and most of the movie focuses on the human feelings of everyone, i think this is maybe the BEST martial arts History or screenplay on a movie...the history is wonderful and you never know what will happen in the end.

Phillip Rhee (Tommy Lee) and his real brother Robert (who plays the role of Dae Han) are the best fighters here and they have to fight for the first time since Dae Han Killed Tommys brother during a tournament combat years ago....

Eric roberts also plays the role of a men who never betrays his family and friends...

I just wish it had subtitles in spanish, or at least in english or commentary by Eric and Phillip Rhee.....wheatever

I will remember this movie forever for the scene when Tommy decides to return to the team after he saw two little brothers with an ice cream and suddenly the ice cream of the little kid goes down and then the older brother gives its ice to his brother.
