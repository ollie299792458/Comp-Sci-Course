Not once dropping the silver doller he keeps clenched between his rear cheeks , Patrick Swayze plays dead guy out for justice,and trying to protect his true love  Demi Moore , in this the movie that showed ,that even ghosts can get beat up on the subway train . The potters wheel scene moved me , to the bathroom , where I couldn't get to the sink , a girl resembling Uma Thurman was snorting coke .WHAT was you doing in the ladies I hear you cry , ah , I was wearing my aloe vera hand cream at the time . I thought not another hour or so of this ,then he goes for help from a medium [Whoopie Goldberg] and the film lightens up . Whoopie's comedy talent  save the  film from being over sentimental cabbage water , and at the start of death , good guys are carried up in a beam of light ,and bad guys are dragged away by evil shadows on minimum pay , to a hotel I once stayed at . I believe the in between guys are ferried across the river mersey, where they wait in line at the passport office for eternity .
