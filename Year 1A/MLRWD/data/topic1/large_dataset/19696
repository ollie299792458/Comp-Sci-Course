Ideal couple lost one of their two kids -- their son. That is all of the story; all other details (»tiny crime act« of their son at the beginning, father's feeling of guilt...) have the only function to prove that we are looking at the ideal family. 
Death of a child IS tragedy!!! And it carries very intimate moments of pain so questions is should those moments be exposed without any other reason but »to touch human heart« even in such form as movie is. 
The other very important fact is that death of a child (UNFORTUNATELY) is not very rare and thousands of such movies, based on the true stories, could be made every year -- the most of them even more tragic -- just ask yourself how many children can afford diving equipment and how many children died of bombs and bullets, how many children died because of lack of food or medicine...
At the end of the movie family refinds its lost »idealness« by driving to the other country (is the reason important?). Is there message: if you have lost your child but do not have car or you can not afford to drive to the other country...? 
This movie seems to be almost mocking to the most of the parents who lost their children. Is it really so easy to »hide wood behind one tree«???
