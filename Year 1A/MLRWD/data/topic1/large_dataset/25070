As their third musical, Rice and Lloyd Webber tackled the then unknown saga of Eva Duarte de Peron. Thanks to the original concept recording and the London/Broadway stagings, EVITA became a world-wide hit. Who would eventually direct and star in the film version? OK...before you can say, "but why Madonna?" you must give the film a chance. While watching the film, I was completely mesmerized and captivated by Madonna.  Not once did I think or imagine her as the "material girl" (although Eva herself may have been the original material girl).  Antonio Banderas is handsome as the characher "Che" (not Guevara).  He, IMHO, represents the people of Argentina...their sentiments towards Eva...his kiss of the coffin in my interpretation is Argentina saying goodbye; she may have been controversial, but even the sceptical probably admired Eva Peron.  The film is epic in scope and recalls the heyday of the film musical. The orchestrations are lush and, as friend of mine would say, "perfected for the screen."  And the inclusion of a new song, "You Must Love Me" to the score is wonderful.  EVITA on stage is a masterpiece...bold and daring and different.  EVITA the movie is a gem.  It is a remarkable piece of film-making and enhances any research on the real Evita. As it having no dialog...remember, it is an opera...and that is a story told through song. Surprise yourself and enjoy the story of one incredible woman!
