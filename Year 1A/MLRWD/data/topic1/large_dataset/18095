Having read Stephen King's novel twice, I decided it might be fun to watch the movie and see if they'd done a good job adapting this enthralling masterpiece. I should have known better...fortunately, the film hasn't managed to ruin my enjoyment of the book (which it could have). I don't understand how people can rate this movie so highly, even those who haven't read the book and so aren't influenced by the original story. But even judged on its own terms, the movie is so unbelievably lame it's almost comical. The characters are completely unconvincing, and there is no real suspense in the whole film. The script leaves out so much vital stuff that the story loses all its potency and just becomes laughable. If you only see the movie you will surely ask yourself, "What the hell was Louis Creed thinking, bringing his son and wife back from the dead? He was warned, wasn't he?" But if you read the book, you DO understand.
Don't bother seeing this. It's no good - compared to the book or otherwise.
