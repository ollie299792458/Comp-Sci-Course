During the Civil War, the order was given for the organization of the first black regiment. To be led by General Robert Shaw, it proved not only to be a significant turning point in the war, but also led to an amazing  act of bravery.
"Glory" follows General Shaw (whose letters a  large portion of the movie is based on), a young, confused man amidst  racism, hate, anger, and war in a struggle for solace. Played by Mathew  Broderick, one of the few roles he fits perfectly, he leads the regiment  into history.
Denzel Washington won a supporting oscar for his role as a  bitter ex-slave who desires to fight, and he'll fight anyone he can. A  monumental success for Washington.
Zwick's direction is enchanting,  capturing the characters faces up close often to examine the mental anguish  surrounding the regiment and making no secret that war is brutal. 
A  war-film of true grit and quality, with an terrificly effective score from  Horner, "Glory" plays off of fact and ends in legend.
