Really the definitive adaptions of Narnia continue, with a vision remarkably true to the story which is quite a feat in any big budget adaption.

The themes of CS Lewis are strong and not 'dumbed down' despite being transposed in the adaptation, and from the again fine choices in casting all round to fantastic production, it's just a rarely wonderful fantasy film.  "It's different everytime" when you return to Narnia and isn't that great!

Andrew Adamson surely must be at the peak of his powers as everything about these Narnia films seems to be at the right time at the right place in my estimation -it's one fault is a mis-guided big end battle narrative that while well done doesn't fit the film but fortunately this can be chapter skipped to the next beat pretty much on the mark of Lucy finding Aslan in the forest for a wonderful conclusion. The the soundtrack isn't as memorably as the first, as the re-use of some of the first outings great themes are in evidence although their are some nice new themes too - the castle raid with the mice being a highlight for that.

A great film experience that again entranced me from the opening to the end...as i thought it would. Why wouldn't you want to go adventuring in Narnia?
