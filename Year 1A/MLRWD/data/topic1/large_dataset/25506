Tropic Thunder takes an absurd, behind the scenes look at a blockbuster Hollywood production while satirizing the war film genre. From tongue in cheek jabs at great war flicks like Platoon and Apocolypse Now, to prima donna actors, to Tinsel Town power brokers (Tom Cruise's best performance of late), nothing is sacred. Stiller's humor is over the top and razor sharp, Jack Black does what he does best, fart jokes and physical comedy, and Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of amazing.

The special features include the standard behind the scenes featurettes and deleted/extended scenes, but hidden among them are two gems. Rain of Madness does for "Making of" documentaries what Tropic Thunder does for Hollywood blockbusters.  Also included is the sketch from the 2008 MTV music awards showing Stiller, Downey, and Black trying to come up with a viral marketing video. The clip had me laughing as much or more than the feature did.

If you are into satire and silliness, Tropic Thunder is a solid fun movie.
