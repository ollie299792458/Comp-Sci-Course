I loved the Natural when it came out in 1984.  The mythical quality of the story, terrific acting by a perfect cast, great editing, and great direction made this film one of my all time favorite sports movies.

So this year a new dvd version is being released that is being called the Director's cut.  Apparently there are 20 minutes of new footage added in, but the editing results in a film that is only 6 minutes longer than the original.  The chief difference between the two versions is that the backstory is relayed primarily through flashback from the "present", as Roy Hobbs returns to his childhood home after 16 years away.  He retrieves "Wonder Boy", then goes to New York to start his career with the NY Knights.

The new version works okay, but I frankly preferred the original.  I preferred its slightly more deliberate pacing, and I don't think the new scenes (primarily extended versions of already existing scenes) added any real value or perspective.  Indeed, one scene in which Memo travels to meet Roy on the road actually detracted from the cohesion of the story.

Bottom line:  if you loved the original, you'll like this one.  It's still basically the same film.  I just don't think it needed any tinkering.
