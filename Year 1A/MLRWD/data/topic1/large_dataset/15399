I speak as someone who has a nine-month old son... watching this movie made me laugh, get angry and contemplate.  Wonderful cast -- Adam Scott is great (although very different from his P&R character -- he can be a bit of a douche at times).  I have never seen Jennifer Westfeldt in anything; however, this movie makes me want to check out Kissing Jessica Stein.  Westfeldt is believable in her role as a somewhat insecure working mother/friend.

My favorite couple is Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd.  They are extremely well placed together -- they pick at each other's quirks and flaws, yet they manage to create this amazing chemistry wherein you believe and relate to them.  (My husband is still quoting some of O'Dowd's lines -- "I did everyone you asked!")

I am not one to watch a lot of romantic comedies -- but I checked this one out because of the great ensemble.  Yes, it can be a bit mushy and gooey (especially toward the end) -- and that is why I knocked it down one star.  But with that said, it's a loving, funny take at parenthood and those relationships surrounding us during this time.
