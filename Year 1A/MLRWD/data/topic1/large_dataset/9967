My Review on Daddy Little Girls

Tyler Perry does it again! creating a story that is not orginal.

Union plays a prissy sucessful lawyer and Elba plays a working class man who is a good father to his three daughters. when the girls grandmother dies of lung cancer her last wish is to have Monty(Elba) the girls  father get full custody of the girls because thier mother is no good drug dealer and the man she is dating is a no good thug that does not care about the welfare of her daughters. The mother is appaled that no one tells her of her mothers passing shows up at the funereal angry wanting her daughters to be with her since she is their mother she  cusses  Monty out and promises him that she will have her daughters back you can guess the ending her since Union plays a very sucessful lawyer who helps Elba

for me this movie is predictable.  I liked the movie because Elba is a hot guy and I read Amazon.com review saying its a positive movie  family friendly movie.

Good points:
 the acting was on point
 positive view of black father

Bad: The characters are cliched
  movie has predictable ending
