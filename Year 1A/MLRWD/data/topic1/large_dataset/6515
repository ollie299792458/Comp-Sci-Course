Hope Lange looking forward to getting married with her boy friend once he returns from over sea's. The naive Diane Baker. The self delusional actress Suzy Parker. The disappointed uptight Martha Hyer. The mean boss Joan Crawford. The slightly inebriated handsome Steven Boyd. The lecherous Brian Aherne. The stage Director Louis Jourdan. The phony self centered Robert Evens. Great Johnny Mathis theme + haunting sound track.  There are other minor characters that also have a piece of this wonderful film.
Author,Rona Jaffe is interviewed (Sylvia Stoddard)  and has her complaint's on how her book was changed for the movie. I got a couple of laugh's out of her cranky complaint's.
She made a big hit with her first book here. Movies don't usually follow the book that closely and this film is no exception. I like the movie version better than the book. The book is not as up beat as what's up on the screen here.
It's one of those movies you can see over and over again.
Other film's that relate more to women than men are;"Summertime","My Life In Ruin's","Love, Pain and The Whole Damn Thing","Brief Encounter","Come Back To Me","Roman Holiday" just to name a few.  Note;English&Spanish Subtitles. Stereo,Color,Cinemascope,Wide screen format. Trailer,Movietone;Premiere,121 minutes.  Released in 1959.  I ended up having a crush on Hope Lange and I alway's liked the cute talented Diane Baker. A woman friend asked me why I didn't have any movies with romantic themes. So, now my overall movie collection includes all categories, I think ?
