Battlefield Earth is based on the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same title. I actually enjoyed the book, even though it was far fetched and silly. The movie is perhaps even more silly and unbelievable. The plot is outlandish and full of giant plot holes, most notably how things like electronics still work and books are preserved after a thousand years. Camera angles and colors are weird and the villains laughable. John Travolta has fun and leaves no piece of scenery unchewed with his role as the lead villain, Terl. The actors playing humans deliver pretty good performances; Barry Pepper's Jonie is a good hero in search of a better movie.

The film raised some controversy for its connections to Scientology, being based on a book by Hubbard, but there's nothing about Scientology in it nor in the book (although HUbbard's dislike for psychiatry was evident in the book). "Battlefield Earth" is just a misguided movie. It might have been possible to make it into a decent movie if they'd been able to make it more believable. Instead it's a classic bad movie and a pretty entertaining one. It's certainly a must-see for bad movie aficionados. The DVD has a short behind the scenes feature that's pretty interesting, and a commentary by director Roger Christian and production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. It's fascinating to see how much effort, and obviously talent, that was invested into this movie and it still turned out the way it did. These special features made me appreciate the movie more.  Recommended for fans of bad movies, silly sci-fi-epics. or comic book style movies.
