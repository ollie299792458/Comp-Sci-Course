There is no accounting for taste.
The magic of this film worked for me and for thousands of others.
But it doesn't work for everyone.

If the magic doesn't work for you that's fine.
A prior review here used considerable intellect and very good critical faculties to justify a response that is emotional and taste related.
It doesn't come close to capturing the beauty of the film.

What Anderson does miraculously is distance you with satire and artifice at the same time he draws you in emotionally with a look at good people struggling with complex feelings.
Good fairy tales do the same.
The imagery, use of music, cinematography, and script are all creative and for me were magical.

Look at Anthony Lane's review in The New Yorker. Lane is one of our better reviewers and has the expertise to look at this film far more perceptively than I can or the prior reviewer can.
You may still not like the film.
I've been a serious filmgoer for 50 years. I'm also not a Wes Anderson junky. I don't like all of his films.
I loved this one.
