In the year 1957, the Russians bombed the US.  The only city that escaped distruction was Vegas.  Elvis was king.  But now, the King is dead.  From out of the desert come Buddy, the only man who has the guitar skills to be  crowned the next king.  His problem...aside from compeditors who wish to be  king, Death is on his trail, hoping to be the one who will stop Buddy and  become king himself.  This film is an excellent example of the spirit of  Indipendant film.  There is no chance that any major studio would want to  release a film like this.  It is a very stupid film, but that is it's stong  point.  You have so much fun with this movie, that it doesn't matter.  That's what makes this film work so well, it is so bizzare that you are  drawn into it.  My favorite moment of the film is near the end where Buddy  faces off against Death in a battle of guitarrs.  Buddy, with his 50's  sound against Death, and the power of metal.  This is definately worth the  time of those who enjoy films that are most likely to have a cult status.
