WWF's wrestling superstar "The Rock" stars as Mathayus in the 2002 movie The Scorpion King. Michael Clarke Duncan (Balthazar), Kelly Hu (Cassandra), Steven Brand (Memnon), Peter Facinelli (Takmet), Branscombe Richmond (Jesup), and others star in Chuck Russell's prequel to Stephen Somers' 2001 smash The Mummy Returns. Stephen Somers didn't direct, but did assist in writing the story, screenplay, and producing. Executive producer was Vince McMahon, son of Vince McMahon Sr., who owns 70% of the WWF. I think this movie was more about trying to launch "The Rock's" career than making any real sense. It was as if Chuck Russell tried to get as many fighting scenes into a 92 minute movie as possible. In the Mummy Returns The Scorpion King is portrayed as an evil tyrant who wants to take over the world and kill all his enemies. He even made a deal with a dark God! So how in this movie can he be perceived as a good guy who overthrows a king for the reasons he is fighting for in the sequel? Either the movie wasn't long enough or they should've made a prequel to The Scorpion King. Why did Mathayus The Scorpion King turn evil? It's not a bad movie, but I think there are too many unanswered questions. Good action. Good cast. Good movie. Overall, I'd stick with the original movies by Stephen Somers.
