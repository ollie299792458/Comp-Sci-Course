Ok, I agree with the other reviews to a degree. There is a moment of freezing on Paul Rogers song. I agree if the goal was to highlight the Fender Strat that there could have been more big names and more emphasis on the strat. But I bought this dvd for David Gilmour. Anything else would be cake. If you forget that this is a celebration of the strat and ignore minor technical glitches (hey this was a relatively cheap dvd) and just pay attention to the music- I found it to be quite good! I don't find the performers to be "bored and boring" in the slightests. In fact most of them look like they are enjoying themselves immensely! I'm really glad I bought this dvd. If you are a perfectionist stay away from this dvd. If you just like music of a wide variety of styles.... get it. It really is pretty good. And a live version of Pink Floyds' "Marooned" (which will be an extra feature on the Pink Floyd Pulse dvd when it is FINALLY released in September) is unavailable on any other dvd... so that alone makes the disk worthwhile.
