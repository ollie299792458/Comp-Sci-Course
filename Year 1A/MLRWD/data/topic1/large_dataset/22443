This film is Brad Pitt's best movie and role ever.  The shear magnificence of the sceneries, the ultimately fatalistic beauty of all the characters, and the emotional bond you develop for each of them makes for a totally  enjoyable movie experience.  Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn, Anthony  Hopkins, and Henry thomas are the epitome of the tragic family which  renders heartbreak into an artform.  You truly feel the pain of a  disintegrating family that never quite loses it all.  You cheer for them at  the end, after having obtain their redemption.  Julia Ormond is classically  gorgeous, and Brad Pitt plays the role of the noble tragic hero to  flawlessness.  Henry Thomas, although a short presence on film, still plays  a character which still haunts the other characters and the audience long  after his death. You can't help but to feel for and cheer for Aidan Quinn's  character.  He epitomizes the "nice guy finishes last"  philosophy, and his heartache is palpable. Anthony Hopkins is the noblest  of father figures, although his Scrooge transformation after his stroke  almost made him laughable.  I like the way the film touches on so many  other themes, such as discrimination against American Indians, prohibition,  the inherent evil of government, love and war are often the same,  and the  timeless theme of how life is filled with tragedy and heartbreak.  Tristan's character epitomizes these themes, and he is indeed the rock that  everyone shatters against.  Everyone around him dies young, while he gets  older. His is the kind of character that remains in your mind long after  the credits end, and you're left always wondering whatever happened to him.  Gorgeous filmmaking indeed.
