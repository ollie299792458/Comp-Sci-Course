First of all I must say I am a huge Mothra and Godzilla fan (this is the reason I just had to have this movie for my collection)! This movie stars Emi and Yumi Ito, "The Peanuts" who play  the twin fairies from Infant Island. They also played them in the first Mothra movie ever released in 1961. Here is what it says on the back of the box: "After a fierce typhoon, a mysterious gigantic egg washes ashore. The twin fairies of Infant Island plea for the egg's return to Mothra, its rightful owner, but it's too late - greedy promoters have turned it into an amusement park attraction. Meanwhile Godzilla reawakens and tramples across Japan, heading straight for the big egg. Can Mothra save her offspring from Godzilla? Will Japan survive this epic monster battle?" Sounds good right?! Anyway I enjoyed this movie sooo much, its one of those movies you can sit down and watch over and over at the edge of your seat in suspense, even though you know whats going to happen. Its just that good! I also have to say the special affects are great for 1964 when the movie was made. Also the old original flailing of monster heads, tails, wings, and other appendages are all there (just one of those old movies that all adults used to watch in horror, but laugh at today). I highly recommend this movie for many reasons: if your into fighting and monster action, if you have a history of watching these as kids, if you have an incomplete Godzilla movie collection, or if your just one of those monster sci-fi nerds. Please enjoy if you decide to purchase this item, I promise you wont regret it! (its also a perfect gift for a birthday or Christmas if you have Godzilla fan children from ages 7 and up!)
