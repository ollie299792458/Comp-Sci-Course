I had heard good things about this movie and of course about its great twist ending. Like others we spent most of the time trying to figure out what the twist could be. We had it figured out about half way through at least to a point; unfortunately that was the most entertaining part of the movie.
It was very predictable and in some cases just lazy in its attempt in being cunning, the Dad was a complete moron, the psychologist needed to be killed, why didn't anyone kill her?
This movie could have been so much better if they would have just spent a little more time making the orphan a bit more believable in her manipulations. I mean who wouldn't guess that as soon as the mother told her Mother in-law to make sure Isabelle stays put, the Mother in-law gives her a dollar for a soda around the corner.
If you liked the (Good son, bad seed) and so on, this will not disappoint and Isabelle Fuhrman plays the part very well. The twist is good, but the finish is very predictable...
