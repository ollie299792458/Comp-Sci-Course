This Carrie is better than the first. The first Carrie made starred Sissy Spacek and she did an excellent job playing the role of Carrie and I often wish she could have been in this one! However the newer actress(angela bettis) does do a remarkable job. It is nice to see that the woman playing Carries mother in the remake was not as crazy as the one in the first. In the first Carrie, Carries mother (played by actress Piper Laurie) kinda went overboard with the whole dying thing. She looked more like she was doing something else but I decline to actually write what that looked like in a review. Lets just say, it didn't look right with the rest of the movie in the first movie. In the second movie that scene wasn't even in it and it is a lot more tasteful and somewhat closer to the book. In the remake, Carries mother dies of a heart attack rather than a stabbing, a better touch I thought.  The new actresses are really good! It has a nice touch adding the police investigation to it I thought and this is just overall a better version of the movie. There are some scenes to the movie that make this a much better film. The first movie was classic 1970's style horror. The remake is more modern and much better.
