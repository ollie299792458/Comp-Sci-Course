I found this movie "watchable" and the performances were good.  However, I found the message of this movie disturbing.

Flor (Paz Vega) is a wonderful housekeeper.  She's warm, loving and caring ... and of course, beautiful. This IS Hollywood! Her daughter is also all of the above and the "lady of the house", Deborah (Tea Leoni) likes her a lot. She spoils her without her mother's approval. However, Deborah also arranges for the daughter to go to a good school on a scholarship. At the end of the movie, Flor quits her job and insists her daughter leave the school, despite Deborah and her spineless husband insisting that she stays.  The daughter gets upset about this, thinking of her future of course. Flor utters "wise" words stating that the daughter seems unimpressed that she might end up like her mother one day and is she ashamed? The daughter whole-heartedly accepts this as gospel.

Hello?!?

Flor is a gorgeous woman who has done well with herself as an illegal immigrant, but hey - is there anything wrong with grabbing the chance to excel beyond housekeeper?!  Has that got anything to do with being ashamed of your mother?! Nada.

I found that message quite ordinary and I ended up wanting to punch that sweet Flor. It completely ruined the movie for me.
