It's been more than 6 months since I watched this movie, but there are parts of it that I will never forget.  The "killing floor" scene will stay with me for the rest of my life.  My neighbor asked me to watch this movie because both of our households eat nothing but organic food.  She owned the movie and thought we'd enjoy watching it.  I can't honestly say that I "enjoyed" watching all of it because much of it was graphic cruelty to animals, and we care deeply about animals at our house.  However, I can honestly say that it was the most important movie I have ever watched when it comes to thinking about the food we eat.  After watching the entire DVD, including all of the special features, we have not eaten another bite of meat from anywhere and have not purchased any meat whatsoever, not even organic meat.  We have literally been vegetarians ever since watching this movie, without regret.  Because of this movie, never again will an animal have to die to feed my family.  No more pork, beef, chicken, fish, or any other breathing being will die to feed us.  We never saw this coming when we sat down to watch this movie, but I am a changed soul for having watched it and highly recommend it to everyone.
