This movie portrays the hypocrisy of so-called "free nations" that preach about human rights and dignity whilst using rogue nations to do their dirty work. The CIA agent (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) at one point says "this is my first torture", an apt description of what Anwar El-Ibrahimi (played honestly and believably by Omar Metwally) endured, after chance links him to terrorist bombers. Appropriately for me the story starts in South Africa, a country which experienced a case similar to the one described in the movie, in October 2005. A local Pakistani national was abducted in the middle of the night, was driven several hundred kilometers to an airforce base in Pretoria and flown out of South Africa to an unknown destination for interrogation. It has subsequently emerged that the individual concerned was flown to Pakistan. Events around this story (see here: http://www.mnet.co.za/Mnet/Shows/carteblanche/story.asp?Id=3078) add to the credibilty of the movie and the need for those of us who are "free" to stand up to such human rights abuses and insist on fair and due process. Remember: all that it takes for evil to succeed is that good men do nothing.
