Congratulations to the filmmakers and financiers of this bold film, and also to the Academy for giving it prominence.  
"Boys Don't Cry" succeeds as a portrait not only of a sexual identity crisis but  simply as a portrait of one woman's compassion (Chloe Sevigny) for another  human being--it succeeds where "My Own Private Idaho" failed  because "Boys" is an aesthetically cohesive work of art.  Director Kimberly Pierce is astonishly gifted.  Her attention to detail,  composition, and her ability to use locations and static objects as  metaphors for what is transpiring in the minds and lives her her characters  is remarkable.  The editing is also another noteworthy feature (although  the use of flashbacks in Act III is unnecessary and detracts from one of  the film's most powerful scenes).
Although Hilary Swank is undeniably  amazing, it is the character played by Chloe Sevingny that gives this film  its emotional resonance.  Her role is not a supporting role but a lead  role--in fact she is technically the protagonist (undergoes classic  character change)and has nearly as much screen time as Swank.  Sevingny's  performance is absolutely brilliant.
One warning:  I walked into this  film unaware of how disturbing it would be and was blindsided.  This is a  gritty, no holds barred film about a sensitive subject.
Although I doubt  this was Kimberly Pierce's primary intent, the film also stands as a  powerful argument in favor of hate crime legislation.  There is an  emotional plea for tolerance at the core of this movie, and people on the  political fence may find that this film moves them in the direction of  conceding that hate crimes comprise a separate category.
