This is one of those movies that we, the parents, don't mind watching over and over, and not being an Adam Sandler fan per se, I can honestly say I think he is quite funny in this one.  We are typically pretty conservative in terms of what we will let our kids watch, but there are only maybe two words that I thought were mildly inappropriate (sexy and stupid were each used once that I recall).  There is one kissing scene, but it is not steamy (the kids still say "EWWWW!" though!), and for a change, there are no overt or covert political agendas being promoted as in so many other movies these days.

My only negative, as in almost every-other Disney movie out there, is that they have to take at least one of the parents out of the picture.  Why is there ALWAYS an absent parent at the crux of these kids' movies!?  I understand that divorce is a huge part of life these days, and thankfully (spoiler alert) these kids get the stable family they need in the end, but, come-on, is it really that hard to write a compelling story around an in-tact family?

Enough ranting.  Great original movie for all ages!  (our kids are 5 & 7)
