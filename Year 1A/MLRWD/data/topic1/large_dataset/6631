Something strange is going on in the world of film. Pathetically pointless narratives are being made into big movies and sold on the basis of a few images and who is in the starring and supporting roles. I don't know whether to blame the director or the script writer, but this is just utter garbage. All of the characters are caracatured. The whole film seems to be an excuse to repeat a mix between The Matrix and Hero, but with none of the style of either. Mr Morgan Freeman: What are you doing in this film? Bob Hoskins is a decent actor, but why did he take this role? Jet Li: Surely someone can write you a better script than this. Herzog, the great German director, believes -- and I agree with him -- that we are living amid a collapsing civilization, in part evident in the paucity of its images. This film is horrid, from beginning to end. Even the violence is totally lame and unreal. Fake blood appears to be wiped off in the next frame. It's so sloppy and bad it makes me sad, not angry. I'm not even going to watch the "special features" on the DVD. I'm just going eject and try to find something better. DO NOT waste your money on this. Luc Besson, if you read this, if you can't do better than this, please don't "do" anything further at all. Give up and go away. p.s., I'm obliged by the system here to give this film one star whereas I'd actually give it none.
