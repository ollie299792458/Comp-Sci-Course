Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is the dark knight the way he truly was meant to be.  Despite the many excellent incarnations of him, no one ever portrayed as well as the producers of this movie.  They're also responsible for the remarkable series, which came out when I was 9 years.  I loved it!!  Now that I'm older, I love it even more.  The series was clearly made for an older crowd.  So was this movie, for if I had seen it when I was younger, I surely would not have liked it as much as my mother would have!!

The story is very deep, with many twists and also many mature themes.  It also shows an alternate reason for Bruce Wayne choosing to become Batman, which is a broken heart.  Batman Begins did explore Batman's origin, however it cannot even come close to being compared to Mask of the Phantasm.  NO live action movie to date and in the future will ever match the perfection of this film.  Alan Burnett, Bruce Timm and their production team made the most under-rated movie ever.  And Kevin Conroy is undoubtedly the greatest actor to ever play the role of Batman.  Highly recommended movie!!!!!!!  Indeed it is the best Batman film ever made!
