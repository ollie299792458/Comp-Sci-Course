Years later, another look at The Big Knife. Due respect to other reviewers, but "blacklist" analogies never occurred to me when first viewed in 1956... or anytime after, nor are they necessary to an appreciation of the film.  The cast alone, even for those possibly indifferent to the younger Jack Palance, make this something to see: Ida Lupino, Wendell Corey, Everett Sloane, Jean Hagen, Shelley Winters, Ilka Chase, and the absolutely, quintessential  Rod Steiger: exuberantly, enthusiastically, maniacally overacting as the LBMayer/HarryCohn/JackWarner producer. Steiger farcically, outrageously, climbs the curtains and gnaws the rugs but is great fun to watch. A mid-fifties polemic upon the Big Bad Castrating Studio System, featuring some of the choicest Odets rococo, Steiger makes it seem also a blast at Actors Studio and The Method. Alas, the ending is unbearably, incredibly, insupportably, contextually wrong and amateurishly executed, too horrible even to be camp,as a nattering moralist is trotted center stage to prate nobly while a---wait for it!--yes, a Demillian Celestial Chorus oohs and ums.
