WB has every right to release the same cartoons over and over every time a new format comes out. As a fan or collector we have the choice to buy what we want. Yes, as a collector it's frustrating, but I'll bet you remember purchasing your favorite record album, then again in 8-track, then again in cassette and yet again as a CD, and "yipee" now there's MP3's... such is life. If HD, 3D, Blu Ray and huge hi-tec flat screens are your thing and you happen to love classic WB cartoons, your in luck with this set, and probably many more to come. Like many people I want to own them all, the complete library, I'm a collector. I don't care about the format, my collection is made up of VHS and DVD. For me the question is; Do I have this toon? If a set comes out with 60 titles and it contains only 10 that I need, I might buy it, it's my choice. Honestly I'm quite happy with the old-grainy-washed-out originals on VHS. Stupor Salesman gets me every time, regardless of the picture quality. Between VHS and DVD I have an impressive collection, but I am still missing so many more. So I hope they keep em coming, even if I have to buy 30 to get 3. My biggest problem might be owning a VHS player that works for the next 20 years. I hope someday to have them all, then after I pass away the whole collection will be on a lawn somewhere for a dollar.
