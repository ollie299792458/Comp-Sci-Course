When I decided to watch this dvd, I expected a light funny movie, with crossdressers and a fun cast of eccentric characters. Instead, we get a film with gratuitous t&a, unfunny homosexual stereotypes and Cuba masquerading unsuccessfully as a gay man. Bleh.
I guess it's just me, but I struggled through watching Boat Trip, hoping there would be some redeeming quality to this dreck. Unfortunately this proved to be a waste of time. While I agree gays were quite stereotyped, the portrayal of women was downright exploitive. No opportunity was missed to show women topless and nude (including the opening DVD splash page). Ech. The purpose of such gratuitous scenes seemed to be to throw a bone to the heterosexual male audience "Yep, we know the film is full of gay men, so...Here, we'll show another topless woman..." Bleh....
Also, the main character Cuba plays never really LEARNS from his mistakes....He changes because he's forced to, not because he wants to. And this is supposed to be positive? He lies to his girlfriend the ENTIRE movie and she of course forgives him immediately? Please brother. 
A disappointing film on many levels, and not remotely funny.
