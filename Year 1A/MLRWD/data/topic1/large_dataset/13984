I find myself often in a position of automatically assuming that a Director's Cut is going to be a better version of a film. In this case it was a completely different film. The new director's cut is masterfully done, especially considering the lengths they had to go through to make it. Had I never seen the theatrical version, I would say it is unequivocally one of the best anti-hero movies I have ever seen. There are some scenes that have been re-added that I feel are extremely important to properly developing porter. One of which unfortunately could not co-exist with the theatrical version's "third act" or I might suggest a combination recut. I think the director's cut truly showcases the vision that was behind the movie originally. The mood is dead on, and Gibson's performance draws a gut-shot reaction in a few places that is truly visceral. I do find myself still yearning for the voice-overs, mostly due to my own love affair with noir, and that blue filter. There was a playfulness to the original cut that I thought worked very well, however in light of the director's cut it's easy to see it was not what was intended. I think I'd be more inclined to rate this movie higher had they not axed some of the more classic noir elements I enjoyed  in the theatrical version. However, many people seem pleased with the removal of those elements, so there it is. All and all I would say that it is worthwhile to buy both copies of the movie. I wish they ahd packaged both together instead of forcing us to buy them separately because they really are two separate takes on the same story.
