Clint Eastwood has, over the years, quite cleverly hidden a speech impediment that hampered his early forays into acting. His technique is based on an old French teaching about the linguistic problems experienced by some people, such as Jonathan Ross. Both Clint and Jonathan have difficulty pronouncing the letter 'w'.

Whereas Rossy just dives on in and has made it a feature of his persona, Clint has used the Fleuron approach where the letter is pretty much negated and often not pronounced at all. In 'Dirty Harry', his line about feeling lucky, to the punk, he says, '...to tell you the tooth...', note 'tooth', not 'truth'. To most ears this sounds acceptable and normal but in all of Clints films, use of 'w' words is kept to a strict minimum.

The music in this film is also quite grating, possibly to cover for the woeful dialogue. A chap called Lilo Shafter did the music, and from scant listening it sounds like music from a skin flick from the same era. All in all I cannot see one good thing to recommend this excellent film to others to miss it.

The story is entertaining, the acting is bad, the special effects are terrible, editing and lighting is adequate given the equipment used but unforgivable in this day and age of DVD's and MP3's. All in all, I would give this film 3 stars, minus two for the reasons above, plus 3 for Clints acting, minus 2 for the title, add three for the music, take one for the bloke out of Hellraiser being in it and finally minus 2 for the use of the Fleuron approach to the 23rd, and sacred, letter.
