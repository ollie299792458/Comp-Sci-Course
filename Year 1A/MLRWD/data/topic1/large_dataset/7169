Between its title and the two leading stars, you might expect this to be a frothy, romantic comedy with a Parisian backdrop; well, you would be wrong. And if this what you are looking for, you might want to set a course for a different land. This is one in a long line of self-reflexive big budget Hollywood films which aim to take us inside the machine. All of the cliches so hard-ridden into our collective consciousness from Hollywood's grand golden era are gently lampooned all while creating an exciting (albeit absurd) plot of it's own. This is the story of writer Richard Benson (William Holden) and Gabrielle Simpson (Audrey Hepburn), hired as his typist, and there adventure in writing a screenplay over a weekend in Paris. It's a great joy to watch these two masterful actors tear down the fourth wall and show us what they really do for a living. "Paris" spotlights both the difficulty and, you might say, relative ease of creation, and the undeniable importance of these remarkably talented (albeit heavily eccentric) creators. If you love film, and all of it's many flaws, you will find a lot to like with this one.

If you are watching the film for either of its stars, rest assured they are in top form and Audrey looks impossibly glamorous as always. There are also some tremendously well-played cameos. A very fun film which moves by at a brisk pace, and is even more fascinating with the passage of time. It's not perfect, but it's awfully good; a minor gem worthy of your time and rediscovery.

The quality of the DVD print is excellent with bright luminescent colors and nice inky blacks. There are a few specks here and there but otherwise the print looks amazing. This could only be bettered by the higher bitrate Blu-ray has to offer. Sound is likewise clean and free of overbearing hiss, pops or other such defects.
