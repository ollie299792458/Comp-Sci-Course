A story with definite potential proves a flop due to, yes, lack of focus,but also trite assertions (It's ALL about the money), and poor directing/acting by a Ben Affleck wannabe. Christopher Walken was the lone saving grace of this movie because he is Christopher Walken, not because of any merit by the so-deemed crafters of the film. Alas, Rod Steiger's potential impact was scuttled due to inept scripting and direction, which can nearly be said for the muted Ricky Schroeder as well.

Indeed, the screenplay shamelessly [copied] numerous other works, the game scenes were all flash which at best contradicts the reality (pool hustling is about hiding your skill, not advertising it so all the big-money patsies will steer well clear of you), and hustlers very rarely get hustled by other hustlers, especially from such a sophmoric trick like giving away several balls in an eightball match.This cheap con works only with the most naive amateurs.

Two stars is a generous rating for this flic which is well outclassed by The Color of Money, which plays a distant second to the classic The Hustler (featuring Willie Mosconi whom many still regard as the best player of all time, Jake LaMotta of belated boxing fame, and not to mention Jackie Gleason who was an expert pool player himself- the camera never blinks when he takes a shot). If you enjoy gambling stories in general, check out The Cincinnati Kid starring Steve McQueen, Karl Malden and Edward G. Robinson, a nearly forgotten gem that is to Rounders what The Hustler is to The Color of Money.
