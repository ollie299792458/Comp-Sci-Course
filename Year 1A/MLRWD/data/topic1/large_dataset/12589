When it comes to reviewing movies like Gone in 60 Seconds, the critics are just plain stupid.  You can't rate this film on Grammy Categories.  This is a flick about cars.  Sexy, fast, adrenaline pumping, loud, oh-my-god-it's-in-digital-surround-sound cars.  There's nothing like hearing a Supercharged-Nitrous-pumping 1967 Shelby GT 500 Mustang in Digital Surround.  I don't care what the critics gave this movie.  With a kick-ass cast and supporting stars with names of Porsche, Lamborghini, BMW, Hemi Cuda and Ferrari just to name a few; you can't go wrong.  And there was actually a plot.  You have to remember this is a 100% guy movie.  When I stepped out of the theatre I heard booster wanna-be's revving up their ladies all over the parking lot.  That's what this movie is about.  If you actually try to rate this movie, you'll be dissapointed.  But if you just sit back, relax, and picture yourself in the driver's seat, you'll absolutely love it.  I'd recommend it to every guy who has ever exceeded the speed limit.  (and come on, how can you give a movie with Angelina Jolie in it a bad rating...)
