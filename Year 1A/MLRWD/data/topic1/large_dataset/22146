I remember those days. I was a young ex-pat living in Germany during the RAF's heydey, and I remember well the sense of dread and impending doom this group managed to inculcate in the society. Especially, I remember the Mogadishu crisis; unfortunately, this episode I feel was rather neglected inthe movie.
It was therefore fascinating to get behind the scenes of the story, to get beneath the skin of the main protagonist. I'm not sure how true-to-life the movie is, but it paints Andreas Baader as a hot-blooded gangster who just happened to find a cause into which to focus his unreigned aggression. The two women Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Enslinn came across as far more intelligent, and more human as a consequence. In particular, the split in Meinhof's personality becomes clear. According to the film, this was a woman, a mother, with all the right instincts and a deep sense of justice; then "something happened". That sense of justice hardened into a curtain behind which  lost herself. What a waste of a basically good human being.
HIghly recommended.
