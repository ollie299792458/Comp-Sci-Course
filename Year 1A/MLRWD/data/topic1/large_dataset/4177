This is the reason I own a DVD player.  The sound is incredible.  The visuals are crystal clear.  This is the complete version of the Pay-Per-View show featured on Directv in August, and it is far superior not only because it also includes MY WIFE, RELAY, 5:15, THE REAL ME, and more.  (The PPV was a paltry 90 minutes!) It's because it's all on DVD.  If you have a halfway decent sound system you're going to feel like you're front and center at Royal Albert Hall.
Some have criticized the fast-pace cutting.  I think it's edited the way a rock concert should be.  It creates a frenetic ambience which puts you right on stage with the greatest rock band in the world.  Sure, these guys are pushing sixty, but the energy is still there.  The pouty, snarling Townshend, and the grinning, happy-go-lucky Daltrey, are the yin and yang of this legendary band, and they're anchored by a guy who is probably the best musician of the lot -- John Entwistle, bass player extraordinaire.  (You're going to love the bass-cam shots on 5:15).  Rounding out the quartet and sitting in for Keith "I died in 1978" Moon is none other than Zak Starkey, son of a Beatle, and a darn good drummer himself. 
I highly recommend this double-disc selection.  (The second disc has some rehearsal footage and a mini-documentary on the charity.  Great stuff, but I must admit I wanted more extras -- maybe some highlights from the 2000 tour?).
