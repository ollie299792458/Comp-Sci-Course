If I was reviewing the movie (I do not feel this is the place for that), I would have given it three stars (I enjoyed it but it wasn't one of the Marx Brothers' best). However, this review is about the DVD itself. The packaging itself is cheap looking with no literature inside. The case jacket claims, under a Special Features heading, to have been Digitally Mastered, which, at first glance, suggests it was digitally restored or remastered. Actually, it's just marketing spin. Although video quality was good, it was not restored or remastered. It was just digitized, which is the only way it could have been put on a DVD (and what's so special about that?).

Also listed under Special Features was full screen version (which isn't wide screen but neither was the original movie so what's special about that?), Dolby Monaural Audio (that's special?), Interactive Menus (two selections: Play and Scene Selection), and Scene Index (double talk here, it's already included under "Interactive Menus" and practically all DVDs have them anyway so what's so special about that?).

Despite the claims on the case jacket, there are no special features. All one gets is the movie. Audio and video is ok. At least I didn't notice any splices or scratches in the film. At $14.98, it was definitely overpriced for what one gets. I've gotten far better from the $3.98 bargain bins.
