I first saw this film in theaters ten years ago when I was 14 - the age of the prime target Spice Girls fan at that time - and I absolutely hated it. So I have no idea what drove me to watch it again now, let alone buy it. But it seems that the wisdom that comes with growing older, and growing out of a taste for teen pop, leaves me with an ability to finally appreciate Spice World for what it is: a slight, yet unpretentious and oftentimes hilarious film that doesn't take itself too seriously and is having an awful lot of fun doing it.

Seriously, the Spice Girls seem to be natural comediennes. Their comic timing is brilliant, and they all have personality to spare. (Their lip-synching abilities are another matter.) There's also an amazing host of well-known British actors who you'd normally think wouldn't be caught dead in a film like this - Alan Cummings, Bob Hoskins, Stephen Fry for starters. I particularly loved Richard E. Grant as their uptight, controlling manager. I recognized him as the devious butler from Gosford Park, and his character here is a complete 180 of that.

Forget the paper-thin, near-pointless plot - something involving a pregnant best friend, the pressures of fame and too many gigs, yadda yadda yadda. When you're having this much fun watching a movie, who needs a story to make sense of all the insanity and inanity?
