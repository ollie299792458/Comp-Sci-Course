An excellant movie that truly gives scares.  The story line of a ship that  was lost and then come back seven years later only to be haunted by the  crew aboard her was amazing.  Who ever thought of that was a genious.  I  love Horror movies, not these slasher movies like Scream 2 (Scream was  actually good)and I know What You Did Last Summer, but the ones that work  on a pshycological level.  Eg:  The Changling, Poltergeist, The Exorcist,  Black Christmas, The Omen and this one plus many more.  The Special effects  are great and they got top notch actors but still some scenes seem to  faulter.  There was alot of blood and that didn't bother me but bothered  others they maybe should backed off a little on the gore.  When it came  time for the scares this one delivered.  There are only two movies that I  can't watch by myself and they are The Exorcist and Event Horizon.  I know  that Event Horizon isn't the scariest but...  If your in the mood for a  Horror you can't go wrong with this movie.
