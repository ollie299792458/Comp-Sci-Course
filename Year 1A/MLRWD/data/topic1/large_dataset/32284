Air Jordan and the Heckling Hare? Couldn't work.....could it? Leave your cynicism about merchaindaising at the door, because Space Jam accomplishes something that The Flintstones Meets The Jetsons, or other such fare, could never achieve. First, for such a goofy concept, the film is remarkably grounded in reality, and some of the best scenes are about victimized NBA players dealing with no talents; add to that the implications of Jordan's experience with the Looneys affecting his chosen sport. Performances are dead-on, and Michael is as properly laconic an actor as he is a player. Finally, the key to this is the Looney Tunes themselves - it's their first foray into true feature films. Thankfully, each character (especially Bugs and Daffy, and those two ought to be) are complete in character as they were in the 40s and 50s. Seeing Bugs get equal billing as the live-action star is beyond promising; it's a reminder that Bugs Bunny has possibly meant more to Americans than a great deal of actors, writers, and directors combined. People will pass on, but the "mild-mannered forest creature", as he himself would put it, will live on into eternity.
