I remember when this movie came out- some of my friends were planning on going to see it, but I didn't go.  After that night when they went, I never heard anything else about it.  They never really commented on it and I never really heard anything about the movie from the media.  This was about 3 years ago.  As I was walking through Blockbuster the other day I saw it on the shelf, and, seeing as I was at a loss on what movie to rent, I decided- what the heck- I've never seen this, I guess it's better than nothing.  When I got home, I put it in, not really knowing what to expect, and what I got was amazing.  This movie is so brilliantly acted and so real that I found myself feeling every change, every emotion- hearing the sounds- experiencing the pains and the triumph.  It actually took two watches for the complete circle of the story to sink in and hit me.

The previous reviewer said that this movie was nothing special because it is the same story as so many people.....I think that's what makes it so much more heart-wrenching.  We each are only exposed to the lives of the people around us and it is so easy to forget the trial and heartache of so many people in this world- in the past and in the present.  This story was so real to me, not only because it was based on a true story, but because I know that there are so many people that live the same thing, or were the product of an enviorment like it.

This movie is one that will draw you in with it's innocence and clutch you with it's horrific reality.  A great movie for anyone who isn't afraid of the reality of this world- the good and the bad- and who enjoys a film that doesn't have the stereotypical "happily ever after" ending.

One of my favorite films......I was blown away!!!
