1996:  The city of Los Angeles is an absolute wreck.  Crime abounds, with the most notorious bad guy around, Simon Phoenix(Wesley Snipes) taking it all in like one big joke.  John Spartan (Stallone) has been after this guy for several years, but in the process of finally arresting Phoenix, the building around them explodes, appartently taking several innocent hostages up with it.  Spartan is stripped of his rank and sentenced to cryogenic imprisonment for 70 years.
2032:  Spartan has served 36 years of his sentence.  Phoenix, who was imprisoned in the same facility, escapes and begins to reinvigorate his reign of terror.  The only problem is that the LA that Spartan, Phoenix, and the rest of us all know and love has turned into a megalopolis called San Angeles, a politically correct paradise where there is absolutely no violent crime---correction, no crime of any kind---whatsoever. (There is also no profanity, and anyone who swears is fined for violations of the Verbal Morality Statute.) Consequently, people have forgotten how to deal with a fugitive like Phoenix.  The only solution is to bring Spartan out of the freezer, which is exactly what happens.
This movie introduced me to action movies, particularly Stallone movies, and the movie soundtrack genre.  The special effects will blow you away all by themselves.  This was also the first movie I ever saw with Sandra Bullock.  Perhaps it's because of her airy portrayal of Lt. Huxley that made me think of her as my favorite actress for a while.  But that's another story.
I think that San Angeles is a funny bone-tickling example of political correctness gone to far.  Either that or it's social conservatism. Sometimes I wonder if San Angeles is the kind of world people in the family values crowd would like to live in.  In any case, even if you don't like action movies very much, I think you will like this one.
