The positive reviews that "Frozen River" has recieved created high expectations from Indie Film Fans and it doesn't dissapoint mainly becasue Melissa Leo carried the movie.  Her portrayal of Eddy Ray, a working poor mother living in the US-Canadian border in the dead of winter is spot on.  Her life is a struggle, every inch of it, but just when you think she's gonna get beaten down, she kicks back the tears and continues the fight.  The fight to provide a better house for her sons, the fight to get her fair share from a smuggler even if it means pointing a gun  ready to shoot, and the fight for her own dignity.  She shares the struggle with Lilah(Misty Upham),  a Mohawk Indian who has become a pariah in her own community. They are bound by this struggle because of their shared commonality, both are poor women with no husbands(one died tragically and the other walked out) and minial jobs, both are loving mothers and  both have no one to depend on except ultimately each other.  I wouldn't label this movie depressing because these women are strong and don't ask for pity, it's like they're saying "it is what it it, ladies"  This is a movie about working poor women who have very little options and have no luxury of time or choices to make it better. It is also about learning how to trust a complete stranger because deep down inside you know she's a mother just like you and she will do the right thing just like all good mothers do. And lastly, this movie acomplished a lot with so much constraints like the limited budget and limited time to shoot it.  It is rather impress.  Highly recommended.
