How can a movie with such an all-star cast be such a disappointment? Even Kristen Wiig's character was a tragic one, with zero comedy moments. What.

The movie had a couple funny instances, but a lot of "seriously?!" and "Is it over yet" and "I am so embarrassed that I suggested we watch this" moments, so be prepared. It isn't *really* funny, i would hardly classify it as a comedy, or even a romcom. It was misleading and unfortunate. The ending was bizarre. The other reviews pretty much covered it, but basically it's like "What?" and "sweet jesus, PLEASE END BEFORE IT GETS WORSE." The writer also did "Kissing Jessica Stein" and that ending had a similar feeling of "oh. that was kind of a bummer." It sort of seems like this is what happens when women get to be funny (yay!) except they have to operate and corral their humor into a man's world so as not to make the movie un-enjoyable for dudes (boo!). blah. Now it is un-enjoyable for everyone. Wish the writer could just stop writing like she is always worried about what men think.

SO, basically, this movie was a no go for me. Sad.
