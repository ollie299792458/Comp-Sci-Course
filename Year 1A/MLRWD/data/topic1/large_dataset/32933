This year the academy awarded the second silent film for best picture The Artist which was brilliant and deserved it. Wings is the first ever film and silent film to win best picture, I saw Wings a year ago on TCM of course and thought it was okay, great achievement in action sequences of the sky, however never thought it was great enough to win best picture, I would have chosen Sunrise. But now with this brand new restoration of a film that I now accept as worthy of winning best picture, a film that is now my fifth favorite silent film.
This is a must buy for any film lover, Wings was Avatar of its day, and in my opinion is a more accomplished achievement with a great spectacle of film and flight. As for the restoration, many here are suggesting that the film was restored digitally, it wasn't, it was enhanced digitally, but not fully restored digitally. The new tinting and color coding of the flames was restored like how it was when it was first shown, and also for those who love the original organ score? it is optional on this fine DVD, and of course the added in 5.1 sound by Ben Burtt who has done a brilliant job adding in a great quality of sound effects and brings out the best of the action and war sequences, with the new adapted score, tint restore, and sound effects really made me appreciate the film more, and I don't feel cheated, because this film was shown this way when it was first released, except with the organ score. Its an amazing spectacle of a film to get lost in, a great film on war, and flight.
William A. Wellman's brilliant film finally gets its own DVD edition, and a deserved restoration of a film that will take you away to the high sea's of heaven.
