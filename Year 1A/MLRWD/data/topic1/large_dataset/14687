Saw this one as a college student in the early 80'a and fell in love with the crack riding displays and the music. The story is a simple one that is popular in all countries. Unspoiled lad from the country becomes an orphan due to an accident involving a horse. He is quickly made to realize by the mountain men that he will have to toughen up a bit and then come back to make his way. He goes to the low country and starts looking for work . He runs into a crowd surrounding a horse and it's handler and "rescues" the handler from being trampled by the stallion. The handler turns out to be the lil firecracker of a daughter (jessica) to the local rich land baron. The story of how he becomes a noted horse handler derives from his working on the barons lands and falling in love with said firecracker. She is willful beautiful and determined to make her own path as much as he is . Watch this breath taking spectacle of a movie and enjoy some of the best horseback riding and scenery you have ever seen . The actors take back seat to it all but manage to hold their own. Kirk Douglas is in a dual role in this one as the Father and the uncle of Jessica. Watch and judge for yourself. This one is completely clean and suitable for all ages. Side note this was the first soundtrack I ever bought in my life . Loved the rendition of Fur elise but ended up loving the whole cassette.
