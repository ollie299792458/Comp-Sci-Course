If you can get past the fact that it's a musical (which I generally don't like but it seems to work here) and have some patience (it's almost 3 hours long), you will be very entertained by this film. I actually recommend watching it several times because there is really a lot of detail and it's hard to truly absorb everything the movie has to offer upon first view.

My favorites here are William Daniels as John Adams (nevermind his short stature; he turns in a big performance!), Ralston Hill as Congressional Secretary Thomson (his facial expressions at times are a riot), Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson, and of course, Howard Da Silva as Benjamin Franklin, although I am very impressed by all the actors in this film.

For those of you who have the DVD with the restored director's cut, make sure you view the extras. I enjoyed watching the film with the commentary by the director and the screenwriter; you get a lot of interesting information about the actors, the filming of the movie, etc from those guys. Also definitely check out the screen tests, which show about five of the actors who appeared in '1776'. It's fun to see how they rehearsed one of their lines/parts. Daniels is great here, of course, but my favorite is that of James Noble, who plays the Reverend John Witherspoon of New Jersey. In his first try, he stumbles, almost swears with sounds of laughter in the background and someone saying in a shocked voice, "Reverend!" I'm a big fan of his anyway (mainly from his role as Governor Gatling on "Benson"), so I was really happy to see him in '1776'.

Bottom line? Check it out, especially if you're a history lover. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
