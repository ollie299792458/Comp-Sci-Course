Ed Wood is perhaps the most misunderstood and just plain odd films of Tim's career. It is a comedic look at the life of the man who's become oficially known as the Worst Director Ever, Edward D. Wood jr. We follow Ed from the debut of his play "the Casual Company", which although touted for it's realistic costumes (he got them from army surplus, so the story goes) was a horrible bomb. Never being done in by debt, flopish movies or low morale, Ed's love for angora and womens' underwear saw him through many a hard days night. The Casual Company really set the tone for Ed's film career, as he wrote, produced and directed (like some sort of mutated Orson Welles, Ed's idol) several hollywood low-budget bombs. His "big break" comes when he meets an aging and heroin addicted Bela Lugosi who he becomes fast friends with. Through many trials and trbulations, Ed somehow finds a way to get his work finished, even by getting a baptist church to fund a film about grave robbing! Sure it meant having all his friends baptised in a swimming pool, but he -did- get it done. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood to a T, once again transforming himself completly into the role. To watch Depp in Edward Scissorhands, then Ed Wood will really give you a feel for how great an actor he is. Lisa Marie plays the sultry latenight monster movie television show host Vampira, whom Ed pursues to be in his movies for some time before she finally relents (due to her being fired). Martin Landau's protrayal of an aging Lugosi is spellbinding, one of the best of his career. Perhaps it is poetic justice in some way, that Ed Wood is one of Burton's worst grossing films. I'm sure Ed would approve.
