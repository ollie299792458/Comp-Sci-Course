OMG! This could quite possibly be the worst movie I have ever attempted to watch, and I want to emphasize ATTEMPTED; I was unable to finish it. I kept thinking it would get better, give it some time, etc. Boy was I wrong. Corey Feldman's groveling speech impediment and psuedo-tough guy act was God-awful and pathetic. In fact, the movie might have been worth watching without his ridiculous character. My wife began to fast-forward through parts of it just so we could TRY to get to the end (and the movie is only 81 minutes long!). At 72 minutes in we decided to stop for the night and watch the 9 remaining minutes in the morning. But when morning came we couldn't bring ourselves to watch the rest of it because it was so pointless we don't even care how it ended!! So I can't even offer a spoiler alert!!

This movie certainly is an embarrassment to the original Lost Boys- which for those of you who might be wondering, I greatly enjoyed. My advice to everyone: rent the original again and enjoy it. Don't waste your time, like I did, on this dud.
