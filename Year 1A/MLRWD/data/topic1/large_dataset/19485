I have never watched a movie that evoked such emotion in my heart. It is a romantic story that idealizes true love, and how powerful love is.  I understand that the actual life of Veronica Franco herself was not exactly like the movie depicted, however it is a movie filled with romantic truth and beauty. The movie is based on a woman who did great things relative to the time she lived in. I agree that there is nothing glamorous about being a prostitute when it comes to disease, pregnancy, and hardship; however it was the only ticket to freedom for women in a time where men dominated society in every aspect.  If one would like to read about the actual life of Veronica Franco, I would recommend a book titled The Honest Courtesan: Veronica Franco, Citizen and Writer in Sixteenth-Century Venice by Margaret F. Rosenthal.  On another note, the musical score is absolutely beautiful...you will feel good for the rest of the day after watching it. This movie will even melt a macho-man's heart. :) This is my absolute favorite movie, I hope you enjoy it!
