This is the typical story about a young man living in South Philly and with his father, He has a job in the shipyatd where the Father is the Foreman. He has an attitude yet is not a bad guy. By hard work work and a break he gets into the Naval Academy where he is considered an outsider because of his attitude and lack of desire to ask for help, Yes, of course there is a woman, there is always a woman!!!!!!! The Film however is fun. The film does have one shortcoming when he and the company commander do not see eye to eye and the LT always states that he knows what a real officer is and what makes them good! Yet, I don't see that he does. An officer doesn't make it personal and he wouldn;'t allow those who are overweight to stay so. He also doesn't think he is better then every other officer either. Despite this the fiklem is fun, well acted and it was nice to see the personal growth of the cadet and how the uperclasss chief handles her feelings for him and his for her for a year. I have left some out but overall it is a nice romantic, peresonal growth and is realistic in that we do have guys like this in the service alot. I enjoyed it and gave a 5 star
