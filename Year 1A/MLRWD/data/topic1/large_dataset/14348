This has got to be one of the best horror/thriller movies I've seen this decade!

The story is about this family. The mom Kate and her husband john are experiencing a tough time in thier life because thier third child was born stillborn which is revealed at the beginning by a disturbing scene that will make any women shut her legs in pain. To cheer themselves up and fill the void they abdopt Esther whos a 9 year Russion a local orthanage. Thier youngest daughter Max shows sisterly love immediately, but the older and more suspicious Daniel is even less welcoming of Esther. It doesn't take long for s*** to go down. Not since Children of the Corn have I seen such a creepy "kids". Just like older killer kids movie, the siblings learn something ain't right before the adults. Some might find it cliche, but in this movie its done in a way that I never seen before. Esther holds a secret, an extremely dark secret that not even peaple who think they've seen this type of movie won't see coming. Its not just that shes an evil b**** either. I mean something noone will see thier first time watching. When I found out it was no questioning that this would be one of my top ten favorite movies this decade. I did have some problems though. These weren't necessarilly problems with the movie, but more of problems with the characters.

For one I thought the father was stupid. Seriously. He got what he deserved. I also found it a bit overboard how depressed the mother was. I never had kids so some might argue that I don't understand, but it still it seemed insane that she would become an alchoholic and thier marriage is nearly destroyed because she lossed her baby. She has 2 other kids shes neglecting because of it, plus she builds a shrine for the child! I do give her credit though, shes not as dumb as the father was. Other than that I really loved this movie. Its definately a must watch.
