I don't think I can add anything to the reviews already written about this fine movie.  The DVD is lacking in "extras", but it's a treat to have it on DVD nevertheless.  But I'd like to add a little side-note.  A few months ago I found that the character "Dr. Carrington", played by Robert Cornthwaite, in "The Thing" was residing in an Actor's Home in Woodland Hills, CA.  I'd been a fan of his acting in that film, as well as in the TV drama "Picket Fences" where he played a man slowly succumbing to Alzheimers Disease.  So, I mailed him a letter in late 2005  to express my thanks for his work, and he wrote me back a very nice letter in return.  Sadly, just the other day I read an article in the LA Times which listed his death on July 20th, 2006, at age 89, of natural causes.  He'll be missed.  Incidentally, a "spoof" movie of the Sci-Fi/Horror genre starring Cornthwaite, Kenneth Tobey, John Agar, and many others is just being released on DVD titled "The Naked Monster", and it's available here on Amazon.com
