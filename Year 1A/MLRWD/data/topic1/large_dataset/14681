Yes, even after almost 30 years, the Fall Guy still makes me hang to my TV set! I was a fan then and I am still now and not just for the lovely Heather Thomas! Actually, I wish I had a truck just like Colt's, I do own a GMC truck but It doesn't have the suspension kit nor the big tires and roll bar. I have to admit that this truck was part of what made watch this every week back then but the formula was kind of origninal being the story of a hollywood stunman who actually earn revenu during his cinema break working as a bounty hunter. Of course, sometimes you can see it coming...but some other times, you get suprised as how the story turn and end up! The DVD comes in a neat box and work very well, these DVDs gave me the opportunity to watch the pilot episode of the serie which I missed when the show was aired on tV in the 80's. There are of course a few extra on the DVD like interview with Lee Majors and Glen Larson. All in all, I am absolutely satisfied of my purchase and I intend to buy the rest of what is available of that TV show. I also would like to warn potentiel buyer's of the fall guy serie, I myself went for an offer on the net for the complete serie on DVD. The price was $50.00 wich I considered a real deal for so many DVD discs but there was a catch! All of theses DVDs were cheap (and I mean cheap) copies who's quality wasn't even worth the price of the disc they were on!!! So if you are to buy some DVDs of the fall guy, go for the originals wich are of prefect quality and buy them wright here at amazone, the trouble free market place!
