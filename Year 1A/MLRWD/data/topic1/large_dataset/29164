I have never seen so many 5 star matches on one set. The match quality on this set is comparable to Chris Benoit's DVD or Bret Hart's DVD or Samoa Joe's TNA release. Here's what's on it.

AWA Tag Team Title Match: Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose and Doug Sommors

WM X Ladder Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon

WM XII Ironman Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart

No Holds Barred IYH: Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel

IYH Mind Games: Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind

First Hell In A Cell Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker

Comeback Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H from Summerslam 02

Yeah, it's only 7 matches but you also get many extras concerning each match. Even Michaels famous speech where he claimed to have lost his smile is an easter egg. I'll leave it to you to figure out how to unlock it.

A few notes about the matches. The AWA match was one of the first bloody matches in the history of the AWA. The ladder match was Pro Wrestling Illustrated's match of the year as well as being awarded 5 Stars from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer. The ironman match was PWI Match Of The Year beating out the match with Mankind from Mind Games. The match with Diesel was one of the first hardcore matches in WWE history. The HIAC match with Taker got another 5 Star Match rating from Meltzer. Finally his comeback match against Triple H finished in the top three in PWI Match Of The Year voting.

Get it!
