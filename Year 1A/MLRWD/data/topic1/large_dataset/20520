Few films that I have seen recently have generated so much controversy or stimulated so much thought as The Swimming Pool.  Some of my friends loved it, even though they were baffled by it; others were frustrated by what they saw as a bizarre plot that didn't quite hang together.  I appreciated it on a number of different planes - its stunning visual beauty, its mesmerizing cast, and a plot that is a sort of intellectual mystery that the viewer must solve.  You will probably not have solved it until you see the end of the movie; then you will want to go back and watch it all again
Without giving too much away, let me say that at its most fascinating level this film is an allegory of the creative process.  Sarah Morton, brilliantly portrayed by Charlotte Rampling, has come to southern France to conceive and write a book that will be outside the mold of the very popular detective series she has been writing for years and with which she has become desperately weary.  As she experiences France, she writes.  Or is it the other way around?  Perhaps she's in search of characters; or are they in search of her?  Are things really what they seem, and are people really who they're supposed to be?  And would Sarah really step so far outside of character to behave as she does?  Clue: watch the swimming pool.  When it's covered over with the ugly black tarp, Sarah's got writer's block or plot problems; when its waters sparkle azure, all's well with the novel.
As they say in the writing biz, it's all material.  But sometimes you've got to embellish it a bit or make your own.
