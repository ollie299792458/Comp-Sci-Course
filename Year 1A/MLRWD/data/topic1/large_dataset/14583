I was pleasently surprised at how sharp and clear the DVD transfer for Father Goose is.

While not one of Cary Grant's all-time best, he is thoroughly enjoyable acting with Leslie Caron and a group of young schoolgirls in this WWII comedy/adventure. This was one of Grant's last starring roles, and he plays against type as a somewhat grizzled loner who likes his alcohol a little too much. He plays an American thrust into becoming a civilian spotter (watching for aircraft and shipping movements) for the Australian military in a Japanese-occupied area of the south pacific by an officer friend in the Australian navy (Trevor Howard).

Grant's character is asked to transport another spotter from an island where the Japanese have gained a stronghold. This doesn't work out as planned, and there he runs into Caron and her schoolgirl charges who need to get off the island, as well. His only choice is to take them all back to his lookout hut on his own, safer, island, until they can all be rescued by the navy, but the rescue is delayed and Caron and the girls soon take over and turn his life upside-down.

The eventual rescue and ending to the story is satisfying and sweet, and there is nothing in this movie that parents need be concerned about their children seeing (or hearing), although there is a scene where Grant and the girls are fired upon by a Japanese plane, and another where Grant thinks Caron is in danger of dying from a snake bite, but no worries, this is a comedy, after all.
