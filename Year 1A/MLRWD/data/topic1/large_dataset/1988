Apart from the inclement weather, the mood here in my basement is somewhat unnerved and affrighted; the horror movie An American Haunting - Hollywood's version of the true story of Tennessee's own Bell Witch -- is on. It's pretty creepy; I'm really enjoying it for my second time.  I've nearly jumped out of my skin a couple of times already.

It is rather interesting that this haunting became known as "the Bell Witch" when it is actually more of a poltergeist - not the sort of "witch" that was burned at the stake; not a "charmed" one.

Most interestingly, based on a few hours of curiosity-driven research, the accounts of this haunting appear to be true, and this increases the fright factor for me.  An American Haunting is at times quite creepy and atmospheric, which to me is one of the most important attributes, if not THE most important, for quality supernatural horror.

I have a vague recollection of a field trip from elementary school - this would be David Lipscomb Elementary School, sometime in the mid-1970s - when our class traveled from Nashville to rural Adams, Tennessee to see a play based on the Bell Witch haunting.  I can remember being scared. I can also remember becoming obsessed with the Bell Witch account for some time, and in fact a group of us neighborhood BMX bikers came to suspect an old woman who lived down the street, on Dale Avenue, of being a witch; sadly, I believe our suspicion was based solely on the woman's unfortunate appearance.

I would like to have seen more of the modern-day activities of this hard-hitting spirit; nevertheless, I highly recommend An American Haunting to all fans of supernatural horror.
