I just love this film. Hrithik Roshan is so gorgeous I could swoon and Aishwarya Rai is an incredible beauty.  The costumes are brilliant in their color and design.  The scenery and settings are stunning in themselves.  It runs the range from battle scences, political intrigue, and family scheming to a romantic love story complete with music and dancing.  The love story centers on a very serious topic of Jodhaa taking a strong, uncompromising stand for her religious faith, despite pressure for a woman to conform and bringing peace to her region.  He must find the strength to keep his rule and establish peace among a conquered and diverse people.  Love and war, peace and diversity, all too current today.  I love a film that takes me to a different place and time.  I wish I understood Hindi, but am glad that is not dubbed.  I'm never bothered by subtitles.  And while musicals are not my favorite genre, the song & dance is minimal, most of it seeming to occur naturally in a festival setting.  I caught this film first on Netflix streaming, and decided it was one I would like to own because it is quite different from the average American film, & I wanted to make sure I could always have it on hand to watch when I wanted.
