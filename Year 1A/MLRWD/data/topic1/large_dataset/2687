On the first look, Follow that Bird is only a little kids movie, something to occupy a child for a while.  And in the beginning for me, that was probably true.  
I first watched this movie as a little kid.  I rented it on tape from the library.  Every time we'd go back I'd get it. I watched it so many times.  The characters were always lovable (familiar faces like Bert and Ernie, the Count, the Grouch, and all the people from Sesame Street) and I loved singing along to the songs.  
But now at least 10 years later I still find the movie as charming and fun as ever.  I hadn't been to the library in years and as soon as I walked in I went off searching for "that movie with Big Bird in it."
Follow that Bird has a great story.  It follows all the Sesame Street characters as Big Bird gets sent to live with these crazy Dodo birds and then goes on to run away.  His Sesame Street pals and others set off in search of him.  And it all combines to be one great goose, or in this case, Big Bird Chase!
