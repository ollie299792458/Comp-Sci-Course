The start of the premiere episode had me a bit scared I'd spent my money on a dud of a DVD. The feel of the first few minutes is cold and rocky. You know something will happen to this guy and for a long moment I wondered if I would care about the outcome. After this bit of visual prologue, once you get to Moya and her crew, it's all systems go! It's a lush visual enviroment worthy of feature films and this guy named John becomes the only thing you can predict. Sort of! He let's loose some one liners that just crack me up. The episode becomes more than a shoot-em-up space-escapees-on-the-run flick in the last scene with John having to reconnect with the human race by taping a message to his father. 
I, E.T. continues this bend with a great "ode to The Twilight Zone" feel. "One being's salt is another's gold" sort of message. D'Argo and Sun have a great time making fun of humans and human technology. Who saves the day? John, of course. It just takes him a little extra time. Again, charm of the ep is at the end when we leave the planet. "For every discovery there is sadness, too." This brought back the feeling I was left with for many Twilight Zone shows, so this is a wonderful successor for the new millenium.
Lastly, you'll never see D'Argo the same if you watch the "making of" piece included on the DVD. So do save it for a rainy day when you want to be surprised by how fantastic the FarScape character lead actors are.
