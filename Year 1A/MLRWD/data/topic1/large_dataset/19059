This is one of two Steven Seagal movies, from around the same time, that I missed seeing when they first came out, I don't know if there were too many Seagal movies to keep track of at the time, or did they just all sound so familar that I thought I had seen them. Also, at this time Steve was making some of the worst crap of his once glorious career, so I wasn't always first in line to see his new flick, in fact I was becomming somewhat embarressed by the great one, and didn't want to see him in such failures. Well, no mater what the cause, six years later I got a hold of Out of Reach, slaped in the DVD and prepared for the worst. Luckily, it's not his worst, nor anything even close to being good, but as the saying might go, it's not half bad, well actually, a little more than half bad.

Seagal stars as a, well I'm not sure, we'll call him a mystery man. He lives in the forest, loves the wildlife, and correspondes with a 13 year-old ploish orphan girl. When she turns 14, she will be carted away from the orphanage, in the care of human traffickers, Seagal gets wind of this, though I'm not sure how, and hops the next plane out. Once in Poland, he must crack skulls, bust limbs, make friends with an orphan pickpocket boy, hook up with a hot Polish policewoman, and duel to the death (with swords) with the bad guy. All in ninety minutes work for Seagal.

The action is plentiful enough to keep the movie exiting and the viewer watching. The final battle with villian Matt Schulze, this is the swordfight, is actually fairly awesome. For Seagal die hards, but not necessarily anyone else. It should be noted that this is the first of Seagal's films where a large share of his dialogue has been dubbed by another actor, I don't know if it's just that nobody can due an impression of Seagal, or Sony Home Entertainment just didn't give a flying monkey pooh about it, but these "actors" never sound even remotley like Steve.
