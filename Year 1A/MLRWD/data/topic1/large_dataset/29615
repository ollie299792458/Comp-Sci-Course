I juuuust made the age to review stuff on amazon, so I guess I shouldn't have watched this movie. Well, look at the big picture of the cover, and look at the look on Kathy Thorn's (the lady's) face! You see the exact same look on her face as on the science fiction movies that only air at two a.m. because they figure no one's watching anyway. Damien's King Kong, and Mrs. Thorn is the lady who sits on top of the building screaming help, help, help. We heard you the first fricken time! It's a classic and all, and honestly it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't scary. It was a lot scarier than blair witch, but that really isn't saying much. My dad rented this movie because I sat through the blair witch project when I was home alone and no one was there to screen the unnecassarily large amount of profanity for me, so he figured he'd show me the scariest movie he ever saw to scare me into never watching horror again. I was laughing once the first half hour was over. It is not that scary at all. "Today's children are very jaded! This movie scared me when I was nineteen!" he said when it was over. True, but still. If I were my age in the seventies, I can't deny that this movie would scare the crap out of me. But today it just isn't scary anymore. It was as gruesome as some of today's movies, guy gets his head chopped off, lady hangs herself, someone gets stabbed in the neck, etc. but it still wasn't enough to make the movie truely frightening. If you aren't watching this movie for a scare though, midnight movie.
