I came to this party late, considering it had been off the air for about 8 years, but I can honestly say that I have never in all my years of watching T.V. and believe me, there have been plenty of years, enjoyed a show as much as Coupling.  The first three seasons were outstanding and I will admit, I did enjoy the fourth season, however, it was no where near the first three seasons.  The six main players fit together so well that is was almost like having your family together at Thanksgiving or Christmas.  The loss of Jeff and the decision to make Susan pregnant was, in my mind a fatal mistake.  When this type of show moves away from the original premise of single men and women having a good time and seek to make the show about a more serious relationship, then what follows is doom.  Did I like the show?  Enough to say that I have watched the first three seasons about 3 or 4 times.  I just recently got the fourth season from Amazon and finished it a few minutes ago.  I am sad that was the end, but am sadder that it was such a let-down, but over-all this is still the best show I have seen on T.V.
