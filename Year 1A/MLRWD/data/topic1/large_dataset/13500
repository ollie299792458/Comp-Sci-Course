This film is based on a true story but as Koreeda himself states at the film's outset, all the details of the film are entirely fictional as what actually happened was far bleaker than what is shown in the film. What actually happnened was that mother left one baby dead in the closet while leaving the other four on their own to take care of themselves. One of the kids that the eldest son brought into their apartment killed one of the other three infants, whose body was then abandoned in the woods. Afther the whole picutre of the incident unravelled, there followed lengthy debates in many quarters on how children born out of wedlock should be recognized and protected by society.

  Compared to the utter gruesomeness of the event, the film, tragic though it may be in its own way, offers us viewers a glimmer of hope and is emotionally far more acceptable. All those child actors play wonderfully well with all the subtlty and fineness one can ask for. Piano, baseball, airplane and plants in noodle containers all work as metaphors of freedom that the children long for. This film is truly the one for the ages, and I have no hesitation whatsoever to call this a modern-day masterpiece.
