Cujo (1983) was definately a triumph.  The story of a rabies-infected dog is gripping.  It was sad that Cujo became vicious as he was such a loveable dog transformed by something out of his control.  Te characters are very human.  Dee Wallace plays Donna, the woman trapped in her car by Cujo.  She gives an amazing performance as a woman fighting to survuve and get her son Tad (Danny Pintauro) to safety.  Pintauro is believable as a boy who is frightened out of his mind and soon is stricken by heat exhaustion and hunger/thirst.  Daniel Hugh Kelly is great as Vic, Donna's husband, who is called away when his ad line for a cereal brand is taken off the shelves after a health scare.  The subplot of Donna having an affair makes the characters seem even more like real people.  The last half hour is white-knuckle intense.  The director adds some unique camera angles and builds the characters and suspense.  Plus the ending is more upbeat than the novel, which works better for the movie.  Cujo is a great film.
