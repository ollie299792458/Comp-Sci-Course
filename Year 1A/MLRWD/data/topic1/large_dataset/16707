There were many times where I felt left out of a joke because, while I knew the source material, I did not know the context of "Squeal like a pig" or the sound of "Dueling Banjos".  I finally sat down one Sunday afternoon with a copy of Deliverance just so I wouldn't feel so left out.
While I now understand all the little marks this film left on pop culture, it also brought on two unexpected reactions from me.  #1)No matter how well you think you know yourself, you will only know your "true" self when put in unfamiliar situations.  Sure, it is easy to say "Well, I would react this way if that happened!", truth is you don't know sqaut until someone puts you to the actual test.
#2)What happened to films like this?  This movie, and most movies of the pre-1980's, were willing to spend time engrossing you.  Let the camera linger for that extra second, let the visual truly sink in.  Let the characters have a discussion about mundane, every day life....it let's you crawl into their head a little bit more, and makes the situations they are put into seem all that more real, and in this case, startling to you.  Take any of today's movies like "Matrix" or "Swordfish" that rely so heavily on their pretty special effects, I felt no connection to the characters, no concern when something happens to them.  Give me a movie like Deliverance, or any of it's other pre-1980's ilk, and I will be a happy camper!
