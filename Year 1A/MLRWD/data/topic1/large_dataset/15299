Dear Dark Shadows Fans,

We recommend buying the Deluxe Edition. I do believe Amazon might have sold out of the Limited Edition despite it still being available for pre-order.

DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND:
We are releasing a second print of Dark Shadows coffins (also known as The Deluxe Edition). It is virtually the same as the Limited Edition (releasing on April 10th) however that version was limited in quantity and was offered early to fans. This Deluxe Edition coffin (the one you see on this product page) does NOT include a serial # nor does it include a Jonathan Frid signed postcard. If you missed out on that, I am sorry but they were very limited in quantity.

The good news is, you can still get your hands on this amazing coffin collection. We did try to price it as reasonable as possible as no expense was spared in building this set.

In summary:
Limited Edition = April 10th = includes autograph and serial #
Deluxe Edition = July 10th = No autograph and no serial #

Enjoy!!!

Sincerely,
MPI Home Video
