I had wanted to see this one since I saw a trailer in the theater, and it looked like it had a good cast with a decent stroyline.  It was pretty clear from the trailers that the President was getting shot and different people saw it in different ways.

And that is exactly what happens.  I thought it was pretty well done as each person's point of view rewinds events back to the time of the attack, and then branches off to their repsective perspectives.  And each flashback adds a little bit and piece to what happened and I found myself trying to tie each person and parts together.  Each piece added to the question of who was the good guy or gal, and who was the bad one.

It comes together towards the end with a rather traditional chase scene (which was also hinted at throughout the movie in the flashbacks.)  At the end everything gets resolved a bit neatly in terms of who gets what, and there were a couple of things that were a little annoying in that they did not make sense from what was shown of the charactors.  In other words some things bad guys would have done they did not do (do not want to play spolier though.)

But the small parts were not too objectionable in light of the fact that this is a general thriller and usually there will be one or two things that miss the mark.

There are other thrillers that are better, and some other movies portray the switching persepctive/stories better.  But if you just want to watch a general thriller that has a couple of warts, this one is good.  If you are a bit picky about thrillers and some logical inconsistencies will be something that detracts, you may not like it as much as I did.
