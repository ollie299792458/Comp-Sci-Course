With the current lacklustre season of the X-Files (largely sans Mulder) screening here in Australia, it is good to know we can return to the glory days of the X-Files on DVD. I agree with the previous reviews in that this was the best season of the X-Files, prior to it being all consumed with the "mythology" episodes and sheer stupdity at times. On average, season 3 had a good balance between these types of episodes and the one-off 'monster of the week' episodes (which are much more fun if you ask me). By the time this season was playing here in Australia, The X Files had reached the mega-hype level, and deservedly so. It is a shame that the X-Files has almost become a mockery of the great show that this set clearly proves it once was.  It was for sets such as this that I first bought a DVD player - now I can watch my fave episodes as many times as I like. Highlights from this season include: The Blessing Way, Paper Clip, Piper Maru, Apocrypha, Jose Chung's "From Outer Space", Talitha Cumi.  This DVD set also has the distinct advantage of providing an audio commentary (presumably from Chris Carter), which the previous sets have not done. All in all, Season 3 on DVD looks like a must buy for both fans and those with a passing interest in the series.
