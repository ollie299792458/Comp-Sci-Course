This movie follows the essential plot of Arthur Golden's novel, but is not a stand alone movie. Audiences that have not read the book find themselves confused about the ending and missing small but enriching details about the story. The attention to the importance of kimono design, for example, is completely absent from the movie. It is details like this that help to bring the story to life, adding an anthropological level to the basic romance. This could have been easily achieved without lengthening the already dragging 140 min film. The visuals in the movie are spectacular at times, but focused on the wrong things.
The story is well represented, especially the struggle of a young girl, as she risks everything to have a miasma of control over her life. The main story is easy to follow, as her symbol of freedom is easy to identify. The narrator waxes poetic at the end, which leads to confusion about her situation as geisha and not wife. More attention to the life of a geisha throughout the movie would have allowed for the well-spoken lines at the end. Unfortunately, without this background, the closing is confusing.
Overall this is an enjoyable and worthwhile movie. Not the cinematic genius the book could have become, but visually and mentally pleasing.
