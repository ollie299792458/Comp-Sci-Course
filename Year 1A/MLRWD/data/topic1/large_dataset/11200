As fans of the Stieg Larsson novels, my wife and I tremendously enjoyed the movie versions of all three novels in Blu-ray.  While winter conditions prevaled on the outside, we spent a weekend snuggled up with a blazing fire in the wood stove and a few bottles of red wine engrossed in the story and characters created by Stieg Larsson.  While I am not a great fan of sub-titled or dubbed movies, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We even watched the second movie with sub-titles (even though it was dubbed, as is the third movie)not wanting to break the spell these movies cast over us. The characters of Eisbeth Salander and Mikeal Blomkvist protrayed on screen are the characters as I imagined reading the novels. Noomi Rapace really brings Lisbeth to life with an intriguing and brilliant performance. The DVD package also includes a Bonus Disc of behind-the-scenes footage and the personal history of the author Stieg Larsson.

While the movies were great and added to the excitement and enjoyment of reading the novels, I must tell you that to get the "full experience" you just have to read the novels.  If you don't read the novels, you will surely miss alot of the intrigue, sub-plots and characters that will create the anticipation of wanting to see the movies.
