I've purchased a lot of belly dance instructional videos, and this is by far the best.  It may not be encyclopedic but it's pretty darn thorough I think this is the place to start.  There is a section on techniques that is VERY clear and in depth, and I recommend going through it little by little until each element is mastered comfortably.  Then you can do the practice flows and choreography, which show you how to merge these elements together.

Autumn Ward has a beautiful, balletic flow to her movements and she teaches specifically how to achieve this.  In fact the arm sections are essentially ballet ports-de-bras as I was taught them, with some character styling added in.

Don't try to use this video as a workout, or to build strength.  I'm enjoying Rachel Brice's videos for that.  This is more about how to put together the ability to actually dance.  I'm finding my own style by experimenting with each motion until it feels like "me".

Buy this first!  I can't say enough good about it.

For those who would like to develop the grace, balance, and isometric flow in their movements I highly recommend Finis Jhung's ballet instruction videos <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJRY7E">The Finis Jhung Ballet Technique Level 1: Barrework for Beginners</a>.  They would be an excellent accompaniment.
