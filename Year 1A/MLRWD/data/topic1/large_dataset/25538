The Station Agent is not a seriously involved movie that will leave you at the edge of your seat.  It is not your typical Hollywood slam bam and gratituitous violence and sex.  It is rather a simple excursion to our fears, our human conditions, our grasping for acceptance, our attempts at emotional stability, our belief in what's fundamentally proper, and most importantly, its an illusion of life brought to film by such talented actors.  Dinkladge and Clarkson gave remarkable performances in such a low-key movie, probably no one has ever heard of.  The movie paces itself in a slow monotonous, if somewhat unbelievably naive, manner.  The ending itself was somewhat trite and abruptly non-alarming, but in the end, we all understand what great pleasure it was to actually experience an hour and a half minutes of all these emotional rollercoaster rolled up into a heartfelt dramatic performance.

To call this movie boring would be one thing.  To call this movie a call to our heart strings would be more appropriate.  Try it and experience it yourself.  A truly amazing movie without all the pretentiousness and high-budget expectations.
