The movie starts off with a neat story about the local rich old lady who plays the town "Tooth Fairy" and much like Freddie K. in Nightmare On Elm Street things go bad for her when two brats end up missing.
Who else would you blame but the sweet old woman who gives gold to the children when they loose a tooth.
Now to when the main character  Kyle (Chaney Kley) as a child looses his last tooth and maybe his innocence if he could make it to the school dance, but oh no he has to wake up and look at the Tooth Fairy, now he will pay for seeing that which should not be seen. Kyle must spend his life in the light to keep the vengeful spirit of the Tooth Fairy from killing him.
This is a cool idea and I think this could be done, night job and sleep in a windowed room during the day. Kyle is never with out his pile of flash lights and soon has to help his child hood crush and her little brother who is about to get his for looking at the ol "Tooth Fairy".
The evil Tooth Fairy spirit looks creepy and scary in some parts and just lame in others.
I swear that I saw Stan Winston worked on the FX on this film and when the Tooth Fairy looses her china mask she is one scary looking old hag.
This film is worth a look but you will be yelling at the screen "STAY IN THE LIGHT DUMMY".
