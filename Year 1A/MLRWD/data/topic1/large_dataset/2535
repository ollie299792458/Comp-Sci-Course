I don't believe that Ed Wood deserves to be called the worst directer is history. He certainly made so bad their good films. But,I believe he just didn't have the money to make grade A films. He took what he could get his hands on and made movies. Simple as that. Some are bad and some or the weirdest things you will ever watch. I put Glen or Glenda in this category.

This is a great place to start with your Ed Wood collection. This collection includes his most famous bad movie, "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Bela Lugosi is in 3 of the films in this set. Some say Ed Wood used Lugosi but i think they had a real friendship. I think they worst movie on this set is "Night of the Ghouls".

The picture quality of these films are top notch. All the films are in Dolby Digital Mono. Although, The Haunted World of Ed Wood is presented in 2.0 Stereo.

Anyway, if you ever wondering where to start with Ed Wood then buy this. You will not be disappointing.

Great set. Especially for B movie lovers.
