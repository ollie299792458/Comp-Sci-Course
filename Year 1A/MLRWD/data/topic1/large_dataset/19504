I've been a Cure fan for many, many years, and I have to say that this is one DVD that is sitting in my Cure collection that is so bad, I keep meaning to Ebay it.

The quality of this show is worse that what the average film student could make.  In fact it looks like a student has been handed a camera for the fist time with build in 'strobe' and 'tracer' effects and it playing a game of "what does that button do?", then gets obsessed with the newfound ability to hit 'tracer' over and over at various points in the songs for 'creative effect' because said student has never had this technology before.

Badly shot, badly edited, with inserts of 'fan footage' shot on mobile phones from the front of the audience.  C'mon Robert, you can afford to not have to rely on free archive from fan's mobile phones!

To be honest, I can't remember if the actual performance of The Cure was any good in this show, because the quality of the filming was unwatchable, and that is the only thing that has stuck in my head about it.

Nil poi!
