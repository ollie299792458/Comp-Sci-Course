I know the opinions about season 2 will be more mixed than season 1, but I personally believe that season 2 is just as exciting as 1.  The only difference is that there's a change of scenery and a focus on some different characters.  But I still find Prison Break to be one of the best shows on tv right now and just as compelling and heart-pounding as ever!  Prison Break still manages to be intriguing, simple enough to follow, with great characters people really care about.  In particular, Paul Adelstein (who plays Agent Kellerman) does a really fabulous job this season, whereas last season he was more of a minor character.  And unlike Lost, this show actually manages to answer questions and move the plot along.  This season has also held steady in the ratings unlike some other shows, which must mean that it's doing something right.  As always, the biggest weakness is that it's as ludicrous as it was first season, but this is fiction.  If I wanted reality, I'd watch a documentary.  And I don't think it's really any more unrealistic than any other action drama on tv today.  I give this season 5 stars and can't wait to see what the writers will cook up for season 3.
