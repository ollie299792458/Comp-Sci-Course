Pierce Brosnan delivers a typically smooth and sexy performance in the Thomas Crown Affair.  Comfortably in character, he plays a bored tycoon whose million dollar business deals no longer give him an adrenaline rush.  He turns to another passion - art collecting, from the Metropolitan Museum  of Art, no less.  The theft scene has a fast-paced, Bond-like theme closing  with Crown's smug satisfaction as he toasts his latest Impressionist  acquisition.  Nevertheless, he gets more than he bargained for in the shape  and form of Rene Russo who plays the equally sharp and cool international  agent hired by the insurance company to retrieve the million dollar  painting.  She zeroes in on Crown immediately and with pure sex appeal and  feminine grace, she "gets her man."  Both enjoy playing the  delicious cat and mouse games, each only briefly enjoying a moment of power  before it's regained by the other.  
It's a sheer delight watching the  hot chemistry between Brosnan and Russo.  There's a steamy rhythmic dance  sequence including the famous see-through dress, plenty of sparkling  repartee, and a Caribbean island romp guaranteed to amuse even slightly the  most jaded viewer.  Denis Leary is the tender-hearted detective with the  tough-guy exterior and Faye Dunaway is amusing as Crown's psychiatrist who  is more interested in tormenting her client than in providing any sort of  therapy.  It's a fun couple of hours in the world of art, money, and the  rich and powerful.
