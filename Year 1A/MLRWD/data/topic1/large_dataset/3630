When The Leopard arrived in our midst, in 1963, I was in my final year of high school. Fortunately, it arrived in the summer, as I and my friends went to the afternoon performance each of the six days it spent in our little, provincial town. One of those friends was studying cinematography, another later became a concert pianist, one was intent upon becoming a writer, and we were all considered ourselves critics of Italian film as only an 18-year-old could be in those dear, dead days when Visconti set the standard for the globe in beauty and creativity. Our unalterable opinion then, as now, is that The Leopard was, and remains, the most beautiful film ever made. Sadly, that conclusion is based predominately on memory.
It has been enormously frustrating to try to view the film during the past 40 years, as it, unlike Visconti's other magnificent efforts, has been singularly unavailable. I have been chiding everyone who would listen to create a DVD of this film, and now it has been done. I profoundly hope mine is one of the earliest orders in, as I have an incredible desire not only to see this wonderful film again, but to own a copy which I can enjoy at my leisure.
Salutations to all who have participated in this effort!
