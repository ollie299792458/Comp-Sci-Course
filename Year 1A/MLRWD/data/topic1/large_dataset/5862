... It's a charming story, but I guess all the nudity and face-eating kisses we are bombarded with these days must have numbed you to some good old fashioned storytelling that does not need sex and drugs to be interesting.  When looked at from that standpoint, this film has LOADS of substance ...  Could the point of it also be that none of us is perfect but all are capable of achieving Heaven onetheless?
Second, judging something from the past - whether it is a movie or history - must be judged on the face of its merit as it was when it originally occurred.  Judging today's behavior against standard decorum from the past is completely stupid.
Third, it is a very clever movie.  There are several moments throughout the movie that are downright funny.  For example, consider the woman who wound up in the ultra-hot environs while Don Ameche's character is there.  A true comedic classic.
If you're still unsure, rent it.  If your video store does not carry it, buy it (from Amazon!)  It's THAT GOOD!
