I am a usually a stickler for the correct aspect ratio and non-colorized versions of films (their original intent). In this case, many post-1953 films, other than Scope films, were filmed 35mm film which has 1:37 to 1 dimensions, with a "soft" matte so they could be cropped anywhere from 1:66 through 2:1 in theatres. When shown on television, they could look like there's a lot of headroom in the cinematography, so the composition isn't quite right, although you see the whole full-frame picture. Legend films has provided the latter here, but crops nicely on my widescreen television, maintaining the original aspect. But the clincher here is both B&W and Colorized versions are included on this disc. To my surprise, in contrast with the 1980s faded and phony colorized releases, the color looks fantastic here, muted and striking to look at. Even the colorized trailer, while keeping the audio soundtrack, replaces the dull talking head scenes, with more shock scenes from the movie, an actual improvemnt! The Menu design is also great fun. So watch it in Color, and enjoy the memorable performances of leads smarmy Vincent Price and statuesque Carol Ohmart (Miss Utah 1946, 4th runner-up Miss America), a multitude of entertaining quotes ("Do you remember the fun we had when you poisoned me"), and one jump-out-of seat scene in a cellar. "Hurry, or you'll be late for your own funeral."
