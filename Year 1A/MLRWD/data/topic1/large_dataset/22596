I've been wanting to buy some B and B DVDs, including the motion picture as well as episodes, for some time now.

Apparently, the new Mike Judge Edition DVD coming out soon will be pretty good, and will give me much I'm what I'm after.  Many episodes in their entirety, uninterrupted by commercials and with DVD sound and picture.  great.  Some additional features sounds cool also.

I will get it.  Can't wait.

But as for the movie, what's the deal there?  There are NO EXTRAS whatsoever on the DVD...at least the one I rented from the video store.

Seems that Mike Judge could make a killing, and a VERY FUNNY DVD, by re-releasing "Beavis and Butthead Do America" with featurettes and extras.  It was a GREAT movie and should be in the DVD collection of all movie/comedy lovers.

I've been imagining and writing scenes of B and B doing a voice-over commentary of the film in my head.  This seems absolutely tailor made for them since that was one of the mainstays of the original show...ie..them sitting jabbering on about something they're watching on TV.

Hilarious possibilities with even just a B and B commentary.....and a second commentary by Mike Judge in semi-serious mode would be awesome as well.

Also, how about some featurettes....... behind the scenes....a blunder reel......the action sequences..."how they were pulled off"..the stunt doubles who worked on the film.....interviews with the "actors" etc...

I'd buy that edition in a nanosecond.  As it is, I'll just watch the old tape when I get the itch....and hope that the new Box set of the show will turn out well.
