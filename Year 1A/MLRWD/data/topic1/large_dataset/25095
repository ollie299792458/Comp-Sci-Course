Romero's Day of the Dead is still the best of the pack, in my opinion. It has bad acting, bad dialogue, and overly obvious subtext...but it just works so well when viewed holistically.

The movie opens up with a scouting mission by helicopter. The team drops in to an area, calls out for any survivors using a bullhorn, then skedaddles when the dead start showing up in hordes. It's clear at this point that things aren't looking good for humanity. The apocalyptic world is in full swing and our band of heroes is severely outnumbered.

As the movie progresses, we learn that:

1) Military personnel and scientists are not very well suited to extended stays underground together.
2) Dr. Logan is a freak with a crackpot theory concerning the domestication of zombies.
3) It's not good to be the only woman in a subterranean complex filled with testosterone trolls.
4) If you're ever caught in a zombie crisis and someone starts acting insane, they probably are...so don't waste any time trying to figure out what to do - either lock them up somewhere tight, or shoot them and save yourself a lot of BS down the road.

There are some excellent effects in this one, care of Tom Savini. His mastery of blood and guts is plainly apparent, especially in the scenes of Pvt. Rickles and Capt. Rhodes checking out. Oh, and don't miss Pvt. Steel's incredible two-hit combo on one rowdy zombie - kick to the mug and bullet to the forehead...does it every time! Not to mention the famous "shovelmouth" scene...who knew the sodden old flask-tipper had such moxie in him?

If only they made 'em this good today...
