WARNING!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!
  This movie is stupid. John must have needed the money when he did this. I like Leguizamo in movies, but who wrote this crap? It was interesting and believable at first until his girlfriend(waterston) started a escort service with her high-school friends. Like that would happen in real life USA. Except for the husbands paying 18 YO girls for sex I would definitely believe that. The acting is fine though by all the actors. Then the story degenerates into outrageousness. Like when the teen madame gets her johns to assault and batter the teenage brother of one of her escorts. In reality, the johns would be afraid of getting caught by their wives, the teen escort's parents, and finally the police. In the end of the movie the teen madame and her girlfriends try to murder one of her former teen escorts, for escorting on the side without paying the teenage madame her cut, while her client johns beat up the john, the rogue escort was servicing. Whom the madame later finds out to be her own father who is cheating on her mother.
  What a joke. Whoever wrote this s@%t must have a negative view of escorts and cheating husbands. The writer needs to read about why husbands commit infidelity. It's not simplified by saying that they are creeps. Even infidelous husbands have a valid reason whether its sex addiction, a deteriorating marriage, which shouldn't of have happened in the first place, etc.
 Avoid this movie and see Empire, Wild Things 3, the Take, Paraiso Travel, Zigzag, Carlito's way, Casualties of war instead.
