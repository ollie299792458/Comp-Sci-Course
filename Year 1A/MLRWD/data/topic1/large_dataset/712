I've read many of the reviews of this film - not all, but many. No one has yet to state that their reaction to the film was remotely simlilar to mine. That being- I laughed uproariously. My mother, age 55, saw several of my favorite moments of the film and cackled wildly.
During the first 40-50 minutes of the film I was confounded at why the New York Times review on the back side of the case called the film "darkly comic". I thought it was beautifully bland in an utmost pretentious kind of way, but continued viewing because I figured at 2 hours and 38 minutes it could not remain at that pace for the entirety- at least I hoped not.
Through Paul Dano's flamboyant, high-pitched squeals of healing, to Daniel-Day Lewis' subtle nods of contempt and climactic "milkshake" euphemism, I saw the film as a geniously constructed piece of dark comedy. It was so genious to me because it was not played as a dark comedy; it was played as seriously and straightforward, and with as much time and craft as the best pieces of a Shakespearean drama. I saw it as playing the absurd as if it were the heaviest material. It cannot be escaped that Plainview's eccentric, outlandish behavior is over-the-top and completely unrealistic. I believe that at it's heart- it's a SCHTICK, a caricature, and it isn't supposed to be dramatic.
There are no jokes in the film; I'm sure the script reads completely straight. It's the nuances of the performances that make it fantastic.

Whatever the rest of this film's viewers believe- I have recommended this film as the holy grail of dark comedies, or simply recommended to those who believe their sense of humor is more than a tad off-kilter.
