I haven't actually bought Bonanza Season 2 Volume 1 yet and it does not look like I will. I insist on excellent picture quality before buying a DVD and I always research the professional reviews on the Internet before buying. Most of the reviewers on Amazon who comment on how good the picture quality is on a DVD are well meaning but still amateur reviewers who don't know what a good video picture really looks like. In 10 minutes of researching I've already found 2 professional web sites (Home Theater Forum and DVD Talk) who say the picture quality on Season 2 Volume 1 isn't near as good as the Season 1 sets. As time goes by, more negative reviews will probably come in from other sites.

I own both the Season 1 sets of Bonanza and the picture quality was excellent. I'm sorry to hear that Season 2 does not appear to measure up. We shouldn't be surprised. Unfortunately, Bonanza is owned by CBS/Paramount, one of the most inconsistent video companies in the world. They have a long history of screwing up their vintage TV releases, from changing the music on The Fugitive to cutting out Jim Nabors's songs in Gomer Pyle. Thank God the CBS/Paramount dimwits at least had the brains to farm out the video production of the recent Blu Ray Twilight Zone TV releases to Image Entertainment who did a spectacular job. To bad Image didn't get the Bonanza contract.

I don't post a negative review to hurt the feelings of the Bonanza fans on Amazon. I'm a big Bonanza fan myself and want to see this classic TV show done right. But, all concerned fans have only one weapon to use against careless video companies like CBS; hit them in their pocketbook. If nobody complains, they will keep turning out mediocre DVD releases. If I can keep a few people from buying this new Bonanza release with my negative review and some other reviewers join me, maybe we can get CBS's attention. I doubt we can, but we still have to try.
