The remake/lose sequal to the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers moves us out of the small suburban community of Santa Mira and into the metropolis of San Fransisco.  Transparent alien spores enter the atmosphere above the city and fall to the ground during a light rain.  Attaching to plants, the begin growing like parasites and sprout colorful and quite harmless looking flowers.  Elizibeth Driscoll happens to pick one of them and bring it into her boyfriends house with her.  After setting it on the nightstand next to the sleeping Jeffrey, she goes to bed.  When she awakens the next morning, Jeffrey isn't quite what he used to be.  And so it begins.  The movie moves slowly and builds up considerable suspense and tension by the time you reach the ending.  Many of the characters retain the same titles given to them in the Jack Finney book and the original film, but the story itself is as much a sequal as a remake.  The film stays true to the basic subject matter but twists various events present in the first film into events that have just as much if not greater effect then they had in the original.  As the film progresses, the characters become slowly aware of the changes in others around them, and paranoia begins to take over.  This film frightened me; it really did.  It's extremely well made, with the photography and the soundtrack all adding to the effect.  It's a wonderful picture, one that I recommend to anyone.  The DVD presentation is okay at best sadly, a remastering of the film would be nice after all these years.  Darker scenes show pixelation every once and a while, and the film isn't as clear in some places as one would hope it would be.  But these are minor problems at the most, and none of them detract from the effect of the film.  Highly recommended.
