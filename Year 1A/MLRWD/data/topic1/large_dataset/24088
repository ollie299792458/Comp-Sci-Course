Penelope has finally found its opening weekend and my review is as simple as this: Go SEE it in the theatre because it is a rare, wonderful, sharply comedic and quick-moving film. Support a movie in a theatre that uses great set designs which includes art by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974803200">Joe Sorren: In Celebration of Balance & Opposable Thumbs</a> and includes music by Sigur R&oacute;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AJJNPY">Takk...</a>. Chase scenes are not predictable. Penelope covers, in a few comical moments, what else would a person do who was confined to one house their entire life? I enjoyed the "who's real" and "who's fake" process of elimination and how one copes when you only find the latter. The characters are well-crafted and played by some of my favorite people, obviously Christina Ricci, but also minor characters played by Burn Gorman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWE5OY">Torchwood - The Complete First Season</a>), Nick Frost (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMWA">Hot Fuzz (3-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a>), and the ever-watchable (getting all the laughs when I saw the movie) Peter Dinklage which you've seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTWDI">The Station Agent</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011KQSZ4">Death at a Funeral</a>, plus Marianne Faithfull is in it (uncredited) and she really is as great looking as I remember her from the brief appearance she made in BBC's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UNYPGM">Absolutely Fabulous - Absolutely Everything</a>. The story's moral is powerful: embrace individuality. It's as simple as that and I would love a poster of this phrase on every street corner to remind those people that forget to do it.
