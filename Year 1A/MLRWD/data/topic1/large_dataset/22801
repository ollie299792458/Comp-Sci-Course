Just got back from a sneak preview of this and I LOVED it.

If you liked American Pie and it's first sequels (and their raunch level), you will really enjoy this great return from the original cast.

The Class of 1999 gets together for their 13th year reunion (really? 13th? well, that's not going to spoil the rest of the movie) and we get to catch up with what life after high school is like for everyone.  For the most part, everyone's personalities are the same, and the writers and actors did a great job of projecting those characters into adulthood.  Although projecting an older Stifler still doesn't seem like "adulthood..."

I don't want to give away any of the jokes, but this was a really funny movie.... funnier than I expected, to be honest.  And not only will the audience be consistently laughing out loud, but viewers will also feel an unexpected nostalgia in watching.

As I said, I did expect it to be funny, but this movie is MUCH better than I expected.

As with other crude comedies, this will probably play slightly better in the theaters, because of audience reactions, but this is a wonderful return from the cast, and is very well written and directed.

Go see this movie!
