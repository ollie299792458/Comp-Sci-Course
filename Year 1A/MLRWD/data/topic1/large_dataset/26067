Looks like McNamara won again with his anti-war doc. film.  The insight and proggressive beliefs that the Weather Underground stayed true to act as a legitamite foundation for the liberated America we live in.  If you are enticed by politics but are sick of corruption in America check out this film about a group derived from the SDS that took its war with the government to an extreme that had to be recognized.  I never knew they busted Timmothy Leary out of jail and attacked symbols of American injustice without using murder (the tool those in power use to stress their point) don't think you've seen a film like this before, it left me energized with a tendency toward learning about political struggles of today! Who'd think a gen-Xer could look at a film about revolutionairy soldiers of the past and wonder what he could do today to maintain the liberation sparked by students from the 60's.  A must have for any leftist, documentary fan, or anyone interested about the origins and movements of the "New Left"
