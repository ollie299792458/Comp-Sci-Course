If you dislike the teen genre, because of its over-idealistic portraits of school life and growing up, littered with assorted stereotypes, then this is the film for you. I've seen a number of de Palma's films, and while I  applaud his visual and technical skills, his " homages " to  Alfred Hitchcock, who as far as I'm concerned is the best director the  industry has produced, can be infuriating. The film has an auspicious  opening, what with the vast number of naked teenagers. I can't help but  feel this was exploitative. The scene where Carrie has her period in the  shower is painful for the viewer to watch ( did anyone see the shower head  as a phallic symbol ? ). Sissy Spacek is wonderful as thye troubled teen,  embarassed and repelled by her awakening sexuality. This is no wonder  considering her mother's religious obsessions. It's probably good that  Carrie does not have a happy ending, otherwise what would distinguish it  from other teen flicks? The music was very reminiscent of Bernard Herrman,  especially during the scene where Piper Laurie stabs Carrie ( very Psycho  ). It would be harsh to say that Carrie is a Hitchcock rip-off, because it  works very well on it's own merits. The sequel will hopefully be terrible,  because it sounds a bad idea. The most impressive thing though is the  film's ability to shock. I'd read about the famous ending, the hand  emerging from the grave, and it still scared the hell out of me. All in  all, very good. A shame Mr de Palma's career has taken the commercial and  mainstream path in recent years however. Hopefully he'll learn from Mission  to Mars and especially Bonfire of the Vanities, that he isn't a commercial  director. Instead he is a very controversial, dynamic, and provocative  indie helmer. I hope he re-thinks his carrer pattern.
