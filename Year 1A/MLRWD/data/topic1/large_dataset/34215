Do not waste your time. So utterly disappointing and ridiculous. Not funny enough or sinister enough to be black comedy...it piles the gore so thick that it is just dumb--not campy enough to make it fun, not bloody  enough to be frightening. U-turn wants so badly to be "edgy" and  darkly funny, but that would require some modicum of finesse. U-turn is a  rip-off of several different films, and disgraces all of them: Natural Born  Killers (Stone tries to use the techniques he employed in NBK to ill  effect--here it is schmaltzy), Chinatown (as if we didn't see the bare  attempt at a plot twist coming), Duel in the Sun (he plagarizes the end of  the movie and does such a ridiculously bad job of it that he should be  ashamed).
With such a great cast you'd think that this film would be  great--and at some points, this potential peeks through:  Voight is  wonderful as the blind man, Phoenix is hilarious as TNT, Thorton RULES as  the mechanic.  However, as anyone who's seen Hurly Burly, or Mulholland  Falls knows, an amazing cast list cannot make a bad script watchable. In  fact, it just makes it worse because it's all the more frustrating and  irritating.  
Save your time and money and get a movie that doesn't try  so hard to be bad-ass, and just get one that IS--rent one of the movies  U-turn tries to rip-off, or stick with your old standbys until a great  movie comes along to fill that gap.
