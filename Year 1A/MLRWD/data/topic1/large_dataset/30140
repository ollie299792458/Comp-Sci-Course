I went to see this movie at the theater and I will readily admit that I was completely baffled by the critical acclaim it received.  I rented the DVD recently because I was going to give it another chance (well I was going to see what was it I was missing that so many other were seeing)  When I fired up the DVD I decided to listen to the writer's comments.  That transformed this film into a remarkable experience.  So much so I will be buying it to add to my collection.  The details and inticacies of the film and the story come alive as I listen to the writer explain how this story unfolds.  I know many will say that well the movie should be able to stand on its on and in a lot of ways it does.  But listening to the writer answer all the question I had in mind and even more was such a delight.  I recommend getting this movie on DVD just for that reason alone.  There are even more features that I did not get a chance to explore that I am sure will make it even better.  I highly recommend seeing this film!
