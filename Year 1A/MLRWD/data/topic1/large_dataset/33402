I can't help thinking that a lot of people get this film wrong. Yes, it is very very funnny and yes, it is the most quotable film I know (I know practically the whole script by heart - does that make me a nerd?), but surely it is much more than that? If Withnail was 'just' a funny quotable film, I don't think it would A) have achieved such cult status and B) would have touched so many people (well me at least) in such a profound way. Withnail is funny but it is also a very moving film about friendship. It's about growing up. It's about coming of age. It'S about those people who never 'quite' make it. The scene in which Marwood and Withnail say goodbye, you know the 'chin chin' scene, is one of the most moving moments of film I have ever seen.I always get an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Withnail at that moment and his final solioquy from Hamlet is simply breath-taking. The only film I can think of that does roughly the same thing is 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Jack Nicolson is brilliant. Richard. E. Grant is brilliant. ONe flew is very very funny and very quotable ('At least I tried Goddamn it, at least I did that.'). Withnail is even more quotable ('We want the finest wines available to humanity.....'). RP McMurphy is the classic loser-joker, like Withnail. And, like in Withnail, One flew twists us around at the end and chokes the laughter in our throats with the final scene. It is the mark of a genius to do that. The 'CHief' runs off into the distance. Withnail walks off into the distance. If you love One Flew like me, you'll love Withnail and I.
