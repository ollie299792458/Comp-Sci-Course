This movie is one of the reasons the Criterion Collection's selection process has little credibility with me - the movie, a 1943 vehicle directed by Ernst Lubitsch, features mediocre casting, turtle-like pacing, self-consciously cutesy dialogue, and direction by numbers.  Ninotchka it's not!

I bought the movie to see Gene Tierney in one of her first big roles, and she is wasted in curiously unattractive clothing with platitudes for dialogue.  She is not helped by the miscasting of Don Ameche as a romantic lothario - he has little affect to his personality, and is definitely not leading man material.  I could not believe for a minute that he was a ladies man.  Cornel Wilde or Cary Grant would have been more believable.

And why is this a Criterion Film? Beats me.  Leave Her To Heaven had better color cinematography, Laura is more of a classic thriller, and All About Eve is one of the all-time best Fox films EVER.  Period.  Yet this Lubitsch title was chosen for inclusion ......WHY?  Thank God I bought this used through a vendor on Amazon - at 39.99, it is a disgraceful waste of money and time!!

Lame story, lackluster leading man, artificial looking color, direction by numbers ..... tbis is a film worth preserving?????
