Scooby Doo has been a No.1 cartoon hit on Cartoon Network over the 90's and now its going into a new era at the big screen and has just come out with a game on the stunning PlayStation.2 gaming console. The movie is going into the 00's and was No.1 at the box office for 3 weeks in a row! Making $54 mn in its opening week it has made $240 mn dollars world-wide. It was No.1 in Spain, USA, South Africa, Germany and other countries. Sarah Michelle Gellar shows an excellent performance in this film, and so does the rest of the Scooby Gang. The movie is for adults and children. It has a great feel to it and is very entertaining with some great special effects. Despite the rude negative reviews from newspapers in its release the movie has become very successful and the sequal Scooby Doo 2 is coming in 2004. Let's just say those newspaper reviewers don't know a good movie when they see one and don't know how much work goes into it by the Director and actors/actresses. It has become a world-wide franchise and nothing can stop it.
