This is Spinal Tap is the brilliant rockumentary/mockumentary chronicling the band Spinal Tap's tour of the United States.  This was Rob Reiner's debut film,  and what a film to begin with. This is Spinal Tap remains somewhat of a cult classic,  but its hilarious characters,  awesome music,  and brilliant storyline comes to life on screen,  and everyone could enjoy this movie.  Michael McKean plays the lead singer David St.  Hubens to perfection,  while Harry Shearer plays Derek Smalls with great finesse. A young Christopher Guest plays Nigel with a quiet brilliance,  and Guest would incidentally go on to direct and star in two of his own mockumentary films,  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW,  which I must say,  are equally genius,  especially the recent sleeper hit BEST IN SHOW.  Also great is Tony Hendra,  as the cricket-stick wielding manager of the band. June Chadwick is strong as David's girlfriend Jeannine,  and Bruno Kirby makes a great cameo as the limo driver.  The other supporting cameos are fantastic,  coming from Fred Willard(who won a Best Supporting Actor award from the LA Critics for his role in BEST IN SHOW),  Dana Carvey,  Billy Crystal,  Fran Drescher,  Angelica Huston, and Paul Shaffer.  This utterly hilarious movie is excellently directed by Reiner,  who plays the director of the mockumentary within the film,  Marty Dibergi!  Fantastic!
