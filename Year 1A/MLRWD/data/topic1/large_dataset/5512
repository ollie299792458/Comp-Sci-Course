I have followed Tom Hanks' career since Boosom Buddies and Splash.  I liked his comedic touch as an actor in his early work.  The same qualities that drew me to him then, as a comedic actor, are on full display in his writing and directing in this film.  This is the kind of film I wish I had been an extra in.  It wreaks of fun and whimsy and has a sense of humor that few films match.  From Lenny's wisecracks, to Guy's family dynamics, the dialogue and characters ring true and familiar without being overdrawn or hammy.  The music is also very refreshing and upbeat and I enjoyed it immensely, even though I'm not a huge fan of that era of music.  The pacing is perfect.  
There are some scenes that make me giddy everytime I watch them, kind of Capra-esce that way.  The one with Faye running down the sidewalk listening to the radio is one of unbridled joy.  The scene in Illinois when Hanks makes that arm gesture/thrust at just the right beat in the music is also cool, IMHO.
This is one of those movies that is extremely entertaining to watch and looks like it was even funner to make.  It reminded me of another "musical" I loved called "Starstruck" that Gillian Armstrong made in Australia.  They are two of my top 20 favs of all time, which is a select group.  Given the quality of this film I'd rather Hanks be a director than make bore-fests like Cast Away.  There are so few great comedic actors and directors I hate to see them wasted trying to be "well rounded".
This movie rocked!
