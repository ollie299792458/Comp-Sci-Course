This is one of my all time favorite movies!! Double Jeopardy is one of the suspenseful and fun movies that I have ever seen. This is a must own dvd because if you rent it you will not want to return it because it is so good. I usually will only watch movies that I buy one time and then they get lost on my entertainment stand and I never watch them again, but I have seen Double Jeopardy five times and love it everytime like the first. Everyone that I have talked to who have seen this movie also think that is one of the best movies out there!

The person below who stated a comment about the Double Jeopardy laws does not have a clue about anything in the court room. I thought that there were smarter people than this out there! The double Jeopardy laws are true and states as follows

Double Jeopardy and Jurisdiction Law:

The term Double Jeopardy refers to "danger" of a second punishment whenever an individual is brought to trial again for the same crime (or a greater or lesser included crime). This means that there cannot be a second prosecution for the same criminal act (both in fact and in law) upon which a first prosecution was based. The accused must be released and the case dismissed.
