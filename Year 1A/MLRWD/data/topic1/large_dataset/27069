I am slowly collecting DVDs of all the classic horror/science fiction movies I loved as a kid....Planet of the Apes was one of my favorites. I saw a version of it several years ago on cable tv that looked quite dated due to the poor picture quality. I was hesistant to order this DVD package but I took a risk given the positive reviews I read by others here. Well, my skepticism disappeared quickly after about five minutes into this picture. Quite frankly, I just could not believe the picture quality of this DVD!!! It looks like it was made yesterday! The Western location shots utilized during the first portion of the movie look visually stunning and breath-taking just as if I was observing it for the first time in a movie theatre. The sound quality is quite excellent as well.... Although there are heavy handed moments given its over the top message, the 35th anniversary easily holds it own and packs a powerful and timely message. Planet of the Apes offers a textbook lesson on power, prejudice and acceptance. Readers may disagree with me, but I also think that this is one of Heston's best performances on film.  As far as plot and pacing, you get an exciting thrill ride of action and suspense rooting for "Taylor" in a battle of wits against the ruling ape hierarchy. Oh yeah, the ending (in the top 10 of all time movie endings) ain't too shabby either! Highly recommended...
