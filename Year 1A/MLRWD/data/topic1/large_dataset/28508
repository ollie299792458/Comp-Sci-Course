In "Solitary Man," Michael Douglas plays a liar, a cheater, and an all-around jerk -- yet he's got some inner quality so wonderful that the people who have been most hurt and disappointed by him still love him. Virtually every woman he meets falls into bed with him. And he used to be a stand-up guy; all this bad behavior was triggered by the traumatic discovery that he might possibly not live forever.

If you buy this story, I've got a nice bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

And yet the cast makes the movie kind of worth seeing. Michael Douglas, Danny De Vito, Susan Sarandon, and Jenna Fisher are all outstanding. They're so good, in fact, that you hardly notice the thinness of the plot and the implausibility of the story. In particular, the brief scene in which De Vito explains why his nights are no longer troubled by mental images of the beautiful college girls who eat in his restaurant almost justifies the whole movie. I'm not surprised this movie didn't do well in the theaters (was it even released theatrically?), but if you're a fan of any of the actors in it, you'll enjoy it.
