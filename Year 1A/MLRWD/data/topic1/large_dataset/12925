Daniel Hillard(Robin Williams)is an unemployed voice-actor. He is willing to do anything to be with his children. The kids love him because of his taste of humour and wild, unconcerned view on life. But, unfortionaly this is the reason why his wife, Miranda, can't deal being married to him anymore.

After 14 years of marrige she asks for a divorce. Since Daniel is out of work, Miranda gets costody over the kids, in spite of Daniel's desperate protests. Daniel can't accept his role as a "Weekend-daddy", so when he sees his wife's ad for a housekeeper he gets a mad idea. With big imagination, his talent for acting, and a need to be with his children, he decides to dress up and become an enirely new "guy".

This is one of my favourite movies and i never get tired of watching it! Robin Williams is funny as always, Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan does a good job as the ex-wife and her new boyfriend. The kids, expecially Mara Wilson(Nattie)are all very talented. It's funny and sad all in the right places. If you didn't like this film, you haven't seen it properly!
