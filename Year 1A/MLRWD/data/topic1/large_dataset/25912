Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. But by all means, borrow it, rent it, just PLEASE don't buy it!

Why am I advocating such a boycott? Upon inserting the disc into your DVD player, you will be unfortunately assaulted by a nasty hybrid of the lastest marketing scam and technology; THE UNINTERRUPTIBLE MOVIE PREVIEW.

That's right: While movie previews on a DVD may not be anything new, a complete lock-out of the player controls certainly is! Universal has 7 minutes and 21 seconds of movie previews and during that time, the disc is authored to lock out nearly the entire DVD player functionality suite;

*No Main Menu function

*No Chapter Forward function

*(and, most unbelievably) No Player STOP function!

You can't skip or even stop the player while the preview is running! The only function that responds is the Fast Forward key, programmed presumably with the inane logic that you are going to watch the previews, either in real time of in FF mode, but you are GOING to watch the previews, come hell or high water.

I verified this disc feature on three different DVD players: a Pioneer DV-38A, a Pioneer DVR-7000 DVD-R/W recorder and a JVC XV-N44 all-region unit.

This has to be one of the most offensive marketing tactics ever. Where are the studio marketing departments going to stop? What next? Is some studio marketing numbnut going to have my player opening and closing the disc tray repeatedly, the electronic equivalent of sticking its tongue out at me when I try to pass some inane preview or other marketing content?

Hey, Universal? I stopped going to theaters years ago, with crappy projection systems, dim projector bulbs, shoddy or non-functional surround systems, overpriced tickets & food, cell phone calls, babies screaming, sticky floors, and really bad commercials at theater system volume, not to mention just terrible films. So now, I can stop buying Universal DVD's, too, and post this encouragement for others to boycott you also:

If you absolutely need to see a Universal film, just rent it, don't buy it! Better yet, borrow it! Hit Universal in its pocketbook where it hurts!
