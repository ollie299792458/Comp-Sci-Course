This movie resides in my Top 5 list of all-time favorite movies, so there may be some bias in my review since I am such a huge fan. I did not see this movie when it came out in 1994. I did not become aware of it for sometime after that. I was not a Tarantino fan, so I went into this movie with a completely open mind. What I saw over the course of the film was not only mind blowing, but I would go as far as to say life-altering. The way the scenes are shot, the use of music, and the incredible dialogue and mastery of the human language sets this movie apart on a level with the classics. On top of the wonderful cinematography, the acting is superb as well. Seeing people like Sam Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames in a film before becoming superstars shows the brilliance of the casting.

If you are not offended my violence and profanity, I would recommend you buy this film immediately as you will want to watch it over and over to appreciate all of the nuances of this modern day masterpiece.
