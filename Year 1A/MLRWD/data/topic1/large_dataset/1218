This sequal to Chinatown was worth watching on dvd

It's so cool

The plot gets just as deep as the plot in Chinatown

Jack made me think alot in this one who the bad guy was

and also he made me laugh and smile alot just like in the last film. Jack plays his roles well&#62; Anyone who wants to put him down for acting and directing should be in his shoes. it's not easy to direct a movie and star in it. I give him mad props for directing The Two Jakes. He rocks. He knows how to cast a scene well. The actors are really interesting in this one as well.

The plot gets deeper in the middle and end

and when the movie ends is when I was shocked the most

I never saw it coming

Really cool cast to watch. They really played cool roles

I would recommend this film to people that are just getting into Nicholson.  He deserves some respect. He is a good guy. Very talented. I can't wait to get all his movies on dvd. especially more of the others he directed. He will always be respected by me. It sucks he got bad reviews at the Box Office. I liked the movie alot

and have watched it 8 times already and still wanna watch it.

The music hooked me in alot too. Just like in Chinatown. Riveting seriously :)
