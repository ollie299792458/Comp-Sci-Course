I thought that this film had a rather unusual storyline, although the outcome of the relationship between the main characters was quite predictable! I did enjoy it, and found myself cracking up.
Good points: Along with all the character flaws both Wade and Kelson have, the film is careful to develop redeemable character traits along the way as well, making both characters human rather than unsalvageably neurotic. Very human in-fact, I know people in real life like these two. They're also careful to show that both characters do actually have similar interests in life so it's not completely head-scratching to see them falling for each other. Oh and the romance is never sappy, so for those who are a fan of subtle expressions, furtive glances and baffled reactions, this is the film for you. Bullock and Grant might be playing their usual roles but those roles are definitely very compatible, at least in this film. Chemistry is present and makes the film work.
  So by all means go out and buy this film. I think that if you're into romantic comedies, you'll love this one.
