I like these kind of low budget campy "not really scary movies" and just recently I watched it on Elvira's Macabre Theatre at midight last
Saturday on Time Warner Cable channel 406 (KDOC). I will say this: since I really enjoy music as well as these kinds of movies, I thought the
"entire" soundtrack for this movie was absolutely awesome. I'm willing to bet that if the producer of this low budget movie, if he is still around
and he were somehow were to be informed of my review, he should take a serious look into my suggestion. He should get the technical support to get
rid of all the muffled 'sound interference' and think seriously about reproducing the soundtrack at least to this 1966 low budget film.
The music itself is very jazzy and I would have to say that I really enjoyed all of the progressive moments of this "jazz" project throughout
the movie to be more enjoyable than the movie itself. If this were available on Amazon.music I would by the CD Soundtrack to this popular 1966
cult film in a heartbeat.
