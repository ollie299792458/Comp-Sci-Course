This DVD is a product from a person from Eastern Europe who has not joined in the "close your eyes" policy of Western European leftist intellectuals who always refused to realize the Soviet (criminal) system.
Similar to the "Black Book on Communism" which resulted in an alarm cry of those leftist intellectuals in Europe because they feared to loose their beloved Soviet System and their dream of Socialism/Communism this DVD is high-
lightening the truth about what really happened after the October revolution.....and what happened in the Eastern European states after Roosevelt (and Churchill)gave them away to Stalin after WW II following the Jalta accord!

This DVD should be a compulsory part of history lessons in schools and universities.

But I doubt it. Media, Historians and Politicians in Western Europe are not prepaired to come up with the truth.
They are afraid that the crimes of the Nazis would be relativised and could look smaller in comparison.
