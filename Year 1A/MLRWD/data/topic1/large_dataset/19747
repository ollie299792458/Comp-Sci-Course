I just viewed this Fiddler on the Roof Blu Ray disk two days ago. I played it on my Panasonic Blu Ray disk player and was VERY VERY SATISFIED at the EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE OF THE DISK! I enjoyed this movie very very much! The picture was so sharp in High Definition! I do not know who these other people are who complained about this disk but I was so happy I took a chance on buying this disk even after reviewing the bad reviews about their disk playing bad. Those other people must either have a cheaper blu ray player (I've tried looking at blu ray disks on cheap blu ray players and they played lousy)or have a problem with their firmware. Some times I have a problem viewing at first a movie (for example: "The Kings Speach" in blu ray version.) In order to see it right, I had to update the firmware of my blu ray player!  BLU RAY MOVIES ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER than DVDs TO SEE ON A BIG SCREEN TV THAT CAN PLAY HIGH DEFINITION MOVIES!!!!!! The only disadvantage is that you sometimes have to update the firmware on your blu ray player if you don't have it always connected to the internet, but for me it isn't much of a deal to update my blu ray player once in a long while to play a new blu ray disk. Also when looking at amazon.com, the blu ray version of fiddler on the roof was much cheaper than the DVD version!!! I hope this review helps some people.
