This particular movie/DVD is ultra-awesome! The story and/or moralistic value of seven is enlightening, even though Brad Pitt is in it. Nevertheless, Brad Pitt practically plays himself, a superficial cop (minus the cop) who thinks the insane are plumb insane with no further intellect. Sorry, a anti-Brad Pitt rant. Anyway, you wouldn't be thinking about buying the DVD if you haven't already seen the movie, so here's the cool stuff: The extras in this dvd set are amazing! This is one of the rare DVDs that actually allows you to see the restoration process and even allows you to choose between the two!! They did so much work in remastering this film, unlike a lot of DVDs out there that have the lable "remastered" and actually aren't. You get 4 (oh sure, FOUR!) very cool/informative commentary tracks including one with David Fincher, choices between SEVERAL audio options; including DTS ES Discreet 6.1, yes... 6.1!! You also get deleted scenes that are interesting and not some extra shot of someone staring off into the corner before the scene that was actually in the movie. You get to change audio mixes for the opening sequence which really rocks and what-not. Plus, to top it off, you get a plethora of DVD-ROM (not Range Of Motion for all you physical therapists out there) stuff. Buy the DVD and get CREEPY!
