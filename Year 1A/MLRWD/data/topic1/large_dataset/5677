My rating is for the DVD package as a whole.  You simply can't get a better value for your money than this DVD.  Three versions of the classic that really started the horror craze back in the early 30s. 
  Sentimentally, I'll always love the Lugosi version better.  To me, Lugosi  is the ultimate Count Dracula.  No other actor comes close in my book.  Along with Dwight Frye's classic, definitive performance as Renfield, these  two performers manage to carry the picture over its many rough spots.
  I  agree with the majority that the Spanish version is better overall. Lupita  Tovar, as Mina (Helen Chandler's English counterpart) is the highlight in  the acting department.  Also, many  little directorial "extras"  show how the Spanish crew worked hard to improve upon the scenes shot by  the English crew during the day.  My favorite is the addition of smoke  rising from Dracula's coffin as he rises for the evening.  A small, but  eerily effective addition.  One of many.  And the third  "version" with the Philip Glass score:  The less said the better.  I don't care for its addition to this classic. By itself, it's somewhat  interesting music (albeit monotonous), but its intrusion over the entire  film, including the dialogue(!) mind you, is just too much.  An experiment  that failed, in my book.
The "extras" on this DVD package,  however, are outstanding.  The poster and photo montage, cast and filmmaker  bios and production notes should be of interest to all fans of film in  general.  But this package benefits immeasurably from the inclusion of two  additional features:  feature commentary and an outstanding documentary on  the making of the film (well, both films), both guided by the hand of David  J. Skal, THE authority on (the cinematic) Dracula. If there's ANYTHING you  wanted to know about the history or making of this classic film, you'll  find it here.  Three films, really, on one DVD and numerous, invaluable  extras.  This DVD package can't be beat.
