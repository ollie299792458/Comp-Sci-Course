After months of chronic pain in my low back, hip and sacrum, I am so thankful I found this viniyoga therapy.  Within a week of doing the exercises daily, I regained strength and stability in my target areas, and am continuing to enjoy these benefits and increased mobility and flexibility.

Dedicating 30 minutes a day to this gentle practice has changed my perspective on the importance of self-care. Three weekly visits to the physical therapist, daily meds, regular massages and over $1000 in co-pays have not given me what Gary's simple, effective therapy can.

The DVD provides helpful information in a simple format. Take from it what you need (I recommend reviewing the educational information in the first sections to increase your understanding of this vital system in our bodies. For examle, you learn about how we need to contract, expand, and relax our muscles to enjoy full health in this area). In the exercise sections, Gary's slow, measured approach allows you to focus on your breath and healing postures to make the most of this self-care routine.

If you are looking for relief, you've found it.
