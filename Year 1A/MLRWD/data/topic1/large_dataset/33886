Upon seeing the DVD of the long awaited release of "The Fantasticks", I can honestly say that someone at MGM Home Entertainment had some sense to enrich the DVD with all the foolishly edited scenes and songs that were omitted in the the theatrical release. It was great to see all the excised footage but in the same sense had U/A marketed this film properly and had not had the film foolishly re-edited, it may have done well at the box office. My one regret was that the reprise to "Try To Remember" was used in the final product and not the original filming that is included as an extra. After seeing the film and the deleted scene, the film seems sort of empty. I recommend the disc to musical lovers as it offers a lot but, it would have been nice had this film been given the respect it deserved and all excised scenes and songs were placed back where they were originally intended. On one final note, Ritchie's Commentary is quite interesting to listen to after seeing the film...
