If U have seen this brilliant film before with the original Australian soundtrack, then I do not recommend this video! Only in America will they take a film in perfectly acceptable English, and then go and totally ruin it, by dubbing it into American English. The mind just boggles! The initial reaction is one of disbelief when you first hear one of the characters speak (because U know what he's supposed to sound like). This soon turns into irritation as you try to marry the characters with the new 'foreign' voices, and try to spot dubbing errors (lips moving but no sound &amp; vice versa),and deliberate substitution of words (there R some of these as well), AND, try to watch the story, for the rest of the film.
I knew there was a dubbed version, but i thought it was called 'Road Warrior' or something.
The sad thing is, for me to return it will cost more than the video is worth (had i only been informed in the synopsis)
I shall search for a 2nd hand 'original' copy in England.
Please tell us when a film, in English, has been dubbed for the American market.
If you have not seen it before, or if U R American &amp; can't follow the Ozzy slang anyway, then i suppose this dubbed version can be entertaining, but not to me.
I shall be much more wary in future.
If it ain't broken, don't fix it!!
