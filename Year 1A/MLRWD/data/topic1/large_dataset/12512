This movie not only has 2 very talented female actors Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock, but this movie is not so much about the workings of doing magic, it has plenty of magic in it, but ths movie more shows the harm that magic can do and the long term affects one spell you cast can do.  If you're looking for a movie that might help you learn how to do magic or how it's done, then this is not the movie, it shows very little about actually the full set-up of using spells, but it is very funny and also has its sad moments.  Bullock and Kidman are sisters in this movie who go to live with their Aunt's because their parents die, their Aunt's end up teaching them magic and once the sisters grow into teenagers/young adults Kidman runs off from her home town following love and men and living a more on the road life and Bullock stays with the Aunt's, well the town they live in is small and her Aunt's are accused of being Witche's and the community acts scared of them, but they aren't harmful witche's and they just go about the market and through the town as if it is entertaining that people act the way they do towards them, Bullock whose a young adult gets noticed by another young man who works in the town who fancies her and the Aunt's cast a spell to attract the man and Bullock in a relationship of puppy love, like all spells there are consequences sometimes and the Aunt's didn't think the long term downside of the spell would ever be a problem, but I can't tell you what that is because you'll have to watch it yourself.  The movie is not all about Bullock, Kidman stays in touch with her sister and they end up re-united and she has problems of her own which add another twist and exciting part to the movie.  I really enjoyed this movie, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was a little cheesy, but it was meant to be comedy and even if you're not a believer of magic, this movie is still funny and it's not got a whole lot of magical parts in it, so if you're someone who is strong beliver of magic is wrong or doesn't exist this movie definitly does not make magic seem like it is real at all, it maintains the make belive magic element in the movie. It is more of a film for women to watch, but it is very funny and I enjoy watching it and watch it often if I want a good funny movie.
