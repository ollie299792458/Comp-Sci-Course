This is one of the best re-issue DVD series I've seen in a long time. Classic Media knows what we want and gives it to us.

* A great-looking transfer of a classic film.

* Informative commentary

* Not too expensive

The best thing about this series of re-issues, is, of course, the inclusion of the dubbed American versions alongside the original Japanese versions. This allows the hardcore Godzilla fans to see the movies as they were originally made, while giving stoned couch potatoes the campy dubbed verisons they remember from Saturday afternoon Creature Features ("Hey look! His lips are moving but he's not making any sound! Haw haw haw haw!").

A lot of DVD companies would either confuse the consumer with two separate releases, or release "Deluxe 2-DVD" versions of every movie (as with the original Godzilla movie), but Classic Media gets it right by putting both versions on the same disc and releasing it at an affordable price (with great graphics to boot).

It doesn't hurt, either, that this is one of the best of the original Godzilla sequels, presented in all its fabulous widescreen Tohoscope glory. Even if you're just a casual Godzilla fan, this one belongs in your collection. As for me, I can't wait for the release of the Ghidorah movies and War of the Gargantuas later this year! Godzilla-lovers rejoice!
