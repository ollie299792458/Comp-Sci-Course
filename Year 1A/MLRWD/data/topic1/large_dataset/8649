Hilarious!

Brotherly love, cannabis, catfish noodling, crossbows, Jews, drugs and death in Tulsa!

Ivy League philosphy professor Bill Kincaid (Ed Norton) is lured back to his Oklahoma hometown, where his twin brother Brady (Ed Norton), a small-time pot grower, has concocted a scheme to take down a Tulsa drug lord (Richard Dreyfuss). Throw in their crazy mother (Susan Saradon), Brady's half wit sidekick (Tim Blake Nelson) and the always lovely (Keri Russell) and you've got one seriously good time.

The movie starts out slow and then keeps building up and building up into a full blown dark comedy. I would compare it to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00441GYOW">Adaptation</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JIE7JC">Burn After Reading</a>.

If your an Ed Norton fan, this movie is obviously a must see, as he plays two characters, twin brothers Bill and Brady Kincaid. The supporting cast is excellent as well, Keri Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Tim Blake Nelson and Josh Pais. Josh Pais is pretty much an unknown name, but his face is definitely familiar from other films. He plays Jewish dentist Ken Feinman and has a small role in the movie at first and a large role near the end, his breakdown scene is absolutely hilarious!

Hats off to Tim Blake Nelson <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRM">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a> for writing this dark comedy gem! He also co-produced the movie with Ed Norton.
