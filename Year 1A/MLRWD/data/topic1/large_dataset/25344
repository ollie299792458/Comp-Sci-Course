While this set of five films ( on two discs ) is a good representation of "Coop's" early Paramount output ( and a most attractive bargain ), it would have been even better if the compiler had included "Desire" instead of "Design For Living" and replaced the insipid "Peter Ibbetson" with the rousing "Souls at Sea." But the remaining three titles are fine ( even if

"The General Died at Dawn" is an incomplete cut ). The quality of the prints ranges from good to very good. Many on-line reviewers state that

"Beau Geste" is the best of the bunch. Certainly this is a fine production with one of the best openings of any film, but the story is a little too contrived to ring true and I've always felt that Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston ( all good actors) are unlikely brothers.

The film is virtually stolen by Brian Donlevy as the brutal sergeant. The real winner in this collection is the superb "Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

Well-scripted, perfectly directed amd flawlessly acted, this is one of Gary Cooper's best films and he is ably supported by the excellent Franchot Tone. The film includes a snake-charming sequence that has never been bettered. The atmosphere of India is perfectly captured and there is a rela slam-bang action climax followed by a most touching finale. Apart from its ongoing popularity ( the film was continually re-released throughout the 1930s,'40s and well into the '50s ) it influenced several other classic adventures films including "The Charge of the Light Brigade"(1936), "Gunga Din" and "The Real Glory" (both 1939).

This collection, which shows Cooper to be a most potent screen actor in a variety of role, is heartily recommended and is worth the price for "Bengal Lancers" alone.
