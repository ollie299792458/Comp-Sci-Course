Throughot my life as a Russian history buff, I was surprised at how no one managed to make a decent documentary about Russian History. Countless documentaries (like Nicholas and Alexandra, Nova, The Revenge of the Romanovs) but they all left a hole in the story, until now...
I was browsing when I decided to visit the History Channel website. And Russia: Land of the Tsars was being advertised in the spotlight with contests etc and trailers. I was anxious to watch it (although I was expecting a disappointment like other documentaries). So I reserved the TV and watched it. It was stunning because it was a mix of movie quality acting, interviews with experts and informative narration.
The problem with many documentaries was they would ignore minor tsars/ tsarinas and my personal favorite (apart from Nicholas II) Tsarina Elizaveta Petrovna. But not this one they comprehensively explained personalities and showed an array of portraits of the sovereigns and re-enacments of important events. When the first part finished (at the end of Pyotr the Great's death) I couldn't wait till the next day for the continuation, it was so enchanting I did not want to leave the Land of the Tsars, but I waited till the next day when I watched the continuation (even more dazzling). Ekaterina the Great's affairs, Pyotr III's murder, The Napoleonic Wars, they were all re-enacted, I was stunned. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Russia and expects up to date information and rich production.
