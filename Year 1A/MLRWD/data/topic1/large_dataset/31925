All in all an entertaining movie, not one stereotypical aspect of British life including their pretentious and outdated social structure as well as did their dry sense of "British" humor go unscathed, nothing was sacred or bullet proof.It reminded me of a modern style of the beloved "Monty Python in a way.
The film is beautifully shot with detail to the British country manors and costumes accurate to the culture as well as to the time period.
 Each actor was well suited to their role, although Kristin Scott-Thomas playing character of "Veronica" was stiff at the start and did overact a bit but then fell comfortably into her role easily as the manipulative and overly controlling mother-in-law from hell.
The Can-Can scene where the character of Hilda danced it sans "scanties" or underwear to please her love interest Phillip much to the dismay of both the  uptight mother and sister.Applause from the male audience members raised the roof and the amount of donations for the annual "War Widows Revue" show, also lessening the new American brides chance for acceptance.
The hilarious outdoor hunting shack scene were both Biel and Barnes were caught in their birthday suits trying to have a little alone time as dogs and people busted in on them, Barnes held the family dog up to cover private parts while mom fainted and the proper "Lord Hurst" obviously tried to sneak a glimpse of Bens nude wife.
Jim's(Colin Firth) sarcastic one liners were the icing on the cake throughout the movie. The goofy character of Phillip did redeem himself in the end when he acted chivalrous towards Biel's partner-less character at the start of the fantastic tango scene with Firth, was danced by both actors as far as I could tell. If doubles had been used the transitions would have been smoother and Beil would not have watched her feet, in spite of those flaws both would do well to be on "Dancing Of The Stars",they really were that good together.
 I recommend buying the DVD,because you will find it will be one you do not tire of easily even if it is watched repeatedly time and time again, the ending will always be a surprise.
