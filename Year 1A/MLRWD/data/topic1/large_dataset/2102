... Being a huge fan of the original classic, I was a little perturbed when I heard they were remaking it, fearing another disaster like 1990's remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, but after seeing it, I was pleasently surprised.
  Not only is the best Zombie movie in recent memory (with the exception of the original and perhaps tied with 28 Days Later), but it is also one of the most suspensful.
  I challenge any skeptic to sit through the first ten minutes of this film and not be convinced that it was a good idea. The suspense, special effects, direction, script, and yes even acting are first class.
  The story is very different from the original, with the only real similarity being the mall. Some of Rommero's more mature socio-economic and political undertones were abandoned for the sake of good old fashioned thrills, but you know what? I don't care! The film was made so well that it's few shortcomings are hardly noticable and easily overlooked.
  Many fans of the original feared that Universal would "wimp out" on the zombie effects that made the original so shocking, but fans will be please to find that they didn't. The blood and gore are easily as good (and abundant) as the original, sometimes even better (and more convincing).
  For any parents out there wondering about the content of this film, the violence is VERY strong. The language is also pretty bad. There are some short scenes of sexuality but they are there nevertheless. The atmosphere and suspense are also very heavy. Parents may want to think twice before taking youngsters to this one. I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone under twelve, and even then I'd think hard about it.
  This film is one of the best and most entertaining horror films in years. See it. Fear it. Love it. ...
