I really love asain films because they seem to have a way of capturing such an artsy feel to them.  The music, the scenery, the way the film is shot: asain movies are brought to another kind of level due to the amount of love put into them.

Zhou Yu's Train is another example of beauty in a film.  Though this was not my favorite film (Star Runner was phenominal, a must see), it was still very pleasing to watch.  The story revolves around Zhou Yu, a young woman struggling with her desires: should she stay with the poetic, quiet man who lives so far away he requires long train rides twice a week just to be able to see his face...or should she dare let herself fall for someone new?  This is the question she faces when she meets up with Zhang, a veternarian who actually lives within distance of her own home.  I must admit, this movie throws you for a loop, and I actually found myself rooting for the loud, obnoxious guy instead of the guy who is supposedly the true romantic.  There is also something written on the back of this movie about a young woman who looks like Zhou Yu; but that really doesn't play that much into the movie...they make her seem like a stalker, but that's not really true.

All in all, this movie was beautiful and poetic, and a must see for any asian film fan!
