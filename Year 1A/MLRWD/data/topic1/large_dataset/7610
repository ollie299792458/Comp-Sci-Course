***WARNING SPOILERS***
How do you keep faith in anything greater than yourself, when at any moment your life can be extinguished by forces outside of your control?  This is one of the basic struggles of human existence.  To live in constant fear is really not living at all.  Our hero Theo kept his faith, even after losing his infant son to chance illness.  He keeps his faith, even after the love of his life is killed before his eyes.  He keeps his faith, even after his old friend is killed before his eyes.  He stumbles through the endless war-torn wasteland on an unclear mission, not really knowing for sure whether his actions will ultimately help save humanity.  Countless times during his journey, our hero is on the razor's edge, where the slightest single variance in his actions or the actions of those around him will lead to certain death.

Was Theo successful in his mission?  If you believe he was successful, was his success due to his faith and perseverence, or did he just get lucky?  Do we human beings value faith, determination and self-sacrifice as virtues, or are we all just waiting around for chance to shine favorably upon us?
