The world of anime is very hit or miss.  Japanimation is either amazing or terrible.  'Ghost in the Shell' would be filed under the category of amazing.  It succeeds in every area:  narratively, musically and visually.  The soundtrack is one of the most engaging, magical, original, beautiful things I've ever heard.  It's so good I bought the soundtrack.  Visually, I would use the same adjectives that I used for the soundtrack.  Simply put it looks REALLY, REALLY good.  In fact I'd say this is probably the best looking piece of animation I've ever seen.  No corners are cut in this film in terms of the research and imagination that went into this film.  The weapons are very cool, the action scenes are extremely well thought out, all of the computers/buildings/vehicles are very slick and the scenes in the rain at the end of the film are incredible.  One area where this film completely blew my mind was the script.  Not only is the 'plot' extremely complex and interesting but there is also an extremely well thought out discussion of artificial intelligence.  This film is surprising cerebral, especially for a genre normally associated with little school girl superheroes.  This film is a great way to spend 115 minutes of your life.
