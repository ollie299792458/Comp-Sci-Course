What's to say about this gem of a film except to hail it as the biggest guilty pleasure of the 90's.  Elizabeth Berkley deserves all the stops playing the temperamental but oh-so fine drifter slash stripper who'd throw anyone down the stairs for a chance to highlight a popular Las Vegas revue. Not only does her wish come true, but mega problems soon follow, like jealousy, rape, revenge &agrave; la Ninja--all among her highly-respected peers, or so it seems.  The used and abused theme the film carries throughout its nearly 135 minute run never misses a beat. Paul Verhoeven (knowingly?) creates a "Valley of the Dolls" world where anyone who's anyone looks fabulous while suffering greatly in the name of Goddess (the title of the Las Vegas revue, don't you know).  But the film's biggest asset, besides the many deliciously laughed out moments(unintentional, of course), is its star, Miss Berkley,  bless her heart. Not only does she give heart and soul into her role but, contrary to everyone on-screen, she seems to be the only one who's not in on the "joke".  And that's exactly why her performance, as the film itself, is a must-see.  Moreover, the extra features on this Fully Exposed DVD edition (the one minus the complementary accessories) even includes the famed commentary by witty man and "Showgirls" devotee David Schmader.  You'll giggle so much over the massive movie cheesiness that you'll want to repeat the experience again and again.  Now, if only the director and star were attached to the rumored sequel floating around, life would sure look like a big bowl of Versace dresses.  Or should we say Ver-sayce? Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher
