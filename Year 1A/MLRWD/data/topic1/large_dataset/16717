There are only a few animated shows that I would call a favorite of mine; The Simpsons, Southpark, Invader Zim these all pushed the boundries of what you can do with animation as a whole. I can add to this small list in fact I can put at the top of the List Cowboy Bebop. now you may not be able to tell by my chosen shows listed earlyer but I am a devoted anime fan. But never did I find one that could speak to me like this. It is quite possibly my favorite show of all time. It has every thing that is needed to be a great show. It has comedy, violence, a genious plot, thought provoking theories, genuinly likable charachters (my favorite is the incredibly hot Faye Valentine), and some of the most in depth backstories I've ever heard. I will admit I didn't have high hopes for this series at first due to a slow first two episodes at which nothing of any relevance happens but by the third episode I felt like doubting this series was like commiting blasphemy. It tells the tale of Bounty hunter Spike, expolice officer Jet, the casino cheating feme fatal Faye, the greatest haker ever Ed, and a spunky data dog named Ein. They travel in a fishing ship converted to a space ship looking for just at least enough bounty money to eat if nothing else. This is by far one of the best series to show on American television in 5 years it should not be missed. Don't care how you watch it just make sure you do.
