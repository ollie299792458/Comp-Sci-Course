I bought this movie because I saw a few scenes and it looked interesting enough.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, from start to finish.  Yep, the plot line's been done plenty before and there's profanity and crude behavior, which is common these days as well.  All I can say is ".....and?".

I read, probably like a lot of people, the poor reviews as much as the good ones to see what people get (or don't) about the movie.  After watching it (twice) I don't get all the crying about the "F-Bomb" references and all that.  It's not much different than most people I've seen, especially one's who work at airports (which I did).  And there must be a few annoyed lawyers out there who don't like this movie because they keep saying that "Molly" is a lawyer, which she's not.  She quit that whole idea and is an event planner.  Funny that there are at least two other reviews that mention she's a lawyer and seem put out about her being with the "loser" character.

I think all the characters in the movie are believable enough to be enjoyable and I'm very happy I own it.  I give it 4 stars only because it's familiar territory.  To those out there who can't understand it, quit trying and it might just turn out to be funny.  Besides, everybody needs a buddy like "Stainer"!  Life would be pretty bland without one.
