Crystal clear and sharp across the board, this Blu-ray transfer is top-notch. Picture quality is just astounding. Beautiful movie to render in such a gloriously high resolution. I have watched it all the way through one time -- plan to watch it a million more.

I can't get into the whole "reviewing of the movie thing". Sorry to say, but this is just a technical review. It's a great movie with great characters and story. It spawned a hundred episodes in a series because it was SO GOOD. I have owned it in VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray and it was well worth every penny to get the latest version. It looks stellar.

All scenes...still, panning, action, panoramic looked flawless and played without a hitch on my Samsung BD-P1600. I was floored by the visual quality, seeing as how it's about a 15 year old movie. Paired with my Samsung LCD TV, I don't see many of the newest movies looking any better than this one. The sound was truly impressive even on a low end surround sound system.

Well worth the price, I have to say. One of the transfers so far that has far exceeded my expectations.
