I believe a lot of people are missing the point of the whole school shooting aspect of the movie. You cannot simply place blame on one thing for why bad things happen. There's a whole spectrum of reasons why one certain event can happen. Trying to place blame one one thing for something as complex as a teenager killing multiple others is almost impossible to do. Not only does it vary from case to case, but for the act to even occur, the teen must be in a confused state of mind. Blaming "Pulp Fiction" or gun control isn't a rational way to explain why the event happened. This is what the film was trying to portray.

No one knows the real reason why tragedies such as this happen. Not even the person commiting the act truly understands why he or she is doing it. That's the point of this film.

However, the film tells this message in a beautiful way. Yes, the whole odd couple thing is cliche, but Busy Philipps' performance is what elevates this film beyond the cliche. While Ericka Christensen was rather good, Philipps is the reason why this film was so touching. She transformed this film into so much more than your typical odd couple film, but rather a realistic view of someone who has gone through serious depression and mental anguish. She serves as a guide to not only Christensen, but viewers as well. In one particular scene towards the end of Christensen's stay in the hostipal, she gives a heart wrenching scene outside in the dark as she explains how she copes with her depression and void of feelings.

This film is so much more than a movie about school shootings. It touches upon teenage social groups, depression/suicide, friendship and life as a teenager in today's world.
