The Royal Tenenbaums is my favorite movie of 2001.  It is unlike any movie I have ever seen before.  The characters are truly unique and each performance is excellent.  Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum gives a dynamic performance.  He does a great job of showing all sides of this character.  You want to feel angry at him, for the treatment of his family, and you grow to love him at the same time.  Royal's three children are given equal time to develop as individual characters.  They each have a distinct personality that reveal different sides as the movie goes on.  There are so many interesting little details in this film that it's hard to take everything in on one viewing.  There are Chas's Dalmatian mice, Margot's missing finger, and Richie's headband.  These aspects are all part of these characters personalities, but they are not made a big deal of they are just there.  Gywneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller all turn in unexpected performances as Royal's troubled children.  They are all brooding in there own unique way.  Stiller is especially restrained as his character is recently widowed and he has become obsessed with his family's safety.  Wilson shows many sides to Royal's youngest son Richie from a sweet caring son to a depressed lovelorn man.  Paltrow plays the apathetic Margot perfectly, showing her to be both cold and caring at the same time, depending on who she's dealing with. She tends to only be caring around her brother Richie.
Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have put a lot of effort into the script that make this film original and poignant.  Anderson payed attention to every detail of this production from costume, to music to set design.  He has created a world that doesn't quite exist but is very familiar.  All the effort has paid off, this film is definitely worth seeing.
