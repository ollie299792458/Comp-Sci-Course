Okay, this movie has been reviewed to death, so i thought i would take a different tac with mine. I recently debated the merits of this movie with a friend of mine online. He said that it was one of the best, worst movies of all time, meaning that it was a horrible movie that you just couldn't help but watch whenever it comes on. My response was as follows:

"I actually wouldn't call Starship Troopers a terrible movie at all. If you consider that it was a Heinlein magazine serial in 1959 written (the actual story name was "Starship Soldier", and was published in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction") that was then published as "Starship Troopers" in novel form at the end of that year (won a Hugo award also). It was written as a response to a newspaper advertisement in 1958 placed by National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, calling for the unilateral suspension of nuclear weapon testing by the U.S.. Heinlein actually founded a group in support of nuclear weapons testing, and then wrote his stories.

So....considering the background of the story, and the fact that Verhoeven kept the movie honest to the book and its intent, which included a very heavy depiction of how propaganda campaigns can shape or threaten to shape national policy and the public mindset and/or acceptance of policies, i would say the movie was actually quite brilliant.

It brought the innocence of the time period it was written in to life while telling an outrageous counter propaganda tale of why we need to arm ourselves more heavily as opposed to ridding ourselves of armament.

p.s. I had a band once called "Games & Theory" back in 1998-1999. Can you guess where we got that name from?"
