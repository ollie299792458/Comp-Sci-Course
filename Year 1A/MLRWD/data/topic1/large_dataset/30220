I bought this collection back when it was first released.  I was in line at Target on the morning of November 28th, I had been waiting so long for this set!  I was NOT disappointed!  In fact I love this set so much, I'm planning to buy an extra set here on Amazon just so that I never have to go without!

The packaging is first-class, the tin and lenticular sleeves alone are worth having!  What a beautiful way to display your love for Superman!  The comic book and the free poster offer are great bonuses!  And you cannot possibly beat having FOURTEEN discs of nothing but pure Superman!

From SUPERMAN RETURNS, to the RICHARD DONNER CUT of SUPERMAN II, to the LOOK! UP IN THE SKY documentary ... everything you could possibly want is all here in one SUPER set!

Even though it was a bit of a hassle to have to send in for the replacement discs the first time, it was handled well and I really am pleased with the level of customer service the WB provided for thousands of fans who called in!  It could not have been easier to get the corrected discs.  You really have to appreciate the WB for not letting this mistake slide by - because not all studios would have gone to the same trouble they did to do right by the fans.

Thanks WB for putting this fantastic collector's set together!  I will treasure it forever!

If you are a Superman fan and for some reason you missed this set the first time around, DON'T pass on it now!  Also, you can't possibly get more of a bargain on all of these films!  Even at $100 it is an absolute STEAL for all of these movies, rare special features, and documentaries!  This was the best purchase I've made in a long time!  :)
