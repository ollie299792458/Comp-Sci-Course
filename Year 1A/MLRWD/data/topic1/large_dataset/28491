If you're looking to buy this Blu-Ray, you're likely familiar with the film so no need to review the actual movie.  If by some chance you haven't seen this film then I'll quickly summarize: Awesome classic.

As regards the Blu-Ray, Warner did a fantastic job of restoring this classic film, especially considering the source material they had to work with.  Yes, this Blu-Ray is very grainy.  Yes, some shots are quite soft.  And yes, that's *exactly* how this film is supposed to look.  This was released in 1933; film stock was grainy and lenses were out of focus every now and then.  In this Blu-Ray disc Warner has given us a wonderfully accurate presentation of this historic film.  I commend Warner for resisting the temptation to "clean up" this film for modern audiences that seem to have forgotten what old movies actually look like.

Complaining about the grain on this Blu-Ray is akin to complaining about the lack of sound in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040QYROK">The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray</a>] (and wait till you see how grainy that is).  Or that Gone With The Wind doesn't fill the entire HDTV screen.  Or that Psycho is black and white.  Or that Kentucky doesn't have ocean front property.  I mean it is what it is folks, no amount of complaining is going to change what this incredible 1933 film looks like.
