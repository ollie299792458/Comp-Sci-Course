To begin with, I'm honestly not familiar with the 60s version, and it may be better in every way.  I don't really know.  I can say that some of the complaints about this version which compare it to the 60s version--for example, that the movie merely indulges in patriotic gesturing, and that it contains less than 50 minutes of story--seem pretty exaggerated.  If I have any real complaints, the most outstanding is that some of the details of plot elements don't quite make sense (to avoid spoilers, I'll just say, what the heck were the shoulder devices for, considering everything else that was done?).  The second is that the very few real villain-type characters (and one of them far more than the rest) seem a little too over-the-top to swallow completely, bordering on comic book villainy.

As a psychological film, though, the handling of blurred-together hallucination and memory was done magnificently well, and the portrayal of people who can feel their minds betraying them was admirably credible and also respectful. Although there is some lack of closure regarding the ultimate fate of Atticus Noyle, in a way this is fitting, since he seems almost like a phantom during the course of the film. The main reason I gave four stars rather than five is that while Manchurian Candidate is often skillfully atmospheric, in pursuit of atmosphere, it sometimes becomes either heavy-handed when trying too hard to create an impression or impossibly vague when trying to avoid being explicit. However, it usually manages to keep well-balanced, and seems to aim high, both of which are done all too rarely.

As an aside, for some reason, Liev Schreiber and Denzel Washington, the actors whose characters are obviously at the center of the story and who get the most screen-time, are listed as supporting actors, and those playing two of the soldiers who show up only briefly are listed as the "stars."  If you're watching the movie to see them, you may be disappointed.
