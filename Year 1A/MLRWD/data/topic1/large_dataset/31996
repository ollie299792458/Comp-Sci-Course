Before this movie I didn't have a clue who "The Hurricane" was.  I watched this movie to find out who he was and because I read great reviews on Denzel Washington's performance.  The reviews were definitely on point along with the Oscar nomination he recieved (which he should've won).  Denzel Washington's acting was superb.  The movie is about a boxer who went to prison wrongfully accused of murder, who then was helped to freedom by a young man and his Canadian tutors after reading his autobiography  which "Hurricane" wrote while he was in prison.  Hurricane was another black man who had no luck in the US Justice system and didn't recieve a fair trial until the case went to federal court where all the lies were uncovered and the truth set free.  This was a wonderful movie.  It made me cry and also angry at the injustice and also the racism.  I was elated when "Hurricane" was released from a trying time in prison.  This movie will be around for a while and maybe become a classic.
