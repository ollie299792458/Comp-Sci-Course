This series was not originally available in Canada, it was on HBO which until recently was verboten. I picked up Season One after seeing some great reviews and that Bruce Campbell was in it and got hooked digitally. The right amount of action, suspense and thrills mixed with some smoking chemistry between Jeff Donovan and Gabrielle Anwar, storylines with spies and con artists and some excellent writing makes for a great show.
Bruce Campbell and Sharon Gless are two of TV's pasttime greats who add humour, dimension and depth and drag this series from being just action-drama to a cut above.
In Season Two it keeps on growing. Mike Weston's difficulties with his new handlers keep interfering with his objective of the week, and makes his choices and actions even more outstanding because of the extra effort he has to go to in order that everything works out. The tension in Mike's and Fiona's relationship gives that extra spice to each episode, and the fact that Mike chooses to join his mom in counselling speaks volumes about his desperate desire to mend the bridges and be a son to her.
We may never get to know why Michael was burned, but while he is trying to figure that out he will continue to help others and in doing so, himself.
Get it if you can, and watch out for Season Three.
