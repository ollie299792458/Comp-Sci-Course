o.m.g! this film is absolutely brilliant!__the intensity, the actors, music, directing...
MICHAEL HANEKE's style is a little like a combination of kubrick and gaspar noe.
i honestly don't know if haneke's adaptation is faithful to Elfriede Jelinek's novel "the piano teacher".
however, this film is so intense, so captivating..(and even funny)...
plot:
erika kohut is a middle aged piano teacher of the vienna music conservatory who is still living with her possessif mother.
she appears to be normal.
however, she is a sadomasochrist.She watches porn while sniffing used condoms,cuts herself with razor blades and..well..you get the picture.
she's a sadistic loner. she does not want to be loved,but humiliated and tortured.
Walter, is her admirant student.
he is fascinated and he adores her.
what follows next, is their strange relationship.
in short , Humiliation is part of the menu....
i think this film was rated nc17, but i'm not sure..anyway,do not bring any children with you!!
some scenes are really extreme!..apart from that,on a technical level, this film is perfect.
ISABELLE HUPPERT is not acting in this film, she's living her part.
she is incomparable.
defenitly the best actress of 2002
even the brilliant Naomi watts (of mulholland drive), is no match to huppert.
BENOIT MAGIMEL and annie girardot, are also Really, impressive!!
there are no false notes.
the conclusion of the film is sudden and imprevisible.
(like in every haneke films)
SUGGESTIONS: michael haneke's "CODE UNKNOWN" with juliette binoche._ FUNNY GAMES (made in 1997) _ BENNY'S VIDEO (made in 1992) _ and THE CASTLE (made in 1997).
