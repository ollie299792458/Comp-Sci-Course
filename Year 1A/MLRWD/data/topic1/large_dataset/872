I don't think anyone could have ever faithfully crossed Dune from Novel to movie, unless the movie was over 10 hours long with a budget well over $200  million.  The biggest problem was that this movie was not long and detailed  enough to satisfy the real Dune fans, and too long and detailed for the  mainstream.  Yet this movie did well all things considered.  The acting  and screenplay are true to what I felt the characters would be.  Even  Herbert said he was impressed with the vision of the film.  Kyle  MacLachlan's portayal of Paul Atreides is masterfully performed for someone  of his then young age.  Lynch's strange and alien choices for design only  serve to heighten the film.  His strange yet subtle use of osmotic fluid  visuals to describe hyperspace and omniscience are unearthly and almost  spiritual for those few who understood it. (While everyone was just trying  to figure out what was happening).  I only wished this movie showed the  entire novel, focusing even more on the convoluted details, mysteries,  religions and cultures (which would've wierded out the mainstream audience  even more than the original film did!)  If you're a hardcore Dune fan,  you might be turned off by the relatively short length (over 2 hours), but  consider that this movie was made trying to at least break even to the  mainstream audience..which was required to pay for its budget.  If  you're looking for a thought provoking, complex and almost spiritual  film..this is it.  If you're looking a fun, shoot em up sci fi you'll be  very dissapointed.
