Another example of director Zhang Yi Mou's style to film the world from the woman's perspective, even though the narrator is a man. Enough to make a grown man cry like a baby - well, may be not, but quite touching, and definitely enough to make some women cry. Note: half of the women in the theatre were untouched by the movie when they got out, which can also explain why true love is so hard to find but so easy to buy these days... and why men, like me, is always unsuccessful when asking to date beautiful stars like Zhang Zi Yi. A love story took place in a small village during the Cultural Revolution. The narrator's mother, Zhang, is the village beauty, and fell in love on first sight with the new teacher in town, the narrator's father, in a time when the term "free love" was not even coined, a time of arranged marriage. A simple plot, but it is the proving ground of the director's masterful skills. The film itself is a piece of artwork. You can almost smell the atmostphere of the simplicity of rural life. In reality, I bet it would be hard to find a girl that looks like Zhang in such a village, but her appearance still matches the settings, and quite well too. Also the filming is perfect. If you can take snapshots of the scenaries shown, you can easily win prizes in photography contest.  The backgroud music is not exceptional, but also matches the settings.
