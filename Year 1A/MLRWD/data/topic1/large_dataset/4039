The film tells the story of LK from a perspective totally different from what reading architectural books about him can get. Books and photos about him and his buildings could never convey the same feeling the movie aroused. It is the director's personal journey, yet it has gone beyond a melodramatic story of search, healing and reconciliation of a complicated family (though i also appreciate that very much)to the bigger picture of the spiritual connectiveness his work has incurred amongst family members, colleagues, and those gifted with his buildings .

This is so much in line with LK's thinking and design..the timelessness of the human spirit communicating. Kahn should be happy knowing how his work has influenced and inspired so many people in various ways.

The film does not deify kahn. People could also misunderstand him and his buildings.. how sad one could be seeing the dilapidated state of the jewish bathhouse.

You feel connected to him after watching the film. Everyone loving his work should try to watch it.
