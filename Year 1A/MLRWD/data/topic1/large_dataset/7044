After owning the original for a couple of years and enjoying it after repeated viewings, I decided to take the plunge into the superbit version of this and another title to see if there were any differences.  Certainly, I found the soundtrack to this movie to be somewhat bright in the original version and was interested in hearing the DTS version.  I have found on reference class equipment that the DTS versions of every film I have viewed have outclassed the Dolby Digital version, without fail.  Again, this version did not dissapoint, in the least.
Visually, this is simply stunning on reference equipment.  Although the original had outstanding clarity and color, the superbit is ahead by a mile.  There is a reduction in video grain removing yet another veil between the viewer and the film.  Quite simply - it is pure in its ability to bring the viewer into the film.  One is drawn into the film and the experience can be incredibly enjoyable.  Color is richer, purer, cleaner than the original.  Scenes in NY where Korben Dallas is flying his taxi are amazing in their depth perspective and clarity.  All new lines of vehicles flying all over the screen were visible that in the original were blurred into obscurity.
The audio DTS track is far warmer than the original and tighter.  Better transition between channels exists, as well.  In all, I was able to turn up the film to a higher level than on the original enjoying the dynamic capabilities far more.  Bass is more extended and much tighter than before.  The top end is more integrated and far less "glassy" than the original D/D version, as well.  Mids are pure and smooth.  Vocals are much more delineated.  Lee-Loo's bright orange hair is much cleaner and the color more saturated, yet no bleeding of color exists.
In all, it eclipses the original and if you don't own the original, I highly recommend this.  It is definitely reference class.
