One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Another hard-to-please family member who saw it remarked, "I haven't laughed this much since 'Some Like It Hot.'"  This movie is about Toula (Nia Vardolos), a completely Americanized girl from a very traditional Greek family, who finally finds the guy of her dreams,  Ian (John Corbett from Sex and The City).  Ian is the only child of  straight-laced country clubby waspy parents (much to the loudly-expressed dismay of Toula's family). Ian and his family are completely unprepared for the large, boisterous and opinionated clan they're about to join through matrimony.  The planning surrounding the wedding is mesmerizing and hilarious as cultures and future in-laws clash.  The fun is always good natured and the laughs are all big.  Another part of the movie's appeal is watching Toula blossom from a plain Jane dutiful daughter (destined, the family assumed, to old maidhood at the ripe old age of 30) into a sparkling woman who knows what she wants. Based on Vardolos' one woman show and produced by Tom Hanks.  Apparently the show struck a special chord with Hanks who experienced something similar when he married Rita Wilson who also hails from a traditional Greek background.  About as perfect as a movie can be.  No need to be Greek to enjoy it immensely.
