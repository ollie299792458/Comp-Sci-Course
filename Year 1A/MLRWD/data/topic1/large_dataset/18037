I read Green Lantern back in the 1960s, and on and off since - especially since libraries started carrying `graphic novels'. As far as I am concerned, the film is an acceptable adaptation of the comic - especially considering the changes to continuity that DC has imposed over the decades. The basic origin was a faithful copy, and the fact that `without fear' has been upgraded to 'able to face his fears and overcome them' is merely upgrading what was a simple children's story to a more acceptable adolescent level, and gave us a meaningful plot.  The alien characters and planets looked alien thanks to the motion capture and CGI; the story held together reasonably well; this is a Hollywood film, after all. What more could you expect? It may not be dark Knight or Iron Man, but it is a first rate second rate film, and streets ahead of the Fantastic Four or the first Hulk film, at least to me.

(Query - did they buy-in the Galactus effects from the Fantastic Four to reuse for Paralax?)
