If you're in a safe place, you know you are being traced and you don't want to get caught...why in the world would you pick up the phone to call your uncle to tell him you're not dead? Why?

If you're the bad guy and you are in train station line with your victim (Taylor), why not follow the victim to their cabin to get what you want?

If you're the bad guy and can tap into any computer, video surveillance camera or electronic device...why in the world can't you tap into a cell phone to get the code that you need?

Other questions...Why isn't there any blood on the shoot victims? Why was there a tear come out of Taylor's eye but have not emotion on his face? Why was the movie called abduction? Who was abducted? Was the cell phone the abducted? How did Taylor remember the name of the apartment address and the people he was supposed to be on his side, without writing them down?

I believe one of the Amazon reviewer summed this movie up for me...
"Me and my 14 year old daughter watch this movie, and she absolutely loved it! I felt that at the beginning when I saw a little too much drinking and that it was over the line. But by the end, not too much violence, cussing, nudity or sex! So this movie was great!"
So if your a 14 year old girl and do not like violence, cussing, nudity or sex...this movie is for you!
