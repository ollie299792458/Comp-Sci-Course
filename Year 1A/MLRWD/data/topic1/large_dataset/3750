This film may have gone a long way to typecasting George Cukor as a "women's" director.  The description was patently unfair because George Cukor was simply a great director, period. Such films as Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, A Double Life, Gaslight, and his uncredited work on Gone With the Wind clearly establish that he was one of Hollywood's great directors and not just a women's director.

The Women, which has long been a camp classic and fodder for many spoofs is a star-studded hoot. This is due in large part to the wonderful performances of Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer (it is a shame that this Queen of MGM is not remembered well), Joan Crawford, Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and the hysterically delicious Mary Boland.  The scene where Rosalind Russell and Phyllis Povah go to spy on Joan Crawford in the department store is high point as well as Mary Boland as the Countess DeLave decribing how she hates the mountains. Frankly anything Mary Boland did was wonderful (check out Pride and Prejudice).  The performances of Joan Fontaine and Virginia Weidler (Little Mary Haines) seem dated now, however they fit wonderfully into the film.

The Women is a rarity because it is one of the only Hollywood films made where the cast is entirely women and there is no man to be seen.  This is a must see for anyone who wants to see what Hollywood films once were.  It will also make you wonder how in the hell they are going to pull of that rumored remake with Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan.
