Yoga Beauty Body is one of my favourite Ana and Ravi Dvds.

The Dvd is filmed on a pure white set and the sound production is lovely.

The Class begins with a Tune in via a mantra and then moves into a warm up section, I really enjoy the warm up section as I feel that it prepares body and mind for what comes next. Then there is the kundalini yoga sets which are energising yet calming and include the 'magnificent 7' postures which are said to be beneficial for women and are good to do often, these include shoulderstand, plough, camel and stretch pose. I feel encouraged throughout with Ravi's commentary and if I open my eyes at any time I am inspired by Ana who demonstrates to the postures beautifully. There is a lovely 'Sa Ta Na Ma'meditation lying down on your front and then a final Tune out with a mantra. I feel so blissful and happy when I have worked with this DVD and have had comments that I look 'Radient'.

Ana and Ravi give good, clear instruction, information and demonstration throughout and there is encouragement from Ravi to keep you going.

I work within my limits on any given day.

I had practiced hatha yoga for approx one year prior to discovering Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini Yoga is now my main practice.
