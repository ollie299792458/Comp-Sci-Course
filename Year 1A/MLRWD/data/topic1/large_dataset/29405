As the BBC exhibited with The Doctor Who series, sub par special effects can be overcome with well written stories.  The Five Doctors is no exception.  The idea of bringing all five doctors together in a single episode was certainly a well-conceived one.  Other than the noticably short appearance of the fourth doctor, Tom Baker, I was impressed with this episode.  The story begins quickly and continues up until the climactic end.  What makes this episode special is that all versions of the doctor, both present and past, must combine forces in order to overcome the evil which is plaguing them.  It even appears as though the Doctor must employ the assistance of his "best enemy" in order to win.  Having lived in England for nine years, I grew up having watched a lot of Doctor Who.  This is certainly my favorite science fiction show.  The fact that the BBC never invested much money in special effects helped to prove one fundamental fact;  Good writing makes good shows.  This is never more true than with The Five Doctors, one of the better episodes.
