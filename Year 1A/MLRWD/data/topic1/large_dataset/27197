I'm a fan of Tyler Perry but until I saw this movie, I really thought his talent was limited to one genre. I had him pegged as a master playwright of gospodrama, as I call it, and a producer of dramas with a heavy emphasis on outrageous comedy. He came close to a serious drama with Why Did I Get Married, but I must admit that it wasn't a favorite of mine. I was also disappointed with Daddy's Little Girls, as I thought it was overdramatized and almost comical at parts that weren't intended to be comedic. So I went into this movie expecting more of the same - in fact, I didn't even bother to go see it in the theatre. Boy was I wrong!! From the cast to the plot, this movie was amazing.

Alice Pratt and Charlotte Cartwright are an unlikely pair that have been friends for over 30 years, when their lives become intertwined by their children's extramarital affairs. What follows is a tale of love, marriage, betrayal and family. There is drama, comedy, romance and even a little action. Kathy Bates' performance was absolutely wonderful, and Sanaa Lathan was great as a villain. Alfre Woodard was also on point, as always. The writing was great as well, my favorite line by far was from Kathy Bates, "You are a woman scorned, without a prenup - make your demands!" Too funny!!

This is nothing like Perry's other films. It takes him to a whole new level in my opinion. This is a movie that I can watch again and again. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
