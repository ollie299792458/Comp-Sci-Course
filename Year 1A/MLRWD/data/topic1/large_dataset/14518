Debra Messing (Kat) hires Dermot Mulroney (Nick) to escort her home to England for her younger half-sisters wedding of which her ex-fiance just happens to be the best man.  The antagonists are her half-sister Amy and her ex Jeffrey.  They of course do terrible things to Kat but for some reason we don't explore 1, how evil, hateful and manipulative Amy is  2, we don't get to see them receive the comeuppance they so richly deserve.  I was really let down because of it.

Although I love these two actors separately, together they have absolutely no chemistry.  Their performances were woody at best.  I felt Dermot phoned it in, and not with a regular phone, but with one of those tin cans and string jobs.  He seemed so uncomfortable in this role.  There is 1 really great redeeming part to this film and it's his backside...of which we get to see and that nice chest of his....yum.  Debra did a great job, there is one scene when she finds out why her ex left her at the alter and she did a bang-up job at it.

I had such great hopes for this movie.  Being a lover of the romantic comedy there is much I will allow when it comes to probability and plotline.  Unfortunately this movie had no flow or acceptable believability.  I'm still trying to figure out when they fell in love, how and why.

If you are looking for a movie that does not require thought, one that is a total escape from reality and reason this one is an o.k. choice.  Just don't expect too much and you should have an good time.
