My wife and I watched "The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry" this afternoon. What we witnessed was an unforgettable story of a seventy five year old man Jonathan Sperry, who takes three adolescent boys under his wing and encourages them to commit their lives to a closer walk with Jesus Christ. Dustin, Mark and Albert are three friends in the summer of 1970, who are struggling with straddling that fine line between childhood and adulthood known as adolescence. Dustin, in particular, is feeling an attraction toward a pretty classmate, Tanya, while trying to stay out of the way of Nick, a bully, who delights in tormenting those he perceives are weaker and don't fight back.While mowing a neighbor's lawn, Dustin catches the eye of Jonathan Sperry, a widower, who invites Dustin at first to mow his lawn and then invites the three friends over for a Bible study.  With simple life-changing biblical wisdom, Jonathan inspires the boys to apply the lessons of Jesus to their daily lives even to the point of interceding for their worst enemy, Nick.
  This film conveys the beauty of Christian commitment in a simple, practical fashion. There is no droning intellectualism or self righteous condemnation. This movie is genuine in that Jonathan wants each boy to give their lives to Jesus and make a difference in someone's lives by their witness.Jonathan is a true mentor whose delight is expressed in the seeds of faith which he plants, waters and watches grow. Gavin Macleod is priceless as the venerable wise senior who dispenses faith as readily as homemade lemonade. Robert Guillaume is great as the crusty neighbor who is at first suspicious of peoples motives until his life changes.It is a joy to see each child grow in grace under the tutelage of a man, who loves unconditionally despite hardship and loss.It is a pleasure to see a movie which respects the Lord  and is unashamed to give Him rightful glory. I would recommend this movie highly for the whole family to see.
