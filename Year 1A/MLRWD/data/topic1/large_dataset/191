Love Hina a piece of animation genious with likeable characters and a good plot to keep you watching.

When i bought the first Love Hina dvd i watched it over and over until the second one came.  I kid you not, i watched that thing at least a hundred times.

The series starts out by introducing all of the characters and MOST of the delimas.  Keitaro Urashima is somewhat of a downer, and you have to wonder how the girls put up with him dispite the constant run ins with them in their towels, this is, if he doesn't have his head in Naru's chest.  He is an extremely un-lucky guy!

The first dvd gets right into things and you will immediately find yourself rooting for Keitaro to find that little girl.  The quality of the animation is top notch for a digital anime.  Nothing is comprimesed right down to the very addicting soundtrack!

I would rate this dvd appropriate only for kids over thirteen and NO, that doesn't include thirteen year olds.  There are numerous rather tame incounters with girls in their towels, and constant run ins (literally) with Keitaro and Naru.  I dont think i would call all the punching and kicking violence because there is never anything at even looks realistic in terms of fighting.  Its mostly the girls beating on Keitaro i mean he did just become manager of an all girls dorm!  There are on or two swear words to look out for as well.

Dont get me wrong i LOVE this series, and especially this installment, im just trying to play devils advocate for the parents out there.  Remember christmas is coming!
