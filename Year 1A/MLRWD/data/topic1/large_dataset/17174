This Mystery Train Neo-Noir Zone film feels like a Teleplay Production from the 50's; so people will see it as a cable flick. It's not that. Cable wouldn't want this piece of un-marketable tripe when they're filled with top "entertainment"?! Not ready for Sly-Fi Channel and it feels so good. Reality based, the story may pass to the supernatural as well as suspense , gore, mystery and it's a Christmas period chiller.
Most panned this film and I see what they hate; but I also see what was meant to entertain. The story is lumpy but filled with more genres than a multiplex. Digital effects as well as blood-lite gore may be bone to pick; but it was all smooth for me. The style, soundtrack, story, setting, the campy allusions and story work the modest budget. Danny, Steve and Leelee are hot
Bottom line: I will watch this many times for mood and fun.
BD is 1080p, the box says i. Sound cuts well and the picture looks fine but the only reference is to old films...as if,....they were made now.
