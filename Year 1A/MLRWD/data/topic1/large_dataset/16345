The mix and remix of sound for this DVD is so bad I suggest you turn on the subtitles so you can follow the dialog more easily.  Excellent male actors are given little or nothing to do.  Given these faults and the lack of any real movement in the characters, there is a lot that is excellent.  There is close observation of details in how we talk to each other, much of which is very funny.  Catherine Keener once again shows how excellent an actor she is, inhabiting her character so completely and naturally she saves the movie.  Her examples of "fake" and real smiles are terrific to watch, as is her panic being at a party where she is a nobody.  In a way this movie is part insider "Hollywood " joke and part essay on female insecurities.

The director has inserted a subplot about an adopted sister that is good by itself but not really needed as part of the flow and it detracts from the overall effect.

Rent it for Keener, otherwise as an example of a project that did not quite make it.. And also as an example of how important sound is to get right.
