When I saw James Nesbit on the front of the Radio Times in a crazed almost Jack Nicholson 'Heeeres Johhnny' pose, I couldn't help thinking this had to be some kind of joke, James Nesbit playing a role as complex and serious as this?, this wasn't 'Cold Feet', but after watching every week, and now currently half way through the series, I have to say I'm impressed, he's been able to put something into the role I didn't think was in him, his dark side has to be said is actually pretty sick and incredibly violent, the fact that he is more powerful and faster than a normal man, with a sadistic nature the like I've never seen on a television programme before, is really a little disturbing, and this makes it all the better, tales of this nature have to capture that.

This isn't just some mad Doctor dabbling with potions tale, so far it is complex and intriguing, and we still don't know the full story with him, I get a distinct impression this is gearing up to go for a 2nd series or perhaps even more.

You might know the writer Steven Moffat for his previous work, the comedy; 'Coupling' and also the gorgeous Gina Bellman from the same show.
Jeykll is the best TV show I've seen since Prison Break ended, and to be honest I look forward to it every week, and and that's saying something, because with the stuff on tv these days I don't get enthusiastic very often.
