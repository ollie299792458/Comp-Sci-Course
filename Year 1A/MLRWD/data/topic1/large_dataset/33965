No, it's not DLR singing, GET OVER IT! This tape has its ups and downs. One thing many reviews mention is the admitidly insipid 80's fashion sense the boys in the band display. Sammy is without a doubt the worst offender, but last I looked, fashion didn't make the music, and the music is great. 
The DLR/Sam wars continue to this day, and I love both eras, but here it's really evident how great Van Hagar was back in 86 and how well they played together. 
Gone are the DLR raps and jokes and "I forgot the F**kin words!" I'm the first to admit that was funny for a while, but I'd rather see it replaced by Sam and Ed trading solos in Sam's solo hit "One Way to Rock". But in an effort to keep the review balanced, Sam does look like he's trying way too hard to be "Dave-Like" in his onstage antics. 
The playing by all four members of the band is phenomenal, and with 5150 being one of their greatest albums, they had a great time playing it (and adding to the material in some cases, like the extended "Summer Nights" and "5150" solos).
The sound, however, is a little on the weak side. Ed's guitar sounds amazing because it's him, but when you compare it to the later "Right Here Right Now", it's thin. Alex's drums are all electric as well, and that sound was horrible from day one. Mike's bass is pretty well buried throughout the concert.
Be that as it may, the band's playing is phenomenal, and I think Sam did as good a job as DLR did on "Panama", but he lacks something when he sings "Ain't Talking Bout Love".
The VH concert set itself is boring to look at and unattractive, and the light show sucks, but who cares, it's Ed playing an extended Eruption solo like on one else. This is a bittersweet reminder of VH back in their Van Hagar glory days (for a glimpse of the DLR glory days, download the 1983 US festival show off the net).
If you're any kind of VH fan or a fan of 80's riff rock, this is a must have for your video library.
