The title of the review says it all.  If you are an Alien fan that is.  I won't go into the specs as those are available elsewhere.  Two of the features that make this set so noteworthy are the extended cut of Alien 3, and the extensive documentaries on all 4 movies.  Although I really enjoyed Alien 3, I still thought it was the weakest of all 4 movies.  Visually, the movie is beautiful, but story wise, it was a very hard movie to get into after two major characters from Aliens get killed off in the opening credits (not spoiling anything), and one is mangled almost beyond repair.  However, having said all that, the new version, even though not approved by David Fincher, is a much better version that the theatrical.  Definitely worth the watch.

The documentaries are hands down excellent!  Alien Ressurection's documentary is probably the weakest of the four, but still good.  Alot of excellent insight into the filmmaking process, the problems behind the camera, the short timelines, the pressures of the execs, Sigourney Weaver's non gun-toting vision of Ripley for Aliens etc... It is fascinating.  The only thing missing was the true nature of Fincher's conflicts with the execs at Fox for Alien 3, which are noticeably removed from the documentary.

A must buy, at a great price at that!
