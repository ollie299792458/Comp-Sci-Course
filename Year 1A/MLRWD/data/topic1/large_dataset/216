I  used to hate western movies. I thought that they were a wast of time. I  first watched the movie "SILVERADO" in my english I thought that that i was going to hate it but i loved it. I was wrong it was an intence movie filled with action. The reason why I liked it so much was becuase it wasn't like many other western it was modern. The movie "SILVERADO" had a good foreshadowing like the part when the settlersshowed the money to the guards you knew that they were going to steal it from them in the trip. What i think makes a western not good is the actors they are always serios. Unlike "SILVERADO"  the actors were serios and funny at the same time. I have three qouts from the movie that i really liked. One of then is "Don't force me to make a adjustment around here."What i think this means is that don't make me do some thing that i don't want to do. the second qout is "Quit your yelling you old coot." This means to stop talking or to stop yelling. The last one is "This used to be a peaceful town."  I think that he is trying to say that everything was good when it was his way and before payton, mal and Raden were in town.Thats why i liked the movie'SILVERADO."
