Seems like George Patton was portrayed, in the movie, as a charismatic, strong willed and an effective leader with a mouth to boot..!! I believe the light shed on him showed that he cared for the men who gave 110% for him and his country yet loathed and despised a man for his apparent weakness to fake injury or show any sign of what he called 'cowardness'.
Unfortunately, men like these are bound to have faults. His were apparent. All to eager to mouth-off to everyone and anyone more often than not got him into trouble. As he said, he's not there to make friends...he's there to fight..!!
It was a good movie showing him as a person and how he 'ticked' and it also showed his understanding of war and how it worked. His apparent "previous life" captured a sense of destiny which is something I haven't seen in a movie before. He forever seemed determined to right the wrongs of the world and was completely convinced that he was the man to do it. His almost obsessive nature on the history of previous wars played a major part, for
his role, in the film.
On the German side there showed some lieutenants of the Fuehrer ( pardon all the spelling ) continuously going over past wars attempting to second guess Patton and kill both the British and Americans. I am intrigued as to whether this is a known fact of for purely 'motion picture' reasons ?
I will admit I didn't think the movie was all that good but I guess it wasn't a movie about war, rather a movie about the character of George Patton and his own battle within a war and how he himself overcame it with the help of his own troops.
Overall, an excellent portrait of George Patton. 4/5 from me.
