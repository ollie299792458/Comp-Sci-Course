I just saw this movie on TV and I came straight here to tell everyone to at least rent it and try it - then come to amazon .com to buy it.
It was  a really well made flick.  It was funny and a little sad and just  wonderful.  Ben Affleck is trying to get to his wedding and everything but  the kitchen sink is being thrown in his way - including Sandra Bullock.  Doubting himself and his upcomming wedding, Ben struggles to get to  Savannah through plane crashes, fires, and hurricanes.  If you liked  "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles", then you'll like this  story.
They really stuck with the title through out the movie -  "Forces of Nature".  When you watch it the second time look for  these forces and note the wonderful camera angles and cinematography during  the weather scenes.  Also note that weather is not the only force out  there.  The scenes weren't dark it was a filter.  The director wanted you  to see it through this sorta blue filter and I don't think it would have  worked as well without it.
Just buy it, ok?  It's so wonderful and  uplifting and... you have to watch all of it!
