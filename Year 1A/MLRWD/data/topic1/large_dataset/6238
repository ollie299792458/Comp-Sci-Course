Best film based on a work of Mamet's that I have seen. This is such a wonderful film. I think Campbell Scott is perfect for his role. All the cast is great. But the real strength of the film(of any Mamet film) is the  story. Plain and simple. The way it flows. The way it builds. David Mamet  knows how to write! (Unlike a lot of screenwriters today.) I can't  emphasize enough just how good the dialogue in this movie is. You just  don't get dialogue like this in movies today.  Short and sweet. To the  point. And the acting is the same way. That's the beauty of a Mamet film.  No over-indulgences. The actors aren't contributing any "strong  emotion" or "powerful performances". That's what could have  ruined an ingenious story like this. But it didn't. Mamet has said before  that some of the best actors were back in the old, classic films. Why?  Because they were paid to do their job. Do what they had to do and nothing  more. The story is what matters in this film. And it's a very good one. It  keeps you hanging on and guessing till the very last sequence. Steve Martin  has never been better. This is his best work, ever. That's right. And  Carter Burwell's score is...  perfect. The man writes brilliant music. I  mean brilliant. There's Fargo, this, and now Being John Malkovich. That's  one hell of a resume. Ben Gazarra's the man. If you want to see a smooth,  intelligent, well-written movie, I very strongly recommend The Spanish  Prisoner. As for these other reviewers who dismiss the film as  "contrived", they obviously don't know what they're talking  about. They're all a bunch of idiots......
