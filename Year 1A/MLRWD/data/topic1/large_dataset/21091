This isn't a great who dunnit, it's not even a very accurate adaptation of the redoubtable Agatha Christie but...it's got everthing to offer and for those who enjoy spending a pleasant few hours with murder, great Cole Porter tunes and as many film stars as you're likely to find, this is it. Peter Ustinove takes over the role of Hercule Poirot, private detective extrodinaire, from Albert Finney ("Murder On The Orient Express") and is more an impersonation than a well acted character but who cares? He's filled with Gallic...sorry, Belgian charm. And what a cast for him to investigate! Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, James Mason, Sylvia Miles, Roddy McDowell, Denis Quilley, and on and on. No one bothered to write a score for this; Why would they when there's Cole Porter around? His ageless tunes wind through this providing everything from a lounge performance to the appropriate musical stings where needed. John Lanchbery has them arranged to be lush, vaguely decadent and very listenable. Clever, if not witty, dialogue, terrific settings, faux thirties costuming that needs this sort of star power to not get in the way and every production value availble make it a happy homicide with the guilty punished, the heroes rewarded and a happy ending for everyone. In short, the sort of film that one suspects the actors had a grand time making. Scenery is chewed, parts are over acted and a good times is had by all. Including the viewer, certainly this one. Alas, it's the sort of spectacle that isn't made today unless CGI effects get the starring role. Even if you've watched it ten times, it's still a comfort to watch just for the fun to be had. In these times you can't have this good a time at the movies even at quadruple the price asked here for the DVD.
