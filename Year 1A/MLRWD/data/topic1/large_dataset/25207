Being There is a lovingly-crafted, slightly overlong and knee-slappingly funny political satire which includes one of the most bizarre 'sex' scenes in movie history. Peter Sellers is a riot as the deadpan Chance Gardener whose endless pontificating on the welfare of plant-life becomes a potent metaphor for 80's politics, granting him national attention thanks to the endorsement of a dying codger and his concupiscent wife. The film is timeless, save one walking montage early on that seems like it was scored by a malfunctioning machine. The action is primarily contained to a cold, ornate mansion, though it does not seem catastrophic, instead casting a wide sense of exposure due to the fact that most plot points revolve around television and its ability to manipulate the truth--if the truth ever even existed to begin with! Much has been made of the film's final shot with its Christ-like implications. For me, the last few frames make the movie--elevating the proceedings to a level not quite broached by all the network-TV nudging and winking when Chance says things like "All Is Well In The Garden" a phrase you might find yourself constantly regurgitating long after the credits have rolled. If you don't mind a slow-boiling storyline and are excited by good old fashioned acting, you will find much to love here. And oh, stick around for a blooper reel (one of the first of its kind) which shows Sellers with his hair down, worth the price of admission alone.
