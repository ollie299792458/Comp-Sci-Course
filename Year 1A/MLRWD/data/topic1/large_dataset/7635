I have been a fan of Adam Sandler for awhile now ... you can always find something to relate to in his movies.  However, his leading women have often left something out of their preformances other then a want to work with Adam ... i kinda feel that changed with this movie.
Adam cast, for once, a women that was more then "her" more then a playmate to crack up in the course of filmmaking ... he also brought in the best preformance of Drew Berrymores carrer ...
Drew brought into this movie more then the star appeal and sexuality that she brings to the 'Charlies Angels' movies.  She brought a beliviable to Lucy that is just unmatched to what so many actresses are capable of.  Very few actresses could have provided the humor and drama she provided while portyaing this chracter.  You feel her heartbreak each time she wakes up, and you understand her frustration as only she can portray (show me any other women in an Adam Sandler film that made you feel what she felt in this movie ... )
Adam Sandler himself was overlooked for his preformance in Punch Drunk Love, and let's not see this a routine in his life as a film maker .. Drew deserves a chance for an Oscar nomination, and at the very least, if she does not recieve the Golden Globe in comedy/musical, i will not have any more belief in the hollywood award system.
