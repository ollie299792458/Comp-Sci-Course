This movie focuses on a single episode in the history of South Africa right after the election of Nelson Mandela as President, namely the rise of their rugby team from constant struggles to winning the World Cup.

Let me start by acknowledging some legitimate criticisms of the movie, many of which have been noted by other reviewers: (a) rather limited sociohistorical context is provided, which is an issue for viewers not already fairly familiar with the history of South Africa, (b) the pacing of the plot is uneven, and there are gaps in the story, so there's often a lack of proper buildup and the links between events aren't always clear, and (c) the portrait of Mandela is rather incomplete, especially with regard to why he seems to be such a saintly leader yet has very strained relationships with his family.

Having noted these negatives, I recommend ignoring them, because the main purpose of this movie is to present a story of racial and cultural reconciliation which is powerfully uplifting and inspiring, and the movie fully succeeds in this regard, in no small part because the acting is top-notch across the board.  There were many moments during this movie when I was deeply moved, to the extent of recalling the unexpectedly strong emotions I experienced the evening Barack Obama was elected our own President.  Perhaps there's some irony that this unification of South Africans was achieved by vanquishing a series of external rivals, but I suppose this is innocent enough when accomplished via sports rather than war (isn't that part of the purpose of international sports events like the Olympics?).

Summing up, the positives of this movie vastly outweigh the negatives, so I highly recommend it.
