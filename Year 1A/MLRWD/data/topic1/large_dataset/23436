As the mother of daughters, I have seen nearly every Barbie movie ever made.  Some are better than others.  This definitely ranked in the top five, perhaps the top three or four, because it was utterly hilarious.  Barbie (Corinne) goes to the city with a letter of introduction to become a Musketeer.  She is brushed off because she's a girl and ends up working as a servant in the palace.  As is typical in Barbie movies, a pretender to the throne is attempting to bump off the heir apparent, in this case a somewhat clueless prince who literally has his head in the clouds and is trying to invent a viable hot air balloon.  Barbie discovers that her fellow servants are also aspiring Musketeers and an elderly female servant, upon discovering their ambition, decides to train them.

It was refreshing to see an older woman sympathetically portrayed in a Barbie movie, and Madame's skills are clearly superior to the young Barbies.  She teaches them lot of fun moves, more consistent with martial arts sensibilities than old world swashbuckling.  This proves utterly hilarious as the 4 Barbies fend off legions of armed men using rapiers, long ribbons, fans, a slingshot, and a perfume mister.  My kids probably couldn't understand why I was laughing so hard.  Ninja Barbies, how cool!

Of course, there are a few annoying and formulaic anthropomorphic animals thrown in.  But as usual, believing in oneself, not giving up, and proving that girls are just as good as boys prevails in this Barbie feature.  Young girls probably cannot get enough of those messages.

The music wasn't half bad either.
