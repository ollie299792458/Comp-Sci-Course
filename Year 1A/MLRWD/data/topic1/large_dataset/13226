First let me say that I am not comparing this to the Magnificent Seven. I have not seen that classic Western. But I have seen this film, Kurosawa's greatest. Most people get initially put off by the 3.5 hour running time. Trust me, you won't even notice. I was glued to the screen for the whole time. It was amazing. After hearing so much about this film and seeing it all come to life. There are so many lessons in this film for everyone, from any background or profession. There are so many emotions and feelings that flow through this film. You can feel the bonds form between the 7 masterless samurai as they defend a lowly village from attack. You see the oldest and most experienced samurai who gives himself a mark of dishonor(he shaves his head bald to look like a monk) in order to save a young child. He becomes the mentor of the youngest samurai in the group. Teamwork abounds among strangers. Love springs forth in the time of war. Courage is tested, lives are lost, and honor is salvaged. The very last scene was just inspiring and will pull on your heartstrings. Don't settle for anything less then the full 3.5 hour version. It is time well spent.
