I have seen many animes in the past, but I have to say that Perfect Blue is probably one of the best Japanese animation films I have ever had the privilege to watch. Certainly, one of the reviewers at the New York Times Daily Review was correct in quoting that if Alfred Hitchock and Walt Disney got together to make a thiller, they would have created Perfect Blue.
  This is a modern film with a modern setting, and the filmmakers have effectively balanced a plausible and realistic background with the surreal images of Mima's delirium. The animation is top notch-fluid, detailed, and very cinematic. There are no cyborgs or magical girls/boys here, folks. Just pure surrealism set in the heart of Tokyo, Japan, amidst the tumultuous pop culture that is part of the real Japan. The blurred transitions between reality, dreams, and the well crafted movie-within-a-movie (also a thriller, inspired by Silence of the Lambs) leave the viewer guessing until the final scene. I kept getting the feeling that the director was a great fan of Jodie Foster's films. Behind all of this resides Mima's character- one which we can empathize with throughout the film. This is a masterfully directed work. 
This anime is definitely a keeper and a great achievement for Japanese animation. I never thought any other anime could come close to Ghost In The Shell, but I guess I was wrong. Buy the DVD, it's definitely worth it.
