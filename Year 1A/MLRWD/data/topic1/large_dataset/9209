I had wanted to see this film forever, the soundtrack was out of this world and everyone said it was amazing. Or everyone I listened to at least. So I finally saw it and had cause to believe them. I didn't want to leave the theatre after it was over, only to sit there and watch them dance and smile and let it all wash over me. We sat there long after everyone had left thinking that if only Sean Patrick Thomas would smile at us our lives would be sorted.
Of course it wasn't just the smile it was everything about the movie. Julia Stiles plays a poigniant ballerina caught up in the midst of loss and confusion while Thomas, the aspiring pediatrician, becomes her saviour. We adored them, wanted them to be real because we had never seen anyone dance like they did. She had grace and beauty and he had style and energy, together they became something we could happily watch and get lost in. 
As they save each other form the worlds that they exist in and the emotions that surround them the movie expands into its social context, is more than just the dancing and the physical energy that seems to crackle between Stiles and Thomas. The soundtrack contributes to everything that the movie becomes and is erratic and interchangeable, it portrays a side of both our doctor and our ballerina. I couldn't not smile when they smiled, or feel I should be dancing when they danced. They made me move and you have to give them credit for sharing their energy with us.
