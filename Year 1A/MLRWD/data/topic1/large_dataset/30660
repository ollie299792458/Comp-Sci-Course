This is a cute little piece of loosely-tied vignettes that give several of today's hot actors the chance to actually ACT (not one car chase, alien abduction or plot to destroy the world in evidence).  We receive insight into the lives and phobias of three sisters (Anderson, Jolie, Stowe) for the few days leading up to their parents' (Connery, Rowlands) anniversary marriage vow renewal.  Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid and Jon Stewart really steal the show as the love interests.  Phillippe and Jolie are believable and sweet as a twenty-something couple with some pretty large issues making the L.A. club scene while Anderson and Stewart are good as thirty-something professionals trying to get through the scar tissue created by past romantic disasters.  Quaid, however gives the best performance when he sets out to prove to himself that he's not the boring, unimaginative husband Stowe thinks him to be.  Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn also shine in a wonderfully poignant subplot involving a mother-son relationship.  It was especially nice to see Mohr in a softer role - I recall all of his previous characters as selfish, crude S.O.B.s.  This movie reminds me of the days before special effects where the story was the star.
