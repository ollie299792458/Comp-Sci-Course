No question about it, this season was worth buying and enjoying over and over again. One complaint though, is that during some of the dvd commentary, the speakers apologize, "we should be doing more commentary as this is the dvd commentary, but we haven't seen this episode in a while and we are just enjoying some of it all over again."

Or another comment, "well, it's been two years since we wrote this season..." because they couldn't remember their process or their thoughts during the scene.

Well, I would ask, why not WATCH it before showing up to do the dvd commentary? Why not refresh your memory before the tape is running so that you don't look like a buffoon who accidentally happened to produce genious work?! I may be asking too much, but could these people just prepare a tiny bit before blathering on for an entire episode? I found it unbearable, and wish they wouldn't even bother offering the commentary track if it's going to be so painfully lame.

Buy the season because you need your West Wing fix. Buy it because your a democrat in a republican world. Buy it because it makes it feel better to be in this country with the current leadership, but don't waste your time on the commentary track!
