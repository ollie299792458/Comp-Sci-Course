I've been a fan of these types of flicks since the 1950's and was excited to see this one had:  beautiful oracles, sword fights, sorcery, bad guys with scars, gods, titans, monsters and more! Amazingly, somehow it was boring.  When it was over I wondered "What was that about?"  One (half) star because the actors worked hard though the hero has little or no screen presence, which may be the source of the boredom.  Henry Cavill is certainly no Gerard Butler!  One star because of the sets/effects.  But where "300" was rousing and heroic, this was just flat.  Climatic speech by the hero near the top of the wall was trite.  Don't know what Zeus was doing at the end, especially with the "BIG" scene.  Don't know which god he killed for helping the mortals.  Don't know who was fighting in the sky during the son's vision, which was essentially a cheap and quick way to get out of the poorly written script.  And then there was Micky Rourke, current Hollywood favorite and a Johnny-one-note where he once had range as an actor.  He spent a good part of the time walking around with a lobster claw helmet, which I thought was the funniest head gear I've ever seen, including the candelabras worn by temple priests here and the weather vanes/TV antennas sported by many of the gods.  So if you're in the mood for this type of movie, re-watch The 300.  If you opt for this, enjoy the headwear, but be prepared for the "There went two hours of my life I won't get back again" feeling.
