Ask any "child of the 80's" and they'll give you the usual list of classic "teen films" -  Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc...  But there's a good chance they'll fail to mention one that really stands out: Three O'Clock High.  It takes place over the course of a single school day.  Jerry Mitchell (Casey Siemaszko) is a nerdy, wimpy kid assigned to tackle a frightening assignemnt: write  a school newspaper story on an incorrigible badass bully names Buddy Revell  (Richard Tyson).  Not knowing Buddy's temperamental nature, and inability to forgive a grudge, he gets Buddy upset enough to make him set up a fight after school.  At three o'clock, natch. Jerry spends the day trying to avoid the confrontation with Buddy, and everything he tries simply gets him in trouble with school authorities, and with Buddy himself.  And the moment of truth draws  closer... Three O'Clock High is basically High Noon in high school, but it's done in such a fresh and interesting way.  The cinematography is spare and clean, with some deft camera moves.  The dialogue is pretty crisp, and occasionally hits the mark dead-on. It's surreal, but any recent ex-high schooler will easily recognize the "types" depicted here.  END
