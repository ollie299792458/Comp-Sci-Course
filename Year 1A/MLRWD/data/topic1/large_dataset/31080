By now, ArtsyFartsy News subscribers know I enjoy nonfiction, especially when it comes to artists' biographies, the history of painting, color, artists' materials, etc. And - I like movies! Put this all together and get it all from The Medici - Godfathers of the Renaissance. It is a four hour docudrama that is both educational AND entertaining.
This beautifully photographed history lesson and biography chronologically unfolds, starting with fifteenth century Florence (I want to live there!).

The Medici family, using their charm, patronage, enormous wealth and eventually, their power initiated the start of the Renaissance. You know - like Michelangelo, Botticelli, da Vinci, Galileo and many others. The back story is equally fascinating as well. By sheer power, the Medici family was able to "produce" two popes, bankrupt the papacy and use money to "purchase redemption." The Medicis held court for over two hundred years. There's a lot of art history: David, the Pieta, Medici tombs, The Sistine Chapel frescoes plus more "inside stuff" to further your appreciation of how we still revere this art today.

This richly photographed and acted spectacle will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates history and art. Excellent gift for yourself as well!
