In making a film about the effects of guilt and betrayal both real and imagined, Sergio Leone also made a film about the numbing poignancy of the passage of time. Towards the close of the film the sense of waste that  infuses De Niro is so great that he can't even be angry, just crushed by  heartbreaking sadness. The film is long, the plot is complex, and some  elements of the story are rearranged into an emotional vs. a straight  narrative order, but the overall effect is extraordinarily efficient; had  the story been told without Leone's skillful time transitions and careful  narrative choices, this could have been a very plodding six or eight hour  movie. Plus, what a marvelous cast -- even the characters on the fringes of  the film cry out to be explored (look at how much strange and painful  emotional power Tuesday Weld manages to fit into her few key scenes). My  only problems with the film are minor technical gaffs (the use of cold  cream to try to unsucessfully age an obviously still very young Elizabeth  McGovern, etc.), otherwise, this is simply a wonderful, powerful movie. The  senses and emotions of the film will linger much longer than the story.
