I just saw this again (3rd or 4th time) after finding it on HBO. I once owned the videotape until I upgraded.

David Strathairn as Joe Gastineau is laconic, stoic, but still emotional. His character truly comes alive as a  man you can understand. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Donna De Angelo captures the essence of her aging-bar-crooning character and the interaction between her, her teen daughter Noelle (deftly played by Vanessa Martinez), and Gastineau was developed to draw your interest. Throw in a few twists and one of the best endings and you have a treat for people who appreciate dramatic, character driven works. But if you seek a formulaic, cookie-cutter flick, go elsewhere.

Also, anyone who has visited Southeast Alaska will recognize and appreciate the scenic vistas providing the backdrop. I grew up in Juneau and recognized many shots. One can see similar work in Insomnia (2002 with Al Pacino Robin Williams) and Into the Wild (2007 with Emile Hirsch), but this film has a superior story.

In closing, as my friend KLMVP would say, any song that ends with Bruce Springsteen's "Lift Me Up" is a great movie.
