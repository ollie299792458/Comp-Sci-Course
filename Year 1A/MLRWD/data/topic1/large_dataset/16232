A fabulously brilliant comedy about a mad cross-country rush to recover some buried money. At the beginning of the film, some people encounter a guy out in the desert who crashed his car - he tells them the secret about where he buried some money years and years ago.

As the plot goes on, more and more people find out the secret and join the chase to get to the money first. Everybody who was anybody in the sixties is in this film (Spenser Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Phil Silvers, Eddie "Rochester" Anderson, Jim Backus, Peter Falk, Don Knotts, Carl Reiner, Jimmy Durante, ZaSu Pitts, Jack Benny, and about 20 others).

It is indeed a car film - the chase to the spot where the money is buried involves a huge multi-state race (not dissimilar to some of our road trips to various out of state racetracks!) involving many different cars, trucks, and even an airplane (a drunken rich-guy Jim Backus is the pilot, and Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett are the half-wits who hired him thinking they'd get to the money that much faster- and of course they end up having to land the plane themselves and loosing all their time advantage).

Many memorable scenes - how about Dick Shawn as the spoiled bachelor playboy son of Ethel Merman (who plays a really big-mouthed tough domineering woman), who when called by his Mother to rescue her races cross-country in his Dodge convertible shouting "Mommy" (leaving his bikini-clad girlfriend behind)!
