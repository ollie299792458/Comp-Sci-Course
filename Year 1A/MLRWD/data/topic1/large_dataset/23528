This superbly acted drama about an extraterrestrial named Prot, grabbed my attention from beginning to end. Kevin Spacey is rapidly becoming one of our very finest actors. The depth of his performance in this film deserved an Academy Award nomination. Jeff Bridges, as the psychiatrist in charge of Prot, gives another solid performance. This movie works on many levels. Prot claims to have come on a beam of light to earth, and he leaves in the same manner. Like the character in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', Prot's consciousness comes in over that of Robert Porter, who is a catatonic. While on earth, Prot solves the perturbations in the orbit of the binary star of K-PAX, disappears for 3 days from a secure facility, and generally displays knowledge that no one on earth could possess. Yet no one will believe Prot is not from earth, despite all of the evidence. This is typical of the human mindset, which disavows anything that is not 'common knowledge'.
At the end of the movie, Porter (Spacey) is in a wheelchair, and Bridges smiles and tells him 'if you are willing to talk, I am always waiting.' The subtle, poignant smile that appears on Spacey's face is masterful, and is in microcosm a portrait of the human experience. It is worth seeing the entire movie just for that last scene. It brought a tear to my eye, I can tell you.
This is a wonderful movie with great depth, wonderfully acted, and it reminds us that there is a big, wide universe out there which we have not even begun to explore.
