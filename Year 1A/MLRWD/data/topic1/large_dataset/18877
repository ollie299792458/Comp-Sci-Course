My wife and I always watch my daughters movies with her so we will know what she is watching.  And over the years we have enjoyed most of the VT movies.  The previous parodies have been cute, creative and both generations could enjoy certain aspects of them.

The Lord of the Beans was a 100% knock of Tolkien.  Which would be fine, except that they chained themselves to a 9 hour movie and tried to parody it into a 45 minute cartoon.  The story went nowhere and stayed there for a painfully long time.

My daughter did not understand the movie, the jokes, or the point of the video.  Heck, I am not sure I could tell you the point of this stupid video either.  My wife got up and left and I started daydreaming around the Silly Song with Larry and never recovered.  My daughter finished the movie and it went to the bottom of the stack to be ignored ever since, while other videos have been watched over and over.  Which is a shame, since classic songs like "Oh no, what we gonna do" were sung over and over in our house when Big Idea actually produced stuff worth watching.

The graphics and art work are great.  Big Idea has come a long way over the years.  Too bad they have no creative juices left over for the actual story.

This video is still harmless and cute enough, but I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone.  I fail to find anything even remotely religious or God centered in it. Big Idea has drifted over into the category of Donald Duck and other harmless and pointless vidoes in our house.  Too bad.
