This story presents the life of Red Nichols in a truly unique and entertaining way typical of many of the period's better films. However this film rises far above them all by entertaining you from the beginning till the end. Danny Kaye plays Red Nichols a talented and driven cornet player who begins his career with the Will Paradise's band but feeling trap and unable to play his own style of jazz branches out forming his own band The Five Pennies.

Together with his band and his singer/wife Bobbie played by a young Barbara Bel Geddes of "Dallas" fame cris-cross the country entertaining local dance and jazz fans. They continue their touring even after the birth of their daughter Dorothy who is played superbly by both Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld. When Red's wife Bobbie believes the traveling from town to town and the night club lifestyle becomes too much for their daughter they send her off for a more normal life at boarding school. After a crisis involving Dorothy brings the family together again and it is determined continuous care for her would be needed they soon see the importance of sacrifice and what is really important in life. But they also find it's never too late to pick up a cornet again.

The sound track for this film is also amazing. Performances by the one and only Louis Armstrong both acting and musically were great and to see Danny Kaye and him together is on it's own worth seeing this film. The film brings together a great story, great acting, and great music to make a really amazing 117 minutes.
