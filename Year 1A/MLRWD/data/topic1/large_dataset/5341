For all fans of Lord of the Rings and Veggies tales, this is a true delight to watch. All though lord of the Beans does not measure up to Peter Jackson's epic in either screen time or quality, it is still a light hearted, abtly amusing journey through "Center earth".

  In the story, Toto Baggypants (Junior) has inherited a mysterious bean that can grant him all kinds wishes (though not everything), but he isn't sure what to do with it. With the help of his friend Randalf and a couple other companions, he sets out to find what it means to share your gifts with others.

  In Lord of the Beans, all our favorite veggie characters return with classic spoof names such as "Ear-a-corn:", "Leg-a-lamb", even "Scaryman." However, the "Sporks" (orcs) were my favorite, espcially after a friend told me of how she and her brother and sister used to have "Spork" wars at Taco Bell.

  If you have time, be sure to visit the commentary. It runs about twelve minutes long and is just as funny as the movie, because basically we have all the actors sitting around and using their movie voices, pretending they had really filmed the thing live (a great deal of it in BOb's backyard!).

  Overall, one of the better things to come from Veggie Tales in a while. Excellent for children 5-10 and even some adults and teens too!
