"The Muppet Movie" remains one of my favorite films of all time, and I'm 23-years-old.  No, this is not an attempt to be "so retro, I'm hip".  I genuinely love this movie.  It is simply a fantastic adventure that the whole family can enjoy.  Yes, even the adults.  There is plenty of sly mature humor to entertain the parents, not to mention the fact that for most of us older folk we can still vividly remember watching Sesame Street and The Muppet Show back in the 70s and 80s.  For us, it's a pleasant walk down memory lane.  For the new generation, it gives kids the chance to discover the magic of Jim Henson that they're so sorely missing.  They just don't make family films like this anymore.  The only films in the past few years that come close are the "Babe" and "Toy Story" movies.  Sadly, none of the recent movies featuring the Muppets ever quite captured the magic of this first film.  "Christmas Carol", "Treasure Island" and "Muppets in Space", as well as "Elmo in Grouchland" were all pretty good as far as kids films go, but you could definitely tell that they suffered as a result of Jim Henson's absence.
See "The Muppet Movie" with someone you love.  Relish this timeless tale about following one's dreams.  It's an experience you will want to treasure forever, and share with everyone you care about.
