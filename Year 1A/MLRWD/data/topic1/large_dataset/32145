This is one of my favorite all time movies!!!! I am so glad it was refered to me, I never heard about it at the movies.This woman is like so many of us BUT she finally Does her thing!. Against the family's desires. They are quite happy , to have Shirley stay as a mother of young children  and a long over looked wife,  never to leave it.She feels silly and even a bit guilty running off seeking her own joy. She knows herself and her desires so any surprise doesn't make her wavier. She reminds us  to balance,Laugh and to go for it. Everyone gets used to a character role one might have over played but deep down inside is that spirit waiting to take a deeper breath.I will run off to Paris!Laugh and drink wine and who knows this ending? How about you?Remember ,we would be teaching ;a person does NOT curl up and dye at middle age. Instead it might just be the time that they honor their inner spirit.Take a little or longer adventure to become some of that person they might have lost for awhile.So this movie is about rediscovery.I KNOW YOU WILL ENJOY IT!
