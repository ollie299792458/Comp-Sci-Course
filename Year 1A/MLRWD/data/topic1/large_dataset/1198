With the price of the entires series, don't bother to purchase each year separately--purchase the complete series. These two female, mostly horticulturists, but always involved in some murder mystery, characters always have a new beautiful garden to restore. The scenery in the series is excellent, and the plot always migrates from garden restoration to a mystery that must be solved.

Even though the 2 sleuths are not young bucks, they are entertaining and engaging. This isn't just a series for your grandmother to watch, the younger crowd will find it entertaining as well. Definately clean family fun so if you do give the set to your grandmother to watch, she won't be offended!

Compared to American TV, the British series seem to have characters that are "real." Their decisions, lives, and daily dilemmas have substance and are believable. Such is true with this series. The plots are fresh and have some unexpected twists to them.

I wish this series had run for many more years! If you enjoy female sleuths, also check out the Hetty Wainthropp series. I found Rosemary and Thyme's plots slightly more entertaining than the Wainthropp series, but both collections are excellent!
