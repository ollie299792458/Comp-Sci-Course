My roommate bought this movie. That is the only reason I watched it. That, and Kate Hudson. I think that she is too adorable. I was a little disappointed that she chose a project like this, but I thought, "Maybe she could improve it?" A little bit.
Andi Anderson is a journalist for a womans magazine that focuses mostly on "Cosmopolitan" type issues. Fat, fit, fun, fabulous.. basically cheesy. She wants to write more serious issues, like politics, poverty, etc. Currently, she writes a monthly article called "How to..." Her friend has been broken up with. She made all of the mistakes you make in a relationship that has been going on for a week. Andi decides to save her friends butt and herself, and write "How to lose a guy in 10 days," at her bosses request. 
Ben is an advertising exec, who is cool and cocky. He wants this assignment for diamonds, big client. He somehow lets out that he can make any woman fall in love with him. Somehow, his boss and the supermodels he works with come up with a bet that will set him out to make "any" girl (Kate Hudson) fall in love with him, in 10 days. They will find out the results at the "diamond" party. Can he do it? Can she make him leave? The results, at least, started out to be interesting.
She goes about, making all of the mistakes women make to chase men away. I have to admit, this was the best part of the movie.
These are some tricks she tries:
*Making him go for soda the last few minutes of a Knicks game.
*Telling him that she doesn't eat meat after he has made lamb and making him go to a vegetarian place and eat barley and tofu.
*Bringing pink objects to decorate his place and stuffed animals to live on his couch and bed.
*Acting like a happy lovey puppy all of the time, then crying the next minute for no reason.
You get the idea. Good concept, but could have been carried through a little bit better. 
Anyway, the end turns out to be predictable and formulaic, but I did get something from it. I'm sure there will come a time where Kate Hudson can't help the movie by acting adorable. She did help it enough to keep me there, but not enough to keep me from making fun of it. See her as Penny Lane in Almost Famous. That was the best!
