PFT!!!  HISS!!!
Whatta CAT FIGHT!!!
I've loved this film for years -- perhaps more every time I see it!  This was the classroom for those "Dynasty" broads!  It is surely one of the best examples of ensemble performance.
The first inkling I ever had of this film was in the 197(?) Los Angeles Film Exposition's tribute to Rosalind Russell.  They showed clips from about 15 of her films, and what they showed from "The Women" was the exercise scene.  After that, I was on a mission to see the film (prevideo!).  But, Roz isn't the only star shining -- they all do -- even the bit players ("So, whatta they want you to do?  Lay an egg?").
The script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin (adapted from the Clare Boothe play) is extraordinarily wonderful.  What dialogue!
If you haven't had an appreciation for Norma Shearer before, -- well, you certainly will after seeing this film.  And Joan Crawford -- "Crystal Allen" may be the woman we'll all like to hate best forever.
Oddly, there was no Academy Award nomination for any aspect of this film (perhaps there was an anti-George Cukor movement abroad in 1939 -- he was fired from "Gone With the Wind" remember), not even Adrian's costumes (just get a load of what he put on Roz!).
If you've never seen "The Women" -- shame on you!!
