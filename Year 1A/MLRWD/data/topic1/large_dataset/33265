Alright i need to counteract some of the negative reviews on this.  The picture quality is PHENOMENAL!!!  Whereas the blu-ray of Part 1 is overzoomed-in, this actually shows more of the picture than the previous DVD releases.  I think they did a great job on the transfer...the only grain I see is the original film grain from the low-budget cameras they used back then...it looks the way it is meant to look.  I absolutely loved it, and found myself saying numerous times during the movie 'this looks SOO AWESOME!!!'  And I am as critical as they come, I can assure you.

The special features are decent...aside from the Lost Tales from Camp Blood short film crap--those are all just pitiful and should be destroyed.

Otherwise my only complaint is we need a director's cut of this one...there is some really great footage missing here...I know we've been saying it for years, but man oh man, add that to the awesome quality of this BD, get rid of the Lost Tales crap, and I'll buy it again.

Or even something like what they did with 'Slashed Scenes' feature on the DVD of Part 4...they basically gave you every bit of film that wasn't used surrounding those death scenes as an extra...no audio or color correction or anything, but great quality and it's all there.  I was actually able to splice in some extra gore, color correct it (the best I can with what I have), do some audio-looping & editing tricks, and make my own director's cut of it in Windows Movie Maker.  I would love to do that with Part 2!!!!

However, I am appreciative for what we got this time...far better than any previous release, and the picture quality makes it worth every penny for me.
