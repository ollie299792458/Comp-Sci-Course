This film deals with guilt and vengeance in a small Pharisaical town. Mix guilt with self-righteousness, power and influence and injustice usually follows. However, in this wonderful little film, vengeance has a supernatural advantage which seems to be correcting a serious crime that has been covered up. The problem, which often happens with vengeance, is that the innocent get caught up in the fray and also suffer. As with most religious people they refuse to believe that their faith, leaders, church, or denomination could do any wrong, creating a staunch resistance against any justice or change. That lunacy also allows the guilty to go free ...sometimes.

Why do people pander and cater to religious beliefs? After all it is the religious who must "prove" the gibberish they spout. After centuries of blather..."god created everything in six days and he will burn you in hell... blah, blah, blah." We've all heard it, but why do people still accommodate or waste a moment of time with something that is provably wrong? With literally tens of thousands of religions, not even counting the thousands that no longer exist, at each others (and non-believers) throats. Doesn't that indict god in some way? Even if it is just to accuse god of not clarifying who or what, he, she, or it is, and wants. The word clarify originates from Middle English meaning to make pure and clean. Do you think a god would have a problem with that? It seems like it would save a lot of lives and end false-worship. Certainly an omnipotent and omniscient god has the ability to appear in some remarkable way to everyone that would end all doubt once and for all. But until then, we must put up with the god or gods that have the flavor of the culture they are stuck in.
