I've watched most versions within the last month, and this one is definitely my second favorite because of the superb acting and the faithfulness to the book.  This version has Jane voicing her thoughts as they were in the correct scenes.  Not typical for a movie, but it works.  And you know what Jane is thinking, which can be difficult from only the dialogue.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was not expecting to be this impressed with a movie that is older than my 35 years.  Best if you want a movie that follows the book, and the acting is great to boot.

I am totally in love with the 2007 masterpiece theater version of this movie, which is my favorite hands down. ( I have only one small criticism of it.)  Again, fabulous acting.  The 2007 version is best if you want an enjoyable movie true to the spirit of the book and true to most dialogue, and it is visually very nice!

The most recent (2011) was very beautiful with a very good Jane, but just too much was left out.  The story is just too complicated to be a comprehensive enough movie in two hours, though the makers of this movie did a great job with their version of Pride and Prejudice.  The 2011 version is best if you want something shorter and visually impressive.
