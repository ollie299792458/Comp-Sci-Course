nicole kidman finally delivers the performance that we all knew she was inherently capable of. she just needed the right platform for it. in this movie she pulls off something that only she can achieve. she is intelligent, charming, vulnerable, ruthless, depraved, deluded and downright sexy all in one delectable lip smacking package that will haunt you for many days after you've watched it. there is no one sexier in this industry. it was an excellent idea on part of the director to not show her completely naked. this way the mind is made to imagine with painful clarity, the juicy niceties that she has concealed behind the velvet bikini.
in the scene where she is flashing her bikini to her morose friend, you would sell your soul to the devil to watch her take off those underpants.
nicole teases, taunts and plays with your hormones. her eyes will make you cringe with an unholy desire and her body (and the way she uses it ) will tear the restraint out of your system and pull mercilessly but oh so pleasurably at the rising blood in your body. 
watch it. and keep a saucer below your mouth.
