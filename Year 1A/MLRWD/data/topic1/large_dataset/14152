I found this movie on my son's night stand and thought it was pornography. I popped it in to see exactly what I was dealing with. I was very confused for about the first 15 minutes and then laughed out loud for the next hour!

  The movie is about a mormon named Joseph Young, who is in town on a mission trip from Utah. During his door to door mission to share his love of Jesus Christ with anyone willing to listen, he stumbles into a home where an adult movie is being shot. While Joseph is defending himself againts a group of security guards working the set, the producer decides Joseph is perfect for the lead in his " action, adventure, porno ". The producer, Max Orbison, then offers Joe $20,000 to participate and assures him that he will use a stuntman for all of the scenes that require penetration. Joe accepts his offer, so that he can get the money he needs to marry his true love Lisa in the temple back in Utah. Thus Orgazmo is born. The super hero who takes on crime with his orgazmarater, a laser attached to his arm that gives his enemies an orgazum, thus distarcting them and giving him an advantage in the fight.

  Then life starts to imitate art when Choda Boy makes a real orgazmarater and then the boys discover that Mr. Orbison is an evil man,that must be stoped.

For any of you that are familiar with Trey Parker's work, this is it at it's best! The character's in the movie are all hillarious from Choda Boy, Sancho, the [...] twins, Ron Jeremy, Matt Stone there too many to name them all.

For those of you hoping to see a lot of nudity this movie is not for you. The only nudity in the whole film in one man's hairy backside :)
