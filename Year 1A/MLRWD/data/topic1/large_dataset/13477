The publicity regarding this film led me to believe it must be a goodie: after all, there were eleven Oscars awarded to this work. Well, after watching it, I have to say it is one of the most technically horrible pictures I have seen in my long life. The lead character is an idiot, apparently, who cannot follow simple directions even when many lives depend on correct action. The script writer seemed to assume that most of the world is familiar with every little detail of Lillian Hellman's life; guess what: not everyone is. If I hadn't brushed up on history before viewing this film, I would not have had a clue as to what was really going on, aside from the obvious suspense theme of espionage against the bad guys of World War II. I suspect that the only reason this film was so well-received was the fact that it is extremely politically correct. After all, who can criticize a film that portrays people fighting against the Nazi scourge? Well . . . I, as a fairly left-wing person who despises Nazis as much as anyone else, am criticizing it. It absolutely stunk. I spent a good deal of time yelling at the screen, "Put on the damned hat, you moron!" Those of you who have seen the film will understand to what I am referring. You want to see a good World War II film . . . buy SCHINDLER'S LIST instead.
