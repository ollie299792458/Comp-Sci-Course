Two decades ago, when my wife and I were driving back home after viewing this movie, she burst into tears.  She told me that she had never before realized what Viet Nam was like.

I'm not sure that The Deer Hunter depicted the "real" Viet Nam, because the "real" Viet Nam was different for each of us that served there.  What I can tell you is that The Deer Hunter very truthfully highlighted one simple fact:  no individual who served in Viet Nam came back home the same!

Robert De Niro's character, I think, aptly demonstrates one of the changes that the Viet Nam war could produce in its veterans - a renewed appreciation of life itself - especially that of a defenseless buck.  Dressed in the garb of a warrior, De Niro's character wrestled with the transition from war to civilian life from his first few moments home.  Later, in the misty hills of a hunting trip, he made the choice of NOT killing.  Still later, he tried to rescue his best friend, who never left Viet Nam, from his surrealistic opiate hell.

Don't watch The Deer Hunter as a mere war movie.  See it as a realistic journey for one young man (against a backdrop of life as usual back home) from the innocence of early adulthood, through a foreign hell of warrior in Viet Nam, and finally the battle to wade through the emotional impact of Viet Nam and to reconcile all three.

The Deer Hunter reveals the emotional damage, too-often permanent, that war exacts from its participants.  It should be required watching for our nation's leaders before they decide to send more of our young men into war's particular brand of hell.
