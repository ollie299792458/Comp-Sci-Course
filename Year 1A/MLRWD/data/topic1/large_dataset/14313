This movie is what I have come to expect from Jim Carrey.  A laugh out loud until your stomach hurts, great movie.  Carrey is at it again in a classic Carrey style.  This movie had scenes where I was laughing so hard tears came to my eyes.  It also came to a surprising ending where Tea Leoni and Carrey actually have some heart felt scenes.  This movie is exactly what needed to be released.  After years of unfunny and pointless comedies about nothing, Hollywood finally decided to release a classical funny movie.  Carrey is a master of comedy and shows us exactly why he is the star he is.  This movie is exactly what it was meant to be FUN!

Also a surprising fact about the movie is that Tea Leoni actually can be funny also.  I loved every second of the movie and it made me wont to go home and watch other classic Carry movies such as Ace Ventura and Cable Guy.  If you want to laugh you'll want to watch this movie.  Unless you used to work for companies such as Enron then I feel your pain.

Thank You.
