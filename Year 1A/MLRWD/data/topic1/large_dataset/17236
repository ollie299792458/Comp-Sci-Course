Wake up, AFI! This picture is not only among the best one hundred movies ever made, it is probably the best movie of the 1970's (a decade that included The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Network, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). It is one of the only American movies I have ever seen that is like painting. The more you watch it, the more you see. What impresses me most is the economy with which the characters are presented. While the picture is almost three hours long, Altman has the difficult task of describing twenty-four distinct characters in this limited time space. He does so masterfully. The smallest details reveal the characters' deepest secrets, regrets, feelings. My favourite scene has to be the one where Keith Carradine's playboy/folk singer character serenades Lily Tomlin with his original composition, "I'm Easy". No dialogue is spoken for the entirety of the song, but Altman's camera captures a million thoughts and desires in the faces of Tomlin and a bevey of other Carradine admirers.
Also: The performances are outstanding! Especially Ronee Blakely and Allen Garfield.
