Though not in my top ten list of the worst movies ever made, Garfield is still godawful.  I went to see it with my nine-year old brother and though he claims to have liked the film I think he'll forget he ever saw it tomorrow.
The stars, Breckin Meyer and Jen Love Hewitt, provide very little to the humor or plot to the film.  Both seem to know that they are of no importance in the film and don't even try to act like it.  Their small love story is insignificant and they have no romantic chemistry, though both try, to the best of their abilities, to wield their shy (and sometimes charismatic) charms to have the audience care about them.
The kids I saw this film with were mainly impressed, not with the star of the movie, but rather with the little dog that played Odie.  His physical comedy got the most laughs out the kids.  His big eyes, dancing (a.k.a. jumping on his hind legs) and Garfield's constant abuse towards him got the most laughs out of the audience.
Billy Murray, though well casted as the wry, and cynical Garfield, needed a better script to get more out his role.
