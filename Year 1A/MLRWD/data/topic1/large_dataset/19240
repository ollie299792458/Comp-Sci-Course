I&#65533;m a John Grisham fan, and while I don&#65533;t think that Runaway Jury is his best book, its still a damn good one none the less. The whole plot of the original book is thrown out for an over preaching fight for gun control, and some of the characters of the novel are ether gone or diminish in a certain capacity. Dustin Hoffman&#65533;s character is only a small supporting player in the book, but is a major player in the movie. Maybe because the filmmakers wanted to highlight the confrontation between him and Gene Hackman, which was good but not in the original book ether. I also think that it was irresponsible for the filmmakers to have such a strong stance for gun control, considering the fact that the country is split down the middle on this touchy subject. 
I will give the movie one big credit, the performance of Rachel Weisz was the best thing in this over preaching mess. She was in my opinion, the only actor who really captured the essence of her character, and made the character her own with her fine performance. See the movie for her fine performance alone, and if not, rent Confidence or The Shape of Things; both have great performances by Rachel Weisz, and are much better movies to boot.
