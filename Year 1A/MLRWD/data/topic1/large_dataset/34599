My husband died in a car accident on August 11, 06.  He was 38 years old.  We have a six year old daughter.

Without going through a long story, I first rented this movie from Blockbuster...somehow it was free....the clerk didn't understand it, neither did I.  Not sure what happened.  Watched it that night and cried from beginning to end.

The next day I bought the book.  Somehow, the book turned out to be free too.  It was part of a buy 2 get the 3rd free that I did not know about, the books were not labeled.  Anyway Five People You Meet in Heaven was the lowest cost (12.00.....12.95, & 12.99 were the other 2).  I feel like it was meant for me to read this book and watch the movie.

Both are excellent, but the movie shows some things that really hit me.  My husband, Dave used to juggle 3 balls for our daughter which is what Eddie did in his younger years.  Also when Eddie dies and they show his watch, it gave me goosebumps.  Someone found my husband's watch at the accident scene, broken, only one band.  I keep it with me wherever I go and sleep with it under my pillow.  I know it crazy, but that's what I do and that scene made me think about Dave's watch.

I have bought many copies of this movie and given it to friends.  Everyone loved this movie.  It's such a great way to help with the grieving process and the healing process.  It makes you feel like your loved one is still around watching over you, waiting for you.

I'm so glad my husband got me to watch it.  I will be sure to save a copy for my daughter to watch and keep later on when she is older.  [...]
