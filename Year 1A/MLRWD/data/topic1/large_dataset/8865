Midnight Cowboy is remembered, as other films that share this distinction are, for winning the Oscar for Best Picture (accomplished this feat in 1969).  Mutually inclusive with that is its distinction for being the only X-rated film to ever accomplish that feat, although it's rating has since been changed to R.

Many write how this film was gritty and jarring, and parts were, but ten years later there was the film Hair and, for those of you who have seen it then that should be enough said.

Personally, I feel the grit is more about the story itself.  First of all, the plot is based around a Cowboy `fella,' played by Jon Voight, who wants to strike it big "hustling" in New York.  While his attempts at prostitutioning himself go awry, he finds solace in a lowly, yet now equal compatriot 'Ratso'; I mean Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman.

In a sense, you see the depth of humanity, and how people work to survive through it all, but in overtly unrealistic situations.  In my humble opinion, that is what this story is about.  So please excuse me, or understand, why I do not see why it was so special.

This may have been unique and understandably if this was truly a reflection of life then it deserves its props; however, I can only get attached to one side of the story, that of Rizzo's.  This is because Rizzo lived in New York all of his life, while Jon Voight had life okay but chose to urbanize.  In fact, I actually thought Hoffman did a terrific job, but then again I am a self-proclaimed fan (for the most part.)

In summary, this film was shaky for the times, and as I say meek compared to Hair, and probably today's films.  Yet it won the Oscar for a reason, and hopefully the modern viewer can at least sit down and watch the film, although they may come to my agreement that this film is alright.
