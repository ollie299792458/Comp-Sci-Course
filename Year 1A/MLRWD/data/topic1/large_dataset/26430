The is a wonderful film and story.  I myself thought that her love for medicine and helping people in the end won over her desire to devote her life spiritually.  Her fathers death was the moment she received the grace and courage to live her truth.  Just a sweet, sweet story and she was indeed torn.  I loved in certain parts of the film she kept getting tested.  Just when she thought she was getting closer to her desires for the Congo there would be something pulling at her or in the way. The insane asylum in Belgium where she was first sent (and then sent to watch over the ward of the most dangerous and seriously ill) would test the will of God himself.  Even once she got to the Congo she was sent to the European hospital..not in the lepper colonies and with the village hospital as she longed for with her huge knowledge of tropical diseases etc...her scare with TB, recuperation process and replationship with the Dr. was touching and enlightening for her and the viewer...just great.  I agree this was one of her best films and cannot imagine it being made today.  She was such a true genuine talent. Glad it is on DVD and I appreciate the other reviews with the information on the cinema history. It is a little on the long side, so it needs a big bowl of popcorn! :)
