The single best monster/zombie flick of the late-80's.  Alien brain-slugs enter through the mouth and turn its victim into a zombie, walking it around until it finishes eating the brain, when the body drops to the ground, the head pops open and the next generation of brain slugs spread to the next victims.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

Took the tropes of teen horror comedies and set them on their ear.  Tom Atkins (Detective Cameron) gets almost all the best lines in the film, including the title of this review and the poster's tag-line, "The good news is, your dates are here, the bad news is they're dead".

The slugs inspired the equally entertaining and strong "Slither" from a year or two back, and the comedy inspired a whole bunch of horror films with laughs (such as the Critters films) that never came close to the quality of this one.

I expect the DVD release to shock everyone, as all the people who bought the crap-quality bootlegs over the decades "trade up" to a good copy.

A lost classic.  You're gonna love this.
