I appear to have a differing opinion then other reviewers
here, but this is what I saw:

I just picked up the 75th anniversary edition of Dracula &
was a bit surprised at what I found in comparison to the
Legacy box set of a couple years back. Amazon's listing
states that "as befits one of the legendary titles of Hollywood
history, Dracula looks noticeably cleaner and brighter
than in its previous DVD releases, and the soundtrack
also seems improved." Based on that I thought it would
be an upgrade.

First the good news: I prefer the original audio track
over the Philip Glass. It was quite muffled on the
Legacy box & is improved on the new 75th edition.

Now the bad news: On my system (Pioneer 578 DVD &
Toshiba 32" CRT; component video connection) the
picture quality was MUCH better on the Legacy box! On
my system, the Legacy box is sharper with more detail,
& most importantly much less video noise. The Pioneer
has a tendency to exaggerate video noise in Black &
White pictures with a poor s/n ratio, but this is
pretty extreme. As an example, the dark parts of the
first theater scene in chapter 7 where Lugosi is entering
the theater are more video noise then picture. The
Legacy box has a few more scratches on the film, but
if I had to choose it would definitely be the Legacy
box version.

On the positive side, in my opinion despite it's flaws,
Dracula is probably the best American horror film of all
time. I also really enjoyed the new 95 minute documentary,
 "Universal Horror".
