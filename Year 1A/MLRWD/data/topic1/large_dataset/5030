I'm from a small town in MN....football is very important to all of us.  In this movie, based on the book of the same name, the events happening on the field are as close to real as I have seen in a movie since "Remember the Titans."  Every hit, every injury, every pass, is exactly like that that we see on the field every Friday night, or Wednesday night, or whenever the game happens to be during play offs.

As far as the characters go, Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job in the role of Coach Gaines, and Tim McGraw an excellent job as the bullying father, which was a surprise to most country fans.  All the players on the field for the Permian Panthers did an excellent job also, but the Dallas Carter Cowboys were not a realistic size for a high school football team.

If anyone wantst to see a movie and be able to relate to a football player after the show, this is an excellent movie to see.  I went with two football players, and they both felt everything that was happening.  This is a good sign that it is a realistic movie.
