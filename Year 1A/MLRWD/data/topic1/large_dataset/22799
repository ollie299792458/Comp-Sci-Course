The Skeksis think there dark rule is complete and that they had snuffed out the only hope that the world has for being spared an eternity in darkness, but the young hero has been hidden away, saved from the slaughter of his kind, the Gelflings.  Throughout his journey you encounter strange and wonderful creatures and sinister ones as well, making The Dark Crystal, a classic fantasy film for the young or young at heart.  Jim Henson's creatures are always fun to watch. and this is no exception.  The characters and story are very immersing, making you want more as each moment unfolds.  A wonderful tale showing what can happen when one party tries to harshly take control of a land and all of it's people, and how the smallest glimmer of hope can transform the gravest situation.  I admit that it may date me in many respects, but something will eventually date us all, but I still love this film at 30 years old.  The movie in Superbit, with optimized DVD quality and sound is a great find for those who enjoy fantasy films, and Jim Henson.  In closing I would say this is probably my favorite Henson film.
