Were there ever two finer men to grace the screen than Eric Stoltz and Liam Neeson? My eyes were constantly doing battle over which beauty to feast upon! Ah, but I digress!

I liked this film SO MUCH BETTER than Braveheart (which, frankly, bored me to tears!). Magnificent pagan pageantry, music and dancing frame the story of love, loyalty, honor, bravery, integrity, family, betrayal and trust so clear, so artfully created, and with such breathtaking beauty!

Not to be given short shrift is the story of women as property, chattel to be violated at will in battle, those who pay the price for the decisions of their men. Rape as a weapon of politics and property (honor violated) is a crushing testament to women's place in herstory.

"Honor is what no man can give you, and none can take away," says Rob Roy, "Woman is the heart of honor."

Rob Roy is nothing if not a man of honor. He will not swear false witness even against a man he has no respect for, he will not lie, cheat or steal and chooses only men of honor to surround him. When his best friend disappears with money borrowed as an investment, he refuses to believe he has been duped. There is nothing but honor around Rob Roy MacGregor.

This becomes crucial when Rob Roy speaks the truth of his rage to those in power. To accuse him of lying would be ludicrous, as everyone knows Rob Roy MacGregor doesn't lie. It is the best defense anyone has against being disbelieved.

A beautiful movie. Powerful themes. Worth watching again and again.
