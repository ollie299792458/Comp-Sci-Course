Million Dollar Baby does not endorse euthanasia, but rather offers one perspective on the issue. Many of the negative reviews for this film that have been posted criticize Clint Eastwood for crafting a movie that is both condescending to the physically challenged and an argument for the right to die.  That being said, it is true that many have persevered through suffering far worse than that of Maggie Fitzgerald, and the assisted suicide performed by Frankie Dunn is cast in a sympathetic light.  The decisions made by the characters in Million Dollar Bay, however, are meant to be a paragraph in the conversation on the issue of euthanasia, not a conclusion.  It seems some of the people who chose to bestow a negative review on this film aren't willing to particpate in any right-to-die related discourse with civility.  These individuals would rather resort to rhetoric and close minded attacks to get their point across.  Watch Million Dollar Baby.  With objectivity. After you've finished you may applaud, detest, feel apathy or uneasiness towards he actions of the characters in the movie, but at least try to empathize with them and maybe you'll find Million Dollar Baby to be as powerful as I did.
