If you look at my other Amazon[.com] reviews, you will notice that I don't review movies and truth by told, I watch very few movies.  Perhaps 2-4 per year, including both in the theater and at home on video or DVD.  I'm just not a movie fan.
But tonight, we rented the Monsters Inc DVD and I absolutely loved it!  Clever, hilarious, touching, innovative, unique, imaginative - those words don't begin to tell about this movie!  You just have to see it.
It's such a pleasure to see a G-rated movie doing so well, both at the box office and also sales of the products for home viewing.  This movie is totally free of sex, profanity, and substance abuse.  Some of the action could be called violence, but not in the sense we usually define violence in movies!  This movie might scare a 4-year-old, however.  You need to know your own child to know if he's ready for this action-packed, laugh-a-minute masterpiece!
I watched this with my husband and two of our older kids (ages 19 and 21).  We all enjoyed this movie immensely and can't wait to watch the extras on the other DVD.  I can actually see watching this movie again, as the humor flies fast and furious and I know I missed a some good lines!  
You will be touched by the relationship between Sully (the big blue monster) and the little girl he affectionately names Boo.  He puts her safety above his job and above the good of the company.  This little girl they created is nothing short of charming and endearing.  You will instantly love her and cheer Sully on as he does everything he can to protect her.
The premise of the movie - that the Monsters collect screams of children which in turn power the city that the Monsters live in, is nothing short of genius.  This DVD would be a great gift for many people on your Christmas List - regardless of their age!
