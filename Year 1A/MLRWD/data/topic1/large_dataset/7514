Too many people who don't like this film becasue they don't understand the way this film was made. This is the film that broke the rules and as a result, every movie in some way borrows from this one, The acting is phenominal from all cast members and I don't even need to mention the screenplay and direction. This is a film for the ages that one viewing cannot do justice. This isn't the kind of film you watch on the surface only, because no one thing in this movie has a single meaning. "Rosebud" is more than just a sled, or a lost childhood. The film says it best that no one word can describe a man, and that is what Citizan Kane was doing; describing a complicated man from different points of view. This is, indeed, the greatest film made.
  And on the DVD: The picture is outstanding! I've never seen this film look so good. And for film buffs, the feature commentaries by both Peter Bogdonavich and Roger Ebert are excellent and give you a whole new perspective on the film. The documentary that comes with it, Battle over Citizen Kane is haunting.
  This movie is a must-see and must-own for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.
