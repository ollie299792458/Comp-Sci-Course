Spoiler alert!!

Tony Jaa is back as Tien, story continues from ending of Ong Bak2 with the evil Lord Rajasena torturing him by breaking his bones (after Tien has trashed the 20 guards). He is rescued by Kana Khone villagers, to heal Tien's karma the villagers build the Buddha statue seen in the first movie; this causes Tien to be miraculously healed allowing him to rehabilitate his body to complete health. Meanwhile Lord Rajasena is plagued by visions due to betraying his lord and the Ghost Crow (Dan Chupong) offers to remove the curse; of course he kills Rajasena in order to become the new king. Tien arrives with his new found mystical powers, overcomes Ghost Crow and rescues the girl.

Tien and Pim return to the village, where they and the rest of the village pray before the Ong Bak statue.
