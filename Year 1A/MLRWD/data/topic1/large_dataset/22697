Okay, I was bummed when in the original DVD release of Season 1 Part 1, there was no Nights in White Satin in the No One Here Gets Out Alive episode...but just the fact that this set FINALLY includes the Mel Profitt arc is worth the $9.99(!!?!)  The arc where I first encountered an amazing actor named Kevin Spacey and my eyes first feasted on the 100% woman that was Joan Severence.  William Russ' awesome Roger Lococco, as well as the rest of the usual suspects Jonathan Banks, Lifeguard, and of course Ken Wahl.  Yeah, it's a bummer there's no Moody Blues, and I was expecting some minutes trimmed here and there, but I'm almost done with the Profitt arc and I swear, there were even a few scenes that I'd never even seen originally on TV( and I'd seen the reruns a few times thanks to my now dead VCR). If the music thing is really that distracting, I'll cue up 'Nights' on the old iPod and listen to it while Vinnie and Sonny stare at each other. Good times.  Can't wait til Season 2 comes out.  Wiseguy's back, my friends. Here's to holes in the ozone, buckwheat.
