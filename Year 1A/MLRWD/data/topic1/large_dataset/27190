Firstly, Christian Bale is on his way to becoming one of this generations best actors, it was incredible watching him work his magic on this film. I saw this film  last night and it is still very much in my mind. The first time I tried to watch this film, I will admit, was difficult, due to Bale's dramaitic and skeletal like appearance. I agree with most of the reviewers here, Reznick is a distrubed, distraught man, slipping daily into his man made hell. But, I think there is another component here, how we enteralize guilt and other emotions. How do we accept our role in incidents, things we have caused, if on purpose, or by accident?  Several times in the movie, Reznick is confronted with making choices, paths that diverge in two seperate directions. I believe he is a kind and good hearted man, but he chose to run away from a situation  than to confront it. There is a little bit of us all in Reznick, enteralizing our emotions on a daily basis, not only affecting ourselves, but those around us.
