In Holiday Inn it isn't Bing Crosby or Fred Astair that makes the movie outstanding, but rather the relatively unknown "B" movie star of the time, Marjorie Reynolds. As you watch this movie you can "feel" the mood that Marjorie is portraying at the time, just by the look on her face. For example, during the the "Easter" scene, her eyes and smiles say it all, you can see she is in love, and as she sings "White Christmas" at the end you can feel the tears building p in your eyes - thoughout the entire movie she says more with her facial expressions then the most popular movie stars do today in their entire careers... If you love truly good acting, Holiday Inn will make you smile and make you cry, you will love Marjorie Reynolds  and it will bring back memories of a time when ladies could truly dance in high heel shoes, we don't see that type of dancing in many movies these days. Picture quality, sound and special effects are not of primary importance in these kinds of films, these are the kind that rely on your own imagination and feelings, much in the way you do when you read a good book.

Going my way is also a good old movie which may bring tears to your eyes at the end and is generally a "feel good" movie. It really does a nice portrayal of the good side of the catholic church. However, it won't make  you fall in love with the lead woman as you do with Ingmar Bergman in "The Bell's of Saint Mary's"

Having these movies to watch over and over again to stir up your emotions and forget your toubles is like having a prescription drug to ease you through those tough times in life. However, you must be able to look past the lack of color, the lack of fancy graphics, sounds or special effects and just appreciate the true acting involved.
