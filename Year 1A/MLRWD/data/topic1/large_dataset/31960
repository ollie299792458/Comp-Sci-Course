I am 29 and totally in Love with the Lord. I am working out everyday and look forward to it!!!! If you like good music and to have that "feel good" fun time during your workout, it's for you. You sweat, and feel energized. my favorite is the cardio party and kick punch jam. I have been doing it for one week and SEE the difference. If you are action oriented and results oriented like me, you will see quick results as well as have fun to keep you going. I got mine from beach body, service was great. I have lots several inches in that one week and have a ways to go. My plan is to do the turbo scult this week and keep doing this set and the older turbo jam versions for about 3 months to burn off 50 lbs then do the ChaLean extreme. I LOVE ChaLean...she inspirational and her CARE for you comes through on the screen. She also speaks positive words like You will love this work out...and guess what I love this workout!!!! You will too..it beats out all the old typical workout videos...NOTHING compares because the music is actually upbeat and good dance party style music that I grew up on, like best jams of the 90's early 00's. Stuff you heard at the local house parties and such! ENJOY IT and check my reviews again so I can shere the updated results!!! Updated Results 8.12.09 I lost about 16lbs since July 1st of working out to this and eating much better! Lots of inches. I am still going, I have aobut 44lbs to go!
