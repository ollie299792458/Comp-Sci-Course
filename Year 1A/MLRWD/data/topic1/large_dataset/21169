Never mind the secret of Soylent Green; this movie is scary enough without it.  Made in 1973, riding the wave of the burgeoning environmental movement, and starring Charlton Heston fresh from his Planet of the Ape series.  Portrays a dystopian future suffering from global warming and overpopulation.  Most people in the movie have never even seen a tree, let alone a 'green space'.  Yet the quality of life has declined so gradually (like the frog in the pot of slowly heating water) that they aren't even aware of what they're missing, of how much better it used to be.

E.O. Wilson (in "Biophilia") worried about such a future and compared it to the life of a chimpanzee in a lab.  Assuming the lab techs were ethical and made some effort to give the chimp toys and attention, it might know some semblance of happiness.  But we would know there were a whole range of experiences (e.g. swinging through trees) that this animal was uniquely evolved to appreciate and would never know...

Soylent Green is the future we all should fear.  Everyone should see this movie.
