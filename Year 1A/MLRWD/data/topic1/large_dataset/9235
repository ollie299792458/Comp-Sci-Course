This is a vey well made movie about the rise and fall of Edie Sedgwick. While it may not completely explain or try to explain why Edie did what she did it is a very well done movie. The acting, especially by Sienna Miller is very good (even if you wonder why she got the role when you see some of her screen test passages in the extras).At times the physical resemblance with the real Edie is exceptional, or at least with pictures from that era. Basically Edie was a wealthy New England socialite who left art school to go to New York where she met Andy Warhol- Being spectacularly attractive she became famous for the famous Warholian 15 minutes and then became very involved in drugs and eventually died at 28 years of age. However she has with time becom an icon of the 60's. This was confirmed by a book hat came out a while ago by Jean Stein and which is quite an excellent read.
The extras are rather good since there is a short documentary about the real Edie with interviews of survivors who knew her such as Gerard Malanga and her brother. This series of interviews actually complement the movie quite well. Together with the above mentioned book it increases the fascination one can have for her. Also as stated above there is a short screen test Sienna Miller did for the movie.
The guy who plays Warhol is not that great though.
