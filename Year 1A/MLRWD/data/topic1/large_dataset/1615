Brian Wilson sure was a genius.  If you ever had a doubt, watch tis wonderful documentary.
The Beach Boys sang beautiful harmonies, but were not a harmonius group.  A lot of bruised ego's, wreckless actions and  in-fighting were what the group was really about, apart from the  music.
The fact they haven't killed one another is probably due to the  fact that they are family.  
With an abusive father and smug egotistical  cousin, the Wilson brothers had a lot to contend with.  And Brian, the  absolute genius of the family and group, was either blessed or cursed (I'm  not sure wich) with a very fragile ego.
Through it all, though, Brian  emerges as such a giant teddy bear of a man.  Such a kind, gentle soul who  had the misfortune of surrouinding himself with people less than  helpful.
This tape explains the whole sordid story in a cohesive  way.
And don't forget the music.  Above all else, this tape is filled  with some of the mopst beautiful music of the 60's and 70's.
This is  great!
