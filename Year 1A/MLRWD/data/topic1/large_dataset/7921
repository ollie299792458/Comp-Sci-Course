OK, LET'S ADMIT IT: Ya gotta love these three goofballs - and let me add this: YES, Curly was the ONE & ONLY funny man of all time with regard to being a genuine original and a truly unique character but PLEASE DO NOT lump SHEMP in with Joe or Curly Joe or any of the other HORRIBLY BAD "third wheel" stooges - SHEMP was very, very good - in fact, some of his 'SCHTICK' is every bit as funny as CURLYS best stuff - ALRIGHT, he's no CURLY and he's a bit annoying at times but he can be as funny as CURLY - just give the old boy a chance!!!
I'm something of a CHAMPION of SHEMPS cause; he simply should be appreciated more for his own brand of classic humor and not berated merely because he's NOT Curly!
In CORNY CASANOVAS, when SHEMP looks at MOE apologetically after accidentally yanking him off the top rung of a ladder, landing his head in a bucket of filthy mop water, then nearly decapitating him while trying to remove the bucket and then utters this CLASSIC: "Gee Moe, I'm sorry Moe, What mo' can a fella say? That's all there is; there ain't no mo'!", only to be beaten senseless by Moe, after which Moe chuckles and utters this gem: "take it easy, kid, you're only nervous" - proving that he doesn't get the humor in SHEMP'S little ditty, I drop to the ground screaming with laughter!!!!
No matter how many times I see these episodes, I always ENJOY the boys antics in these classic comedy routines!!!!
