I went into theatres not knowing what to expect, I was very surprised it turned out to be more then I expected it to be. alot of people like it, some dont. I personally Love this movie, Its a very intense storylined action film. It goes in detail about most of the assassains, you get to know the FBI Agents Portrayed by Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta. The Cast was great each excelled at his/her role, no weak links. Jeremy Piven is the character that the movie sorrounds, hes a cocaine addicted vegas showman who gets in a bad entanglement with the mob. I highly recommened this film to anyone who likes a great action movie with a solid storyline. At the time it played in theatres It was one of the best action films id seen in many years. Ray Liotta makes a strong showing in this film although in my view nothing will touch the role he played in Goodfellas, the chemistry in that movie along with the story was to good to be topped by anything hell ever do which is why its pointless for people to compare other roles to that movie, Goodfellas was a dipalma masterpeice it had Liotta, Dinero and Pescis terrific chemistry words of advice when seeing Liotta and Pesci is not to compare their other roles to that movie. Dinero possibly can be compared due to the fact hes had so many great roles that go with that style movie. But again id highly recommened this movie to any fan of hard hitting action drama films. When it comes to blu ray or dvd this film all the way through and around is better on Blu Ray the superior picture and sound helps miles and miles with the movie and its style to see the full effect and extent. Enjoy it if you choose to see it I hope you do. Hope this review helps.
