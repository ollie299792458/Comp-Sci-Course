This rambunxious super-slide of comic adventure surely excells what the average audience would expect from a lower-budget comedy such as this.  Superstars David Duchovony, Julianne Moore, and Dan Aykroyd star in this uproarious film, alongside Sean William Scott and Orlando Jones.
This slam-bam, gritty spoof from Director Ivan Reitman (Twins, Ghostbusters, Six Days-Seven Nights) pits a fire-fighter trainee (Sean W. Scott) in the center of a million-year discovery.  After a meteor from outer-space crashlands on (Scott's) car in an open field, College scientific professors David Duchovony and Orlando Jones investigate and soon discover that the rock is evolving.  From a bleeding rock, to mulitcellular organisms, to plant moss, to species, to worms, to bugs, to dragons, to primates, this evolving mutant species could wipe out human existence within three months of its arrival.  Now Duchovony, Jones, Scott, and Moore must come together to find a repellent to wipe out the aliens before the human race is extinct.
This plump and absolutely fun comedy is presented with great performances to back it up.  Sure, the film is goofy, but packs the laughs.  The film is a sure treat for everyone.  There isn't much detail to go into.  It was better than expected.
QUOTE: "Uproarious, hilarious, and fun are the three words I choose to describe this spoof.  It's rather dumb, but it is brutally and terminally funny.  The performances add a lot to it, while the visual effects aren't real convincing.  But I'll take it for what it is, and have fun with it.  Reitman's new Alienbusters film turned out to be a sure shining crystal stone, rather than a tombstone."
