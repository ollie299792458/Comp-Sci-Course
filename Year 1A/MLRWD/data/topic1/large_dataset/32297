Heed my warnings... you know all the "gruesome" scenes in other movies where the camera pans off-screen just before the most violent act is carried out?  Well, Rambo doesn't pan off screen.. you get to see those with a fury like no other film ever produced.. and these aren't cheesy haunted house effects...the events depicted are almost surreal.  Take out all of the violence and you're left with about 15-20 minutes of peace.

Technically:
- Editing is excellent.
- Transfer on blu-ray 'pops.' Colors seems a tad bit over-saturated, but contrasts and blacks are spot-on.
- 7.1 DTS-MA (a rarity) makes the action all the more life-like.  Since there's not a lot of dialogue in this film, your center channel won't receive the workout of the other channels, however, this is an immersive experience.

There is barely any story here... hardly any dialogue...This latest Rambo 'film' can can barely be classified as such.  However, what is here is 5-stars of vomit inducing guilty pleasure.  What else can I say... For what it is, I loved this movie! 5-stars.

Foot-note:
The latest Rambo outing is (loosely?) based on events happening in the country of Myanmar (formly known as Burma).  If what's depicted in this movie is even 1/8 of what's going on there... the citizens of that country need help and they need it now!
