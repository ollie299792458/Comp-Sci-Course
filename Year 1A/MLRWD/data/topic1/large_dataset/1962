Although shown primarily from the Muslim terrorist perspective, Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 film is even handed and shows the frustration the French endured in dealing with the Arab terrorists - a frustration that finally brought about the actions of fighting fire with fire.

Muslim terrorists cannot be negotiated with. They do not accept any law (other than Islam). Terrorists are single-minded. Terrorists, as the name implies, are brutal and will use anything within their power to bring about the destruction of their enemy, in this case the West. They are imbedded in our institutions and, rather than taking on the status of "citizen" of their country of choice, they respond only to their single-minded religion, which has been shown time and again.

Muslim terrorists are even more brutal than their western Marxist counterparts of the 1960s and 70s, as they act by not only committing brutal homicide, but also use brutal suicide in the act, making a homicidal-suicidal terrorist even more difficult to stop.

In Algiers, the French used brutal tactics in return. Although losing the overall war to political pressure, the French Army won the anti-terror war of Algiers by using tactics that deal with terrorism and terrorists. American and other western leaders, planners and analysts would do well to view this film.
