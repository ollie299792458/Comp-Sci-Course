I think the reviews of Ang Lee's film say more about the reviewer than they do the film. If what you're looking for is slim on story and long on whiz-bang visual effects, then perhaps this "Hulk" is not for you. If you're satisfied by more explosion than exposition, I'd suggest any number of other comic book movies.

Ang Lee has been vilified for creating here a smart, tight, thoughtful movie that just so happens to be about a comic book (anti)hero. Which means that much of its built-in audience is going to be surprised by what they get in this film: a multilayered story that is rich with subtext; excellent performances by award-winning actors; clever dialogue and assured pacing.

In other words, for those who love movies, this is a good one.

Far from perfect, this movie does succumb to summer blockbuster visual effects-itis by the end and for my money it degenerates into noisy racket for the lowest common denominator in the multiplex. However, what fun it is to get there.

This is a much smarter movie than it needs to be, probably better suited to those who are more interested in a good story than to those who want some brainless "pow!" with their butter-flavored popcorn. There is no doubt that Hulk smash- Hulk smash expectations, Hulk smash conventions, Hulk smash the low-set bar for comic book adaptations. Hulk smash.
