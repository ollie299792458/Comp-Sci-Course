I really liked the Twilight books and I want to like the movies but they are just horrible.  As one reviewer put it its Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves but the sad part is--- they don't die at the end.  The acting in the movie is so bad, it can only be accented properly by the worst make-up team in Hollywood,  the vampires are supposed to be white (due to the whole lack of sun thing) but the actors in this movie look like they were dipped in whiteout, and Rosalie's hair is about as realistic as sticking a poodle on her head and calling it her hair.  Some of this stuff was acceptable somewhat in the first movie because the books didn't get super popular until the movie was like mid-production, but New Moon had a huge budget and it was worse than the first movie.  The two main actors are so bad when I was in the movie theater my sister and I couldn't stop laughing at some of the scenes with one or both of them in it (we really ticked off some of the die hard movie fans).  But an issue with translating the book to movie is a) fans of the book have an idea in their head about what the characters should look like and Twilight doesn't come close to it  b) the majority of the book is Bella's inner thoughts and they can't translate that to the movies.

The best advice to give is to tell everyone: If you are over the age of 13 and you want to see what the Twilight series is like read the books because the movies are so horribly cast& produced its disgusting. But it's so bad that you get morbidly curious about it.
