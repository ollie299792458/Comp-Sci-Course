[...] this movie gives so much pleasure it's impossible to resist putting my two cents in. Ever since I first saw it decades ago it's been by favorite movie (though I don't think it's the greatest ever made). Every character, from the sinister Bogart to the beautiful and confused Ingrid Bergman, from the cynical Claude Rains to the ambitious Sidney Greenstreet, is superb. And of course there's Dooley Wilson playing that midget piano, "Knocking on Wood" and crooning "As Time Goes By" which was written long before the movie was ever thought about. There are some odd things in the movie, too - the way Bogart can't pronounce "bourbon" so that it makes sense and the plane taking off in the fog (in the desert!). Whether Bogart would get Bergman at the end was kept a mystery throughout the shooting, but of course he would have to give her up - this was 1942, she was married to Henreid, and what kind of heel would he be if he got the girl? He's got Nazis to fight, anyway. The movie is a Hollywood classic and one that I'll continue to watch over and over again.
