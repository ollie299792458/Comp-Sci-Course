Ok, first thing I'm going to say is that MANY people do NOT set their TVs up right (or at all) to view red/blue or magenta/green (aka red/green) 3D movies correctly.

You need to turn your brightness up high, not so high it's washed out of course, and then just tweak your color settings. I did so at a good 3D scene in the movie until the magenta/green (in this case) ghosting was nearly ZERO. Of course you may see it here and there, but once setup right you can watch this movie and absolutely enjoy it.

Once you're setup right this movie is an absolute joy to watch in 3D on a 1080p HDTV. Yes, the movie is a bit campy and silly, but the 3D is really well done. There are scenes in the mines and the forest that are absolutely awesome looking. Trees, cave walls, bushes, etc...all stretch back into the screen as if you could reach into it.

Just a warning to some, there is a very adult scene in this movie...and it lasts for a good 5 minutes..LOL...but it's hilarious if you're of age. Don't let the kids sit in on this one. (There's extended full frontal of a female)

In the end I HIGHLY recommend this 3D Blu-Ray to anyone that likes B movie slashers/thrillers. Remember, you CAN WATCH THIS without having a 3D TV or a 3D Blu-Ray player. You only need an HDTV and regular Blu-Ray player. This is probably about as good as it gets without spending thousands on 3D tvs, glasses, and players.
