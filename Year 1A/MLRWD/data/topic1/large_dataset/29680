The Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection is worth it for just the 'Monolith Monsters" alone. Together, the collection is a gold mine in sci-fi.

My 12-year son and I first saw "Monolith Monsters" (on VHS) with 15 other geologists as evening en-tertainment in a makeshift trailer-theater at the University of California's White Mountain Research Station in Bishop, California. We watched the movie in utter amusement as characters Dave Miller (government geologist), Professor Arthur Flanders and others in the cast spouted one nonsensical aphorism after another, in their attempt to explain the formation of the monoliths and the possible ways of stopping their growth. The movie is one of the best examples of "Bad Geology" that I had seen. Even my son pointed out the errors of the movie's finer statements: 1) looking at a piece of Obsidian (a black glassy rock composed of silicon dioxide) that every school kid recognizes, Dave Miller says "Looks like stone to me" - duh; 2) theorizing that water makes the rocks grow, the townsfolks decide to flood the monoliths with salt and water. But Obsidian (silicon dioxide) is inert to both salt and water!

Without getting into other specifics of the movie's bad geology, it is clear any halfway intelligent middle school student would have identified the rock. And yet despite some of the funky statements, "Monolith Monsters" remains a wholly enjoyable `B' movie. It is `Camp' entertainment for scientists, especially geologists, and is a period piece of Bad Geology - a good movie to watch with colleagues over a beer while making childish insidious remarks. This is high entertainment. If you like the TV program "Mystery Science Theater 3000", you'll love this movie. It is great that the movie is now out in DVD.
