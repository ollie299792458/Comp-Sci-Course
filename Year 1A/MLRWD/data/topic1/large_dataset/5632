I recieved my disc today and found the color version to be asbsolutely beautiful and utterly enchanting. The soundtrack by AIR was not as bad as I had feared after reading some of the reviews and previewing the soundtrack cd. (Thankfully, much of the most dreadful music on the cd is not in the film.) However, I agree wholeheartedly that it was a terrible mistake to make the AIR soundtrack the only option. I consider this to be a very important release, and feel its integrity has been seriously damaged by this baffling decision on the part of Flicker Alley. I also do not like the Blu-ray/DVD combo format. I think that most people, like me, will only watch the Blu-ray disc, unless they have no Blu-ray player, in which case they will only watch the DVD. This makes the extra disc useful as a drinks coaster or mini frisbee, but little else. They could easily have made the second disc a 'Best Of Melies In Color' compilation or perhaps a sampling of contemporary films to provide a historical perspective. But these issues aside, I am very happy with my purchase and it definately will go on my shelf with other discs which will never go on ebay, even if I am reduced to living on rice and beans.

P.S.
 If you cannot afford the 30 to 40 dollars price, you can get a dvd version as a bonus disc to the AIR soundtrack cd for around 15 dollars. Then you can use the dreadful cd for your drinks coaster.
