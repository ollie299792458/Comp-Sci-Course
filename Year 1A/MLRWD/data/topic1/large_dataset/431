For those of us who grew on '70's movies this is one that can not be left out.  Literally creating the summer blockbuster season, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films ever made.  Speilberg took a mediocore book and  turned it into a true classic.  The characters, especially the three leads,  are fully realized and developed.  Each of the three men are different in  every way.  Yet, it the final act when they are on the Orca they all must  come together and do battle with the man eating shark.  
The story never  lags and the tension never lets up.  The first two acts set the final forty  minutes up flawlessly.  With the addition of John Williams and his classic  score and the supberb editing of Verna Fields, both won Oscars, it is  perfect is almost every way.  It is hard to pass this up.  It is the film  that made Speilberg and he has not looked back since.
On DVD the film has  never looked and sounded better.  Williams' score can finally be heard for  what it is.  The picture quality is great and the widescreen image make  this complete.  A must for DVD fans and fans of classic movies.
