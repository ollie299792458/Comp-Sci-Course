I came across this movie years ago when I was into a "B" movie rental frenzy.  This is a really fun movie as long as you go into it expecting a "B" movie.  Just don't take everything so seriously and enjoy the cool characters.  Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is a trooper/cop in the future, after the big earth quake that distroyed Los Angeles.  His task is to eliminate the trancers, mindless zombies controlled by an evil character.  Jack Deth dispatches the trancers with Dirty Harry like accuracy.  Sent back into the the mid 80's to chase our evil villain, Jack Deth finds himself in a relationship with the very young and beautiful Helen Hunt.  
  Their is one spot in the movie that really caught me off gaurd, I wasn't expecting a moment of really fine acting.  There is a scene where Tim Thomerson tells Helen Hunt that he doesn't want her to come with him cause he doesn't want her to get hurt, and she replies "You love me" and he say's, "That's what I just said wasn't it?"  Well, maybe it's just me but, I thought it was a really good scene.
I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys light hearted movies.  Take a leave of your senses, you need a break from reality.  After all, where else can you find such cool lines like, "Dry hair is for squides".
