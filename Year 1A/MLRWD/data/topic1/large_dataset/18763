Well... i have always admired Michael Jackson... his music... his energy,, his originality, his genious.. but never felt him that close.. When i knew about this film, i didnt know what to hope, but i knew i had to watch it.
Now i saw this film, what its the most close experience to meet him in a concert, I understand what Michael means, his magic, the way he moves the people, your felt him inside you... he is extraordinary.
Now i feel i love him, i admire him, i cant stop listening his music, watching his videos, youtube, everything i can, i cant just get tired. This man actually changed my life.

The inspiration is there with him, you see this amazing and talented person, and you are happy because is a gift, and then you realized he is gone, what a huge lost. Its really great for his fans to see him enjoying singing, enjoying what he is doing, and in a personal stuff, he seems like a real angel.. and since now, he is that for me, an angel and my closest friend.

I have watched this movie 10 times, and i cant wait for my DVD, i think here in Colombia the movie is not be longer presented, i am very sad about that.

I think, any Michael Jackson' fan will enjoy this more than enything else in the world.

Michael Jackson, for me, is one of the greatest gifts from God, that we never have been able to deserve.
