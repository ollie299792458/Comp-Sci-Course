I can't even watch this movie, it's so bad and blurry in 3D I couldn't even watch it :(, I was very disappointing with it and would like my money back.

It sure would be nice to talk to a real person at Amazon, but I couldn't find a # to call anywhere on your Amazon web page.
 I contacted you guys 7 days ago and you told me it would be picked up at my house the next day, UPS never showed up the next day or any day at all, this is the worst service I've ever had, if I don't here back from you guys I will put a stop payment and never use Amazon again, look at your records I'm sure you will find that I've been a loyal costumer of yours for a very long time, it's not a very good policy for you guys to ignore a customer and let it get to this point. You guys really sucked on this order.
One more thing, I've tried contacting you guys (Amazon) three times and you only answered the first time, the other three times I got NO RESPONCE FROM AMAZON.
