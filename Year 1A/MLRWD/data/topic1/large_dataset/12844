It is so nice to finally see this show on DVD. The DVD transfer is bright and clear. I haven't seen this show since it was broadcast in the 1980's and I often wondered why it hadn't been shown sooner on cable. I wish there were extras included on the DVDs, like commentary from some of the actors or directors. Even with the 1980's hairstyles and clothes, the show has a timeless quality. The song and dance sequences are TERRIFIC--talk about some great dancing, especially from Debbie Allen, the late Gene Anthony Ray, and many others. I wish Seasons 4-6 would be issued.

The TV series was not as raw as the movie; hence the director of the movie does not like the TV series and had nothing to do with its creation. But given that it was the early 1980's, certain things could not be shown or said back then on TV as opposed in the movie theater. Also, I like the fact this show is a more positive depiction of theatrically-minded students, although it does tackle some heavier themes in the later seasons.

A terrific show if you love theater, dance and music from a bunch of clearly talented actors and actresses. My 4-year-old son enjoys watching the singing/dancing sequences because there is so much movement and color.
