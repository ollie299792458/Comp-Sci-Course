As a die hard Resident Evil fan there is a certain amount of consistency I come to expect from the games and even more from the movies.  I loved the first installment, it wasn't based on the games but it had the same feel to it, but Apocalypse is a disjointed montage of things that happened in various games.  Sure I didn't mind many of the inconsistencies to the game to the movie, but get someone who understands how a Beretta operates, the slide locks in place when you're out of ammo.  My biggest issue was the ending, everything made sense how you wouldn't want the story getting out but I think that Paul W.S. Anderson forgot about events in the cold war that led to the establishment of NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) there purpose to track missiles...  Translation you can't nuke the city and get away with it, NORAD has our backs.  Then the refusal to use any other mutant other then Lickers is insulting to the far superior Hunter's of almost every Resident Evil game, 6 foot tall killer decapitating frogs just never gets old.  If you didn't know anything about Resident Evil other then it had zombies and lots of guns then yes you might like this insult to Resident Evil fans but a die-hard such as myself, I had a hard time with number Apocalypse, and when it comes to the next one im going to pretend that the first was the only movie.
