This movie is good. I am glad the film didn't just harp on the fact that the man was TIRED because THAT black woman's actions. He was also TIRED because of his choices he made in marriage and later dating black and other races of women. Loved that Asian-American woman.

First critique I wished that the film maker would have not just focused on what a woman with "Angry Black Woman Syndrome" looks like. But what a woman without looked like. Would have liked to actually see the main character find the "good", "strong" woamn that was for him.

The interviews were interesting. Hey we all have our opinions but (2nd critique) just like the film maker ask the women hard questions I wished he had asked some of the opionated "good" men did they make choices to cause them to be TIRED like the main character. Did they think they ever cause any woman in the past to contract "Angry Black Woman Syndrome".

But All in all it was a good movie. This is coming from Just a Black Woman.
