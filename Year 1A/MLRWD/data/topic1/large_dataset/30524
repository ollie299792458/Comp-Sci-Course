When my stepfather first urged me to watch Forrest Gump, I was critical. Over three hours of a stupid guy's ramblings on the world? Please.

But then I actually did watch it, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Forrest Gump tells the story of an Alabama man born with a low IQ. The story begins with him sitting on a bench, trying to strike up a conversation with the woman next to him. At first she isn't interested, but as Forrest's story goes on, you can't help but be drawn in and before long there are more people on the bench, missing their buses so that they can keep listening.

Forrest has been everywhere, from war to to Ping Pong tournaments, and met a cast of people along the way, the most important being his long-time love, Jenny. Forrest is dense and clumsy, with braces on his legs and a mother that would do anything for him and won't hear a word against him. Jenny is beautiful and smart, with a father that abuses her. They're best friends.

When they grow up they go seperate ways, but Forrest never forgets her, and they run into each other at differnet points of their lives. Forrest's story is told in a great way- Forrest himself is dull, but you have to be sharp to catch all the references in it, from Nike campaigns to the impeachment of Nixxon.

When the flashbacks end and Forrest is back on the bench, he finishes the rest of his story from there. It's sweet and sad and truly moving. Even though Forrest is not especially bright, there is plenty of wisdom in all that he does. As he says, he's not a smart man, but he knows what love is.
