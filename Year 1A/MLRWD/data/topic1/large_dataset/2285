I'm very happy that all the legal wrangling finally resolved, and that I got to see this.  I've always considered film to be a branch of literature that is not always looked upon with the same critical eye we are so used to with books.  For me, this film kicks it way up several notches in story, characters, actors, and filmography.

I found this film an amazing experience.  Just for starters, to me, Kenneth Lonergan eye seems like my own--he shows us Manhattan on camera the way I see Manhattan as I walk about. I wonder if this is true for others.  I found this camera work so accessible, and made me feel like I feel when I'm there going about my day.  This may sound bland, but, it was remarkable that it felt like me being there taking in the city on any given day.

The story then vividly portrays the chaos and angst of adolescence, family life, sex, relationships, tragedy, parenting, and the inevitable confrontation of the world as it works and human idealism.

The cast was impeccable, Anna Paquin showed us  a phenomenal display of craft, as did the rest.

I hope this film get's the recognition it deserves.

Thank you to Kenneth Lonergan for giving this gift.  Remarkable!--Thank you!
