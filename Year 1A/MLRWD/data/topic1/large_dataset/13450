The story of this movie is pretty poor. What I dislike about this movie is that Nicole Kidman and George Clooney seem to play parts that I would think they are not suited for.
I give this movie a 1 star rating simply because the story was pretty poor. Even a movie like Broken Arrow with a similar plot was a lot better than this. The reason? It had better casting, better direction and was more action packed.
The Hunt For Red October written by Tom Clancy seems to be shadowed by this movie. The uniforms and the cinematography weren't too bad at all.
Maybe I just don't like Nicole Kidman and George Clooney. I never really liked Clooney or Kidman anyway, but at least he was alright in Up in the Air.
From now on I'll make sure I continue to avoid anything with Kidman's name on it. I was never fond of her anyway. Although she is pretty. Clooney may be desirable amongst women, but I would much rather watch Humphey Bogart! At least Bogart has talent. Bogart is a true entertainer.
All that said, I had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Kind of B grade film material.
