I came across Vertigo for the first time in the early 80's, when due to copyright restrictions, it wasn't available to be seen on video, TV or in theaters...Having read many books on Hitch's films, I always wondered why  the writers of these books always thought Vertigo was his best...It wasn't  until Vertigo was re-released in 1984 that I saw it for the first time, and  immediately it became my favorite Hitch movie as well...There is something  so hauntingly beautiful about this movie that it stayed with me...As soon  as it went on video I bought it and it became a cult movie for me, I would  watch it over and over, studying every scene, seeing new things upon each  viewing...Unfortunately, I couldn't see the restored version when it hit  theaters a couple of yrs ago, this I will always regret...But now that I  bought the DVD I was blown away at how wonderful and vivid the colors now  seem...I could go on for days as to why I love the movie so much, but all I  can say is...If you are a hopeless romantic, and you don't see Vertigo, you  will have done yourself a terrible disservice...Watch it, again and  again...fall in love again and again, and have your heart broken again and  again...I love the film so much...it represents the good and bad things in  life, yet done with such class and suspense that only a genius like Hitch  could have done it....a 10 star movie in my book!
