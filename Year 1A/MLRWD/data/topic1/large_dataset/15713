I'm not sure why people think all movies need a lot of dialogue. If you really pay attention to a good movie, with good actors, and put yourself in their shoes, why would you need conversation. "Quest for Fire" is one of my favorite movies and I needed no words to understand what all the charactors were feeling. The same goes for "Vahalla Rising." The acting was great. The story was interesting. I like to think and feel when watching a good movie and I did. This was One Eye's story. He is finally freed from slavery and sets out on a new life to a new world. You are thinking his future has to be better than his past. The extreme violent lifestyle he endured as a slave who had to fight for the profit and entertainment of his captors has not killed his humanity as you see in his relationship with the young boy. He can still see right from wrong. But violence was a necessity to survive. I would have preferred a different ending but at least it wasn't predictable. It is a dark violent movie but so was this time in history.
