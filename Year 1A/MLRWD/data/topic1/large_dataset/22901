This is the closest to a perfect movie I have come to in a long time.  Imagination, music, great characters.  Just perfect.  The imperfections in the acting remind me of the tale of the persian carpet.  Each persian carpet has a n incorrect knot built into it, because perfection is only possible in the hand of god.  The story is filled with forgiveness and extraordinary power.  Characters who can feel pain and forgive.  Even the evil queen is filled with sorrow, longing and confusion; lonely and pathetic.  She is addicted to beauty for the sake of nothing other than to feed her addiction.  The evil in this story reminds of the satan as seen through the eyes of dervishes....Satan was so in love with god that he refused to bow before man....evil in this story is a human construct, very much understandable, if out of control.  And Snow white, well she is sublime...."you cannot have my heart". understanding and forgiving.  resolute. " who will be my brother"  and "NO YOU CANNOT have my heart" and she sheds a tear knowing that she is denying a pathetic creature a desperate need.  The music brings you to tears.  The seen with the white hart is seared in my memory for ever.  This is a perfect movie.  Perfect.
