First of all, I love the movie and it's an absolute classic. I just wanna throw my two cents in on the Blu-ray release and say that despite some other reviews, I am satisfied with the picture quality of the Blu-ray version.  First of all it's an older movie- we're talking like TWENTY YEARS OLD, so no matter how many times it's remastered, it's not going to reach Dark Knight-esque quality. Yeah, there are definitely problems with grainy-ness and other imperfections, but I just got done watching a close-up of Shoeless Joe Jackson on my Samsung in 1080p, and I can promise you this isn't just marginally better than DVD, it's quite noticeably better.

Some of the professional reviews I've read suspect that Universal used the same transfer for this edition as they used for the hd-dvd release a few years back. Since that's probably very likely, I wouldn't be surprised to see an improved transfer in the future, since transfer technology and remastering technology improve over time. But how soon? NOT FOR A LONG TIME! I wouldn't expect a new transfer for another 10 years since transferring/remastering is very costly(take for example North by Northwest's gigantic one costing $1 million recently). After all, Universal is not going to invest the money if they can't recoup it with sales. So moral of the story- this is the best edition you're probably gonna find for a long time :)
