I saw this film on TV about 15 years ago.  Cable edited a bit here and there, I could tell.  But overall, the movie was preserved.  I'll have to buy it soon to see it again.

A scathing attack on the recent 'legalization' of pornography when it was made, it ends up being titillating in a disturbing way.  And so over the top, it gets funny, even though the subject is anything but.

An overbearingly religious man loses his daughter and then goes into the underworld that swallowed her, trying to hold onto his own soul as he goes through what he percieves as 'hell on earth' or pretty close to it.  The film's only flaw is that it showed nothing of the reason why his daughter went from a college student to a dead-end porn actress during a 4 hour tour in NYC.  And the Dad was potrayed as being too heroic.  I've met his equivilant in RL, at coffeshops.  Imagine thinking a pyscho Gacy-like cannibal/homosexual is stalking you, then finding out they are just bible-thumping Christians, then almost wishing they were the former psychotic types as they rave their church of one-one dozen?

Agree or disagree with it, this is an excellent, well acted, well written movie.
