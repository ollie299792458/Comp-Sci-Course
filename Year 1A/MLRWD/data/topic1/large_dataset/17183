Brilliant and disturbingly honest

Cate Blanchett gives a sterling performance as Tracy Heart, a young woman struggling to reinvent herself beyond her drug-related, criminal past by managing a local video store.

But Heart is tied to, and trapped in her past, partly by circumstance (her heroin addicted father and alcoholic mother) and partly by a series of her own bad choices. Her inner and outer struggles; the battle between doing what is best for her versus what she wants (ex boyfriend Johnny) which put her constantly in a state of limbo, swimming to nowhere. Her desire for a future combined with her inability to get a bank loan to get started; wanting more, wanting better, to do better and have better, yet her inherently tragic, drug-laden environment continues to ensnarl her despite her best efforts to stay clean. The constant self-sabotage even as she helps others - and not knowing how to help herself--make her the beautifully complex, tragic character we can all identify with.

The fractured life of Tracy Heart is echoed beautifully in the smashing of the photographs of children, the breaking glass, the breaking vase, the constant breaking  - everything is breaking down around her, and her sad, broken and dysfunctional life leads her back to the only place where she can find peace and serenity; the swimming pool. The swimming serves as another poetically sharp contrast to the madness of her drug-infected life, swimming back and forth, back forth, going nowhere.

Blanchett is outstanding, and her ability to capture the inner complexities of Tracy Heart is a truly memorable performance right to the end - and then she returns to her childhood beach, and to happier, less complicated days, where we see her bring her father to rest, with a fly on his face.
Come to think of it, we are all little fish, really, swimming in a great big pond, trying to make sense of it all.
