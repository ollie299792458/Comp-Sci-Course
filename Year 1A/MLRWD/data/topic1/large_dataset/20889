As soon as I heard the strains from "Black Eyed Dog", one of my least favorite Nick Drake songs, I knew I was onto something.  The director's commentary track mentions that this is not a snip from Nick's original, but a rerecorded snippet (the rights cost too much).

Here's a fine little "chick flick" that I drank with my eyes after borrowing the DVD from my niece.  Of course, I'm an emotionally hungry lifelong bachelor (so far, I figure I'll meet someone at some department store).

This movie is easy to watch time after time, and for the most part gets better with every viewing.  I could have done without that kid in the devil suit.

This one blows away Nora Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle" and "You've Got Mail", and even her best, "When Harry Met Sally".  Okay, so that's not much of a claim.  It's even set (for the most part) in Ephron's beloved New York City.  The plot lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, misleads, evades, and in a way quite appropriate to the mysterious force that seems to toy with the lead characters.  The movie manages to remain fresh and entertaining and is romantic without being cloying or annoying.

... along with this movie, it'll be good for your heart.
