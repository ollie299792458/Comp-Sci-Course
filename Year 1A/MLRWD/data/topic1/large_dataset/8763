This movie is a worthy successor to the original Fantasia movie.  The artwork in all the pieces was superb (although, you could tell the art from "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is old).  This movie, as with the original, gave me a greater appreciation of classical music, while entertaining me with impressive visual imagery. 
The pieces are as follows:
Beethoven, Symphony #5.  A classical piece of music (who can't identify it upon hearing it?) portrayed as a good vs. evil contest.
 Respighi, Pines of Rome.  Flying whales!!  A great piece of music which builds to a fantastic finish.  Has some cute moments with a baby whale.

 Gershwin, Rhapsody in Blue.  Easily the best (and longest) piece in the movie.  Done in the drawing style of Al Hirschfeld, a magical tale is told of four people in Depression-era New York.  A heartwarming, moving piece.

 Shostakovich, Piano Concerto # 2 Allegro Opus 102.  A charming piece of music, used to tell the story of the Steadfast Tin Solder.  Some of the scenes in this piece may be scary for little kids.

 Saint-Saens, Carnival of the Animals, Finale.  A (very) short, but very funny piece which answers the age old question:  "What happens when you give a flamingo a yo-yo?"  I was laughing out loud at this one.

 Dukas, The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  This is the same piece as from the original 1940 movie.  Still worth watching after all these years.

 Elgar, Pomp and Circumstance.  Donald and Daisy Duck star in this reinactment of the story of Noah's Ark.  Fun to watch and enjoyable.  

 Stravinsky, Firebird Suite.  A wonderful story about life, death and rebirth.  The piece builds to a wonderful ending, both in the story and in the music.  Some of the younger children may be scared by some of the scenes in this piece as well.


Overall, this movie is a wonderful addition to any home video library.
