There is probably little doubt that Oliver is one of the greatest musicals ever made for the silver screen and it is an enjoyable addition to any collection. The movie is not one I'd let a child under the age of nine see due to subject mater and (although little blood is shown) emotional violence that effects even the oldest of viewers, however that is my own personal opinion. This DVD features 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, although for most of the movie only the front 3 speakers are used. Occasionally, all 6 speakers are used for sound effects and a couple of specific scenes. However, the sound is crisp and clear regardless of the lack of use of the full power of a home theater sound system. The picture is as good at they come on DVD. However the DVD is a flip side DVD; meaning that the movie is divided into two parts - one half on one side, the other on the opposite. This is not a huge issue in my eyes since it adds a stage feel to the movie and allows added clarity to the picture (often when they scrunch a film onto one side of a DVD it reduces picture and sound quality) and is edited very well so that the disruption simply seems like an intermission. Still, if you hate getting up and flipping a DVD in the middle of the picture you may want to wait until another version comes out (if one does it most likely will be on blue ray). All in all, this is a pleasant widescreen edition of Oliver on DVD.
