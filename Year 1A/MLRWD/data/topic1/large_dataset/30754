It was 1933 the middle of the "Great Depression" Hollywood was looking for a way to boost the American morale.  Musicals had run there toll with the primitive sound systems & frozen camera shots.  Along comes Warner Brothers Studios, "42nd Street" script, Harry Warren / Al Dubin delightful songs, Busby Berkelry dance choreographer (predessor to Bob Fosse)larger than life dance productions & a budget of $400,000 (unheard of for musicals, especially during the depression).  The results a revolutionary film that set the standards for the "Hollywood Musicals" forever.  Note: Berkeley revolultionized Hollywood musicals in the 1930's & 40', staging elaborate dance productions with scores of dancers. Creating massive geometric dance routines with his patented "top shot" (overhead) & arial shots moving the camera from the floor creating many new & unique camera angles forever changing the way movies especially,  musicals were filmed.  
Now this great Warner Brothers musical has been digitally restored & transferred to DVD with outstanding viewing & listening quality!!!  Excellent DVD package with several extras capturing the behind the scenes & backlot Warner Brothers Studios segments.
Summary: The story focuses on a hopeful & sincere starlet played by Ruby Keeler (her film debut from Broadway), who is initially cast as a nameless chorus girl.  She wins us over & we are therefore involved in the film as she stuggles to "make it" in the glorious world of show business.  With a great 30's supporting cast, a great musical score by Warren/Dubin, Dance choreography by Busby Berkeley we have a very entertaining movie musical.  (Watch for a young Ginger Rogers as another supporting chorus girl).  
A great period film of the "Great Depression", early years of Hollywood, the evolution of the "Movie Musical" & the amazing choreography of Busby Berkeley captured forever on this fantastic DVD.  Enjoy.
