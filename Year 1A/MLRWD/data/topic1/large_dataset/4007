Kickboxing - It's the sport of the future!  Reviewer: BeatHepcat from Southern California  First impressions can be deceiving. Take Diane Court (Ione Skye) Class Valedictorian, a wealthy father, going to England on a  scholarship - smarter than anyone else in her whole high school. What  chance does a lowly, non-scholastic optimist like Lloyd Dobler (John  Cusack) have with a girl who's as beautiful to boot as she is smart? You'd  be surprised. Like the rest of us, there's a world of misunderstandings  that lie within her. The girl that's on top of the world is very, very  insecure. Add to that a serious scandal her father gets in and you'll know  why she favors the silly, but compassionate kickboxer. He's not as silly as  you might think and provides the kind of rock solid friend we all wish we  had. Lili Taylor adds wonderful comedy relief as Corey - Lloyd's tragically  funny best friend. And John's real-life sister, Joan, rounds out the cast.  How well do you know the people that you are close to. Can you really say  anything to them? John Cusack shows us how it's done.
