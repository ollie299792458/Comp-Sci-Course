This is not the funniest, most interesting, or most well written comedy I have ever seen. It isn't going to win any prizes, and it isn't going to be a cult classic, or any sort of classic. If you are looking for complex characterization, or meaning beyond the movie's obvious message, then you are going to be sorely disappointed by "Dodgeball".

But it is funny.

Vince Vaughn plays Peter LeFleur, the owner of a gym called Average Joe's, where the clientele is a regular troupe of misfits. Peter has to come up with 50K in order to save his gym from being bought out by Globo-Gym, run by Ben Stiller's over the top work out guru, White Goodman. In order to raise the money to save the gym, LeFleur and his misfit friends enter a dodgeball tournament.

Ben Stiller is stand out hilarious. The scene with the pizza slice is probably one of the funniest I have seen in any goofball movie in years. Everyone involved with this movie, however, does a great job.

If you like slapstick toilet humor done right, this is the movie for you. If you are looking for "intelligent" comedy, role models, or morality, search elsewhere. Take this movie for what it is, and you will enjoy every silly moment of it.
