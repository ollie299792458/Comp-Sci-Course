I was fortunate enough to enjo the first American Screening of Tim Sulivan's "2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams" at the Dallas Frightmare Weekend in Dallas Texas.

I loved the first film. But this one absolutely exceeded any expectations that I may have had.

The recasting of Bill Moseley immediately brings a whole new level of intensity to the Maniacs. Returning to the Maniacs are Christa Campell, who gets the screen time that she deserved in the first installment (and she gets a couple of scantily clad partners in crime!)along with horror legend Lin Shaye as Granny Boone. The boys from the first installment mostly return, though ladies man Harper Alexander is given whole new heat by the well loved Ogre (Skinny Puppy)

But this is no REPO...(though I did love REPO)

Instead, the kills are much more aggressive-and start almost immediately. But the new adventures on the Maniacs take them on the raod...where they make friends with some reality show types.

What I really want to know is where the hell Katy Marie Johnson came from. She and Asa Hope play off the debutante party girls like they were born for the roles. Katy has a completely freaky resemblence to Paris Hilton. Sometimes to the degree that you think it actually may be Hilton, but then you realzie that Paris Hilton would never be cool enough to appear in this film. Oh, irony.

Even the man candy in this film is hotter. Christopher McDaniel brings some pretty boy back to the Maniacs with his "brothers"-returning Lester and Hucklebilly.

All in all, this movie was unapolagetically offensive, gratuitiously gorey, and very very well done. Tim Sullivan is a horror genius, and he is not afraid to take chances. He obviously revels in pushing the envelope, and with Field Of Screams, he makes his point. And then some...

I absolutely reccomend this to any fan of grindhouse horror, and everyone who loves the original
