I read The Hiding Place years ago, and when I came across the DVD, I had to buy it.  The quality of the movie itself is fairly poor.  But it was filmed years ago, and I'm sure with a low budget.  I would also like to see it remade with the budgeting, acting and screenplay worthy of this amazing true story.

The story itself is absolutely beautiful and moving.  The faith this family had, to put themselves at risk to help others oppressed by Nazi tyranism, is incredible.  Now that I'm a mother, I see the story in a whole new light, and wonder would I have the courage and faith to help others as these truly heroic people did during WWII.  The movie covers a lot of what's in the book, but cannot do the book justice.  You must read the book to really understand how these women can have so much faith and hope in such dire circumstances.  It is not blind faith, or wishful thinking.  These women truly knew their Lord and Savior, and it was through Him that they were able to bear such an incredibly heavy burden and still be able to love and help others.  As was said in an earlier review, He was their Hiding Place.

But I am very disappointed that the movie didn't cover one of the most humbling and touching parts of the book; the very end, where Corrie meets one of the guards from Ravensbruk, and is forced to confront him.  This movie offers all that she went through, and then shows that she's released.  But it doesn't continue on with the story!!!  Instead, you are left with a heavy feeling of sadness for how horrible and evil some people can be.  If the movie had continued with the story, you would see how Corrie's faith helped her overcome in the concentration camp AND the wounds that could've scarred her for the rest of her life.  If you're not much of a reader, watch the movie, but realize there's so much more available to you if you read the book.
