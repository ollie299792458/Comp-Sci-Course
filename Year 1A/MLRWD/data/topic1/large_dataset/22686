A sickly sweet tale of witchery or a whimsical take on love? How much you enjoy this movie probably depends as much on how you feel about the stars as about the subject. Nicole Kidman is great as the wild one and Sandra Bullock perfect as the romantic dreamer. Dianne Weist and stockard Channing are scene stealers as the two aunts who embrace being a witch.  The story follows two witch sisters as they have very different experiences in love and relationships. Aidan Quinn and Goran Visjnic supply the male interest even though both have little to do and do very little with it. But that doesn't matter as this film really belongs to the women, including the little girls playing Bullock's daughters.  A tale of true love, curses and possesion this is quite a unique film in all it's elements and as such deserves to be watched. Many may be turned off by the subject but this film does have may things to offer. But be warned if you don't have a sweet tooth it's probably best to avoid it. If you are a Sandra Bullock or Nicole Kidman fan then you will probably be captivated.
