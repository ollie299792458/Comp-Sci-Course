Deepa Mehta has a decipline, as director, that I have not seen in a long long time. She knows when enough is enough, where subtl-ty is effective, and how to show rather than tell a story. I will certianly watch more of her productions. The refreshing discipline of Mehta coupled with stellar performances by the natural Sabana Azmi and intoxicating Nandita Das is visual poetry, spiritual magic for anyone who has ever dared to be different. The things un-spoken by the actors, love-trust-respect, ring humbly in my heart as I watch the film, and, although Azmi and Das deliver passionate enactments of their mutual affection, Mehta depicts these acts with tact and respect for the institution of love. Indecency is never an issue in "Fire". The film enlivens a sense of hope in the viewer for the two brave "HEROS" who take a risk on the forbidden in a place and time filled with animosity for their contentment. For potential screenwriters and filmakers, "Fire" is ladened with lessons on "story showing", and, the effectiveness of "subtl-ty" in cinema. The acting also holds something special for anyone interested in the craft.
