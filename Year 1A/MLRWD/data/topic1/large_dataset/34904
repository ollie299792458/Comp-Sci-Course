Sweet Home Alabama is a must see movie!  This is a movie that many can relate to.  Especially, if you are from a small town, going through divorce, in love, or live in the south.  The display of humor throughout the movie really catches your attention and makes it a movie that you can not stop watching once you have started!  Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job playing her role as the soon to be wife of a New Yorker and a wife to her high school sweetheart.  Her two roles helps the viewers see the two totally different "worlds" connect and how different they truly are.  Once you start the movie, viewers may think that they know how it is going to end and stop watching the movie.  There are twists throughout the movie that make it really worth watching.  Although, it might be known or seen as a "chick flick", it can appeal to all genders.  Parents might want to be careful and watch it first before their children because there is cursing throughout the movie.  I recommend going and renting or buying Sweet Home Alabama it is truly a must see movie!
