Certainly, it is yet another disaster movie, but we film-goers have a huge appetite for disasters.  The film makers will keep making them as long as we keep paying to watch them.  In my opinion some reviewers have been too harsh about this one.  It's not bad, as disaster movies go.  There are some very good special effects that save it from being the unworthy crock some people are suggesting.
In this film, the Northern hemisphere is covered by big, rotating clouds - there are 3 of them: one for Canada/USA, one for Europe and one for Siberia.  The heroes are American (of course) with a nod to a small knot of British climatologists (or meteorologists) shivering over their tea and biscuits in Scotland.  The warnings about possible climate change, brought about by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and hacking and burning forests, had been largely ignored by those in the strongest position to do something about it.  And now it's too late.  The switch to colder global temperatures has been flipped.  The genii is out of the bottle and cannot be put back.  The course of events is inexorable.  The polar ice begins to melt at an alarming rate.  The Atlantic conveyor (the ocean current that carries warm water to the cold regions where it gets all cold and salty so that it sinks and flows back to the warmer regions) is altered when a critical desalination point is reached.  Climate stability is lost.  There are huge storms - unseasonable and in unexpected places.  Great flocks of birds fill the sky over New York - a portent of doom - flying south.  A huge dome of ocean crashes over Manhattan.  Those who survive the drowning are subjected to blizzards and rapid freezing.  Wolves stalk the streets.  People who are able to, flee south, where they find the Mexican border closed to them.  It all looks pretty grim.  There's been a sudden catastrophic climate change and the planet is plunged into a new ice age.
The quality of the cinematography and CGI, as good as they are, don't make a good story unnecessary, but they still help the film to be very enjoyable despite a high degree of schmaltz.  The wolves are obviously computer generated (just as well because one of them gets a series of vicious clouts with a torch and a couple of them have bone-crushing collisions with walls and doors) but the flocks of birds and the movement of water, snow and ice are very realistic. The acting and the dialogue are not bad but the human interest element of the story really is a bit sickly.  Now that I've watched the film a few times, I find I just skip all the emotional goo and go straight to the entertaining parts - mostly the special effects.  Examples that impressed and entertained me (the sort of clips they show on the trailers):
 the breaking off of the Larsen B Antarctic ice shelf
 the rash of tornados tearing Los Angeles apart
 the huge wave that crashed over the statue of liberty and into New York
 the quick freeze flag
 the discovery in the library of a section of publications on tax law that nobody - not even the most devoted bibliophile - would mind burning in order to keep warm
There are a few extras.  The commentaries are fairly interesting.  The trailers are useful.  I now know that I want to see "I Robot" and also "Alien vs. Predator" looks interesting though we only see the 'creature workshop' and not any part of the film.  The menu programme on this single disc edition is not too good.  If you press the menu button, instead of going back to the menu, as happens with most DVDs, this takes you straight back to the interminable warnings about pirating films and you can't skip them.  So best not to press the menu button if you just wanted to select a different scene for example.  On balance, I think this is an entertaining film and well worth the price.  If you like disaster films, you should enjoy this.
