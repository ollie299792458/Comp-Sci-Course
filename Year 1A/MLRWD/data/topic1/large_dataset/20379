I was very excited when I learned that Family Ties was coming to DVD and I couldn't wait to purchase my own set. To me the show is entertaining, the actors are sharp and witty, and the plot lines are good although I must admit being an older adult now, I was shocked and disappointed at Mr. keatons somewhat apathetic and cavalier attitude with Alex's poor behavior choice in the episode "summer of 82". I will not revisit some of the other reviewers complaints, however in my opinion I feel that the fans who pay $30-$40 to own this set deserve better. First the packaging, the 1st disk is fixed to the inside cover of the case, that in itself does not necessarily pose a problem. It does However when your episode list is behind it and you have to remove and hold the disk in order to view the written preview of the episodes. Other sets I own come with a separate episode guide which you can remove and view what's on the disks while not handling them, but not with this set. Next the 4th disk is fixed to the inside back cover of the case and therefore blocking the other side of the episode list so again to read those episodes you have to remove the disk and hold it, come on let's think about this, what would it have taken to include a separate small episode guide that you can remove and read without removing and handling the disks?? I just don't get it...  Lastly, it seems to me that the color on a few episodes is not the greatest it appears to have an orange tint, so I don't know what happened there although the sound is good and clear. I would certainly hope that the future releases are improved upon in the areas necessary so fans can really be happy with what they purchase.
