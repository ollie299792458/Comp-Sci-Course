This is the best horror movie you could see, If you love horror movies with scary dialouge, great actor's, dead bodies and gore then you'll love this movie as much as I do.
 I first saw this movie when I was getting ready to go to a party, I started watching it after it had been on for the first 10 minutes and didn't see the opening where they hit the man, and left when helen was at her show, I was mad that I had missed so much and that I had to leave, but when I got home and turned on my t.v., low and behold it was on again, but I still missed the begining, Then a few day's later, lucky me, my dad rented me the movie, (he didn't read the back) I wasn't allowed to see rated R movies then, and my mom couldn't read that it was rated R and didn't ask, the next day she found out and said I couldn't watch it again, AND IT WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE! But now that I'm turning 14 I'm going to buy it! You should 2! There's are alot of profanitys and violence and gore. THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
