What a movie,this is a must see!
The action is so detailed,way up spectacular!
I had no idea what i was in for,the first time i've viewed it when it came out,now seeing it for the second time,all the action,car chashes,bloody fights,and i mean bloody,the whipping of the chained knife,and more the ninjas popping in and out of the dark,
not knowing when they will appear,all seems so fresh.
 one of the best scenes,and there are many, was when Raizo was chased down the street in heavy traffic by one of the warriors,ok the hole car chase scene from the beinging! fast action thru out the film.
I injoyed the action,and relationship between Raizo,and the two female characters,from when Raizo was a child all the way up to when he meets female agent(Naomie Harris)which was in 28 Days Later,and Miami Vice Movie.
The back ground colors,were all done very well to pull you into the movie action,and the characters atmosphere.
You won't go wrong buying this collectable movie,you won't!
