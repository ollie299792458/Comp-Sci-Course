I chose this as a birthday gift for myself.  For years I remembered the story, or at least bits of it, I remembered Roberta Shore (here called Jimmie Shore) and the song "Don't Jump To Conclusions" or at least parts of it.  It was a sweet, if odd story, where an orphan goes to live with a maiden aunt and uncle (don't laugh, I had several maiden aunts and uncles).  Her adventured included fitting in with the wealthier crowd, yet having fun with the farm girl who delivered the family's eggs and milk (remember when we had a milkman and a bread man???).  She was shabbily treated by one girl who was jealous of Annette's popularity, and the typical story ensued.

I loved it!  I would rather watch this every week than see some of the reality junk they have on TV!  I will watch it again in six months or so, just for the atmosphere of the fifties and sixties.  It may seem odd to today's young people, but I ate it up when I was a little girl!
