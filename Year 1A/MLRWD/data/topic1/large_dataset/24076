I am suprised every time I talk to someone about New York, New York, they tell me they havent seen it! I know I come from a different generation being the young age of twentythree, but I am a devoted fan of Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro. Being another collaboration from these two cinematic greats should lead you to believe more of the younger movie buffs should have seen it by now. We all talk about the usual Scorcese pics and gawk over how amazing Taxi Driver or Goodfellas is. On that note I just want to brag about the beautiful and touching picture about two creative people and their struggle to love each other and at the same time be creatively successful. Liza Minnelli is brilliant as Francine Evans and does nothing to bring the picture down. In fact after Caberet, this is the only other role I've seen her in. In any case she doesnt disappoint and actually comes off very sexy! Her eyes glow throughout he entire picture and especially in the opening ballroom scene. Robert DeNiro is always great as we all know but he really suprised me here with the character Jimmy Doyle. His razor-sharp toungue spits out the mostly improved dialogue with such fury that it sets the screen on fire. He is also very, very funny. Its also a very personal film obviously to Scorcese considering that it practically mirrored his personal life at the time of filming. Im not going to go into details but if you are a Scorcese admirerer, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. All in all, this is a movie that every movie lover, young or old, should get aquianted with. Scorcese's deft direction, along with the trancendant art direction and performances and with all the music including the title track, this is one gem you shouldnt miss!
