I love this movie.  According to Wikipedia, there were two versions of the script, one in 1951 as a Broadway production and then the 1969 movie version, currently on DVD, with Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood.  Another libretto was prepared for a 2007 stage version that was performed in Oregon.  Although I never saw the original Broadway play, I would have been two years old when it opened, I do remember often hearing the song "They Call the Wind Maria (pronounced Mariah)" on the radio.  I did see the film when it was released and loved it.  So, I recently decided to view it again.
For people too young to know, Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood are best known for their cowboy, tough-guy macho images and that is what lends much of the charm to this movie of a drunken Lee Marvin (Ben Rumson) and an honest, dependable Clint Eastwood (Partner)who are both prospecting for gold against the background of sinful No Name City.  Jean Seberg, a lovely young woman, is the third cast member. The songs are memorable and charming.  The actors are terrific and the movie is hilarious.  Although I love the 1969 film cast, I hope that someone will produce a revised version in order to bring this script to the attention of younger audiences.
