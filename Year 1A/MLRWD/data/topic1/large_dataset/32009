such a controversial, engrossing film about larry and althea, who suprisingly have a wonderfully entertaining relationship and about larry's published hustler. all of it sparked and still does, up all sorts of arguments about the rights of "porn" and the first ammendment. you have to relize that you are gonna learn a lot from this film, and about the person next to you, from debating and all, when you watch this film. one of my favorite films, with such great characters that all seem to hold a common chemistry. its a great movie based on the rights of people and their uh... entertainment (some thought the movie was bad and that all should just dump something they hate in the trash, but that doesnt mean everyone hates that particular thing), and asking the nations questions likeb'has porn gone too far and/or should it just be taken out permanently? are these people pigs or what.'  It doesnt take half a brain to relize that not everyone is going to enjoy this film. but if you like any of the actors, the story, porn, rights or whatever and have a free mind go ahead and watch.  at the very least you should find out something about your beliefs, whatever they may be, and will find it entertaining.  it most likely will become a favorite of yours too.  such a great director and cast. woody and courtney love do a completely brilliant job.
