Except for Jacques, I disagree with most of the reviewers, especially the professional reviewer.

Classical dance is a "dead art" anchored in the 19th century. It has no real connection to the culture of late 20th century USA. The steel industry in America - a dying industry in a dying industrialized town (Pittsburg). What is neeeded is  genius to revitalize what is now dying or irrelevant. Enter Alex. Scenes shot in the flashdance bar clearly show she is not the best dancer, her strength is somewhere else. During the course of the movie the camera dwells on the street breakdancers, the cop directing traffic, the efforts of her friend, the failed figure skater. Until the climax we never see the full dance routine for her rehearsal at the classical dance school. When we see it it's clear Alex has borrowed from everybody - the dancers at the bar, the cop, the breakdancers, her friend the skater. It's all there in the rehearsal routine. New art is born, art relevant to Americans of the late 20th century. This is what genius is.

When the film ends it helps some of us believe that there is hope too for Pittsburg, the steel industry, all of us.
