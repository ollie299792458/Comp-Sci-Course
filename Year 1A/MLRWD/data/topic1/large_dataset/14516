I agree with some of the reviewers' comments about Angelina Jolie, she is incredibly overrated, and I'm so tired of having her "perfection" shoved in my face!  I realize I'm in the minority here.  She actually looked better in CGI than she does in person!  They obviously tweaked her figure to make her even more attractive.  Most people don't seem to understand this... they think what they saw on screen was a 100% faithful representation of her real body.  Her face, yes... her figure?... no way!  I'm sure "adjustments" were made here and there.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't push her out of bed in the morning either, but I can find at least a dozen other actresses who are far more attractive and desirable.

And let's face it... Ray Winstone (Beowulf) looked nothing like his CGI character either!

With that out of the way, I thought Beowulf's character was very well written.  He was a flawed character, arrogant and sex-obsessed.  His desire for women became his undoing (I can relate to that haha).  His lack of will power, and always thinking with the wrong head got the better of him.  I read the original text (I own the Seamus Heaney translation), and I thought the script changes were genius.  Connecting the dragon to Grendel's mother and his past sins was brilliant.  In the end, he redeemed himself by slaying his son and saving his kingdom.  And Grendel's mother?  She still lives in that somber cave, waiting to tempt mankind once again.  And for those saying the ending left the movie wide open for a sequel, I completely disagree.  No sequel necessary, we "get" the ending!

Anybody else out there think his son looked like an Oscar statue? :D
