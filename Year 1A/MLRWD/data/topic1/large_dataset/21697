Let me start off by saying I don't know alot about the life Sylvia Plath. This film was an introduction for me. BUT it makes me want to know more. From that standpoint it accomplishes it's mission. After all isn't that the goal of a film (or book)?  I thought Gwyneth Paltrow did a steller job of communicating the small amount of joy and great dispair in Ms. Plath's life. IF the film is "spot on" with the facts of their life together there is NO QUESTION that Mr. Hughes CAN be blamed for Sylvia's demise. She wanted to go back to Devon and start over, and was in fact excited with the prospect of doing so. Mr. Hughes was not. Mr. Hughes KNEW he had deeply hurt her, and knew of her past attempts, so WHY DID HE LEAVE HER?  If I loved someone like that I would NOT leave them this way. He knew she was struggling (with herself and the children) and should have been more of a help to her. Anyway, great job all around re the actors. An A+ film that conveys its storyline in a most successful way.
