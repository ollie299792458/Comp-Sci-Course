"Lars and the Real Girl" is like no film I've ever seen.  The actors, script, direction and production are nothing short of flawless.  While the premise may at first seem laughable, one finds oneself completely immersed in the in the plot and the unabashed humanity of all the characters.  Ryan Gosling gives his best performance to date; a character of abundant charm, innocence, courage and honesty.
His portrayal of the socially-phobic, "mentally ill" Lars is a singular remarkable achievement.  Every single actor is no less than perfect in their characterizations,particularly Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson.  Ms. Clarkson as the psychologist subtly treating Lars is the best example of a competent, caring mental health worker since Judd Hirsch in "Ordinary People."
The movie rejoices in the quiet tolerance and love that small-town citizens display, a genuine compassion without a trace of prejudice or resentment. Lars evolves because of the fearless nurturing exhibited by his family, co-workers, and all the populace who love him in the truest sense.  This film does its part to destroy the chronic stigma of mental illness in the U. S. A. better than any in recent memory. Its wit, charm, and message of recovery and renewal make it one worth seeing repeatedly; each view uncovers a previously overlooked gem. Once seen, the compulsion to share it with friends and family is irresistible.  This movie is all about bringing people together, and the undying compassion of the human spirit.  See it NOW, then share it with all those you love.
