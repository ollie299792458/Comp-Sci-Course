I just saw this movie today and I was amazed.  Most people who see this movie are either confused or horrified.  The way the book was written and the movie was directed surprisingly makes you cheer for the evil Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  With a serial killer name Buffalo Bill on the loose, Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee is assigned to interview a cannibalistic killer name Hannibal Lecter.  She ends up earning trust in Hannibal and he does to her what he does best: gets into her mind.  
Hannibal helped Clarice in finding Hannibal while still driving her to the brink of insanity with his eagerness to know about her troubled past.  Clarice Starling is played by Jodie Foster and Dr. Hannibal Lecter is played by Anthony Hopkins.  Both stars won Best Actress and Best Actor respectively, while the film's director and the film itself also won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture respectively.  This movie will stay in my fourteen year old mind for a while and most who see it face the same dilemna.
