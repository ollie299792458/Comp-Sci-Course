I had read good and bad critics about this movie but since I'm a fan of military history I decided to watch it myself and shape my own opinion. The film depicts in fine detail the colourful costumes of the period, the claustrophobic interiors of the early 19th century warships, the cruelty of the sea service, the severe discipline imposed on the crews and the primitive medical care of the unfortunates who were wounded in battle. Females are totaly abscent from this film and although this fact makes the movie a little bit dry it adds realism to the story and respects the historical truth.

The battle scenes are excellent, especially the first engagement between Jack Aubrey's ship HMS "Surprise" and his worthy French opponent "Acheron". The historical authenticity is well preserved, the music themes are very good and the scenario takes some interesting and unexpected twists. Russell Crowe is a convincing British captain although the other characters are less well developed during the film. Peter Weir has brought again to life the romantic and adventurous atmosphere of the excellent books on the subject like "The Wooden World" (N.A.M. Rodger), "Life in Nelson's Navy" (Dudley Pope), "Trafalgar" (Roy Adkins), "To Rule the Waves" (Arthur Herman) etc.
