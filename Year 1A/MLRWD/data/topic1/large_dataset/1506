Roger Moore finally hits his stride, in this, my personal favorite of the James Bond epics.  A thrilling throwback to the 60's Bonds has 007 going after demented millionaire Karl Stromberg (a smooth and scary Curt Jurgens), who plots to destroy the free world in order to rule an undersea kingdom of his own.  Assisting him is towering steel-toothed goon, Jaws (an even scarier Richard Kiel).  Jaws is the BEST Bond Henchman in history (at least in this Bond effort)!  He could even give Oddjob, or Tee Hee, a run for their money!  Barbara Bach is one of the best Bond girls as Anya Ammasova (aka: Agent XXX)!  One wishes that B-movie siren Caroline Munro had more screen time, as luscious femme-fatalle Naomi.  Non-stop action and gadgets gallore!  Gotta love that Lotus Esprit Submarine Car! Stunt skiier Rick Sylvester performs one of filmdom's greatest stunts.  His ski-jump off Mt. Asgard, is still a total jaw-dropper!  Production designer Ken Adams's best work since You Only Live Twice (the Academy justifiably gave Adams his long-overdue Oscar nomination for his work on the Bond series)!  Oscar winning composer Marvin Hamlisch also scored with nominations for Best Original Score and for Best Song.  70's crooner Carly Simon sings the classic Bond tune "Nobody Does It Better" with perfect tonality!  To me, this is the one Bond movie that has it ALL!
