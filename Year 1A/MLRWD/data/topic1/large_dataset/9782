We bought the DVD for our family and saw it for the first time on Easter Sunday. As in the Veggie tales videos and DVD's, the songs are catchy (in fact, they stick in your head like glue), the storyline is humorous and the Veggietales folks manage to teach a good lesson. In this case, the moral is that God is merciful and compassionate, that we should be the same, but Jonah just "didn't get the point" (he wanted God to destroy the Ninevites(sp), and in fact, was looking forward to witnessing their destruction). The Jonah tale ends just as is does in the Book of Jonah; my son had seen me reading the Bible, requested to see the Book of Jonah (thanks Veggietales people for inspiring him), and the Bible indicates that Jonah does not repent and show compassion towards others. Not a happy ending, which is why the Veggietales people probably wrapped the modern-day plot around it and ended the movie with a big musical number.
  My four-year-old has been watching the DVD almost every day and
has learned what "mercy" and "compassion" mean. In fact, this past Sunday was the Feast of Divine Mercy, and sure enough, when
the priest made the announcement during mass, my son picked up on the word "mercy" and related it to the Jonah DVD.
  We also enjoyed the second DVD; I especially enjoyed the studio tour and my son and teenage daughter liked the outtakes.
  In summation, I'm glad that we added this movie to our DVD/video collection. I just discovered Veggietales a couple of months ago (I checked  a few out of the local library). I wish I had known about the series 10 years ago, when my two teenagers were younger. However, all three of my children love to sing along with the CD's and sing-alongs, as well as watch the videos and DVD's. Shhhh...even I play some of the Veggietunes when I'm alone in the car. Those songs are TOO catchy! :)
