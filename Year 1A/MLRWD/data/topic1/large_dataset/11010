The Criterion Collection is the only version to buy and here is why:  This movie exists in the public domain because when the movie was released Universal did not include proper copyright notice in the film.  Anyone can print and release a version... and anyone does!

Universal refuses to reissue this movie on DVD.  Anyone can dupe a copy and sell it as their own.  There is only one verison worth owning.  Criterion, who has a long reputation for lovingly restoring movies was licensed to professionally transfer Charade from the original film elements.  All other versions are pieced together from butchered copies; horrible sound and picture with gaps in both, worse than the old official VHS copy that Universal released. I didn't find this out until I purchased one of the other versions and it was unwatchable and couldn't find an official Universal release for the film.

If you love this movie or are just a Cary Grant, Audry Hepburn, Walter Mathau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, or Donen/Stone fan, Criterion is the only way to watch this movie.  The Criterion is a 5 star pressing because while not perfect, it is a dated film, it is as good as this film will probably ever by seen.
