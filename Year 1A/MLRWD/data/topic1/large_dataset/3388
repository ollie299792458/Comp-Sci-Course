Overall I found this DVD pretty fun for cardio, it kept my heart rate up and in a constant, steady sweat.  The ballet-sculpt segment was pretty good for (mostly lower body) muscle toning, esp. considering no dumbbells are needed.

I agree with the other reviewer that the moves aren't authentic dance but dance-based/-derived movements, which I can live with since it's a cardio workout first and dance second (yes, precision of form and movements are important, but moreso for sculpting and not so much for a cardio exercise).  The routines are pretty varied, but kept brief enough so that I remembered all the moves.

Not so much a con, but I found it funny that the jazz, latin & funk background music sounded pretty much the same with just a few nuances that are different.  Another nitpick is the backup performers aren't in sync with Denise's movements from time to time (you would think they'd at least take that out during editing!)

All in all a fun workout, but don't expect to get positive looks if trying to pull these off in a club.
