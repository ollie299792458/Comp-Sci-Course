I was lucky enough to be able to see this when it aired on television almost 20 years ago. After watching the newer George Harrison documentary, I decided to give this one another look, and I'm glad I did. This set is even more special when you remember that George left us less than ten years after it was produced. The stories they tell are interesting, as well as the fact that they don't all remember things the same way (especially funny is the fact that Paul says he doesn't want to take credit for the creation of Magical Mystery Tour).
I bought this set used, and all the DVDs played fine except in one spot: at the end of the segment about Brian Epstein's death, a picture of Epstein appears on the screen along with his years of birth and death. My DVD stops dead in that spot. At first I thought it was dramatic effect, but it went on for too long, and I had to restart the disc again to go on to the next segment. Very strange and spooky.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a Beatle fan, or even those who just like history or are curious about the '60s. The Beatles changed our culture in so many ways that people should hear them talk about the phenomenon in their own words, and not just read those of third parties who were not there.
