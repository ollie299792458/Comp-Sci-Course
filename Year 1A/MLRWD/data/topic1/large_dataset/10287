This is not a review of the movie since there are many here much better than I could write.
I would like to point out this is the best assembled collection of material for a movie.
Disc 1 contains the 'Theatrical' version and is wonderfully restored and has 5.1 stereo.
Disc 2 is where the collection shines. The only criticism I have is that they chose to have this material on a double sided disc (meaning you have to physically flip the disc to play 'side B.') This contains (Side A) the "Roadshow' version. (Two short intros are included to explain what 'Roadshow' versions of movies were.) And although the color is faded and the print isn't restored - this version is really the 'director's cut' and if you like the movie this version is a must see and makes the collection outstanding. It includes many cut scenes which add to the enjoyment of the film.
Disc 2 also includes many fascinating documentaries - I never knew they actually built the ship for the movie!
I was pleasantly surprised to also find included a miniature reproduction of the Roadshow Souvenir Book (1966) and four mini lobby cards. This package will be appreciated by anyone who likes this film and I am pleased Fox went to all this effort when so many other 'special collections' are disappointing. If only all worthy movies were given such a treatment!
If you are a fan of this movie then you must have this collection.
One final personal note - I feel this is Richard Crenna's finest role which can be overlooked considering the other talented performances in this wonderful movie.
