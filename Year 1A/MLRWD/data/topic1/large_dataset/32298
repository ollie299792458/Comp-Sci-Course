This is a better experience on DVD, because if you see it in a theater, it becomes a distorted experience with people carrying on and hissing.  It has become a camp classic, but it's really a classic, and when you see it alone, you realize certain things about it that are not apparent in a screaming audience.
  1) Shearer's performance is excellent -- and in the least flashy role.
  2) The whole movie is a case of bizarre casting that worked surprisingly well.  Three examples:
  a)Shearer.  She didn't play women like this usually.  She played sexually sophisticated ladies -- even after the Production Code.  But she brings a probity to this role that has become inextricably linked with her cinematic image (to a degree that has actually done her a disservice) mainly because she is so good here.
  b) Crawford.  She is supposed to be sexy young thing who steals away Shearer's husband.  But Crawford was at least ten years older than the role, and a good five years too old for the part.  At 35, she looked like a hard 40, and no younger than Shearer.  It's hard to conceive of any man dumping his family for such an obvious barricuda -- especially one who looks like a guy in drag.  And YET -- she's great in the role.  A lot of fun.  And Crawford, as she often did, brings all of her bitterness and resentment to the role, and it works.
  c) Rosalind Russell.  Who'd have ever thought she had THAT in her.

  Also check out Paulette Godard, again, different from anything else she ever did (and looking better than anybody in the movie.)  Now GODARD is what Crystal was SUPPOSED to look like -- not like Wallace Beery in a bathtub.
