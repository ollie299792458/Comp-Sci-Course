For starters, I will assume that anyone reading this has seen the movie and thus I will not spend time talking about what a fun (if a little bit campy) action flick this is.

Out of the dozen or so Blu-ray movies I've seen so far, this was the least impressive.  I'm avoiding using words like "disappointing" because it isn't--the picture quality is amazing.  The lossless audio track, however, left something to be desired.  It just didn't impress the way tracks from movies like "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "The Patriot" do.

Also--and this could just be old age setting in--but I could swear there's some missing scenes from the theatrical version.  The Bonus Features on this disc are impressively packed, with many deleted scenes and other extras.  I could be wrong, so I won't count against it in the review, but it seems shorter than it should be.

That said, if you are a Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez or Colin Ferrell fan, this is a great flick to own.  It's unfortunate that L.L. didn't have more screen time as his performances are always over-the-top in an entertaining way.  My advice?  Wait for a good sale on this one and snap it up.  It'll make a great addition to your Blu library.
