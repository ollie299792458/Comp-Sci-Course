We are all fans of DSOTM, you know.

This symphonic rock concept album changed expectations of rock music forever.  Roger Waters and the Floyd developed their theme in this album the way a great symphonist from the 18th Century develops one.

DSOTM transcends all other concept albums in this development.  It is unique in Rock history.

This DVD, on of the Classic Album Series, is the story of this development.  It is, by the way, the best of all the "Classic Albums" DVD's in my opinion.

Of course, the technical aspects are covered in detail ("just how did they synch all those clocks?") and looking over the mixing board and listening in on the original tapes is really fun.

Even better is how the artists each reproduce performances which are then synched with the album.  Every time this happens, it's magical to watch.

But the best part of this DVD is how each artist in turn lays down his rancor and tells the story of how this magical album comes together.  In the end, they are simple and honest, each realizing that the other contributed some part of this thing that became much greater than the whole.

Pink Floyd will likely never collaborate again;  maybe they've said what they had to say.  For sure,  all the anger that flowed between them would be a giant ogre sitting on their shoulders.  So it's really nice to see this DVD, where they pay homage to each other, and to the incredible thing they made decades ago.
