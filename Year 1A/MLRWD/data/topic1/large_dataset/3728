Beware of some of the other reviews. Their gushing praise smacks of people involved in the production. The trailer makes this thing look like an interesting movie but it actually plays out in such a ridiculous way that it's impossible to take it seriously as a 'horror movie'. This is a COMEDY, it is NOT a horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Sure people do sick things to each other but most of the time they constantly say such goofy things that NOBODY would ever say in real life (or even in a half-way decent movie) that it just takes you right out of everything and becomes one big ugly wink at the audience. There's a way to do comedy mixed with horror but this movie was clearly made by a comedy team who simply want money from horror audiences. Well, we're not all that gullible. I know a rip-off when I see one and I just saw one. The majority of the running time is just this guy getting humiliated like it's some feminist fetish video. Also most people will probably HATE the ending. Save your money and keep looking. This is a really goofy stinker with a misleading trailer geared to rip-off horror fans.
