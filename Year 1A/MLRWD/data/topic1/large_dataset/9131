Jeremiah Johnson was one of the first westerns to look at its subject  matter minus the mythic notions that usually surround the genre.  It's also  interesting for not being about Cowboys and Indians or Range Wars or  Outlaws on the Run, but about the singular experiences of the trapper,  often lost in the Popular West and who more than any other western  archetype defined the ideal of the loner leading a life free of European  civilization and law.  The film is sympathetic to this and relies more on  its suggestion than any blatant statements of individuality.  For its  subtlety it is all the more powerful:  the landscape itself becomes a lead,  and the stoicism of the relationships between characters is broken by Will  Geer's hell-for-leather rascality and the eruption of Redford's quiet rage.  Based on Vardis Fisher's masterpiece novel Mountain Man, which in turn was  based on the real experiences of John "Liver-Eating" Johnston,  Jeremiah Johnson could be loosely categorized with films like McCabe and  Mrs. Miller and The Gray Fox, or even those films that achieve clarity  through humor or satire (although some would say these are not satires at  all) like Little Big Man, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, and Butch Cassidy  and the Sundance Kid.  The action is visceral, the hero is also a villain,  and the end is oddly uplifting.
