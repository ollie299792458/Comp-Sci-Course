This is fantastic stuff. Sandler plays Robbie -  a genuinely sweet guy who is a failed rock star and now makes money singing at people's weddings. His wife-to-be dumps him at the alter and leaves him with a crushed heart that almost results in a nervous breakdown.
He is befriended by a young waitress named Julia (played by Drew Barrymore) who helps him to pick up the pieces of his heart. Robbie falls for her charms and ends up falling in love with her, but she is already engaged to a complete loser who cheats on her and basically doesn't care. 
It's now left to Robbie to make Julia know that they were made for each other, whatever the cost - even if it means getting a plane to Las Vegas to try and stop her getting married to her loser of a fiance.
All set in 1985, this romantic comedy has all the elements to make everyone feel good afterwards. The soundtrack is amazing, Sandler is on top form and Drew Barrymore has never been more adoreable in a movie. The plot is a bit derivative but you can just ignore that and concentrate on the comedy because there are a lot of laugh out loud scenes - especially, the drunken best man speech (played by the brilliant Steve Buscemi)
Enjoy!!!!!!!!
