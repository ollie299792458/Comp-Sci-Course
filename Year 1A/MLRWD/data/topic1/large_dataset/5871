This movie is basically Fatal Attraction in high school. And so far, half the reviews I've read tore it apart and the other half said it was good for what it was. I share the latter sentiment. 
This film (which I believe is the first Fatal Attraction clone of the new millennium) virtually takes the script for the original, or even the true original, Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me, and reworks it so it's set at a New Jersey high school, and that's its' major problem. Other than that, this tale of Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford), a happy, healthy kid on his way to a swimming scholarship with a nice girlfriend Amy Miller (Shiri Appleby) who is seduced into a one-night stand with Madison Bell (Erika Christensen, who gives the best performance in the movie), who won't go away afterwards and turns deadly later, is quite watchable.
What makes it watchable is that the director, John Polson, knows his genre and handles the action well enough to make you forget how bad the script is. The young cast, particularly Traffic's Erika Christensen, who is absolutely brilliant here, also works hard to bring life to their underwritten characters and most of them succeed.
I recommend this, although I don't know how many people I recommend it to will see it more than once. I like this movie just fine for what it is, for it is little more than a popcorn film, but I can't blame people who didn't.
