This film while being an interesting human drama showing the helplessness of free will determining destiny - a common theme in so many middle eastern films.  It is above all else a window into how little difference there is living a middle class life in Iran today vs. here.  I was constantly surprised at the creature comfort (mod cons) level of what I assumed are a typical Iranian family.  The problems of dealing with government justice and day to day moral issues in a Muslim society mirrored themes familiar to us here.  The characters where complex and all the more interesting because of their religious paradigms.  The patience and familial interactions were admirable and the theme, while overlaid with the social requirements that are unique to that country, can't avoid being compared to lives here.  I think this film is very watchable and works to take you to highs and lows as well as any movie I have seen lately.  I would recommend it to those who are interested in finding out what life in non-war Iran is like.  If that part doesn't interest you, it is still a good story.
