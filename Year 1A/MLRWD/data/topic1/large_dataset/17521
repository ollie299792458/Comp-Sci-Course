A Fellini movie is never about the "plot" -- it's about the images, the music, the mood and the vast tapestry of human lives being lived that he conjures. In this affectionate memoir of growing up during the Fascist era in a seaside town, the old master delivers a final, wistful performance. What we get here is a complete picture of an era shown through the eyes of an adolescent.
Yes, the familiar Fellini types inhabit this movie -- the women with massive breasts and bums, the toothless men, the priests, the temptestuous family members -- but in this movie the caricatures are toned down. A professorial narrator shows up from time to time, lecturing us on the history of the town -- and greeted with contemptuous farts by onlookers.
The music as usual is superb.
There is also a serious side to this gentle movie. The bumptious fascists are ridiculed for their ridiculous parades but they are also capable of serious abuse bordering on torture.
Of many stunning images, the scene of a huge luxury liner looming through the mists is perhaps the most memorable. But for me the final scene of a country wedding carried the biggest emotional wallop. The camera slowly retreats as the party breaks up until it is literally saying goodbye to the guests, the party, the memories -- and life itself. I don't know of any other scene in a movie that has the actual feel and quality of a memory.
