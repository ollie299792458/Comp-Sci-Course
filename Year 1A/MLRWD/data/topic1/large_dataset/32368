This outrageously hilarious picture from 1986 is already a classic. In Australia it has almost reached cult status, and I find that it glamorously portrays the American teenage lifestyle. A true American treasure!
Superb casting and acting make this teenage comedy stand out. It is one of those rare films in which the laughs cascade from one scene on to the next. There is never a dull passage. Memorable moments include a unique classroom scene with the teacher's inimitable method of sending the class to sleep, and no one ever forgets the freeze-frame with the Ferrari airborne to the Star Wars theme: brilliant!
The picture quality is excellent, remarkably brighter and crisper than those old VHS rental tapes. The picturesque footage of Chicago is both a credit to the production team and an appealing advertisement for the city itself.
The sound quality also does the exceptional soundtrack justice. Dolby Digital 5.1 and Widescreen as standard features, and a fascinating directors commentary make this DVD release worthy of the title. If you are after great comedy, this wont disappoint.
