Just got my Blu-ray version of "Alleged" and watched it.  I could tell from the opening menu it would be a quality piece of work... it was!  The cinematography, casting, costumes, props, acting are all top notch.  All the period pieces are stunning without drawing overmuch attention to themselves -- even the steam train, buildings and all.  Every detail is exquisite.  I liked the natural beauty of the Tennessee setting and the use of color and light, both inside and outside, with a variety of camera angles.  The orchestral music was classy without becoming overpowering.

The plot is an engaging story of love and moral conflict leading to a satisfying resolution, with a surprising and fun ending that will appeal to everyone.  By weaving the facts of the Scopes Trial around a story of two young lovers, the movie achieves a story-like appeal without being in-your-face about the creation-evolution controversy or coming across as a documentary.  Brian Denehy and Fred Thompson were perfect picks for Darrow and Bryan.  The H.L. Mencken character is a delightful devil worth some good hisses.  Throughout the film is seen the demoralizing, dehumanizing effect of Darwinism on individuals and society.

Compared to the darkness and arrogance of "Inherit the Wind," "Alleged" is warm, human and believable.  More importantly, it is based on true history that "Inherit the Wind" ignored or mangled.  I hope "Alleged" leaves "Inherit the Wind" in its dust and becomes the new Scopes Trial movie.
