Grab a 6-pack of Olympia beer for this one, it's schlock cinema at it's absolute finest! If you're looking for a twisted combination of gore, nudity, and cheese, it doesn't get much better than this. Humanoids From the Deep kicks the '80s off in fine fashion, with enough touches of '70s exploitation and '50s monster madness inserted to make this essential viewing for the cult horror fan.

Some fiendish/foolish scientists get to tinkering with mother nature in the lab, attempting to alter the genetics of the salmon in the small fishing village of Noyo. Bad idea docs...mo fish, mo problems. I'm talking major Salmonella sickness. The end result is a horde of horny fish monsters raping and pillaging the town in chaotic gory splendor.

This film is just good sick fun. I honestly believe every horror film needs a beautifully big-breasted chick running across the beach. Plus the gore effects and costumes here are simply great. If the idea of grotesque water monsters mounting hot naked chicks is potentially offensive to you, you might wanna skip this one. The sexual conquests are more than just implied here, although not nearly as graphic as say a Joe D'Amato film. This Corman classic also has a nice touch of humor and cheesiness to balance it out. Must see stuff!

Overall grade 4.5 stars. When you're fishing in the sea of sex, science, and violence...you're gonna need a bigger boat.
