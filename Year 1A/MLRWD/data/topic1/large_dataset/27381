I had barely heard of Anvil back in the 80's.  The bands logo refreshed my memory from the record stores or the rock magazines (i.e. Hit Parader, Circus, etc.) back then.

Never heard Anvil's music on Houston, TX rock stations but, then again, the Speed/Thrash Metal bands didn't get much airplay down here back then anyway.  It was always "word of mouth" down here that promoted this type of music....even with the Fab Four speed metal bands (i.e. Metallica, Megadeath, Anthrax, & Slayer).

I guess I am 30 years too late but that's ok.  Anvil's spirit kicks ass.  It is their spirit that keeps them going.  It is the bond between Lipps and Rob that is most certainly uncommon in modern times in all relationships accross the board.  Most have just given up after 1 year in the music industry.  Many fade away.  You could say the same for marriages, business, etc..

This band went to the ashes after a rise to what was considered "the top" of the metal world with many other bands.  After spending many years in the ashes, Anvil now has risen above the ashes with the help of this documentary and, quite frankly, their name.  A bitter sweet ending.....no, a bitter sweet beginning!

There are many things from this movie that all of us can take and apply to ourselves such as: 1. Strength 2. Perserverence 3. Commitment 4. True Friendship 5. Resilience 6. Love for making music 7. Love for Family 8. Believing 9. Faith 10. Hope 11. Conviction 12. Conflict 13. Barely making ends meet.....and on and on.

Friendship / Perserverence / Love / Hope 101 for all of us in some form or fashion.
