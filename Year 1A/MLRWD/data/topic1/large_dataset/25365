This film could stand as proof that style and imagination are more important than money and special effects.  Though made on a shoestring  budget, this is one of the most eerie and haunting films I've ever come  across, the kind of horror movie which really does leave a lasting  impression.
Out of three women involved in a car accident, only one  survives.  After managing to recover and start a new life in the city, the  survivor begins to find herself 'cut off' from the world, sometimes finds  nobody can see or hear her.  These are scenes anybody who has ever felt  alienated from society or lost in the world can easily identify with.  The  film is a wealth of unnerving images, such as the abandoned amusements park  and dance hall.
Another memorable aspect of the film is the dark-suited,  deathly-faced phantom who seems to lurk in every shadow.  Somehow I found  him a far more sinister and unnerving presence than Freddy or Jason.  It  must be the power of the imagination - the psychological threat of danger,  what might happen, is far more terrifying than simple acts of blood-letting  or violence.
All in all, this film is everything a horror film should be  - filled with haunting images, a sympathetic central character and a  clever, thought-provoking storyline.
