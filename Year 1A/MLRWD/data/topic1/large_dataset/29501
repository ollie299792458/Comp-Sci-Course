I saw this movie based on a rave review I read in FAngoria magazine and boy it sure as hell doesn't let down. Pete Jackson does an amazing job with a budget that looks to be lower than the first EVIL DEAD film (which was $... by the way). He pulls off mindblowing camera tricks and gore stunts, carving his way through a wisp of a plot about some aliens (disguised as humans) who have come to Earth to steal human corpses for their intergalactic fastfood chain. Jackson would develop more substantial plots later, and I suspect this fun little mindless flick was just his way of showing off his action direting muscle, as well as earning some bucks to put into his next film. BAD TASTE combines the splat-stick humor of EVIL DEAD films and trhe in-your-face attack of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE for a crazy ride. To check out a real scream of a hilariously sick film, check out Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES. And don't acuse the poor guy of selling out with the LORD films...it's good to see a horror director break into the mainstream...although I hope he goes back to this kind of stuff someday!!!
