Like another reviewer said, if you're coming to this movie with the mind set of catching some deep philosophical flick, turn around and walk away, this is not for you.

That being said, it's a great flick if you're 1. into martial arts and/or like great fight scenes or 2. love love love Rain and would appreciate seeing him in various degrees of disrobe or 3. Both of the above. I'm 3 so this satisfied all my needs. The movie was bloody as hell and was alternately a bit laughable and uncomfortable for that reason, but I found myself looking forward to the awesome fight scenes regardless, I learned something new about Rain as well, as I didn't know he was a martial artist as I haven't seen any Korean films and he is an excellent martial artist.

All in all a kick ass good time. Rain is a decent actor, he was neither over the top nor pitiful. The one thing that irritated me about the film was that the lead actress Naiomi Harris is a Brit, but she plays an American, why? I didn't get that because there was no back story to her character that would have deemed that necessary. A good flick though, I recommend.
