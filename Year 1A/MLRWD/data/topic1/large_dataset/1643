Afro Samurai Resurrection is the follow-up to the mini-series Afro Samurai that aired on Spike in 2007 and in my opinion it is better then the original in about every way. First off the story revolves around Sio the new number 1 who steals Afro's dads jaw so she can resurrect him. Of course Afro is not happy about this and sets out on a quest to find the number 2 headband and defeat Sio so he can get his father's jaw. Along his journey he is rejoined by Ninja Ninja and also has to battle with others from his past. When he finally finds Sio he must also defeat his former friend Jinno and his newly resurrected father. The soundtrack by the RZA is imo better then the originals as is the animation which features more colorful backgrounds then the original. You also get more background on Sio then you did for Justice in the original. The only weak part is the ending which I thought was alot worse then the originals ending. Also look for the reference to the beginning of the original. Overall, this is a must see for fans of the original and even if your not a fan you still should check this movie out.
