This DVD is a good overview of Paul's career from 1970-1980. What it does have is some good interviews with his daughter Mary. We see archival footage from tours, interviews and videos. Extras include the videos for Rockestra (1979), Jet (1976, from Rockshow), and Let 'Em In (same source). There is also a photo gallery of 100 pictures from 1970-1980 of the various incarnations of Wings. This is also a moving tribute to Linda.

However, there are no interviews with other band members. The discography has an error on it. Near the end Paul states he took some time off to raise his kids after Wings broke up in 1981. This is not entirely true. He would release Tug of War, Pipes of Peace and Give My Regards to Broad Street between 1982-1984. Paul would do well to release a video collection onto DVD of various promo videos. I think even a collection covering the Wingspan CD, from 1970-1984, would have been a good start. Overall this is a good documentary, but far from the complete word on Paul's post Beatles career.
