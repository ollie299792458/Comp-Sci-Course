Raymond Burr was one of our finest actors.  He could have kept our attention for an hour just reading addresses from the phone book.  As nine years on Perry Mason attest to, audiences loved him in the part.  "Ironside" brings him back as detective confined to a wheel chair.  Essentially, an arm-chair detective, no doubt inspired by another fictional detective, Nero Wolfe.  As such, "Ironside" suffers from the same problems as its predecessor, particularly that Ironside must delegate the legwork to others.  Ironside is far less likable than Perry Mason.  He's so rude to his staff, one wonders why they would put up with the abuse?  William Conrad, who played a similar role as "Canon" managed to balance the hard boiled detective with a man who also had a heart.  Ironside seems to have a perpetual chip on his shoulder, which makes him less likable.  The show also suffers from the "too many cooks" syndrome, there are four principals in the lead, Ironside, with a female and male police assistant and a caretaker, all in fairly stereotypical roles.  The female officer is seen doing all of the cooking and cleaning around the office, for example.  The shows seems remarkably similar to "The Streets of San Francisco," which offered far better chemistry between the two leads, Karl Malden and Michael Douglas.  In contrast, Ironside has too many people standing around in scenes, waiting to get their share of lines in.  This also makes for clumsy dialogue, where lines are passed from player to player to give them something to say.  That said, the character of Perry Mason was always more interesting when he played detective, so on that score, we get to see Burr at his best.
