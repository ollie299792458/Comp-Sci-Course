The video transfer on these DVDs is exceptionally good.  The black and white images are especially rich and deep.

I really like on-screen captioning on DVDs.  I am glad it is included on these dics.  All lot of DVDs have neither on-screen captioning or closed captioning, even on some major label releases.  I never noticed even one minor typo on these captions.  I also like how each caption is nicely positioned underneath whoever is doing the speaking.

It is hard to image how some network prime time TV series prior to the late 1960s, especially the half-hour shows, would have as many as 38 new episodes a year, meaning that a lot of episodes were never repeated until the series went into syndication.  Such is the case with "The Munsters".  Indeed, there are 38 episodes here on this DVD set which only includes the series' first year.  The "Twilight Zone" is another such series that had over 30 episodes per year.

1965 was the year when practically overnight, network TV made the transition to from black and white to color, especially during the TV Fall season premieres.  Fortunately, "The Munsters" was not forced to join in this really big change along with all the other returning TV series that year.

Another DVD label, Image Entertainment, had planned to release on the same date as this DVD set, a two-DVD set containing documentaries and bonus features about "The Munsters".  That DVD has been either scrapped or postponed.  I hope the material planned for that DVD release gets used somewhere, sometime, as I was really looking forward to seeing it.

I am sure I will also enjoy the DVD release of the series' second, final year and, with luck, maybe a new, authorized DVD release of the motion picture "Munster Go Home".
