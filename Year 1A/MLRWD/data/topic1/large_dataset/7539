If youre a lifelong comic book fan like i am, i can definitely tell you that Louis Letterier's reinterpretion of the Hulk mythos is much better than the 2003 Ang Lee version. Dont get me wrong, in many ways the 03 film has many admirable qualities, first of all Lee's dealing with the psychological underpinnings of Bruce Banner's conflict with his father, as well as the idea of the creature already inside of Bruce due to unethical experimentation by his scientist father (trying to create a perfect being), yet these story constructs can be found in the MARVEL Hulk stories of the last decade....however under Letteriers and Edward Norton's soulful, pathos driven portrait of Banner/Hulk, we are given a more streamlined, less angst ridden/more action driven story that still hints at psycho drama but in a way gives greater clarity to the tragedy of Banners plight....as for the villian of the piece we have the Abomination, one of the Hulk's greatest and most powerful adversaries, very well played by Tim Roth, William Hurt does wonders as General Ross although its Norton who truly drives this film as the tortured Banner...he really grasps the pathos of the character much like Bill Bixby did in the 70s series, you feel for him....without giving the story away, to those who thought the 03 film was too overblown, this is the Hulk comic fans know and loved for 40+ yrs, and the added elements of the beloved 70s tv series are here in full view (youll know em when you see em)....the dvd itself is fine, especially when you discover in the special features section the comic inspiration of one of the more touching moments in the film between the Hulk and his love, Betty Ross....my only complaint is the digital copy to be downloaded for your PC...why give me that if i  already have the actual dvd anyway, but if you want a copy of the film for on the go, i guess its ok...otherwise a good product for a fun film, grab it.
