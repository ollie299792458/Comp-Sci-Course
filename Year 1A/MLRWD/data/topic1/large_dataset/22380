Okay, I am one of those people who did not care for a certain other recent "critically acclaimed cinematic epic", so I was worried if I would enjoy this film because of its hype....and I honestly did.
The action sequences aren't as gratuitous as I had worried prior to watching, they flow nice and you instantly accept the fairy tale flight of these warriors. The plot is very intricate, but easy to follow, as the tale itself is sorta timeless. There are wonderful female characters in this film too and Michelle Yeowh (sp?) does marvelous acting (remember, this is all judged from subtitles and the power of her body language and eyes!).
The introduction of characters is nice and the pace of the story flows very nice with the exception of a 20+ minute flashback, however it all ties together in the end wonderfully. You won't find many twists or surprises per se, but the storyline is enough to keep you interested and ponder upon.
This is not a fancy kung-fu film. It focuses a lot on emotion and character desire and uses the ninja action to progress the plot.
The DVD itself is quite nice and has lots of basic features. The "Making of" documentary was a bit dissapointing if you are looking for how the special effects are done. Apparently, there is also an English over-dub track for those who don't want to read the subtitles. (I discovered this later, but have no regrets for watching the original manderin version). There are also a few basic interviews and filmographies.
Special features is not a reason to buy this DVD, the beauty of the widescreen cinematography and score is. When the film ended, I just sat there for a few minutes with a nice film to soak in.
