To put it bluntly, Jurassic Park 3 isn't as good as the other two
Jurassic Park films. Even so, JP3 is a riveting adventure film, set on a forest island filled with dinosaurs. The storyline concerns a thirteen year-old boy who becomes stranded on the dinosaur island in a motorboat crash. Then two tourists, a man and his wife, approach Alan Grant, a famous paleontologist, requesting that he fly them over the dinosaur island, for an aerial tour of the former Jurassic Park, now inhabited by living dinosaurs. But the tourists are not what they seem. The two tourists turn out to be the stranded boy's parents, determined to find their son. When Alan Grant refuses to land the plane on such a dangerous island, the tourist's companion knocks him out cold, then they land the plane. When a t-rex attacks the landed crew, they attempt to escape by taking off again. Instead, the plane crashes, and the crew finds themselves stranded. Now they must struggle to survive the dangerous island filled with dinosaurs. 
Jurassic Park 3 is a must-see to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park. However, one does not have to be a Jurassic Park fan in order to enjoy this movie. The film pulls off a surprise ending that will indeed surprise you. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi terror and violence.
