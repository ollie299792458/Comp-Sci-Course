As a history major, I've got to say that this movie totaly rocks. So it wasnt dead on history wise, but I'll forever see Napoleon porking out in Ice Cream and becoming a "Ziggey Piggy", Billey the Kid and  Socraties trying to make a pass at the 'mall babes', Sigmund Freud with a  "Kick Me" sign on his back, the look on ol' Abe Lincolin's face  when Ghengis Khan pulls him into the phone booth (I always was a reb at  heart), Gehengis trashing "Oshmans", Joan leading aerobics and  Motzart rocking out on synthesyzers. Not a history class that has mentioned  one or all of these figures has gone by without those images in my head,  and I always said if the Army sent me into combat i'd make sure to stop and  say "We're in the middle of a war dude!" to a buddy. This flick  is so much better than anything put out since in the genere, it makes me  think Hollywood has become a bunch of "Royal Ugly  Dudes"....especially the poor sequil to the Great One's Excellent  Adventure. Anyway- buy this flick, if it dosent make you crack up, you're  either as clueless about history as these two, or just a bogus person. AND  NOW OPENING FOR IRON MAIDEN! WYLD STALLIONS!!!
