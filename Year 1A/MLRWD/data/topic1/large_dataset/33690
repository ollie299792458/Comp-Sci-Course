This sequel to PRINCE OF DARKNESS quite possibly one of the more interesting films in the series. When a priest accidently cracks Dracula's icy tomb and bleeds on the vampire's lips, the Lord of the Undead has returned! Finding his castle sealed by a crucifix, Dracula takes revenge on the monsignor who did it by turning his glamorous daughter into the undead, and killing the monsignor himself. All goes well for Dracula until the girl's boyfriend Paul and Dracula's former slave chase Dracula to his castle where the fiend is once again sent to his doom. The only problem I can see is the continuity. It would have been better if the same castle set were reused. The makers should've seen the ending to PRINCE OF DARKNESS prior to making this one.Terrence Fisher is gone and his absense is very evident. However, this movie is extremely good and remains as one of the best films Hammer made. The monsignor should've had a bit more "oomph" in him if you know what I mean. Lee is phenomonal as always. However, I believe he is more effective and chilling as Dracula without lines. His expressions of savage evil and bloddy fangs in HORROR OF DRACULA scared me beyond belief! Go ahead and get this one. It's worth it - if you are Chris Lee fan and a Hammer fan!
