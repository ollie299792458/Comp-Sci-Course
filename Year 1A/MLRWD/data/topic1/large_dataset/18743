I bought this series to survive my vampire fix until "True Blood" season premiered.  It took me a while to get passed the immaturity and over-romanticised view our teens have on finding love.  Like 90210, I had a hard time buying into the notion that in a school of hundreds of students, only 6-7 students mattered to anyone there.  The Damien character irritated me severely but actually proved to be the character with the most depth, as the series continued.  Stefen is too "Edward Cullen" for me.  I can't help but think they could have been more original in providing the love interest of heroine, Elena, as "True Blood" did Sookie, w/ Bill. Dobrev is clearly the most beautiful heroine in a trendy genre that also includes "True Blood" and all "Twilight" sagas.  I watch it mainly for her.  I was very dissapointed to see the petite, cute and intellectual, Chino-American vampire leave the show. I always looked forward to her character as well. I also resented that they allowed lovely, Mia Kirchner to be so maternal and homely. I'm mainly sticking around for Dobrev and Candace Accola at this point, hoping for some improvement in the vampire erotica scenes.  The original air time "sucks" unless you're a teen.  I have to watch it on dvd after prime-time.
