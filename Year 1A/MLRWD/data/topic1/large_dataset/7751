I really liked Patriot because it is a departure from the revisionist history thinking that was so prevalent in the 90's. The film did have PC moments such as the "volunteer" slaves that were working for Mel, but that was probably put there to keep the film from being branded as racist by fourth rate film producers like Spike Lee. There were lots of reveiewers that have stated that the film was rather anti British. Yeah it was. In fact the whole revolutionary war was anti British. Just like WWII was anti German and Japanese. The portrayal of the British represents the nation as it was 200 years ago - not as it is now. I seriously doubt that anyone in Britan has ill feelings for the United states because we won the American Revolution. Get over the PC ... . We cant walk on eggshells every time we open our mouths or make a movie fearing that we may offend some segment of the entire world's population. I think that patriot was well acted and tells a good story depicting a war that not many of us know much about. I know there were a lot of African Americans who were offended at the lead character who was obviously a slave owner being glorified in the movie. Well, I've talked enough to date in other reviews about judging periods of history by current standards - nuff said. These same people wouldn't be happy unless you replaced the character of Abraham Lincoln in a movie with a black actor. This is a good movie, rather long but one that will entertain throughout.
