This film blew me away. It was incredibly intriguing. In fact, my mother was sitting in the next room and within thirty minutes had come in to finish the movie. Robin Williams sucked me in with his brilliant portrayal of a disturbed man.
Sy Parrish is a one-hour photo developer, and his favorite customers are the Yorkins. Nina (Connie Nielson) has been developing her family's photos there for years. Little does she know that Sy makes an extra print of every photo for himself to hang up on a wall in his apartment. Sy sees himself as a part of their family. But a disturbing obsession turns dangerous when Sy discovers a secret about Nina's husband, Will (Michael Vartan).
The climax scene is, with the exception of a scene in "Pulp Fiction", the most disturbing scene I have ever seen. It's brilliantly done by Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, and another woman (I don't want to give away the ending). 
A good movie is one that has an impact on you, and "One Hour Photo" definitely had an impact on me. I will never look at the photo guy in my local Wal-Mart the same way again. This gives such a great insight into the mind of a crazy person. The ending is great, as it doesn't tie everything up in a neat little package. There's one particular conflict within the Yorkin family that is not really resolved at all, and we're left in the dark as to exactly what happens to Sy.
Rent this movie -- you won't be sorry. However, don't think that just because Robin Williams is in it, your little kids can watch it -- they'll be scarred, I guarantee.
