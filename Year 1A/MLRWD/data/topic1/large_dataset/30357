I'm a patient person, so the fact that this came a day late doesn't mean much, since the product itself made up for it.  BIGTIME.
The good:
The packaging is fantastic; I love the artwork on it.  The discs came in perfect condition, and both the featurettes and the film are awesome and top-notch, with an interesting featurette about the background which shares some interesting facts of the events leading up to how it was made, and the relationships between the actors and creators.  The movie itself is just as enjoyable as I remember--more so.  The animation is at its best at High School of the Dead-quality animation (another good show to check out).  The fight scenes are fun to watch and it's never a dull moment.
The bad:
Like I said, a day late.  But still, not much of a problem.  One OTHER minor complaint I have is that I wished they took out the credits between episodes so that it played like a movie.
But other than that, this still earns four stars, because it's AWESOME.
