I saw this when it came out in 82', in a theatre in Wellington New Zealand.At the time I was 14 and had to pretend I was older as this had a R16 rating here.My father was running a shop and said to me "here's ten bucks go to the movies" as he was busy and did not want a kid under his feet all day.Why I picked this film I still have no idea , I was a big horror fan even then but the poster made no sense to me , it had a kind of flower with tenticles thing on it not the picture I have seen over the years , maybe this was a poster only released down here I don't know.There was maybe 20-25 people in the theatre at the time not a lot but I thought good the less the better as you will not have a bunch of kids screaming and yelling.From the point where the dogs head splits open I thought we have something special here and right till the end I knew this was a great film.I raved about it to my friends they all went and saw it and loved it.Was going to see it again two weeks later but it had finished its run here which disappointed me to no end.Back then the VHS market was just starting and I had to wait nearly two years for it to come out , saw it again in 85' as a double bill with Cat People and the theatre was packed at the midnight session everyone I talked too said they were not here to see Cat People but The Thing which was on second.I burnt out two VHS copies of this movie and when DVDS were invented I thought great and I can finally see it how I remember it, in widescreen.To this day I do not think there has been another movie that even comes close to this effects wise.No CGI everything was hand-made , Rob Bottin and with a little help from the late Stan Winston did a fantastic job here.The acting was great and I thought worthy of Oscars which would never happen as horror films hardly win anything.I rate this with the original Jaws as my two favourite films , this one having the edge as sometimes the shark looked a bit suspect.I am 42 now and a few years ago I told this guy who I worked with who was 18 to get this out ,he did and said to me the next day how he loved the movie and went out and brought it the next day.He then said I cannot believe I missed this at the movies , I said "What do you mean missed this came out 25 years ago", he could not believe it and said it looked like a new film which goes to show how well this film has stood over time , it really needs a hundred stars as far as I am concerned.
