So I bought this movie without having seen the movie....EXCELLENT!!! Maybe because it was directed by Berry Gordy, or maybe because Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams as well as Anthony Perkins do a subperb job of acting. I'm no Diana Ross fan by any means, I perfer Patti over her any day. But this movie is very inspiring, for me wanting to be a fashion designer I feel compelled to design and have my designs out there on the runway. And I have wanted to be a model as well. Mahogany inspires me to get out there and do it. Berry Gordy did a great job. Billy Dee Williams was amazing as always, Anthony Perkins...they love getting him to play sneaky creepy character, but he was amazing. And if you can bear watching Diana Ross extremely skinny to the point that it's unhealthy (she believes she was anexoria and not knowing she may have been) then hats off to you, she was amazing and I can't stop looking at her, if this movie is remade I hope they get the right actors, but I wouldn't have it remade, it's wonderful, timeless, and classic.
