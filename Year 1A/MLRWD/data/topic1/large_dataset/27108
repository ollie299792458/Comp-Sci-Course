I was prepared for the tragic feeling of the movie, since it was based off the country song "The Christmas Shoes" which tells the tale of a little boy who wishes to purchase a special pair of shoes for his mother to visit Jesus in.

What I wasn't prepared for was the amazing acting skills of those that starred in the movie, and the creative storytelling that was used to turn this song into a story.

The little boys is a skilled and powerful actor who had us believing from start to finish that this was sincerely happening to him. A rarity in child acting. The story was a sad one, and doesn't end the way that the world would probably wish it to end, however my entire family enjoyed the tears and it brought us closer.

It also sent the message loud and clear that family is the most important thing, and while maybe a small town, sappy tear-jerker isn't everyone's favorite type, it sure was ours.

We long to live in a beautiful small town just as it appeared in the movie, and were thankful for the gift we received by learning a powerful message in the end.

We borrowed the movie from the library and watched it twice. We loved it so much we purchased it brand new (not used) from Amazon today.
