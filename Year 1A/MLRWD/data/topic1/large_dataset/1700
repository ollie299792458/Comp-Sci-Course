Unfortunately, though comics retailer sources have the DVD being released late January, '06, they say it's to be a single disc (bad), widescreen only (good by me) with few extras (very bad. Speculation is that there will probably be a special edition later.  I can wait - just like I am waiting after the "Kill Bill" to put it out as it should have been issued with both/added scenes, outtakes, etc. etc. and for the real DVD of Sin City (and that is about to be released).  The Corpse Bride I saw fit together well, had appropriate characters for its' story, used flat and bright colors well to demonstrate visually the differences between the world (culture) above and that below (below informal, friendly, outgoing, sharing-----above mostly formal, unfriendly/unaccepting, inward looking, greedy).  Characters were well designed and, where intended, appealing.  The pre-wedding arrival of the dead served to bring out happiness in many of the living.  I'm surely glad Dickens (to pick only one) didn't know you had to choose between humor and drama (think Mr. Micawber as corpse and Uriah Heep as living) when you are trying to entertain - I seem to recall he often used both to good effect in many of his works.  And, I agree that parts of the dead songs were not intelligible but otherwise I found them quite entertaining (though I look forward to an SE DVD with cleaned up sound) and fitting for their environment.
  By the way, I loved it!!!
