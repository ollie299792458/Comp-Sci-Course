I stumbled across this show on Netflix and watched all three seasons in less than a month; I wish that CBS had given this show more time.  Simon Baker is amazing as Nick, a character who is so emotionally-damaged and -immature; incredibly smart and capable in his professional life, yet a wreck and completely "unanchored" in his personal life.  Nick is a character we can all relate to, and Simon Baker's raw, edgy performance makes the viewer feel Nick's pain.  I think this show does a great job of showing Nick's struggle to "grow up" while also presenting the very real, and sometimes disturbing nature of the cases that appear in family court.  The rest of the cast is terrific as well, each of them struggling with their own demons and issues, but getting up every day and making the best of it. "The Guardian" is a show that is not always easy to watch - things don't always end up the way we'd hope them to - but it is definitely a show worth watching.  I love "The Mentalist" but this show is what has made me a true Simon Baker fan.
