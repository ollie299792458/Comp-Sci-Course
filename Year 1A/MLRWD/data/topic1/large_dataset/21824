Seed Of Chucky Is Very Different From The Previous Four Pictures, From The Film Clips I Have Seen, Plus The Theatrical Trailers, This Movie Is Totally Cool And Awesome By It,s Special Effects. Talking Dolls That Are Alive Is Very Inventive. I Especially Like The New Character Of Glen/Glenda, I Think This Parental Son/Daughter Relationship Makes This Movie Intresting, Because You Can See How Important Love Is For A Kid Who Is Misunderstood, Unloved, And Unwanted. And How Parents Should Try They,re Best To Set A Good Example. Also I Really Like Jennifer Till,s Acting Especially In Two Roles, She,s Just So Funny, And Sassy At The Same Time. And Brad Dourif Is Well Suited For The Voice Of Chucky, It,s Just This Scary Voice, And It Really Can Frighten You In Certain Parts Of This Movie. He,s Funny Though Too. Tiffany And Chucky Make A Perfect Totally Bad Couple. And When I Do See This Movie, I Hope That I Will Like It. I Would Reccomend Watching It For Laughs, And Scary Moments. After All Seed Of Chucky Is About Many True Facts Of Life, Such As Hollywood,s True Background, Love Lost, Broken Hearts, Family Troubles, And Lots Of Murders. Take It From Me, Watch It Just For Fun Ladies And Gentlemen
