I love all things "Egyptian" and was definitely excited to watch this when it came out. It was so entertaining that I got the DVD. I love this movie. It's NOT supposed to be taken seriously, so all those that gave it a 1-3 star need to loosen up and wake up (literally they do, because some said they fell asleep watching this?!!) This movie is the essence of what you call "escapism." It helps you escape from life, plain & simple. It's full of action, comedy, duels, suspense, and adventure. The 2nd one in my opinion is better in some ways, like in terms of writing, and there is much more substance, but to me the original is always the best. The difference between the 1st and 2nd is this one is funnier, while the 2nd has better action & adventure. If you're feeling down & need laughs, bored and need excitement, or have a movie night with family and/or friends, this is the perfect movie for you. Yes, it can dip into being a bit corny, but that does not diminish it's humor, excitement, and adventure. I couldn't agree more with Amazon's review by Jenny Brown. She says, "If outrageous effects, a hunky hero, and some hearty laughs are what you're looking for, the 1999 version of The Mummy is spectacularly good fun." And "When that action gets going, hold tight--those two hours just fly by." And even though Anthony Lane of "The New Yorker" did not have much kind words for it, he was intelligent enough to notice how good Brendan Fraser is in it, " What redeems it is the presence of Fraser...he successfully demonstrates how to be lusty and affable at the same time." I love him in this. He is sexy, funny, and tremendously good at comedy. He has excellent comic timing. Rachel Weisz is also excellent in it. I think she played her bumbling, clumsy, but sexy librarian wonderfully. Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed-and definitely not bored!
