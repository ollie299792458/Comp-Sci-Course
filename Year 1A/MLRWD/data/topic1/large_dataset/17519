While The Special Effects Are incredible, The movie lacks one major thing, A STORY. This has to be the pinnacle of lazy filmmaking. Sure, The dinosaurs look better here than before, but where is the plot? Where is the suspends? Where are the likeable characters?  Special Effects are fine if this was made with a camp sense of humor (Like The Mummy Returns or any of the Tremors movies) but this is not even funny in a camp sort of way.  It's just down right bad. Even Sam Neill is bad in this film, and that is embarrassing because he is great in anything.  I know Some people are saying that if you don't compare it to the First Two films, then you will enjoy it, but that is a bunch of [nonsense]. The first two movie( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) were great because they were about something. They had compelling stories to them, And characters you can care about. They also were great popcorn films that were fun and exciting to watch. This one is just a mess with no sense of purpose at all. This is just a bad film with the name Jurassic Park attached to it.
