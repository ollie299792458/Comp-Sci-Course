Rumor Has It:

Do you ever get the feeling, when you are watching a movie, that you just wish they'd get to the point already?  Well, I definitely got that feeling when I was watching this movie.

I heard and read the bad reviews that this movie got.  But still, I had to see for myself.  The beginning, while Jennifer Aniston's character is telling about the history of the story of the Graduate, got me to thinking that I must have read wrong because it seemed like it was going to be a pretty good movie.  Then the movie actually started and the first scenes in the airplane caused me to completely abandon those thoughts.

Things got better when Shirley MacLaine's character is introduced because she made the story more interesting with her sharp and witty dialogue.  I think the only time I laughed, or found the movie entertaining, were the scenes she was in.  I was bored with the story of Sarah - and I don't think the writers knew what they wanted from her relationship with Mark, so they just wrote her character based off of that.

I hate when movies don't know where they're going and by the time they figure it out, you've lost interest and are just waiting for the end to finally come.  That's definitely how I felt about this one.

I don't recommend this to anyone.  It's sad really, because I think this movie could have been really great, if it had chosen a path and then stuck with it.  I guess, technically, when this movie got to its point, you should accept that that is it, but this movie's "point" just wasn't good enough for me to give it a thumbs up.
