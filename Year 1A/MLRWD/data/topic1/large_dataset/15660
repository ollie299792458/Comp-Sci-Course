I always find it interesting to browse through the reviews. Everyone knows what opinions are like.......and yes everybody does have one. New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate. Instead they attempt to take in a film that they do not understand and criticize harshly. When I sat down to watch this film I did not know what to expect never having read the graphic novels. Black and White film no matter in your personal camera or a Movie camera has a special quality and when mixed with just a dab of the right colors and at the right times just sets it off the same way that certain colored shirt or accessory helps bring out the best in you. The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity. This movie is not for everyone as the rating suggests due to over the top violence, sex scenes, and its very sexist portrayal of women. Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art. Open your mind, be mature about it, don't take it to seriously and just sit back and watch the fireworks that this film displays.
