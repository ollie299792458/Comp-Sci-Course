Sweet Jesus what was I thinking?  I forced myself to watch this thing essentially twice... because I fell asleep both times.  Sadly, I should relate to the characters, but the only thing of interest here was trying to figure out where I have seen the actors before.  A virtual who's who of "who"?  Oh yeah, the guy from MadTV, oh ... that [...] from 24, oh... Eric Stolz... in plenty of movies, and the only one I can think of is "Mask"....  oh... and that cute guy with a nice butt in leather jeans in that car show that got cancelled... etc.

Ok, well that was the first five minutes.

Basically a bunch of people too old to remember anyone from High School, but meet anyway, and screw because they'll take anything they can get at this point.  Honestly, I kept dozing off and waking up when I heard Billy Idol... and then again saying "is that Night Ranger"? ... and then remember the Spishack Infomercial "Dentist in a Box" in the middle of a heartfelt moment.

Worst. Review. Ever.

...but, sorry, I cannot attempt to watch this again.  One star for Billy Idol.  Another for reminding me of Night Ranger.
