I would not have written a review for this movie, had I not been embroiled in real-life relationships with hardcore narcissists, and reading books about how to get over them and, importantly, identify them before falling head over heels for them.
From the very beginning of the movie, my jaw hit the floor. I think in the past I may have found Elisha Cuthbert's character compelling, "free-spirited" and attractive, but now... She is a by-the-book, larger than life, larger than psychology textbook hardcore narcissist; she disrupts poor guy's life in every possible way, has him arrested, harassed, concussed, humiliated, estranged from what matters to him. She constantly disrupts his life, his schedule, whatever he wants, or builds, or wishes for, she has to come first, she is grossly irresponsible, immature, "cute", "dangerous". She introduces him without warning to a new love interest, she plays hot when he can't take it anymore, she pouts, she faints, she sues him, takes him to Daddy so Daddy can make him feel 2 inches tall and show NO RESPECT whatsoever for any part of him.
Of course, some "reason" is found by the the end of the movie. Whatever.
Funnily enough, I watched Chasing Amy a day after watching My Sassy Girl, and CA's characters's reality, sensitivity, honesty and sometimes great maturity were an eerie clash to MSG's. Same setting (New York), same age group, 2 blonde heroines... but one of them just makes you want to throw her from a very high bridge... and no further resemblances can be found!
I am in the process of learning that real life isn't what's portrayed in the movies. And MSG could do a lot of damage, if believed...
