Generally when we think of the war drama's of yester-yore, images of a patriotic John Wayne pops into our mind, or a high pitched whistle of Dave Lean's entertaining but falsely sentimental "Bridge on the River  Kwai" forces itself in our ears. Both Hollywood and the most  uncompromising film directors know that there are rules that seperate a  propaganda picture from a Anti-War film. And these rules were doctored not  from Lean, or Lewis Milestone, or anyone one else who earned profit for  Sunset Boulevard, or Oscar bonus points, they were doctored in 1957 by the  greastest of all AWOL-Hollywood directors: Stanley Kubrick.
The influence  of "Path's of Glory" is astounding. From the conflict between the  General eating crumpets who orders the Captian to carry out a suicial  charge (a theme later seen in great anti-war pictures such as Terrence  Malick's "The Thin Red Line" and Peter Weir's  "Gallipoli") to the fact the Kubrick never allows the Germans to  be seen (a frame of reference played out in countless movies based on  Vietnam) until the antagonist side has seemed to have inverted an enemy of  itself.
Like so many other Kubrick movies, "Paths of Glory" is  a cinematic work of genius, that will probably be underrated because it has  been so little seen (popular cliche's like "Private Ryan" will  unjustly top the war film list of many-so-ingorant film critic, in the next  decade).But those who have witnessed this masterpiece, will immediatly  realize it's importance.
