For those interested in why there is no "To Be Continued..." after the last scene in Back to the Future dvd (Widescreen or Fullscreen), like there was in the VHS release, here's the official response from Universal Studios about that:
"Thank you for writing us. We understand your concern however the original theatrical release of the first part of Back to the future did not include the "to be continued". It was added for the video release and since on DVD we are very strict in imaging the original Theatrical release it was removed. There is a "to be continued" on part 2 and that is because when part 2 was released in theaters part 3 was already filmed.
Please see below the reasoning from the technical department. 
For the record...
Steve P. has advised that Bob Gale is requesting we omit the "TO BE CONTINUED..." card that falls at the end of BACK TO THE FUTURE. This element was a later addition (to video only) and does not appear on the original negative or Interpositives.
Thank you,
Universal Studios Customer Service"
