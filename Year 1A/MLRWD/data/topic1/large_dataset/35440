Between the lost decade of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the aftermath of the sexual and social revolution of '68, before street drugs, grundge, and now broker metrosexuals, there was once a different kind of decadence, when youth of parental privilege liberally spent their parents' fortunes but somehow still talked with genuine interest about ideas, all the while facing a dimly growing fear of failure and of falling upon leaving paradise at Princeton. This subtly satirical reminiscence of preppy life is practically peerless, perfectly fusing screenplay, acting, and cinematography.  It takes place during the early 1960s on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, among young twenty-somethings who prepped at the best schools and now are Ivy Leaguers or Seven Sisters students, shortly before coeducation and the pill sexualized cloistered college life.  Like Martin Scorsese's allegorical concert film "The Last Waltz" (1976), "Metropolitan" is ostensibly about another finale: "the last deb season as we know it". It is also a larger period piece of wit, wonder, and even nostalgia for an era long gone.  And as a sexagenarian who once witnessed that life first-hand, I can say with some authority that its tone is perfect.
