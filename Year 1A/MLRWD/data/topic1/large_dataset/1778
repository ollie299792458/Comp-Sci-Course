The RHPS 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition is actually a loving gift to us, Rocky Horror fans. I really love the video transfer, but the DTS HD-Master 7.1 audio blows my mind. Another detail really nice to be mentioned is the fact that this Blu-ray, one of those all-in-one BD-books with photos and a lot of extras, has also Portuguese subtitles I usually don't see when I import something to my country - Brazil. And have you ever noticed how haired is Rocky's chest and body? I haven't until this accurately and highly contrasted edition. We are now honored to finally be able to see both UK and US versions. There's only one thing that makes me sad while I play this BD edition and it's the unhappy situation of my not being part of any cast, or shadow cast, for that matter. As Sal Piro welcomes you in a little inviting card, that comes separately in the first pages of the book, if you haven't seen theater exhibition - with shadow cast, screen talkers and flying food - you're still a virgin. So, I'm still virgin, but one who is constantly introducing the Rocky Horror spirit into other's life. However, let me say I'm still working on a theater RHPS project... And someday it might even come true. Enjoy you BD-book edition; it's not only excellent Mick Rocker photos and high definition video material, but eye-rolling, body-exploring, weirdly dressing and dancing sing-a-long fun... In Abundance!
