First off I don't see how so many people can call this a "rip-off" when you haven't even seen the DVD itself. Also you act like Fox is FORCING us to buy this episode.

In my opinion this is the greatest Family Guy episode that has ever been made, and that is a very bold statement for anyone who is a huge Family Guy fan like I am. The source material was already strong, and all the other outside references that we are accustomed to just made it better (my favorite was the Dr. Who reference in Hyperspace.)

Just as a reminder, you do not JUST get the episode. You get some added DVD features like behind the scenes stuff, commentary tracks (Which are always great from these guys) and I believe a preview of the next Star Wars parody episode.

One could argue, "Well, they should just put this in the regular Seasonal DVD Set." That may be true, but on the other end, what if you don't feel like waiting for that, or if you don't feel like paying for the whole season when you just want to have this particular episode?

Instead of viewing this as a rip-off on this idea that you HAVE to buy this DVD, instead view it as a "Gift" by Fox in that now you can OWN this memorable and great episode. No one is forcing you to buy it, and it is an extremely funny episode that any fan of Family Guy, Star Wars, or even parody can enjoy. If for nothing besides anecdotal purposes, instead of describing to your friends how funny this episode was and having to reference everything by memory, NOW you can actually show them!
