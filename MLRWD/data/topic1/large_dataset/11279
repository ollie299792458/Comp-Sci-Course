I would have to have to say that this movie is, at the very least, one of the top 20 most entertaining, artistic, and inspiring films I have ever seen in my whole life, and I have seen a huge number of films.

The acting is absolutely amazing.  Novak, Parker, and especially Sinatra give some the best performances on celluloid. The same is true for the supporting cast.

The writing, direction, and music are all just incredible as well.

My final verdict: not dated, but a classic in every way.  Part of the reason for this assessment has to do with all the factors I have just mentioned.  What I have spoken about so far is the execution of the theme and this execution is praiseworthy indeed. However, it is the theme itself of beating addiction that makes this such a very special winner of a movie.  Meth, crack, and a myriad of other drug addictions are still very much in existence today.  I thank God for this film that reminds us that the human spirit is far stronger than any pill, liquid, or powder that seeks to drag us down to Hell.  Kudos to Premminger for reminding us that we humans are far stronger than any monkey on our back, and that our ultimate identity is as the mighty and unconverable.
