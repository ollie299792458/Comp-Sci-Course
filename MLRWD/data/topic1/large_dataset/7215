The movie Blade, starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff, was a wonderful  story of a half human, half vampire(Wesley Snipes), who would go out and  hunt all the vampires. He was trying to kill the vampire that had sucked  from his mother and basically made him what he was.  Deacan Frost(Stephen  Dorff) was, as you could say, a ruthless vampire who wanted to take over  the vampire world and make it his own.  Blade therefore is always after  him.  In the ultimate fight of good and evil, Snipes is forced to go one on  one with Dorff to protect both worlds. 
This is a wonderful movie because  it shows how the worlds of good and evil can collide and make a big boom  without making the movie too simple but with out all the over exaggeration  that it could have had.  So, therefore, even with all the violence, though  it was not that violent, you got the point that the major fight of the  century was going on and that just made it really good in my opinion.
If  this movie could have been better, which I don't think it could have really  been, the woman that falls into his world could have at least been in the  ever after of the outcome.
