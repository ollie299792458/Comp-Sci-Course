It's about time, that's all I can say.  But with all the great extras, the behind-the-scenes looks at the psychology of Cosmo Kramer, the talks with the cast and creators about how they struggled to get NBC to even let them air the show (boy, I'm sure NBC thanked God every day for making the right choice) and commentaries, the Seinfeld Seasons 1-3 set was well worth the wait.

I'd never seen the pilot before, having discovered Seinfeld late in the game through reruns, and so that was a special delight for me as it was actually funny and sitcom pilots are usually just amusing and passable but this one actually  made me laugh out loud (by something George said, of course).  The cast...well, what can you say?  Legendary cast.  Though much talk was always made over the greatness of Jason Alexander and Michael Richards, I have to say that Julia Louis Dreyfus (Elaine) is my hands down favorite.  Just watch The Subway episode and you'll see why.  That was truly the Lainey tour de force and showcased the hilarity of how this small innocent looking woman could explode into a fury of rage and vitriol...all in her mind of course.

The Chinese Restaurant, The Parking Garage, The Boyfriend (with the famous JFK parody), all classic episodes.  I'm still confused as to what exactly happened with Jerry and Elaine's burgeoning relationship at the end of Season 2, it seemed like they were together and then at the start of Season 3, the plot was just thrown aside and mentioned once again, cleaned up rather quickly.  Nevertheless, this is perfection because as I watched this I only knew the best was yet to come.  Elaine had yet to dance, Jerry had yet to say "Hello Newman" in his special way, George had to yet become even more neurotic, Kramer had yet to start making his grand entrances and weird hand gestures and most importantly...the Costanzas had yet to come.

Here's to more years of more seaons and more laughs.
