This film is paced like a Catholic wedding, which is to say that it's slow and plodding.  Aside from Kelly McGillis, who at least makes the effort, the acting is bad to begin with and gets worse as time (oh so painfully) goes by.  For a movie that eschews most of the trappings of the last decade's ghost stories (The Ring, etc) in favor of realism, it's plot devices have the characters acting and reacting in ways that are beyond implausible.

Hotel clerk acts crazy in the hallway?  Why not invite her in your room!

Just had your wits scared out of you and saw a dead body?  Hey, let's go back to the cellar 'cause we heard a noise!

In other words, all the dumb behavior that makes one laugh at "Friday the 13th" type teens is on full display here despite the film masquerading as more refined horror offering.  When you find yourself rooting against the protagonists out of boredom and a clear lack of common sense on their part, you're probably watching a bad movie.

But lest you think the acting and pacing are the only negatives, it gets worse.  The score is terrible.  Whether you like a horror movie like "jeepers Creepers" or not, it definitely matched the music with the era it was trying to convey in relation to the demon's 1920's auto and abandoned old church on the prairie burial ground.  This movie, despite purportedly involving a crime or tragedy which occurred long ago (which it annoyingly never explains in full) is set to a cheap Psycho-esque score of violins and mood music.  If you turn your head away from the picture, it's like listening to a tire commercial where the rain might cause some slippage around the next bend but...nope...that set of Goodyear "Rainmaster 5000" tires you invested in saved the day!  Cue car pulling safely into family garage and cut.

In short, this is amateur hour with a good camera.  Not good camera work, mind you, just a good camera.  Don't waste your money. I want my $9.99 back and an apology.
