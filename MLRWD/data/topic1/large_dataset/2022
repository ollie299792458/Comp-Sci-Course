Going the Distance is formulaic romantic comedy that the average viewer can trace from beginning to end.  If you go into the film knowing that, however, you will most likely enjoy the ride with the funny references and clever quips.

Drew Barrymore plays typical Drew Barrymore, emphasizing her own funky side and cuteness.  Justin Long is our average Joe romantic hero and he does well in the role.  The supporting cast including Jason Sudekis, Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan, is wonderfully complimentary.

Erin and Garret meet in a bar and have a one-night stand, much like many other twenty-somethings living in New York.  Knowing that Erin will be moving back to the west coast in six weeks, they decide to casually see one another until then and enjoy the summer getting to know one another.  Surprise surprise, their casual dating blossoms into something more and when the time to separate arrives, emotions make the moment more bitter than sweet.  Erin and Garret decide to give the long-distance relationship a go.

We the audience get to watch as they try to keep the flame burning over the phone and Skype, with short visits once in a blue moon.  More than even their interactions with one another, I think the highlights include when each of the leads shares scenes with the supporting players.  Christina Applegate shines as Erin's overbearing sister.  Jason Sudekis is charming as Garret's best friend and voice of dubious reason.

I dragged my boyfriend to see this and he ended up enjoying the exchanges.  It's raunchy and funny and fun.  You might forget it as soon as it's done, but you'll enjoy it while it's on.
