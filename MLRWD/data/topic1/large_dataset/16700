When I was a kid I used to love watching Rudolph, Santa, and Frosty. It really did seem fair that you had to wait all year and then they came on one time and one time only before disappearing for yet another year. I am happy to say that my children do not have to go through the wait year after year. Our holiday season friends have long been available either on VHS or DVD. Now they are finally available on Blu-ray!

As I said, these movies have long been my seasonal favorites. Even the "bonus" Frosty Returns is a welcome addition. Though this bonus is no where near the same level of writing at the other 3 shows, Frosty Returns is still a nice change from the standard Nickelodeon and Disney Channel fare. I would give the main 3 movies 5 stars each, and the bonus a 3 star.

I am giving this product 4 stars overall not due to the video, but due to the value offered. In reality I see very little difference between the Blu-ray version and the DVD version. Blu-ray is often hailed due to the bonus features that can be offered. However, there are none of these here. You pay for the shows, you are getting the shows. Move along, nothing else to see here.

If you have a Blu-ray player and haven't already added these shows to your collection, you definitely should. Your children will love you all the more for it. However, if you already have all 4 shows I would hold out this a Blu-ray with these videos comes out that offers either more features or more of the holiday shows form this time period.
