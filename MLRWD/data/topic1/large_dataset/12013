After viewing the film, About a Boy, the song "Killing Me Softly" is bound to take on new meaning. Hugh Grant's character, Chase, is a low life heir who has nothing better to do with his time than shop and watch television. In the beginning of the film, Chase goes on a number of dates, which all end in a comical matter. However, all of his relationships are meaningless until he meets a single mother and her son. Being the self-centered man that he is, he is drawn to her motherly qualities.  When this woman breaks up with him, he decides to go to a meeting for single parents, while pretending he is a single father. While there, he meets a woman who has a single daughter and makes a date with her. When he arrives at her house there is another young boy there whom she is babysitting.

The boy soon discovers that Chase has no children and threatens to tell the woman if Chase doesn't spend time with him. Not knowing what to do, Chase agrees. Meanwhile, Chase and the other woman break up, Chase tries to let the boy go, but the boy is persistent in arriving at his house everyday after school. As their relationship develops, Chase helps the boy get through all his teenage problems, from girls, to his suicidal mother.  The outcome of their relationship leads to a hilarious ending, which would make anyone laugh, whether having seen the movie before or not. At first I was thrown, although amused, by his character's ignorance but by the end of film you couldn't help but love his character.
