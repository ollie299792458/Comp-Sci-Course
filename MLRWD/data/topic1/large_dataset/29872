I really can't understand those who have been giving this outstanding movie low marks because they don't like the charcters or their morals.

Just because you make or like a movie about a serial killer (i.e. Silence of the Lambs) does that mean that you condone serial killing or that the movie is automatically a bad one?  Can movies only be made about moral do gooders - what kind of garbage is that?  Can you only make movies that express a certain point of view or have a certain type of character and, if so, are we living in the United States of America?

If you don't like the performances, the direction, the plot, the script, the music, etc. that's one thing, but obviously you can make a great movie about unlikeable characters just the same way you can make a horrible movie about likeable characters.  Most if not all of the most celebrated movies of all time by critics and audiences alike contain morally bad characters and portray conduct by some characters that we do not aspire to (i.e. Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Godfather, etc) - by presenting it, it doesn't mean the movie is agreeing with it or condoning it or that you agree with it or condone it if you like the movie, it's just a part of the plot.

I also can't understand the criticisms that the movie is  pretentious.  Sideways has fun at the expense of these pathetic lost souls more than anything else, and really makes fun of their self-importance and attempts at sophistication. The movie is about two guys who spend a week in wine country so (surprise, surprise) there are jokes about wines and wine tasting.  Making fun of pretentiousness does not mean the movie is pretentious.

The acting, dialogue and script are absolutely superb, and the movie contains many memorable scenes and lines - how many movies can you say that about today?  It should have won Best Picture this past year in my humble opinion.
