I don't recall how old I was when I first saw the film version of "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck's novel of the desperate plight of the "Okies" during the Dust Bowl era -- I know I'd read the book after graduating high school and before entering college -- but on second viewing, I was impressed by how closely the film followed the book. Certainly, a fully realized cinematic treatment would have overtaxed Hollywood budgets and the average moviegoer of 1940, and the novel's final scene would never have been okayed by the censors, but the overall emotional pull of the film is about as close to that of the book in a way that few literature-as-film productions ever are. (Of recent note in this respect are Peter Jackson's fine films of J. R. R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy --although I still haven't forgiven him for leaving out Tom Bombadil.) Of course, the genius lay in the casting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, though to be honest, none of the casting choices were faulty. I'm teaching the novel for the first time for a literature class this semester, and I would be quite comfortable allowing non-readers to substitute viewing this film in place of reading the entire book. I can think of no better tribute to a first-rate movie than that.
