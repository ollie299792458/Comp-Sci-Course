I remember asthough it was yesterday, when a friend announced at our church fellowship luncheon that a series for our daughters would be playing that Saturday night (it was in Decembe in Chicago)and all of our daughters would love watching it.  My girls were 11 and 8 at the time, they are now 34 and 29.  We watched it and oh my goodness WE LOVED IT!!!!  My girls just fell in love with Anne (who wouldn't) the constant chatter box that she is!  I also love Marilla and Uncle Mathew!!!! I was looking for a book for my almost 7 year old granddaughter to read and I so happened to run across my beloved Anne of Green Gables!!!  Oh I was just thrilled to know she also will come to  love reading about Anne.

It has been years since I saw the movie and so  I will be odrering 4, for my granddaughters and for my own personal video library as well.  I can't thank Amazon enough for letting me reconnect with my dear sweet Anne of Green Gables again!

Anne is liberated for a girl of her age and time, (the world couldn't handle it then)  and her high spiritness and all the other good stuff!  I remember how things would always go wrong for her or she would get herself into trouble...but things always worked out for her.  I loved the fact that she did win the heart of Marilla (she had won Mathew's heart enroute home from the train station ;) and it is a clean wholesome family watching together movie (there's not to much of that going on these days).

I want them  to read the book first then watch the DVD.  Summer days are long and hot and this is the best time to curl up for them and read.  Buy the DVD and book, it will be the best purchased you could ever make.
