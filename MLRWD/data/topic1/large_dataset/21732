Liked the film very much with loads of tuneful good music for a change instead of a lot of bad new music of Rap etc. Didn't have to think on this one  and had joys of laughter and even a few tears but it came out happy at the end of the film. Sorry the crtics had to put it down so much. Usually I find they put such high ratings on films that has a lot of nudity, violence, and gore. I like happy films with good music and humor and happy endings but apparently the crics don't. That's why we hardly have any musicals anymore I guess. This is one I could see over more than a couple of times and have it in my collection of other films. Usually. when it has poor ratings I can just about guarantee that I will like the film. In this case it has happened again. Anyone who is happy and enjoys life and like humor and likes a good  revue type of show with a lot of show tunes should see this one and add it to their collection. To me there are so few good films out there today. Hollywood has lost so much of it's glamour and don't make classic films anymore. Hollywood needs to come back to the way it used to be witj all its' glitz and classic look ,the way it originally was meant to be. Too many business men has taken over the film business and don't have it as to the craft of the film business like it once was. The big change came in the late 60's. Get this film!
