This movie is not your typical Hollywood cookie cutter film. It doesn't end neatly or happily. Questions are left unanswered. It challenges the audience, especially at the end when you're going to be angry after getting such a large dose of negative existentialism.
The dirty ending is similar to the other movies Sean Penn has directed - notably "The Indian Runner" and "The Crossing Guard." Penn is a big Bruce Springsteen fan and it shows in his ambiguous treatment of the characters - he focuses in on them, shows a snapshot of their lives, and then pulls the camera away, giving barebones exposition, and trusting the audience to reach their own conclusions. For example, despite being the central character of the movie, we know almost nothing of Detective Jerry Black's (Jack Nicholson) background. And, at the end, we have no idea what's going to happen to him next.
Penn doesn't give an opinion about whether Black is right or wrong to put a child in harm's way to catch a serial killer, nor does he tell us whether Black entered a relationship with the child's mother because he loved her, was lonely, or wanted to use her in his investigation (or some combination of the three). The questions left unanswered at the end are similar to those of "Mystic River" and make the movie so good. Penn trusts his audience to be smart.
Like "Shawshank Redemption," this movie demands a second viewing immediately after the first.
As for the performances, Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn are fantastic. It's one of Nicholson's best films of late and doesn't just rely on him to do his Jack thing
