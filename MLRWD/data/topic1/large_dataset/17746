I saw this movie in the theater with my wife on Valentine's Day back in 2004 and bought it on DVD for her (and me) on Valentine's Day 2005. Like most heterosexual men I am NOT a huge fan of romantic comedies. I think most of these films are "chick flicks" that aren't worth the waste of time to see. Love Actually is so funny and heartfelt with great characters that I actually WANT to see it again and again. Too bad all "chick flicks" can't be like this.

As for the several people who wrote negative reviews about the brief moments of nudity in this film ... this film is CLEARLY meant for an adult audience and is rated R. What kind of R-rated adult romantic comedy doesn't have a few curse words and quick flashes of breasts? The only romantic comedies I've seen that didn't were rated PG or PG-13 ... and those are exactly the kind of "chick flicks" I hate. I'm not saying this movie needed the boobshots or the harsh language ... the film probably would have worked just as well without it. I will say that the language and the moments of nudity help make this film a bit more "honest" in terms of its view of adult relationships.
