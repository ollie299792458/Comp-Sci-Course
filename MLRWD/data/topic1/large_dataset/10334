UNBELIEVABLE!!!!

It's been SO LONG that I've waited for this flick to come out on DVD...

Sure, it's obscure, but so is Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, and that one's been out for about six or seven years!!

Jessica was one of the first films I had seen that genuinely creeped me out....

I'll never forget....I was fourteen....it was a Saturday afternoon in early 1982, and the local independant station aired it...

I had been looking forward to it, because at that time I was eager to check out all the weird movies that had been airing (such as the abovementioned Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, and They Saved Hitler's Brain).

It was a fine spring Saturday afternoon, but man, oh, man...when that vampire woman came out of the lake, telpathically whispering to Jessica to "...Stay.....stay..."....wow. Creepy.

That vampire woman was played by Mariclare Costello, a gorgeous actress who also for a time played a teacher on The Waltons.

All this time, the only copy I've ever had was a recording I made off of Cinemax in 1993, and I've since dubbed that fuzzy copy to DVD because I thought this film would never be released in that format, but am I ever glad that it's about to!!

I won't give any real spoilers, but if you're one who loves psychological horror (as opposed to all the glitzy CG FX, etc, ad infinitum), then this very obscure, mostly unknown flick from the early 70's is for you!!!
