Not since Dragonheart have I seen a movie with the mythical creatures that was actually worth watching. How To Train Your Dragon is a wonderfully entertaining children's movie, but is just as fun for adults who grew up dreaming of Dragons. Hiccup is a loveable hero who does what nearly every child has ever wanted to do: meet and ride a dragon. The story of friendship and belonging is one that can be appreciated by adult and young audiences who have ever (and who do still) loved dragons and the magic that seems to roam with them.

The movie is sweet, intelligent, fun, and heartwarming. The characters are likable, the Dragons are amazing and the animation is breathtaking. John Powell's score only adds to the wonder of this film. And there have been few movies I have seen that have kept the child-sized audience so quiet. So enthralled is everyone in the movie that few even bother to make the noise generally heard when a young audience gets restless half-way through a story. Not so, here.
