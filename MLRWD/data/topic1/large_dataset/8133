Iron Maiden are one of the greatest bands ever, having all these classic videos is awesome, but the menu on this DVD is completely annoying. It is really slow getting to the song you want to watch and the computer generated eddie is just tacky.

If you have the new rerelease enhanced CDs then you already have these videos included with your audio purchase. A highly recommended DVD is 'The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days'. They haven't released part 2 yet, but part 1 has 5 of the promo videos, 4 early live sets, an awesome 90 minute documentary, and more - a much better purchase for your money.

To summarize this DVD review: It is good, but not necessary.

RECOMMENDATION: Buy 'The History of Iron Maiden Part 1: The Early Days' and be sure to purchase part 2 whenever it comes out - perhaps even start annoying the band about it. Also, if you are a Maiden fan and do not yet have 'A Matter of Life and Death', be sure to pick that up as soon as you can - it is a great CD!
