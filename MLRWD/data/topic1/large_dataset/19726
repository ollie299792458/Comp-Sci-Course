Let me begin with this review by stating that I enjoy most of the movies made by this director, Takashi Miike.  He is well known for his ability to shock the audiences with non-conventional plot devices and imagery .  His movies are typically marred with violence, destruction, and excesses.  Even more impressive, this guy makes something like 5 movies a year, every year for the last decade or so.

The reviewers before me have revealed enough plot about this movie so I will skip to my gut feelings after watching this movie.  To be honest, I am disappointed.  The plot felt too close to The Ring and while there was a twist at the end, for the most part the movie was predictable and full of cliches.  Miike did not lose his comedic touch with the exorcism scene, but overall this movie feel like it was forced.

One great thing about this DVD though, is the bonuses.  Unlike many other J-movies this DVD set actually comes with a 2nd disc full of interviews and an alternative ending.  I hardly understood the original ending so I actually enjoyed the 2nd ending a little more;  it was done in a typical Miike fashion.

Overall there are many better J-Horror movies out there as with better Miike movies.  For those who enjoy J-Horror definitely check out The Ring (not the American remake, although it was not bad) if you have not already.  Miike fans probably have already seen most of the movies this guy has made.  My personal favorites are Visitor Q, Dead & Alive, and Ichi the Killer.
