The ladder match and the Hardys made me fall in love with wrestling in my preteen years, so its great to see a DVD that is basically dedicated to both (after all, Matt and Jeff are partly responsible for putting the match on the map). I like that the WWE went way back with the history of ladder matches and the selection here is great overall. I'm also very glad that only one or two of these matches overlap to the "Edge: A Decade of Decadence" DVD. Since he's been an integral part of the evolution of the ladder match, it would have been easy for duplicate matches to appear on both DVDs. Its good to see that WWE took the time to make sure this wasn't the case.

One thing struck me as odd, however: In the RAW match between RVD and Eddie, there is a shot where Eddie is climbing the ladder and the camera cuts to Benoit in the crowd. While the shot is on Benoit you hear the ladder crash, and the camera cuts back to the ring with Eddie and the ladder on the ground. Now, I watched this episode live on TV with a friend and in that moment a fan in a D-X shirt ran out and knocked the ladder over. Needless to say, this made us FREAK OUT, and explains why Eddie looks so pissed all of a sudden! I just find it silly that the WWE felt the need to edit this "one in a million" moment out. Come on guys, learn to laugh at yourselves a little!

But anyway, great and extensive DVD set! My only complaint is that the "formula" of the ladder match can get a bit repetitive if you watch the whole set in one sitting, but that's just minor nitpicking on an otherwise stellar collection.
