Ok, I wanna start out by saying that Mike Myers IS (or at least WAS) a comedic genius. We can see that for sure based on Wayne's World, So I Married an Axe Murder, and yes, even the first two Austin Powers movies. But this last one...oh man. Can I tell you, I actually walked out of the theater. And I NEVER walk out of movies. 
How many times can you do the same joke and have people still laugh? Apparently, only twice, the third is too much.
The beginning, is amazing, but after the hysterical opening sequence, it all goes down hill. Fat Bastard's painfully long description of the smell of his passed gas, the Mole's mole gag that went on for five minutes too long (and five minutes might as well be an hour in comic timing), the cheesy "Mr. Roboto" joke- it was HORRIBLE! I mean, in the scene with Dr. Evil and Mini-Me doing a rap song (AGAIN), NO ONE was laughing, and I was looking at the fire exits to plan my quickest escape. 
Seriously, Mike, I know you can do better. This one's a stinko, plain and simple.
