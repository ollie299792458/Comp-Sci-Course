You have no idea how badly I wanted to like this film. The cast was top notch and the real events this movie was based upon was so compelling I didn't think there was any way it could go wrong. I was waiting for the day it debuted with great anticipation. And when I left the theater I found myself trying very hard to like it only to realize there just wasn't much to like. I'm still struggling to figure out why this happened, because there was no reason this couldn't have been incredible. But the best explanation I can give, and the one I gave to friends who asked how it turned out is that it seemed to me like everyone involved really were not that interested in telling the story of the Black Dahlia murder, and that the had to deal with the true facts were seen as an inconveniance. The strange thing is, someone had at least done some of the homework, because there was a scene where Elizabeth Short(excellently played by Mia Kirshner) talks about how she was engaged to a man who died on his way back from the war, and as I watched it I remembered reading about this in a book based on the case. That the could get a detail that was so small is so discouraging when you consider the facts they completely falsified, such as Ms. Short appearing in pornographic films. The case is not given nearly enough focus, the time that should have been spent on the facts of the case were mostly wasted on showing how the fictional characters dealt with the events. All in all, this film should have been great, as it had nothing stopping it from being the film I thought it would be, but those involved apparently thought three fictional characters were more interesting, which begs the question if they aren't interested in the Black Dahlia Murder, why make a film about it?
