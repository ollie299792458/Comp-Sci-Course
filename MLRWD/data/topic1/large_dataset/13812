I read the book many years ago and was transported by Marquez' prose into the world of late nineteenth century Latin America.  One aspect of the book, the longtime "affair" with the child (she was something like 12 when he rapes her) who ultimately commits suicide when Florentino dumps her, was upsetting to me and I have never been able to recommend the book because of that segment.

  I was curious about the movie, though, mainly because of Bardem.  And I'm glad my husband and I watched rented it.  I'm 59 and he's 73, and it was nice to see a movie about "aging" people falling in love (this is our third marriage, each, and we've been together 20 years).  There is no way a movie can depict all the affairs of the protagonist, but you definitely get the point of the novel, without the distasteful man/child saga.  the book did a better job of depicting Latin America, so if you see the movie first, all the better.  You will love the book, for the most part.

And by the way, we LOVED the Italian actress who played Fermina.  The only miscast person was John Leguizamo, and I didn't even know that's who it was until the credits at the end.

So rent the movie, get lost in the atmosphere, watch the whole thing - give it a chance - and decide for yourself.  Anyone who expects a movie to be true to a book, especially an epic, is a fool.

  Maybe some people just want to watch things blow up, as my husband jokingly said when we began watching, him reluctantly.  We both ended up loving it.
