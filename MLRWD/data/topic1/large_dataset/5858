This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn creates a perfect foil for the snappy dialogue interspersed amongst somewhat silly but completely engaging situations.

Movies from this era understand that every character matters, that they add the spice to the movie. Hence, the constable, the gardener and even the dog add to the overall screwball energy. Movies today don't seem to pay that much attention to such small details.

Hepburn is delightful. In fact, the first time I gave it to my younger brother to watch he absolutely fell in love with her. Her distinctive voice works to her advantage here as the flighty but well meaning Susan Vance. Her incredible energy and innocent machinations add depth to a character which could've descended into stereotype and annoyance if not infused with Hepburn's considerable charm.

Grant is, of course, letter perfect in a role that turns his leading man suave reputation on its head. Instead of the smooth Cary Grant, we are pleasantly surprised by his David, a nerd and rather bumbling, which offers great opportunity to bump up against the insanity of Susan, though by the end of the movie one realizes that she's not only drawn him from his shell, but allowed him to recognize that the very ordered existance he had set up with the very controlled Miss Swallow was not the answer to his dreams as he once thought.

If you wish to watch a textbook, delightful, adorable and engaging screwball comedy, I highly recommend this one as the epitome of the genre. Not to be missed.
