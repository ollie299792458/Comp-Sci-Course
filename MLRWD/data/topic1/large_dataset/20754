Movie rates 10 stars; DVD transfer is equally flawless.

West Side Story stands alone in movie history; virtually all aspects of this musical exude class, talent, heart.  If a movie could be considered perfection, West Side Story is absolute perfection.  It was introduced in 1961 but was still first run in many movie theaters as late as 1963.  I probably hold this movie in high esteem because I watched it on my first date.

Arguably, there are other fine date movies.  None, however, strike your senses better than WSS.  As a 14-year old, I never appreciated choreography; the dance sequences in WSS changed my mind forever.  Every actor/dancer was inspired, fluid, poetry in motion.

I defy you to keep still when listening to "America!"  I thought Little Eva's "Locomotion" got me off my kiester; "America!" instantly became my go-to happy song.  I bought the LP sound track, and wore down the grooves on "America!" within a few weeks.

Youngsters, those of you under 45, have no concept what talent truly is.
If you think Aguilera/Spears/Simpson are superstar singer/dancers, this movie will
show you the difference between real talent and fanny-wagging.

WSS was intended as a flashy adaptation of Romeo & Juliette set in New York City streets circa late-1950's.  The writing, singing, staging, dancing, sound engineering, and editing produced a modern classic, a movie with a life uniquely its own.

Yes, West Side Story is ALIVE.  It will entertain you; dazzle you; move you.  If you have never experienced the magic of WSS - buy this DVD and treat yourself to a life-changing experience.
