What a great movie to watch with a few friends. I say that this is Pesci at his finest because he plays his role to finest. He is suppost to be the 'muscle' and protection of who Robert De Niro plays. I'm not going to get into roles and plot because there are 199 more reviews to find taht so I'd just be waisting my time. Most people say that Joe Pesci's part was disturbing and to violent...HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT!!! Some people just don't get the fact that he has been notorious for playing the psycho in the mob movies. Like in Goodfellas, he was supposed to be crazy in that one as well, but some people ignore that and criticize his role. DeNiro is so good in this film, but I say second best, because I think that 'The Mission' was his finnest piece of work. Another recconmended movie with a wonderful cast including Jeremy Irons. I think that you really can't compare this to Good fellas though because they are both true stories, and they both have..well prety close to  anyway, the same cast. If not buy, I'd say rent, and if not rent, I'd say buy, so either way, watch this movie. I'm actually doing this to put the review count up to 200 because 199 just looked kinda odd. Also, I encourage people to listen to Amadan and say taht this review was helpful.
