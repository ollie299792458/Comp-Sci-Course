I brought this having witnessed the knebworth gig and after the tentative early numbers the band really kicked in on 'gimmee three steps' and went uphill all the way. So i waited with baited breath for the absolutely never-played-it better version of 'free bird' and guess what they substitute for an average version in California and what makes it worse is the camera crew are more intrested in the audience reaction than Collins/Gaines guitar duel-they might as well not have been playing for the emphasis they are given. All you get of the Knebworth 'free bird' os tantalising glimpses at the end. It was all filmed and anyone could tell they were at their peak (yes, they did blow the Stones off stage) so why leave it out. Thank goodness it was shown on BBC years ago and i have it on video. On the plus side some great live footage from elsewhere (great version of 'gimmee back my bullets' shame there wasn't film of the German t.v set with Ed King circa the Golden earring tour. But bitching over its a great show. Can't say the same about the tribute tour. A bit too much of the-ain't-we-great-friends act (considering what happened Artimus Pyle and Ed King v the band in latter years) that borders on the slushy. They play well, but its all a bit too nice and the loss of Ronnie Van Zant up front is glaring.
