I really like the packaging. The Photo Book is inside a nice cardboard sleeve, and it pulls out from the left side. The book is a good quality hard cover with a plastic tray for the two discs. The tray is located inside the left hand cover, and on the right is the 80 page Photographic Chronicle with pictures taken by Unit Photographer David James.

There is also a preface by Steven Spielberg, where he talks about the importance of Still Photography on the set of a movie, a forward by Harrison Ford, and an introduction by David James.

The photos in the book are really nice. Included are shots of scenes from the movie, production shots, promotional shots, etc. Every chapter begins with a brief description by David James about what was being shot and some facts about the films production

VIDEO & AUDIO:

"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is featured in 1080p High Definition and right off the bat, this film looks incredibly gorgeous on Blu-ray. The film sports vibrant colors, detail is just amazingly clear, everything about the film showcases detail. May it be the surroundings of the Mayan jungle, the skeletons, the clothing, the people... You name it, detail is clear and the transfer is just amazing. Definitely one of the best looking Blu-ray video transfers among the many Blu-ray releases of 2008!

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1. and the lossless track is just as equally incredible compared to the picture quality. With the number of action sequences included in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", audio is immersive as front channels showcase the action sequences and musical score, center channel showcases the dialogue which is nice and clear. LFE showcases the booms from the many explosions seen in the film and gunshots and vehicles whizzing and featured through the surrounds are also in abundance.

Personally, for a film of this caliber, I was not expecting anything less than magnificent for picture and audio quality and Paramount delivers with this awesome Blu-ray release. Audio and Videophiles should definitely be happy with this Blu-ray release.

As for subtitles, the film is featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.
