I love the Harry Potter series, both the books and the movies. But I can't say that I rate Chamber of Secrets as highly as I did Sorcerer's Stone.
Why?
Quite frankly, the movie is a marvelous fairy tale to watch, with the action scenes (the duels are excellent!) and some of the key points displayed quite perfectly and loyally to the book. Yet is is lacking what really sucked me in and captivated me about the books. It's lacking the underlying themes, the hints, the layer of friendships and subplots that grow with importance as the books go on. I especially missed the character-development for Ginny who, even though she hardly appears in the book or movie, is fantastically important to the plot. (And yes, I am likely biased, as Ginny is my favorite character.)
Good points: Excellent effects, true to the book, covers the major plot points by and large. A good adaption for a movie from a book, and with what they could work with. Moaning Myrtle was particularly well done, as were the excellent duels.  
Bad points: Missing the character development and major subplots that are so important to the books, so the movie has little depth. 
Overall, I definitely recommend seeing it. the acting is well done, it's filmed well, and it's one action shot after another, with good jokes and plenty of the magic of the first. but don't go into it expecting the same depth that was in the first movie. It's just not there, and what makes the books so magical is the subplots that wind through it, tying it all together. Movie adaptions will almost always leave you disappointed in this regard.
But if you're a fan of the books... go see it!
