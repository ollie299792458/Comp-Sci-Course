This mini-series is done excellently, I cannot praise it any higher. Ten episodes in all, culminating in an unfinished conclusion. I wonder why BBC didn't bother to finish this? This is my first complaint, albeit an unimportant one. The second complaint I have is why the DVD doesn't have subtitles? For those of you who may find the lack of subtitles annoying, then beware.
As you know by now, having read the numerous reviews here at Amazon's, the story centers around the three nannies who work for three different families which resided in London's Berkeley Square in early 1900s. Along with their personal stories are intertwined those of the masters and ladies they serve, as well as their fellow servants'. Only the children they take care of seem neutral, which is why I felt that at many times in the story, it was like I was seeing the story through the children's eyes. The entire series is like a looking glass into the different affairs of the characters, both in high places and in low. This could be the reason why the DVD's back cover likens it to "Upstairs Downstairs."
