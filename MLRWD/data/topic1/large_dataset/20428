I bought this DVD last year and when I fell off of the exercise wagon, this was relegated to a drawer in the entertainment center.  After doing a Kathy Smith weight lifting routine last night, I picked this back up to stretch right before bed with the PM routine.

I'm 32, and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life.  But even I needed improvement, and along with cardio and weight training, I've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine.

My feet hurt from high heels.  My quads are too weak, and I fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger.  The stretches in the PM section for the quads and feet (love the massage!) were so good that for those reasons alone I'm committing to doing this every night to get the day's kinks out.

Lewis instructs you to start a stretch, contract a muscle, and then deepen the stretch.  I haven't seen this technique anywhere else, and I think it's a wonderful method for improving flexibility.

Unfortunately, it's only Noon right now and nowhere near bedtime.  I'm already looking forward to doing this one again.  One day I'll get up early enough to do the AM routine....
