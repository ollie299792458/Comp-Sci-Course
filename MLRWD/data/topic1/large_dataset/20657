Distilling a long and complex book into a two hour movie is
difficult at best and impossible at worst, yet I can't help but think "Order of the Phoenix" could have been better. With apologies to everyone who thought it was wonderful, I found it disappointing, disjointed and confusing.  The rapidity with which the action developed and new characters appeared with little or no exposition was unsettling. My husband, a slight HP fan who enjoyed the previous movies, remarked on the way home he'd understood very little of the plot. When I explained the relationships between some of the characters and provided a little basckground, he asked irately, "And I was supposed to know this how?" Exactly. Even I, devoted HP reader and movie watcher, had the sense that "Order of the Phoenix" was 128 minutes of previews for the REAL movie--which I'd love to see! Perhaps an unedited version will show up (on ten discs)...
I'm giving it three stars instead of one, because of the stunning acting--especially Alan Rickman and Imelda Staunton--and the amazing sets.  It's unfortunate that both got such short shrift.
And by the way, kudos to J.K. Rowling for not writing with an eye to the movies.
