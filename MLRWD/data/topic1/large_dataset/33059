i got no idea what all the critics are thinking or why they even have a job. this movie got terrible reviews from the critics and why? too over the top? well for the first time in ages they made a tight action movie that was a hard R. most pg-13 movies are the same as R movies but without the blood. anyway this is a very entertaining action movie. a non stop thrill ride as all those washed-up critics put it. while definately not for the kids, if your in the mood for something that makes you all tense from the amazing action, then practiclly fallin out of your seat with laughter. i mean if you not grabbin yer seat, yer fallin out of it. great all around shooting scenes and the best, most intense car chases ever caught on film; plus hilarious jokes. you cant beat it. buy it if you like action films at all. also a must if you want to show off your home theatre setup. at least rent it if you like action, you wont regret it. it is rated R for- strong violence and action, pervasive language, and sexuality.
