It"s a shame that you cannot purchase an American copy of this American film in America.  I had to send to Austrailia for a copy [ must be viewed on region-free player] that is complete.  Europeans and Austrailians can see the complete movie but not us.
  The love scene between Ellen and Cort is vital to connect the action in the first half of the movie with the second.  We see Ellen's flight from the town of  Redemption but not her return, nor do we see what caused the change of attitude between them. One moment we hear of her indifference to what happens to Cort and the next  they are conspiring together to avoid killing one another.
  Cutting a sexy scene out of a R-rated film is ridiculous especially one vital to the understanding of the movie.  Since Sharon Stone is both star and producer of this film,I would hope she would try to restore one of her best movies. No work on the film is required, just the release of the foreign edition in America. With many films being released on DVD in several versions there is nothing unusual about that.
  As far as the film is concerned. the great disparity  in the reviews is explained by whether the reviewer likes this kind of western or not. I do, and  i liked this film very much. Besides, how many films have a cast like this; Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman [always a great villian], Lance Hendrikseb, Pat Hingle, not to mention Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio just before their big breaks. Let's hope for a complete DVD.
