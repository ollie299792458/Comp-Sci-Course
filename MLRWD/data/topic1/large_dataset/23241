In the beginning was science fiction of Jules Verne and Herbert Wells (of the time machine fame). They mostly explored the possibilities of the future through the lense of the scientific achievement. Then came the thirties with their pulp fiction printed in cheap magazines and the romance of war and love against the backdrop of outer space that we now regard as Space Opera. Thanks to that heritage of ours, almost everything that Hollywood would serve up Sci-Fi on the screen these days, from Star Wars to Buck Rogers, would be miore appropriately called space opera. There are exceptions, of course; we have Space Odyssey and the Fantastic Voyage (which almost escapes the clutches of the cold war in favor of pure scientific pursuit were it not for Donald Pleasance attempting to sabotage the effort!), and then there is the Sark Star.
While it was inspired in part by Dr. Strangelove, and has the campy feel of a low budget film, the picture is a John Carpenter original showing off his quirky humor. From the beginning we don't know if our militarized space cadets are adrift in space or in the sea of a mammouth bureaucracy. Yes, there is a talking smart bomb that experiences some deep philosophical issues, but who can blame it when thed computer that controls it has its wires crossed? The spacemen are there to make the universe safe for settlement by destroying the unstable planet, and they succumb in the end due to a breakdown in communications, which is at the heart of most major disasters.
For a change the film feels like classic science fiction, we have men in space, as opposed men on a battleship fighting a battle, that happens to be in space. Most of the themes present in classical sci-fi are addressed in this film - Man vs Outer Space, Man dealing with effects of extended space travel, Man vs Machine, and even the etiquette of dealing with the alien life forms is addressed in this neat little sci-fi farce that no self-respecting fan of sci fi ought to miss.
