Some people question the inclusion of this title to the James Bond Gift Set, but as the first of the Roger Moore Bonds it ushers in a new era and is important in an historical context.  One thing the commentary and  'making of" featurette neglect to mention is that the brass at United  Artists, having felt the first non-Connery Bond a big disappointment, was  to insist that the film be so entertaining it didn't matter who played  Bond.  Having Paul McCartney doing your title song didn't hurt either.  Although I disagree with many of the things the filmmakers chose to  include, it is interesting to hear their reasonings.  For example, Bond  literally stacking the deck of tarot cards to seduce Solitaire is just  wrong, wrong, wrong.  Bond should never have to "trick" anyone  into bed.  Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz must spend 20 minutes all told  saying how Moore differed from Connery.  We got it, Tom!  Filmmakers'  memories can be faulty, but someone connected to this special edition  should have told us why veteran Bond composer John Barry and actor Desmond  Llewelyn (Q) were unavailable for this outing.  Although not my favorite  Bond, there is a freshness to this film, and Moore seems more youthful  (even though he is 3 years older than Connery!) and very enthusiastic.  It  is hard to argue with success, and LIVE AND LET DIE was a big moneymaker  for the studio and the Bond team.
