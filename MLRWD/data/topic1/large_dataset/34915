Wowzers! Now before I start my views may be a tad bias seeing as I'm a HUGE Re-animator fan :) . I watched "Bride of Re-animator" before seeing "The Re-animator" so was I ever in for a big surprise when I got my hand on this masterpeice! I would have been happy with just the movie itself. But with all the extras the come in this package I was completely blown away and left knowing ALOT about how this movie was made and many funny stories that came from it.
Now the DVD is full of extras. I LOVE The Commentary by producer Brian Yuzna and actors Jeffrey Combs, Robert Sampson, Barbara Crampton, and Bruce Abbott on this movie! It's is full of laughs, memories, info and just a bunch of friends re-calling events! Jeff Combs remembers ALOT of his lines from the movie, Bruce Abbott has been using a promotional "Re-animator" paperholder as an ashtray threw out the years , and Barbara recalls her moms "favorite scene". There are TONS of deleted scenes ranging from Herbert Shooting up with the the re-animation juice to Herbert crying! Lots of great interviews here, the interview with Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna is gold, they go over casting, shooting, and really funny stories of when the first time they saw the finished product. Another favorite feature of mine is the photo gallery, I laughed my way threw all the many photos and you can tell everyone had a great time on the set (my favorite photo is David Gale under the desk with his head threw it and Jeffery Combs helping him smoke). There are many more extras that are informative and funny. This DVD adds greater quality and sound making "The Re-animator" a must have.
