"Judgment at Nuremberg" was the fictional account of one of the "minor" trials, with Spencer Tracy as the sole judge;

this miniseries is the more-or-less true story of the BIG

trial, the International Military Tribunal conducted earlier by Americans, British, French, and Russians jointly.

Alec Baldwin doesn't resemble the real-life Justice Robert Jackson, who was the chief US prosecutor, but he does a good job of delivering the role, and won awards for his portrayal. Ignore the silly,  totally irrelevant relationship between the Supreme Court justice-on-leave and a secretary or assistant played by Jill Hennessy. You'll get a pretty good impression of the proceedings, in a reconstruction of the IMT courtroom in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg.

The Number Two Nazi, the Number One defendant, Herman Goering,

actually bested Jackson during the questioning. Note how the script portrays their encounter.

the one most people actually mean when they say "Nuremberg war-crimes trial."
