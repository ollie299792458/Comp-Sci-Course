This movie has such a great plotline and you would think the movie would be really funny, but it's not. at all. I never really found steve carell super funny so that may be the problem. The movie is pretty boring sometimes too. HIs friends are hysterical so I think he may be the problem. Theres some funny parts in the movie dont get me wrong but the parts that arent funny are relly boring. Overall I liked this movie and I think it's good and pretty funny but I wish they would have made it shorter. I think thats another problem. They have a lot of parts that arent funny and boring and for how long the movie is it makes it worse. I suggest you should watch this movie but dont go into it having really hgih expectations and thinking it's going to be super funny. Steve carell is way funnier in the Anchorman. If you want to watch a really funny movie and you like steve carell then you should watch The Anchorman instead of this. The part when he's taking his girlfriends daughter to the sex clinic is hilarious.
