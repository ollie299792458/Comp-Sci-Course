So here's a little story about my viewing experience with Elephant.

I watched this movie with my younger brother.  We're both high school kids.  Before Elephant, we'd both watched a few more drama, psychological films, some independent and major movies that have been praised for making the viewers really think.  We both enjoy this type of movie, though it's one of the few things we have in common, when it comes to film.  He enjoys action and sci-fi.  Generally, when he overhears conversation about a new horror movie, the first question from him is "Who died?".  I prefer drama and romance movies, anything with lots of realistic human emotions and situations.

So anyway.  The first hour or so of Elephant passes, and we're both a little anxious, we're kids.  A few times we've laughed, a few times we've 'aww...'ed, and honestly, maybe once or twice we've groaned, the first two thirds of Elephant simply aren't all that entertaining, though I do appreciate it all.  The climax of the film begins, and I'm shocked.  I knew it was coming, and because of that I didn't expect to get that gut-wrenching feeling.  I actually expected of myself to be able to sit back and take it all in normally, like the other films we'd watched throughout the past few days, but I instead got that tingly feeling we've all had at some point in our lives, and I'm shocked.  My brother, he sees my reaction and he calmly asks "What's wrong?".

If you come into this film and expect it to think for you, you'll be left wondering what everyone else is seeing.  Quite simply, if you can call yourself an avid action film lover, Elephant may not be for you.  If you prefer leaving the theater with a physical rush instead of psychological rush, Elephant may not be for you.  If you can't take a film for it's entire package and effect, but rather the sum of it's parts and who gets killed, Elephant most certainly isn't for you.
