I saw the original on Broadway (with Jennifer Holiday) and was prepared to not like the movie because I thought no one else could believably play Effie. Boy was I wrong. While Jennifer Holiday still rules supreme because she shaped the role, Jennifer Hudson lite up the screen. I felt as though I was watching and hearing the beginning of a future legend. The only complaint I had is that she emulated Jennifer Holiday's original delivery a little too close. For instance, at the end of And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going, she did the breath gasp that was spontaneous in the original Broadway production. But I don't want to sell her short, she was absolutley amazing.

The rest of the cast did a good job. I found Eddie Murphy to be very believable and he had a surprisingly good voice. I was less enthralled with Beyonce and Jamie Foxx. Beyonce's voice was good on Listen but came off a little thin compared to Hudson. The actress who played Lorell did a good job in the role. The rest of the supporting cast delivered.

I had heard that the movie dragged but this wasn't my impression. I thought it was just right.

I saw the movie at a historic theatre in New York City and the crowd enjoyed the film so much that they stayed in their seats and applauded when Hudson and Murphy were shown during the credits.
