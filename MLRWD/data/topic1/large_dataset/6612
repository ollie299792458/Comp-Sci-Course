I saw this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Having read the books numerous times and seen Peter Jackson's movies, I have mixed feelings about Ralph Bakshi's movie. On the positive side, it's clear that he tried to capture the spirit of the film. A lot of the dialogue is taken right from the books and he captures the main storyline fairly well on what was clearly a limited animation budget.

On the other hand, many of the creative decisions Mr. Bakshi made were very strange. For example, why does Aragorn wear a skirt the whole time? Why does Boromir wear a ridiculous viking horn helmet? Why is Sam portrayed as being mentally challenged? And why do the Ringwraiths walk around like cripples? Seriously, why would you be afraid of these Ringwraiths when you could outdistance them by simply walking quickly. The pronunciations are often wrong. Balin is pronounced "Bay-lin" for example.

It's almost if Mr. Bakshi make this movie by himself and didn't show it to anyone until he was done. That being said, it's too bad his studio didn't allow him to make a second movie to finish the story. I would have liked to have seen what other strange but interesting elements Mr Bakshi would have added to the story.
