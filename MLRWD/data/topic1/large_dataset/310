After reading "In Cold Blood" I decided to watch both of the recent films about Truman Capote, beginning with "Infamous" and then watching "Capote". My recommendation to others is to only watch "Infamous". Although it covers very grim subject matter, this movie is very watchable and enjoyable, as opposed to "Capote" which is two hours of artsy misery. Toby Jones really becomes Truman Capote in a way that Phillip Hoffman does not even touch. Jones' Truman draws the viewer in and charms, while Hoffman's performance in "Capote" alienates and repulses to the point that it seems that this actor secretly hates Truman Capote. Also, "Infamous" does a much better job at explaining the story to thise who have not read the book, and giving depth to the other characters than "Capote". Watching "Infamous", the dark parts of the story are thrown into sharper relief by the light and humorous parts, and it cuts precisely to the heart of the matter. Whereas "Capote" just bludgeons the viewer over the head with gritty green lighting, long staring pauses and unrelieved gloom.
