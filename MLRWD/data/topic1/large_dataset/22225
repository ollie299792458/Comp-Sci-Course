'A prehistoric beast in a nuclear age!'

No, not G.W. Bush, it's Tor Johnson!

There are some true quandaries in this 'movie' such as:

1.  The narrator slurs his words, is he drunk?

2.  Whenever Tor moves he looks in pain, did he have a back problems?  And if so how long did it take him to get off the toilet?

3.  When Tor mouths something, are they real words? `I ugh Tor ugh.' Or `Tor crush ugh.'

4.  Is Tor Johnson even human?  What the hell are those knots on his head?

5.  How much did Tor get paid for this movie? $10, $20 maybe $50?

6.  If you start running will some one shoot you?

I saw this two nights ago by myself, after getting it in a box collection.  I beg of you not to make the same mistake I made!  The movie should come with a warning:

Warning: 'Watching this movie alone can cause physical harm!'

I mean...it...was...painful.  Like swallowing broken glass or a box of tacks.  But the story doesn't end there. A friend of mine came over to watch some movies, to get into the upcoming Halloween spirit.  And after several attempts to try and get him to pick something I threatened him with the worst movie ever made and he said, 'Worse than Plan 9?'.  I told him Plan 9 was like Citizen Kane compared to this movie.  He wouldn't heed my threats or warnings, so the night after I saw it by myself, I ended watching it again but this time something amazing happened...it was hilarious.  It was absolutely hilarious, we laughed so hard our sides hurt.

The movie itself deserves a zero but fun the factor is off the scale for the veteran sfi-fi/fanatasy/horror fan that is quick with a witty remark and can embrace the carnival bizarre.

I'm convinced David Lynch based his whole career on this single movie.

You've been warned, do not watch this movie alone.
