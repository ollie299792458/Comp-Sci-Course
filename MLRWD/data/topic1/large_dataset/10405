"Plan 9 From Outer Space" is without a doubt Ed Wood's most hilariously incompetent movie - if you only see one of his epics, make it this one. As you've probably heard countless times, this film has it all - flying saucers on strings, fey aliens and silk pyjamas, a ridiculous "army of the dead," tombstones that keep falling over, cops who point their guns in all directions, a 'star' who is dead, and truly hideous dialogue. The story, if it really matters, is about aliens determined to destroy the earth before scientists discover the 'solarmanite' bomb, which can destroy sunlight and, apparently, the universe. A true classic of unintentional comedy.
The DVD from Image Entertainment shows give "Plan 9" just about the best image quality it's ever likely to have. There are still nicks and scratches, but the image is sharp and the black levels are solid, and its miles away from blurry old VHS tapes. The biggest value this DVD has is in its nearly two-hour documentary "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion." This documentary covers every imaginable aspect of "Plan 9" (including shooting, distribution, flaws, and its impact on popular culture) in amazing detail. It also includes interviews with much of the cast as well as prominent fans (Sam Raimi, Drew Friedman, and others). A theatrical trailer is also included.
