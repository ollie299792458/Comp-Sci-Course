When I rented this video, I had to watch it twice before I took it back.  It is a wonderful visit back in time to the 80's, when hair was big and life was sweet.  Wide belts were in, and mousse was a best-seller.  The  music in this movie is fantastic, especially if you, like I, grew up during  this time.  I was weaned on MTV, watching it 24-7.  Watching this movie is  like those MTV days all over again.  Perhaps even better than the music and  nostalgia of this movie is the romance between the characters played by  Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler.  Both characters are genuinely nice, and  are genuinely good people, who are truly interested in being good at what  they do.  It is also refreshing to see Christine Taylor in a role other  than Marcia Brady of the Brady Bunch movies.  I had to look twice at her to  realize who she was in such a different role.  She plays the best friend  and confidante of Barrymore's character, and succeeds in matchmaking.  This  is a delightfully innocent look back to a sweeter time in our lives, and  for those growing up in the 90's, perhaps it will show them how much more  innocent and wonderful life was back then!
