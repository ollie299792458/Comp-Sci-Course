How strange is this; a biopic about a groundbreaking and enigmatic comedian's life (Andy Kaufman), starring one of Hollywood's top actors (Jim Carrey), illustrated through an Academy Award winning director (Milos  Forman) is considered a bad movie! Why? Because nobody knows or likes Andy  Kaufman? Because it was rated R? It's more like under appreciated...
  This is an amazing movie in which we see Andy brought back to life through  Jim Carrey's performance. In fact, you do not see Carrey anywhere in this  film. All the jokes and gags are by Andy, not Jim, ANDY. The rest of the  casts' performance supports the movie, such as Paul Giamatti's portrayal as  Bob Zmuda and Courtney Love's portrayal as Andy supporting and loving  girlfriend, Lynn Marguiles.
 It's odd how it did bad at the box office  and with some critics, who were writing it off as one of the worst films of  1999. Now that it's on video and DVD, it's getting good reviews! Where was  the support during the 2000 Academy Awards (it didn't even get 1  nomination!)? You have to understand  and figure out the movie before  passing judgement.
