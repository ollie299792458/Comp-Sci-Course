This popular TV movie from "Dark Shadows" creator Dan Curtis has  maintained its solid reputation mostly because of the last tale presented,  "Amelia", about a possessed devil doll, but all three tales are  extremely effective on their own level. In "Julie", a shy,  seemingly repressed schoolteacher is blackmailed by one of her students,  which has some dire consequences. The next offbeat offering,  "Millicent and Therese" is truy a most unusual tale of sibling  rivalry. And the final segment,"Amelia", which has elevated this  movie into horror heaven, has a beautiful woman being terrorized by a tiny  devil doll which comes to life in her apartment. The sexy and talented  Karen Black stars in all three segments and effectively displays her  amazing versatility. Though I give all three segments equal credit, I am  compelled to admit that the third segment was indeed way ahead of its time  and features some truly startling effects worthy of a theatrical release.  This is, without a doubt, the finest made-for-TV movie I have ever seen. A  must for horror buffs!
