The theatrical release of Highlander: Endgame was one of the most puzzling releases I had ever seen.  While the characters and concept were consistent with the TV show, the film itself seemed to be greatly lacking.  Almost soulless.  It was only barely decent.
With the DVD release, 12 minutes have been restored to the cut, and the quality of the movie has been changed dramatically.  The villain is more interesting, the characters are more developed, and the plot makes more sense.
It is actually a good movie.
The DVD package itself is also a great deal of fun.  Not only are there some interesting featurettes (including a very interesting 1-hour behind-the-scenes one), but there is an earlier cut of the movie, allowing one to actually see how the movie developed.  And, with a quaint trivia game included, along with some features for those who have a DVD-ROM, the DVD is more than worth the money.
As for the movie itself, it is a great relief.  While there is still almost no sense of continuity (continuing the proud Highlander tradition of disowning anything prior to it), the movie sticks to the original concept from Highlander I and stays there.  There are immortals out for the prize, and the immortality itself is half blessing, half curse.
It is also a joy to see Heather and Rachel, both of whom were ignored since the first film, once more playing out their roles in Connor's life.  The acting is very strong, and there literally are no weak performances.  The action is fast and furious, and the plot is gripping.
Still, I find myself wishing that there was some continuity laid down that the producers would actually follow.  At this point, the only way that somebody could follow the stories between all four movies and the two TV shows is with an interdimensional map.
But, all in all, definitely worth seeing, and definitely worth owning.
