Carmen Electra's rack was the only saving grace for this movie. What happened to the good old spoofs that were actually funny, like Airplane, Naked Gun, Hot Shots? They weren't even trying here. It's obvious the actors were interested in a paycheck only and certatinly not worried about the damage that could be caused to their careers after appearing in such a piece of crap. Did the film "300", a nerdboy's wet dream of bulging codpieces and greased pecs, create a genre that needed so desperately to be spoofed? Filmmakers (and I use the term loosely here) Shecky Greenblatt and Morris Goldberg seemed to think so. These amatuers must be related to SOME Hollywood honchos or else how could the studio have given them the OK for this? A colossal waste of time - - - you can think of ten thousand better things to do with your time other than watch this movie. I guarantee you will actually feel less intelligent than you did before you sat down for this turd, and if you don't, then you are right where the studio who executed this abortion wants you to be.
