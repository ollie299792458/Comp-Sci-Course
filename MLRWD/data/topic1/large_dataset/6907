One of my all time favorites. I loved the series when I was a kid and was first in line for the movie. About five years ago I searched long and hard to get a copy on VHS and finally found one. Now here it is on DVD right at my fingertips (of course I have to get it).
As far as the movie goes it was awesome beginning to end and now at 26 I still feel that way. Many people say that the animation is inferior by today's standards, but I say that this cartoon as well as many of the 80's cartoons are superior to the animation I see on cartoon network. What I see now are drawings, cartoon etc. However what I see in The Transformers Movie were solid characters that I still have to remind myself were cartoons. The animation (movements) my be a bit off key but the drawing on a whole look far more detailed right down to the shine on the metel as they moved. The voices were great especially Leonard Nimoy and Orson Welles. The only downsides to this movie were the killing off of so many cool characters such as Optimus Prime, Wheeljack and Ironhide, and the butchering of the series that followed the movie. Far too much emphasis on the matrix and Rodimus' insecurity as a leader. The writers knew it too because they had to bring Optimus back.
I would definatly suggest getting this movie and watching over and over again. When I show it to my kids they are amazed as to how much cooler my cartoons were to theirs, something I never said to my parents.
