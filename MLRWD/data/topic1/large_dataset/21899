I am not a fan of Bollywood, as a matter of fact, Guzaarish was the third Bollywood film that I've watched in my entire life.  The first one I've watched while visiting a friend of Afghan origin. I thought that the Bollywood films with the energetic dancing and emotional outburst were a bit too much for my taste.  With all that said, imagine my delightful surprise to find out that Guzaarish was a Bollywood film!!

While searching Youtube, I've accidentally stumbled upon the song 'Smile' by composer Charlie Chaplin.  The haunting video clip moved me; so, I've decided to go ahead, 'take the plunge without the parachute'(quote/unquote by Ethan Macaranhea) and ordered the DVD.

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are exceptional gifted actors.  They can 'act' without much 'moving', the expression in their eyes, the shake of their heads, even the silence speaks and convey message.  The setting was meticulously done: the big mansion with its great halls, lots of green plants clinging to the fertile damp soil, metaphorised its owner's strive to live despise his condition. The music in the film was beautiful, haunting, sad and joy at the same time.  The climatic music at the revealation scene was poignantly done. Great cheer to director Sanjay Bhansali!

And the dancing!  Ah, what can I say? Hrithik Roshan is .. WOW! I was watching the movie when my mom walked in at the scene Hrithik danced to his magic act, and she asked 'Who is this great dancer?'. The way he has expressed himself through his dance movements is divine! a devotee to the performing art.  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's flamenco inspired dance was sensous, joyful, captivated and how's she executed those hand dance movements is beyond me!

I was enjoyed 'Guzaarish' with  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Hrithink Roshan so much that after I finished with 'Guzaarish', I searched and also ordered DVD 'Jodhaa Akbar' so that I enjoy their talent once again in different setting.
