Most Blu-Rays are either great (The Road Warrior) or terrible (The Ninth Gate), so it's rare when I find one that underperforms juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a little bit; even a Blu-Ray with virtually NO special features has a magnificent picture (The Dark Knight) or some other compensation.

POLTERGEIST is one of these.

The transfer is great.  I was 2 when it came out so I never got to see it as a big-screen experience and it is a revelation to see it as such: I liked this movie before and I LOVE it now.  However, the transfer's not the problem...it's the master.  I don't think they cleaned the film sufficiently when they struck the master because there's noticeable dirt and pinprick abrasions throughout the film: it's not terrible, or even plain bad...but if you are a videophile like me, it can be a bit unnerving.  The worst part is the living room scene where they first speak to Carol Anne: there's a series of faded vertical scratches through the middle of the screen throughout the entire scene...I would have hoped they'd notice that and paint it out, but they didn't.  Thankfully the scratches are thin and faint (and they don't show up again) so they're not unbearable, but they are irritating.  The film is grainy, but in the good way (1980s film stock wasn't as sharp as it is today) although some grains seem a little larger than others at times...but I can't prove it.

As for special features, well, I think POLTERGEIST is never gonna have the special features it deserves due to the whole Spielberg/Hooper controversy, so I won't get my hopes up.  Basically the picture reminds me of first generation DVDs of classic movies (the first Road Warrior DVD comes to mind)...much better than VHS, but it could be improved/cleaned up.

Colors, tones, blacks and all that other stuff seem to be fine.  Aside from the maintenance issue, I don't see any other problems with this transfer and at $20 right now is a great find.
