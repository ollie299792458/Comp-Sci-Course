I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:

-The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.

-The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.

-The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.

-The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.

The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies.
