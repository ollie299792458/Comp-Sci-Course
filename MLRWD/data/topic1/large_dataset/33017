The Special Limited Edition (SLE) is a major improvement in sound quality.  On the original DVD release, while supposedly sporting 5.1 sound, the rear speakers stay silent during almost the entire movie.  Not so on the SLE version, which does a much better job of immersing you in the audio.
If only I could say the same for the video transfer.  I had high hopes when I read that the video transfer was new, and was disappointed when I saw that the picture on the SLE version was almost indistinguishable from the original DVD. The SLE version still displays some frame jitters and occasional motion artifacts, just like the original DVD, even on a progressive scan DVD player. 
The extra material is OK, but only a true diehard fan would be interested in reading the original script or the original lobby program guide.  Much of the material is difficult to read, because of the small size of the book.
So we will call it a hit and a miss.  Still one of the greatest movies ever, and if you don't already own it, I highly recommend it. But if you already own the original DVD, I would be hard-pressed to justify spending an extra [money amount]for the small amounts of extra material and improvements in the SLE version.
