Grumpy Old Men is probably my favorite comedy of all time. I saw it in the theater back when it came out, then bought the VHS tape as soon as it was released. Then when DVD's took off, I waited and waited and waited for it to be released. It finally was, but only in FULL SCREEN. So I never bought it and only ever had the VHS version until this Bluray came out. Nothing more needs to be said about this movie, it is hilarious and heart-warming at the same time. A gem of a movie that shows you do not have to act old just because you hit your 60's, 70's or 80's. So I won't say any more about that... I will say it is so nice to finally see this in widescreen, and for a movie pushing 20 years old, the picture quality is great. It is a BIG bummer that all that is included on this Bluray disc is ONE trailer. This is easily the weakest Bluray I own when it comes to bonus features. But... I feel happy to get the movie and since it was only [...] bucks new, I can't complain. Here's to hoping the release Grumpier Old Men on Bluray now, and fill it with a ton of bonus features.
