I give this film 1 star because there isn't a zero. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The movie has no plot. It fails as both a comedy and a horror picture. It isn't funny. It isn't scary. It's a complete waste of film stock and time.

Apart from a few very short scenes and clips, the entire two grueling hours is spent in ONE room. Grant's over-the-top acting in this film is just ridiculous. There's a character in the film who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. He says "Bully" all the time, blows a bugle at random times and yells "Charge!" and runs up the stairs several times throughout the film. This is funny? Really? On what planet? I have to think that people must have been easily amused in 1941, because it's hard to imagine that anyone today would actually find this movie funny. Cary Grant himself didn't like this movie either.

Watching this movie is similar to watching an episode of Fawlty Towers - non-stop talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, interspersed with yelling as one emergency flows into the next. This is not a relaxing watch. Part of the problem can be explained by the fact that this was originally a play - thus the exaggerated acting, non-stop talk and and one-room location. Unfortunately, adequate adaptation was not made for film.

I felt like I had been robbed of two hours of my life after watching this awful picture. If I can reach one person out there and save them from wasting 2 hours of their limited time on Earth, then my time in writing this was worth it.
