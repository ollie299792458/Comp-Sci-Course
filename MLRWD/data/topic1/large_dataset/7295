First, I am really fond of this movie. But, each iteration of DVD has been hugely disappointing. The wit and imagination that crafted the movie in the first place is nowhere in the minds of the people doing the DVDs.
For instance, the opening scene (in Madison Sqr Garden) originally piqued your curiosity by showing a fight scene that is surprising (to say the least) for the time and setting... but in this new Immortal Edition, they've spliced in scenes from 16th Century Scotland BEFORE the parking garage fight even begins.  What could they have been thinking?
Worst of all is the technical quality of the DVD: the video transfer is mediocre at its best; the sound is worse, with volume and clarity fluctuating all over the place; and the subtitles - are simply MISSING for most of the dialog. 
Like the other digital versions of this movie, the Immortal is a half-hearted and half-witted effort! If you like this film, as I do, buy the VHS version, and keep hoping the owners/producers eventually join the digital age.
