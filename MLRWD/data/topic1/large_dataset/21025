At first glance King of New York comes off as just another gangster film about a vicious crime lord with a soft spot. This is anything but . Christopher Walken in a powerful performance as Frank White is the main  character in this movie his right hand man is Laurence fishbourne (When he  was known as Larry) who is dead on in his portrayal of a wise cracking  henchman . The movie also stars a young Wesley Snipes and Daid Caruso as  the cops hellbent on sending frank White to jail. Frank is an evil man but  has a heart . He wants to save a public hospital in a poor neighborhood  from being sold and privatized. Though Robin Hood he isnt he does come off  as a hero to those who look up to him. The story is predictable and has a  few holes in it but worth seeing . I guarantee at some point u will find  yourself sayin "hey I didnt know he was in this movie" as there  are many recognizble role players among the stars mentioned. Caruso and  snipes are extremely believable as the cops , Fishbourne is a little over  the top yet he doesnt go too far over and after understanding his charcter  , you begin to appreciate his performance . As for Walken well he is great  in just about any role he takes. Buy this movie you will not be  dissapointed.
