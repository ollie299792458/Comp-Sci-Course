"The Women" will go down in movie history as the quentiessential ladies film.  The central character, Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), is the one who is enduring her share of pain when learning of her husband's affair with a sneaky department store clerk (MGM studio rival Joan Crawford).  With Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Lucile Watson, Marjorie Main and other cast members providing noted performances, "The Women" was directed with skill and strong, entertainment quality by the legendary George Cukor, who took the screenplay from the Clare Boothe Luce Broadway comedy that ran for a then-record 666 performances.  And, yes, who can forget the technicolor fashion scene with the high fashions of 1939 flashing before your eyes?  This is a comedy for the ages.  To today's moviegoers, Norma Shearer is best remembered for "The Women" as opposed to her other films such as "Marie Antoinette," "The Divorcee" (her only Oscar-winner), "A Free Soul," to name a few.  This marked Shearer's last "great film" appearance, although she would do two more MGM films before leaving the screen in 1942.  As Mary, she nurtures a daughter, gets advice from her mother, and uses "Jungle Red" to later get back the man of her life from Crawford.  The fight scene between Russell and Goddard was hilarious to the hilt as the ladies settle down on a western ranch away from New York City.  And Mary Boland's countess was interesting with her emphasis on la'mour, la'mour, la'mour (love in French).

With an all-female cast, "The Women" shows bonding, feuding, and glamour in one, golden package.  A must-see for all.
