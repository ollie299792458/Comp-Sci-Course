Disguised as a dumb teen comedy, "Drop Dead Goreous" is actually a clever, hilarious satire on beauty pageants and documentaries.
A film crew comes to Mount Rose, Minnesota to document the local beauty pageant for the Sarah Rose Teen Princess Pageant. We have the stereotypical characters: Becky, the snobbish, pretty, rich girl (a truly bad Denise Richards); her mother Gladys (Kirstie Alley), the fanatical, ex-beauty queen in charge of the pageant; and Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), the trailer-park Cinderella. Fur flies (as does Amber's mother, the fantastic Ellen Barkin) and tempers flare. Contestants get blown up, knocked out, and knocked off. And that's just at the local level.
While clearly devoid of any tact, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" succeeds on its own terms, as a hilarious screwball farce with a brilliant cast (minus Richards), including Brittany Murphy and the wonderful, terribly underappreciated Allison Janney. It's not "Citizen Kane", but it's FUNNY!
