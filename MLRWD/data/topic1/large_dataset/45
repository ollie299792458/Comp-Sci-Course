At age 15 my first job was at Sidewinder Cafe in Newberry, CA. Mojave Desert. On my 62 birthday a lifetime friend, my husband and I decided to go back to the desert and see how it was doing. We visited the Barn, community center, old homesteads, then went to see if Sidewinder was still standing..... couldn't see it for the tour buses. We found a parking spot, the building was the same, old stripped Avion and Silverstreak trailers parked outside, people taking pics everywhere, cafe dirty but full of people. Cook... dirty and rude, piano in dining area, everything seemed broken but happy people everywhere.. They were all European, most didn't talk English. We kept asking why they were here, finally 1 German lady said... didn't you see the movie and pointed to a film poster on the wall. She put her hand to her chest and said it was wonderful. Well, much more happened while there (now named the Bagdad Cafe because of movie).. (all good), we left mystified, curious AND ordered Bagdad Cafe from Amazon as soon as we arrived back home. It is a cult movie. It was a rage in Europe, Asia, etc. We watched our first cult movie and.... loved it. We will watch it again, and again... we recommend this little jewel, made us laugh and think.
