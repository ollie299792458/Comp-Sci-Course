If you snooze you lose. I know it's a bad saying, but it's good advise to use before watching `The Usual Suspects'. Although it's almost impossible to fall asleep during this film, if you do it's not worth trying to  recuperate. There is so much information crammed into two hours of film,  one minute of not paying attention will require at least ten minutes of  explanation. 
The film begins with the ending when a cargo ship, docked  in the New York City harbor, blows up. Behind a clump of boating equipment,  we see a scared Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), watching a man in black kill  Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), blow up the ship, and then walk away. Now the  plot is set. Through the police questioning of Mr. Kint, done by inspector  Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), we go back to before the ship's land siege,  finding out about a  police line-up, and the mysterious man in black named  Kayser Soze.  
Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete  Postlethwaite, Stephen Baldwin, Garbriel Byrne, and others, along with a  brilliantly written screenplay, make The Usual Suspects one of the best  thrillers and most unpredictable films of all time. I bet you can't watch  it only once.
