This is the second copy of THE GALLANT HOURS that I have had.  The first was in VHS format which I loaned out a time back, but was never returned.  All the reviews that have been made are good, and I have nothing to add.  I will say however, that the exterior scenes that appear toward the end of this epic, including the departure scene and Admiral Halsey's reading of his retirement orders just aft of the Number Three Turret, were filmed in Long Beach Harbor---not San Diego, as stated on the production notes.  They were filmed on board the USS BREMERTON, CA-130, an 8 inch gun, Baltimore Class Heavy Cruiser, homeported in Long Beach, California.  At the time, I was a member of the United States Marine Corps, assigned to Commander, Cruiser Division Three that was flying its flag aboard the BREMERTON. I was a member of the Marine Detachment, appearing in the final onboard scene rendering honors to the departing Admiral Halsey.  The officers (all ensigns), seen pulling the oars of the long boat in the final scene, were all crew members of the United States Coast Guard Cutter PONCHARTRAIN, W-70, also homeported in Long Beach.
