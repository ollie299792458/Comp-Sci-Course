Thir13en Ghosts is about a struggling family who inherit a strange all glass house from their late uncle Cyrus. On the outside the house seems interesting, but inside is where the terror is lurking, trapped in 12 different glass cells, waiting to be released. And someone wants one more to add to the collection, which would make it thirteen ghosts.
I just loved this film, a great, terrifying film that really takes you on a rollercoaster ride! All the actors in the film give great performances, especially the always lovely Shannon Elizabeth and the witty Mathew (Scream) Lillard. The ghosts in the film look amazing, thanks to KNB FX. Speaking of amazing, the glass mansion is very incredible, so errie and yet very beautiful. There are just to many good things to say about this film! First time feature film director Steve Beck did a great job with the film, and it turned out awsome! Don't get me wrong though, the film is very gory and intense, so best leave the small ones at home before heading to the theater or video store to catch this film.
Overall: An amazing horror rollercoaster that will scare you right down to the bone!
