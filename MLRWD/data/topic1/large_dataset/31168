Well, what can I say, a great freakin' movie.  Now, I am not the biggest Tarantino fan, but I do love this movie and Pulp Fiction.  The thing that draws me to his movies is the dialogue.  It's the way people really talk!  Political correctness is thrown out the window, along with any censorship  of gratuitous violence.  And isn't that what we really want?  If you want  censored films, watch Disney.  If you like the whole action film thing,  this movie is for you.  If you like the whole love story thing, this film  is for you.  If you like movies with multiple stars-you guessed it, this  film is for you.  This movie is so good, it has background characters such  as Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and Val Kilmer.  Background characters!  I didn't even recongize Val Kilmer as Elvis (just  watch the movie) until I watched it for like the third time.  My only real  complaint on the DVD is that it was not recorded in 5.1 surround.  This  movie is what 5.1 surround was made for!  I was probably overly  disappointed about that, but otherwise, there is no reason to not buy this  if any of this information interests you.
