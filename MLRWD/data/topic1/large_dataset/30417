This movie was on the weekend deals for $0.99 and I decided to take a chance on it.  I am very glad I did, because this movie was an incredible tale.

For some reason the title jumped out at me, but I didn't understand why at first.  When I was a child, I had actually heard about this story, about the man who lives forever young, but his age and blackness is reflected in his painting.  Once I started reading the other reviews, I instantly remembered this tale from long ago, and got pretty excited to watch it.

I promptly rented it and downloaded it for viewing on my PC. (See note on this at bottom.)

I really enjoyed all of the main characters performances, I was sucked in to this world from the very beginning.  This movie excels at just crafting a gripping story and immersing you in it.

Anyways, a short synopsis; Dorian Gray inherits what appears to be a large fortune and estate from his deceased father. He travels to claim it and meets a man that pushes him in to living a life of debauchery and pleasure. After putting up some mild resistance, he finally succumbs to the temptations. A painter sees something in him and wants to paint his portrait. Dorian poses for him, and whilst conversing with his friend and the painter, his friend unwittingly proposes a very dire question with perilous consequences to Dorian.  Dorian basically trades his soul for eternal youth, but as stated above, all wounds, aging, and soul marring blackness is reflected dynamically in his painting, which he then hides and obsesses over, and guards it lethally.

So the story unfolds, and I want to write more but don't want to spoil more than necessary to get you interested in the film!

P.S. As a side note, I had problems viewing this film in the Amazon Unbox player for the first time ever.  I would get sound but no picture.  Searching help was of no assistance.  Anyways, after fiddling around, I got it to work.  If you're having problems too... try this.

1) Click "Settings" near the upper right corner of the Unbox player.
2) Click on "Preferences..."
3) Click the "Advanced" button near the bottom right corner of the Preferences screen.
4) Remove checkmarks from "Use DirectX Video Acceleration" & "Use YUV Mode".

After doing this, the movie played fine. Not sure why, don't forget to check them back on for your next movie.
