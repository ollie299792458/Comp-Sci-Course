as a bear, this movie is just terrible. i can see where they had good intentions but it is so by the numbers predictable. the film struggles to find its own identity the entire time but ends up imitating every love story in the book. the lead and his love interest are so incompatible it doesn't work. he disses him SO many times yet the kid keeps coming back. it borders on disrespectful and mean with the way he treats the younger guy. like hes a nobody. you cant have sympathy for a vain shallow low self esteem guy in a romantic comedy. the younger lead actor deserved better than what the writer came up with. yet the young guy keeps coming back its just insulting. way over dramatic and juvenile, you cant help but feel bad for the actors having to deal with really bad cliche dialogue. if you want to see a MUCH better film, see bearcub. that movie is actually smart and has way more heart and soul than this trainwreck. this is not how gay bears are guys, this is a bad representation of the community and it is so far fetched. this is not how any couple, gay or straight conduct ourselves. its just insulting.
