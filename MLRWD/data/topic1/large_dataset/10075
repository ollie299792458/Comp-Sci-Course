When younger movie buffs ask me for suggestions for "old" movies they should watch to get an idea of Hollywood's long-gone glamor, "Grand Hotel" is my answer. On this beautifully restored DVD, you catch mythical movie stars at their peak. Garbo, Crawford, the Barrymore brothers, etc. More than that, thanks to MGM's phenomenal crew of artisans, you can study how legends were created--from Adrian's sleek gowns and furs for the ladies to the severely tailored suits for the men. From the highly lit art deco sets of Cedric Gibbons to the wonderfully stylized performances elicited from the magical cast by British director, Edmund Goulding. Those meticulous close-ups of Garbo and Joan Crawford took hours and hours to light and film. You can watch the physical beauty of John Barrymore, just before he slid into acute alcoholism. The music, those great limousines, the sets, the make-up, MGM's superb array of character actors (dig Rafaella Ottiano as Garbo's long-suffering maid), help contribute to the powerful ambiance of Hollywood in l931. There are some great goodie extras, too. I'm glad I got this DVD because I've worn out at least 3 video tapes of this timeless classic.
