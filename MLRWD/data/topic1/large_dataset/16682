The plot: a group of men, from various backgrounds, agree to participate in an 'experiment', for which they will be paid $14,000.  Some of the men are to act as prison guards, the rest as the prisoners.  They are to be 'observed' by the hosts of the experiment.

As the movie unfolds, you can identify with the feelings of both the guards and the prisoners.  Soon enough however, you are watching the complete deterioration of human behavior, even madness.  You may find this movie disturbing on many levels, yet you are compelled to keep watching.  Throughout the movie I felt nervous, anxious, and uneasy as I was drawn into the story.  By the end of the movie, my nerves were raw.  Adrien Brody gives an incredibly powerful performance as the 'ring leader' of the prisoners.  He is a man with a strong moral compass and a great deal of empathy for his fellow human beings.  But, by the end of the movie, he too succumbs to the madness of the experiment.  Forest Whitaker also gives a great performance as a mild-mannered, bible-reading individual, who is chosen as one of the guards.  He soon takes control of the other guards and convinces them that they can pretty much do whatever they want, assuring them that the experiment's 'hosts' will stop the experiment before anything dangerous can happen.

This movie may not be for everyone, but I thought it was extremely well done and will probably become a cult classic.  If you enjoy psychological dramas, you should watch this movie.
