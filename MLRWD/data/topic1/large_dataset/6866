It wasn't "Halloween" and it certainly wasn't "Psycho", nor was the script or the production value all that great.  But as a genuinely scary date movie back in 1980, this film worked.  First, the summer camp setting - with its dark woods, creepy cabins and sinister lake - was the perfect spot for a horror movie.  "Friday the 13th" tapped into the childhood fears of anyone who ever went camping as a kid and listened to scary stories around a fire.  Secondly, Harry Manfredini composed a very effective musical score, combining the shrieking violins of "Psycho" with the now-famous "panting" sound effect that would be used throughout the series.  And lastly, this was the only "Friday the 13th" film with a half-believable plot and a sensible motive for all the killing - a psychotic woman determined not to allow the camp to re-open after negligent camp counselors (engaged in having sex) allowed her son to drown in the lake.  Unlike all the Jason sequels, where anyone and everyone gets killed just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, this first film provided a reasonable explanation for the killer's hatred of promiscuous teenagers.

I'm not calling "Friday the 13th" a masterpiece, but it's still scary and almost plausible in a way that none of the dreadful sequels even came close to.
