Imagine a sort of Gone With The Wind where Scarlette is a Confederate feminist who has kicked Daddy into early retirement. She swaps about half her gowns for stuff that Rhett Butler didn't want anymore. She makes a point of personally flogging slaves, but manages to do it without (miraculously, in the heat of humidity of Southeast Asia) having a bad hair day. Imagine that the plot is designed for a long mini-series, but has been squeezed into a feature-length film. Imagine some really fine actors struggling to breathe life into this thing. This is one of those films that makes wonderful trailers and stills you could turn into art, but that just doesn't work as a movie. I know a man who was a young draftee in Vietnam. He once told me, "You know those Chinese paintings with the twisted trees and the misty landscapes? Well, it really looks like that." If this film is any indication, he was right. The landscape is the best part of this film. Mostly, this movie is just tragic and sad, which is probably the point. If I had been in her shoes, I would have sold the plantation, taken my adopted daughter, and made a beeline for the south of France the day after the communists blew the brains of of the village elder I was being introduced to. I must say that Miss Deneuve still looks wonderful; the thirties fashions, especially those marvelous hats, really flatter her.
