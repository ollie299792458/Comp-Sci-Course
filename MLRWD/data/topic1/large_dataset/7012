Without going into any details about this wonderful movie let me say this is one of the most enchanting, well-written, captivating films I have seen for all time.  It is a well-developed synergy of drama, suspense and thriller.  It is true this film has some science fiction but it is extremely well done and serves to provide the necessary elements to support the rest of the film.  This is by no means a second-rate sci-fi film nor would I classify it as a science fiction film.  In terms of its suspense, let's just say Frequency demands you pay attention just to stay along for the ride.  That's not to say you feel as though you are working to stay involved.  On the contrary, there are moments you forget about your own surroundings and feel you are in NY watching those Amazing Mets.  And be prepared to be observant and attentive.  Those who do will only enjoy the movie even more since it is laced with small nuggets that make you have those ah-ha moments when you happen to weave two or more related events together.  The acting is first cut also.  All to many movies either have one or the other.  But Frequency holds it all together from start to finish.  This is a movie you can watch (and watch again) with your friends and family (not youngsters though) and have something to talk about for days.  So in conclusion Frequency provokes both the mind and the heart.  It truly is a movie that moves one along several dimensions.  There are only a handful of movies I have seen that I would rate 5 stars and this is definitely one of them.
