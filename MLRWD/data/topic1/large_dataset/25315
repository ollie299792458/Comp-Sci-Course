I enjoy foreign films. I especially enjoy them when they are well-acted, well-thought out, and happen to capture just a sliver of life that does not get bogged down in stereotypes and melodrama.
Such is Eat Drink Man Woman.
Being a Westerner with a penchant for good titles, I did not, at first, understand the significance of it. But having the knowledge that Asian films, books and animation do not waste titles but imbue them with sensibility and triple-meaning, I knew that there had to be something more to the title.
It became clear.
What a delightful look upon a family, not only an asian family, but a family.
And the interplay between siblings, parent, the surprises that life tosses at us, and the moments that make it worthwhile. I'm sorry to sound like a Hallmark(TM)Card, but I'm unable to be objective without becoming sentimental. So is my weakness.
Ang Lee is a brilliant director. A good director plays upon his/her actors' strengths, empowers the script and uses scenery as an entity. Mr. Lee has done this and more.
Watch the sumptuous feasting, the play of emotions as colorful as the humor, and the dynamics of a quirky yet familiar family. Bravo.
