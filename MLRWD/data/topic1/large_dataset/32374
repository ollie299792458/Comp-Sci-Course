<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FVEC2">The Last of Sheila</a>The Last of Sheila may have well been an inspiration for Basic Instinct.  There are similarities with both murder mysteries as follows:  primarily the the ice pick to crush the ice and then kill a lover; love and hate affairs between men and women, homo-erotic murder, bisexual trysts, clues, psychosis, cheating on lovers and wives/husbands; writers who write fiction murder mysteries to reflect real life murder, hit and run car accidents, trust funds, ex-conflicts, alcohol abuse, voyeurism  and more...Somehow a nifty film like "The Last of Sheila" did not draw a box-office hit as "Basic Instinct" did, only a cult following.  The Last of Sheila kept the sex scenes as suggested but "Basic Instinct" was just short of being soft porn.  The Last of Sheila is a movie that is clever and should be viewed with the all star cast in the South of France.  It has all the ingredients for home viewing modern without nudity, lewdness or profane language.  This movie is an puzzle with pieces to figure out though parlor games played in the Mediterranean with this scene by scene mystery thriller with an all-star cast!
