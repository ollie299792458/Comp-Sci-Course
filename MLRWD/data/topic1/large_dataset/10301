I won't go into the plot, nearly everyone reviewing this touching, hilarious comedy has done that. I will tell you that the relationship between Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) and Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) is developed incredibly well and is what makes this movie funny and sweet.
The best scene is on the rooftop, where a drunken Benjy cannot stop an even drunker Alan Swann from rapelling down the side of the building using a firehose for a rope to help Benjy impress KC (Benjy's love interest).  BTW, I disagree with the reviewers who believe the relationship between KC and Benjy develops too quickly. The relationship is in progress (though ground to a halt) when the story begins. It's only when Benjy, through what he learns from and about Swann, lets Benjy Stein show through the facade of Benjy Stone that KC decides she really likes him.
This movie will make you laugh aloud and will still touch you in the right ways. When this movie is over, we want to know what happens to Benjy and KC and Swann and Tess, because we care about the characters. It is a rare movie that can do this, but "My Favorite Year" succeeds brilliantly. Richard Benjamin at his best.
Joseph Bologna, Cameron Mitchell, Lanie Kazan and Bill Macy are wonderful in their roles. Mark Linn-Baker does not devolve into "Cousin Larry" from Perfect Strangers, but remains the ernest, funny Benjy and the scenes with him and Peter O'toole are remarkable. But it is Peter O'toole who steals this movie the way Alan Swann steals the ladies' hearts.
