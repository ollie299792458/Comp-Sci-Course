The Direct to DVD animated film used to have a stigma as being not good enough for theatres.  That is not the case with Disney and the TINKER BELL series.  With TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE, they once again take the genre to another level.

In the third film, Tinker Bell (voiced by Mae Whitman) wants to learn about how cars work (since she is a Tinker Fairy).  This leads her to becoming trapped and being taken by a human, Lizzy.  The two become friends, with Tinker Bell teaching Lizzy about fairies.  They also have to hide from Lizzy's scientist father (voiced by THE QUEEN's Michael Sheen).  Kristen Chenoweth, Pamela Adlon, Lucy Liu, and Raven-Symone voice the other fairies who plan a rescue of Tinker Bell.

Produced by Pixar's John Lasseter, this is a gorgeous to look at film, especially on Blu-Ray.  While not quite at Pixar level, it is pretty close.

Kids are sure to love the film (and they are sure to give it five stars).  Even for parents, this should be easy to stand while your kids watch it over and over and over again. I don't think this was quite as good as the second film in the series, which was almost Pixar quality.  But this is better than most of the family films out there.

Extras include deleted scenes with introductions by the filmmakers, a music video of the theme song, a featurette on fairy houses and a game played with the remote control.
