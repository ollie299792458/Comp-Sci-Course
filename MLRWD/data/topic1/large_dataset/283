This is a powerful movie.  All the events take place in one day.  After a minor car accident, the lives of two men become intertwined and quickly place both of them in difficult personal situations.  As a result, the ethics of both of the lead characters are stretched and broken in a series of escalating acts of anger and desperation.  
Yet through a series of events that ultimately illuminate the morally bankrupt relativistic worldview of his law firm, the wealthy lawyer (played by Ben Affleck) discovers his soul and begins a road to regain his life.  The character played by Samuel Jackson learns to keep his emotions in check and remarkably in spite of the events of the day is able to do the right thing and "accept the things he cannot change".
Both Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson are outstanding.  The frightening ease at which our lives can quickly slip out of our control is depicted in a way that emotionally resonates.  In each of us is the potential for small choices to start a series of events that test our character and ethics.  
A well done, powerful film.  Highly recommended.
