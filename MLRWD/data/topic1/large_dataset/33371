How do people say this is Bill Paxton's best work? I doubt even he would agree with that.
This movie has the pace of a driveway snail. It just dragged on and on. The cheesey romantic subplot between Vann and the  Vietnamese language teacher was awful. 
As far as Vann's at-home  situation, they should have just left that out altogether. All it did was  make the movie go on and on and help fuel that sickening romantic subplot I  mentioned earlier.
Eric Bogosian and what's-his-name, the other reporter,  gave really dull performances and almost all of the other characters were  one-dimensional.
The nerdy reporter's voice-over narration started to get  on my nerves, too. It explained things that didn't need explaining in the  first place. 
The action sequence near the end was horrible. The NVA and  VC didn't attack in human waves like that.  In fact, according to some vets  you actually wished they WOULD attack like that. In the movie, these scores  of U.S. army troops were letting themselves be overrun when two machine  guns with interlocking fire, TWO, could have cut down that attack without  fail. Instead, Hollywood AGAIN decided to portray the communist Vietnamese  forces as no more than "stupid gooks" who's only way of beating  the enemy was to swarm them like a bunch of dumb ants. They were a lethal,  determined, and very capable fighting force and nothing like what the movie  showed them to be.
This movie is just chock full of Hollywood B.S. and  isn't worth renting or buying.
The extra star is for the way the  political barriers Vann ran into were shown, which seem to be right on  track.
There might have been another star in for it if they hadn't had  that "Where Have All The Soldiers Gone" song at the end. CORNY AS  HELL!
