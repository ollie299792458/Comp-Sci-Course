I love the movie "From Russia with Love"---end of story.  This review is about the Blu-Ray edition.  By way of comparison, I also own the recently upgraded DVD version of this film that was included in the James Bond Ultimate Edition set.  That movie (the DVD) was restored to a sensational level of quality.  In fact, I doubted it could be visually improved upon.  I was wrong.  The Blu-Ray edition looks even more sensational than the most recent DVD edition that was included in the Ultimate Edition set.  In fact, it was clearly restored from a master print, with an almost indescribable level of visual detail included.  This Blu-Ray edition is so good that it's like watching a brand new movie.  Watching it with my family I repeatedly heard the comment "wow.  Look at that.  I never noticed that before .  . ."  The studio did a first rate job of restoring the movie for the Blu-Ray edition.  And, after all . . . it's a James Bond film.  I'll be getting the other Blu-Ray Bond films; if the restoration is half this good, it will be worth every penny.
