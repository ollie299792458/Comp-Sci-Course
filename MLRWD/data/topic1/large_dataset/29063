Van Damme at his finest hour, Bloodsport represents the true nature behing every adolescent grown man out there. All action and no talk. This film captures the audience in an envolving atmosphere of true fighting skills, choreographed and shot like no other in it's class, smooth long takes with no hand held not choppy editing. It is truly, a masterfull dance choreography in full contact, with Van Damme's long screen villain Bolo Yeung (Double Impact). You will not regret inviting your friends over to watch this fast pace entertaining movie. Then go on to buying Hard Target, Van Damme's second best movie ever.

The DVD quality is an acceptable transfer, let's say 4 stars when compared to Pearl Harbor, but can't complain. Sound is a 2 channel Dolby Digital, which isn't as surrounding as a 5.1 channel presentation. Yet speach is kept low enough to crank up the sound and furthermore enjoy environment sounds. Also 4 stars to the sound. Presentation works fine, though it is missing extras big time! A simple photo gallery would have made an important difference on this DVD.
