Ten classic science fiction flicks from Universal proves you can run, but you can't hide. A giant tarantula, the monolith monsters, a monster on the campus, a giant praying mantis, a leech woman and a mad scientist meat half of these films.

Transfer quality is great. Trailers for these movies are included. That's it. No commentary, no documentaries, no rare features. Still, the picture quality and the price is worth it.

Small trivia to look out for. The script for "The Land Unknown" was scripted by radio script writer William N. Robson trying his hand at a screenplay. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" was scripted by Richard Matheson, from his novel of the same name -- the same man responsible for "The Omega Man / The Last Man on Earth." The airforce pilot who saves the day in "Tarantula" remains hidden in the suit and helmet but take my word for it -- that's Clint Eastwood! The Universal Studios backlot was featured prominently in "The Monolith Monsters" so look out for that Back to the Future clock!

This set is a lot of fun, so be prepared!
