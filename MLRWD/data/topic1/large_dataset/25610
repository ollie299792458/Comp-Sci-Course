In her autobiography, Faye Dunaway complains that she (and her other big Hollywood pals like "Bill" Holden...) were just used for their names on the billboard, when the real star of this pic was the fire.  Well,  I remember seeing this movie in the theater with my parents and sister at  age 7 -- my first PG rated movie -- and I was so dazzled I couldn't sleep  that night.  All those fabulous stars of the past and present in fabulous  1970s gowns, falling to their deaths ablaze.  Susan Blakely on that tether  being scared and fabulous, Faye in her faux Halston getting it on with Paul  Newman in his office (can you believe that bedroom ?).  Mike "Bobby  Brady" Lookinland as the child hero.  OJ Simpson as the handsome black  man (we wont go there) And Fred Astaire gets the Shelly Winters oscar nod.  And when Steve McQueen is informed he has to go in to blow the tanks, his  profane response is so macho and sexy.  And don't you miss when the Glass  Tower wiggles at the very beginning (good old matte photography - this was  2 years before Star Wars, folks...)  I don't know -- what is NOT to love in  this movie?  All I can say is, it changed my life as age 7 and had a  profound effect on me, much as Airport 1975, Earthquake and Airport 1977  did -- all that cheese, all that hair, all those gals in danger.  But this  was the best of them.  (For the record, Poseidon Adventure was in a class  all its own - I don't think that was campy.)
