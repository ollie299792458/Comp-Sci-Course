The Union regiment of Cavalry Commander John Henry Thomas (John Wayne) has a combat encounter with the Confederate forces commanded by James Langdon (Rock Hudson). The telegraph wires were down, and Thomas realizes that the encounter had been in vain, because General Lee had surrendered three days earlier. Langdon, on the other hand, knew this fact a day before his battle. To him, it was not futile. He resolved to keep on fighting. For now, his men would hide their arms, disguise themselves as civilians, and march to Mexico, where he would meet with Emperor Maximilian.

Months later, Thomas finds himself in Mexico, and he runs into his old nemesis. The two men are surprised to learn that they had been on direct opposite sides at several key battles. Each complains of the casualties inflicted by the other side to his men. Thomas wants to move on, while Langdon continues to identify himself as a Confederate.

A group of Mexican revolutionaries hosts the Confederates with an elaborate meal. Then they draw their guns, and call the Confederates their prisoners. It is a trap. Langdon is released with a ransom demand. Either all the surrounding men give up their horses, or the captive Confederate soldiers will all be shot. What will Thomas and his forces do? Will Langdon finally forget the Civil War and return his loyalties to the USA? What will Thomas' adopted Indian son do? The plot thickens...
