Fox has decided to release a box set of Mel's films. First, I ask Fox, "What took so long?" Second, I would have to ask, "Why are you re-releasing some of those titles?

Blazing Saddles is a Warner Brothers product, and should have the WB logo stamped on the disc. MGM has the rights to The Producers, Spaceballs and Dracula, Dead and Loving It. Their parent company is Sony, and Fox and Sony don't get along, most of the time. &lt;g>

It would have been a great idea to re-release new versions of Young Frankenstein and History of the World Part 1. Both are not anamorphically enhanced and are "worthless" to someone who has a widescreen TV.

It's fantastic to see some of the titles released for the first time (High Anxiety, for one). It makes me very, very, very nervous to purchase a box set for only a few films. By not releasing them separately or redoing certain titles, you can see the greed of the 20th Century Fox Corporation. I just can't see spending $70 on these titles when individual releases would probably sell a lot more.

Had the previously released Fox titles been redone, this would be a great box set, instead of only a good one.

There is still hope! Maybe Fox will decide to release these titles individually, or Sony/MGM will release an intoxicating 12-pack of Mel Brooks when The Producers comes out in a few months.
