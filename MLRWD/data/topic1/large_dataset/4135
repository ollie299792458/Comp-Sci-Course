Teenagers today are supposed to refuse to watch black and white, and to sniff at anything more than 15 minutes old.  Several people told me to get the remake of this instead of the original, but when I showed it to 95 undergraduates they were completely spellbound (that means quiet) and active in discussion afterwards.  It may be old, and outdated in parts (unlikely that a juror would sneak a switchblade into the jury room; unlikely that a jury would be 12 white men) but so what?  This is one of those films where every part is perfectly cast and acted.  I was a little confused for a bit by Amazon's listing as Martin Balsam as the lead actor (he plays a relatively secondary role), but evidently they do this in alphabetical order.  Henry Fonda, of course, is the key actor here.
  If you have a use for it, there is a very nice 15 minute intro to the film included with a couple of noted talking head legal types (Robert Shapiro, Gloria Allred) explaining the fine points and what would not happen today.
