Right, so, I had this movie delivered via Netflix but didn't watch it.  I was one, afraid of the rape scene and two, everyone said it was a horrid movie.  I am a huge Gillian Anderson fan due to X-files so my curiosity got the better of me.  I have never seen her in anything else.  The reason I gave this 5 stars instead of three or two is because of several factors.  The first being, drink a bottle of wine while watching this movie.  Actually, drink the first glass before the movie, drink the second by the 30 minute mark and drink the third glass by the 70 minute mark.  Then understand these two things.  First, the guy who plays Adam is a horrible actor and consequently, a huge douche.  Second, whoever is the editor should not only be fired but should never ever see film again.  Gillian Anderson did what she could with a questionable script and made this film worth watching.  She should be up for an Oscar is there was a category, "I had to float this film."  Last, but not least, to give this film a five star rating it does help to be drunk off of said bottle of wine.
