For everyone who as a kid who stood in the outfield, held a baseball glove to their face and connects the smell of well dressed glove leather to their youth and summer on the diamond ... this movie is for you.  I bet that almost every kid who played baseball at any level, had many day dreams of being "The Natural", playing at a level above all others, and getting the "big hit" or making the "big play".  The Natural isn't reality, and it shouldn't be. It's about the "what if" of baseball that reaches into the soul of the former sandlot player, adds some adult twists, and connects the childhood dreams to the adult cinema.  I enjoy this film, not because it's about the way it is, but because it's the way I dreamed it could be.  Roy Hobbs (the main character played by Redford) appears to have it all.  Looks, incredible talent, big league prospects, when his life takes a sudden unfortunate turn.  He returns to baseball and against the odds, lives a baseball dream.  Dramatic?  Yes.  Realistic?  Not really.  But I'd rather be entertained by this baseball fantasy, than watch the biography of today's typical player.  It's more pleasurable to watch Roy Hobbs overcome his baseball challenges, than to watch a player go though drug rehab and salary arbitration while batting .260.
On the cast, Redford is perfectly cast, and Wilford Brimley as Pops the Team Manager is right on the nose.  This is a very good baseball film that deserved better treatment by the critics.  If you're sick of "shoot 'em ups" and pointless shock films, watch "The Natural" for a nice break.
