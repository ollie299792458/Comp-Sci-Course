The City of Angels movie makes you think, and wonder, and rejoice, and believe that if so many people in the world believe in religion, in an afterlife - if the concept is so pervasive, that maybe there is some truth to it.

This movie came out right after my grandfather died, and as an over-thirty, experienced person who had watched him suffer through this wasted time brought on by age, I expected to be happy he was released when he died, but I was not.

Maybe it was the fact that the nurse gave this 85 year old man who had not had solid food in a year a huge Potassium pill and left after he said that no, he didn't want any water, just to watch him code four minutes later. Maybe I just wasn't ready for him to be gone less than 12 hours after I'd taken him to the hospital. Maybe I just wasn't ready to be done loving him and changing his diapers and fighting with Grandma to not treat him like he had a choice. Maybe it was just that he was the most important man I've ever known. But I wasn't ready then, not at all, and this movie helped.

It made me remember why we're here, to love, even when we know it will end in hurt.

It made me allow myself to hope I'll see him again one day.

It made me accept that quality of life is not something that I should take for granted.

But most of all, this movie let me think Gramps might still be around, looking over my shoulder, encouraging me to watch the traffic go by, appreciate my daughters teen years, get past Grandma's senile dementia, because he loved her even for all that she is.

See the movie if you haven't, buy it for when you need to see it if you have. You won't regret it - everyone hits that point/realization about life, and death.

As for comparing it to any other movie - don't bother.
