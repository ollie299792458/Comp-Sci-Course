well what can i say Stallones done it again but this time ur all thinking whats with the high-tec stuff and everything which combines in it well after the 3 Rocky movies u saw the italion stallian go through the ups and  downs and basically something new had to arise to boast a reason for it to  be a good movie action was becoming ever popular so stallone turned to an  action drama to stay up with the 80's expectations and introducing Dolph  Lundgreen as Drago. I live in the UK in a city called Leeds im 21 and my  bro whos 28 watched this at pictures and he says till this day he hasnt  seen the cinema the day it was like when Rocky 4 was released in the UK it  was pact people queing for at least 2 miles crowded in and out police were  there ambulances were there even the fire brigade i mean as crazy as it  sounds people who watched the movie were standing up sitting on the steps  also the company basically let as many people as they could and nobody  stayed quiet as soon as the intro began people were screaming women wooing  the first time in history ever and when the training began and the fight  started it got worse but the company MGM cinemas didnt seem bothered at the  least the cinema was packed and even my driving instructor say hes never  experienced at what he did when he went with my bro to see Rocky 4 i mean  people were like the crowds at a real boxing match they didnt stay quiet  all i can say stallone once again shows patronism in all his movies hes  better than Willis and Arnie at least u can relate some part of ur life to  the Rocky movies like most people did.  AND STALLONES PULLED IT OFF AGAIN  THIS FILM DOESNT LOOSE ITS TOUCH AND STILL LOOKS IN DATE OVER A DECADE  LATER
