I have been waiting for these release since I started my DVD collection some years ago.

When the Ultimate Collection came out I bought it without hesitation, however the fact that Steve Howe wasn't involved (key part in their unique sound) and that audio quality was subpar for the Nottingham and Moscow concerts, it made for just a pit stop while waiting for the reunion DVD.

But now to the point:  although the song selection, filming and playing is great, it is regrettable that the surround mix is not properly balanced and way too focused on the keyboards, that basically shadow Howe's guitars.  I tried all three mixes (stereo, Dolby and DTS) with the same results.

I decided to play the DVD audio through an equalizer and finally everything came alive.  Fully balanced sound and nice detailed sound from Mr. Wetton, Howe, Palmer and Downes.  And I enjoyed it greatly.

Some have complained about song selection, but although I would have wanted Astra to be featured (I don't care much for the Payne era), Asia wanted to celebrate the chemistry they had together on those first two albums, and somehow acknowledge the road that led them together (Yes, ELP, King Crimson, Buggles).  And I respect that and certainly their choice didn't dissapoint.

This is such a great DVD that if surround mix is corrected I would definitely buy it again.  PS: Sound Engineers/Mixers please do your work right the first time.
