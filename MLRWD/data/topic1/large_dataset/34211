Sergio Leone was a director who made a difference in the cinema.  We can be grateful to him for giving us two special talents besides providing enjoyable entertainment.  He brought Clint Eastwood to the attention of the world after Hollywood dumped him from television.  And then he introduced us to Ennio Morricone and his splendid musical genius.  Take away either of these two from "A Fistful of Dollars", "For A Few Dollars More" and "The Good The Bad and The Ugly" and I doubt that anyone outside of Italy would have heard of Leone.
Almost forty years later, I still hum "The Ecstacy of Gold" from the climactic cemetary scene in "G, B & U."  In a conversation with Eli Wallach, I once asked him how he liked the music in those films.  He replied, "If I had heard that music while we were filming, I would have sat up straighter in the saddle."
Aside from those contributions, Leone also changed the way we look at the old west.  His weather worn sets, grubby villians (and hero for that matter) and the barren landscapes (even tho they were located in Spain) altered our image of the John Wayne myth forever.
