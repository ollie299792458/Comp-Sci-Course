As a second-time mom I thought I knew all the "tricks" to get a somewhat fussy baby to calm down. Little did I realize that our new daughter required an entirely different method of calming. We tried  everything, but were not getting more than 3-4 hours of sleep at night. After 4 weeks I decided enough was enough!

I heard about this book at a birth club and after seeing many rave reviews about how well it worked just had to get it. I read it from front to back in less than a day and immediately started on the methods Dr. Karp listed.

Within a few hours it was as though we had an entirely different baby! :) She was much calmer all around, as though she had been crying for these techniques for weeks. Within a week she was sleeping for 5 hour stretches at night.

Really, whether you buy this book used or new, it is worth every cent! Dr. Karp explains how to use his 5 S's in everyday lingo, with humor and lots of illustrations. He also explains why these techniques work, which I found incredibly interesting.

Overall, Highly Recommended!
