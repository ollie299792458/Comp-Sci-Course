I know the title probably doesn't say much about the movie, but I just wanted to say that. Now, on with the review! Airplane is what I've said in the title of this here review, but it is more than this. This is also the first comedy DVD I've seen. My favorite character had to be the pilot, played by Peter Graves, I do believe. He gave some of the best lines of the movie, especially when the little boy who comes into the cockpit, and the pilot says, "Have you ever been in a cockpit before?", and the little boy says, "I've never been in a cockpit before", and the pilot says, "Have you ever seen a grown man naked"? Hilarious! I believe this was the first movie that the Zuckers and that other guy had ever worked on, with this kind of comedy, and whatnot, and I do believe the other ones such as Naked Gun, Hot Shots, and the other ones came later, so you prob don't know what to expect. If you have seen the others one, then you know what to expect. The final verdict: Buy. You won't be dissapointed. P.S. I know this review probably wasn't very helpful, but there are tons of other reviews every place else, so why waste my time and your time by rehashing what has been said in other reviews.
