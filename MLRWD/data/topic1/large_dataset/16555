There's NO extremely graphic ear slicing scene in this movie

If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, well how much a film fan are you then?

I've seen this movie many times and last time is 20 minutes ago. Therefore I know that Marco Freire who writes the review "The ear scene" September 24, 2004, hasn't looked at the screen when the scene takes place, because you DON'T see the ear being cut off. You only see Michael Madsen with a knife in his hand, and after the camera has been zoomed away and back again he stands with an ear in his hand.

In literature it's called expressionism but I call it The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-effect! The reason why I call so is because many people, who have seen the old Texas Chainsaw Massacre, will swear that they have seen a lot of persons being violent mutilated with a chainsaw but they haven't! It happens in the movie but you don't visually see it.

It can have a lot bigger effect, just show a knife, here a person scream but not see the act, because you visualize the seen yourself in the mind and the result will probably be more terrifying, than Hollywood can do it with ketchup. Marco Freire is definitely a very good example of how the effect works ;-)
