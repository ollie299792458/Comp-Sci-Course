The problem is not maybe the movie but the source material (the book). There is too much telegraphing of what is coming. Whereas as the first movie (Girl...Dragon Tattoo) was so full of great twists and turns it blew me away both emotionally and it was literally physically draining to watch.

The second (Girl...Fire) was just plain stupid especially given how Lisbeth escapes from being buried alive and the Jaws-like (007 James Bond references r us) parody of a villain can feel no pain. This one is a straight procedural taking place mainly in offices, courts, hospitals and jail cells. The story feels confined like its setting.

Sorry, but after the first movie I was expecting way more from this series and it deteriorated into just repeating everything over and over again. The thing was way too obvious and wrapped up way too easily. The ambiguity the first film played with just got lost over the next two films as the focus was way too much on Lisbeth's life itself whereas the first one the focus was on how Lisbeth and the Swedish journalist team up to bring down a Nazi.
