I liked this movie a lot to begin with; I hadn't seen it in theaters, but bought the 2d blu-ray after I had rented it.  I recently bought a new 3D TV and rewatched the original just to test the picture and figured that it would be great in 3D, so I decided to buy this version too.  I just finished watching it and I'm not the least bit regretful of my purchase.

I have a few other 3D movies on Blu-ray (including Hugo) at this point and this one doesn't disappoint in the least.  I originally only intended to watch a few minutes of this before going to bed, but couldn't stop.  The 3D added a depth in every scene which wasn't in the original blu-ray that I'd bought and it felt like I was watching it again for the first time (as lame as that sounds).

If you're a fan of this movie and have a 3D TV or are thinking of buying one, I recommend this purchase...you can always watch the 2D version of it if you want and it'll be one of the best 3D movies that you'll own.

As for the movie itself, I obviously really enjoyed it...almost on the same level as The Incredibles.  It's hilarious, got a good story, the animation is top-notch and the 3D definitely adds to the experience.
