* pseudo-spoilers below *

Like others here, not only am I a big JD and NO fan, but also a fan of the clubbing scene and an a person who gets into the cool stuff like the Factory Records numbering system (even Tony Wilson's casket had one apparently).

This was a film about Tony Wilson more than anything, and was poorly done from even that point. I think the producers were trying to capture the angst and magic of the history of Factory and the Hacienda, but they missed it. Coogan is way too dry, the cinematography is not compelling, the storyline is incredibly random and jumpy. If you were not already familiar with some of the storylines you would be completely lost as to what was going on, and if you are familiar you would be disappointed. There are also way too many unnecessary scenes included- the pigeons, the UFOs, seeing God, hang-gliding, etc. which don't add anything and just make the film drag on.

It is a shame, cause it is great story, and some of the other characters have a lot more character (no pun intended), but don't get the chance to offer it to the viewer.
