I have read reviews saying that people are disappointed because there was no gore, or disappointed because the transfer wasn't to their standards.... GET OVER IT.  Twilight Zone the movie is very underrated in my opinion.  This movie pays great homage to the TV show produced by Rod Sterling. This film is a fantasy, sci-fi, horror, and I tend to believe that it is done in such a format that most ages can watch it.  For a movie to be good it doesn't have to have gore.  If a film can make you think differently about a situation then the writer director has accomplished a great job.  The first story about the racist having to suffer the lives of those who he discriminated make you think outside the box about racism.  The second is a light hearted tale where the elderly have a second chance at being young again, this segment is suitable for all ages.  The third installment is just weird but exciting as cartoon elements are weaved into reality by a adolescent. The final tale, although it doesn't show a drop of blood is scary as hell.  I recall watching this when I was a kid and I blame that darned gremlin ripping the plane apart to be my reason for hating to travel by aviation.  Even to this day the gremlin and plane creep me out.  I suggest, buy this, but do note there is not one drop of blood in this film, and although I am a gore hound, this collection is still worth the buy.
