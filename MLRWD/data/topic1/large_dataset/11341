Ever since Leaving Las Vegas I have been a big Nicholas Cage fan, and his role in Matchstick Men is so quirky and hilarious that even moviegoers that don't like him will find it hard not to enjoy his performance in the film.  I also thought Sam Rockwell did a great job as the more subtle and down-to-earth conman.  
The story itself managed to be engaging enough to satisfy most any moviegoer, but nevertheless my hopes were high for this movie and I walked away slightly disappointed with the outcome.  It manages to be very funny in parts, but the major problem in Matchstick Men was its ending, which did not make a whole lot of sense and had some major holes which I will not spoil by mentioning here.  A sloppy ending has been a major problem for movies recently (The Hulk & Matrix Reloaded come to mind), but I do realize that not every movie can have a brilliant ending on par with "The Usual Suspects."  Altogether, though, Matchstick Men is worth the price of admission, if nothing else than for the terrific performances.
