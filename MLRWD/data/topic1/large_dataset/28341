I have to admire this movie and "Gods and Generals" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345422473">Gods and Generals</a>for the even-handed approach to this most horrible event that has forever defined the American political and cultural landscape.  Whether you call it the "Civil War" or "The War of Northern Aggression", the warriors of both sides are treated with great respect.  It makes the caricatures of the South quite obvious and takes some of the polish off the North.  The brave men of each side and their ideals are treated with great respect, and their failures are not overlooked.

If you want to understand our country, and our government, and why we are the way we are, and why the present North and South are still different, do yourself a favor and spend the seven hours these films take up.  A mature person won't regret it.  Ken Burns' treatment of the Civil War will do you well also.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUE8">The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns</a>

Then, travel to Gettysburg and see the land yourself, see where thousands of brave men gave their lives and where President Lincoln gave his "Gettysburg Address".  Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and the battle fought there -- it's not a movie, it's not a video game.  It's real life.  Watch the movie, visit the battlefield.  It's like "Saving Private Ryan" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ZWUS">Saving Private Ryan (Special Limited Edition)</a>  If you are an American and you're not moved and sobered, then check your pulse and check your soul.
