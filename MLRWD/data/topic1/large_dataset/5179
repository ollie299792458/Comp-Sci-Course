While this rather scary thriller is not for the faint-hearted, the suspense of three people trapped in an ATM lobby keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat throughout its action-packed 90 minutes. The film is very cleverly made. Almost all the action takes place in the locked ATM station, but the intriguing relationship between the three trapped characters adds constant interest,  and the way the actors play off each other contributes to the tense atmosphere.

Brian Geraghty (star of the multi-oscar winning "The Hurt Locker") is excellent as the guilt inflicted financier, who worries about the way he has invested his clients' money, and Josh Peck is suitably annoying as his big mouth friend, who thinks he has all the answers. Feminine charm is added in the shape of Geraghty's date for the evening, Beth, played by the gorgeous British actress Alice Eve.

The film reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. We don't really see the source of the threat against them, but we can imagine it, and  it is an ever-present menace. An Excellent thriller!
