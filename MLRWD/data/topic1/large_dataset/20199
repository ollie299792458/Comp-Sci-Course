I remember the days of 54 plainly and this film did a wonderful job recreating the incredible, unlikely yet TRUE story of a warehouse turned superclub. Mike Myers was brilliant in his potrayal of the eccentric genius of the club owner, Ryan Phillippe did a great job in his narration (though as an actor I think he is lousy), and my FAVORITE sexy lady in the world, Sela Ward, is mesmerizing to me in ANY film, and she is beautiful and brilliant as always.
This film even delves into the lives of the "social climbers"; Phillippe's character, a Jersey kid literally pumping gas, lands a job as a bartender at 54 which paid more than most MD's made at the time and had more prestige to his peers; also, the mixing of all sorts in the club- old money, new money, beautiful young people, made for a very alluring mix.
This film was great; the biggest letdown was the acting job done by Salma Hayek, who I hold in very high regard as both an actress and a sexy lady- she reduced her character to a whining,
pathetic shell of what I felt was meant to be a strong-willed, determined starlet.
Overall, this was one of the best films of 1998; Mike Myers showed that he has an incredible acting range, from the extreme bafoonery in Wayne's World, to the more sophisticated comedy of the Austin Powers series, then going into the genre of the tortured soul of the 54's rise and fall.
