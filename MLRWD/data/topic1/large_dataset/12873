I wasn't sure what to expect from this satirical horror comedy as some of the reviews I'd already read had been pretty mixed to say the least! However, I sat down with some tasty treats, made myself warm and cosy and put the dvd in the player.

The film follows two main sets of characters, a military zombie "hit squad", out to dispose of the flesh hungry living dead, who have been let loose from the laboratory of an underground military base, and a group of strippers who work in an illegal strip joint set up right next to the base. The two stories eventually converge with all the main characters ending up in the strip club and zombie flesheating ensues!

To begin with, the acting is mostly poor, with the actors seemingly thinking that because they are in a horror "comedy" then they have to be "funny". Which means of course that they aren't. If the director (Jay Lee) had kept a tighter reign on his performers and got them to basically play it straight then it would have worked a lot better. However, the script is much cleverer than it has any right to be and the effects are good fun and pretty gruesome in a Peter Jackson "Brain Dead" kind of way. "Zombie Strippers" is interesting in that it comes across as both exploiting women and yet having a strong feminist agenda at the same time, with the strippers quoting from Sartre even as they gradually join the ranks of the living dead.

All in all, a fun way to spend 90 minutes with the highlight being the over-the-top cartoon-like battle between the two leading zombie strippers...what they do with ping pong balls and more has to be seen to be believed!
