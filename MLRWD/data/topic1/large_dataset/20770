as a devoted fan of the novels i'm having a bit of a problem to give it 5 stars.  It's not that it's  a bad or  a careless adaptation of the book, and in most parts it sticks with the narrative of the books, but i felt that there has been some changes and maybe even some injustice with some of the characters. Those characters , such as Flay, Fuchsia, Irma, and professor Bellgrove, that demands long time to get used to their strange ways, to  fully understad and love them, suffer a great deal from the harsh editing the scriptwriters did to this vast detailed books in order to fit them into a 4 episode mini series.
However, that injustice is somewhat repaired by the wonderfull casting and espeacily the actress who portrays Fuchsia ( the most loved Gormenghast figeure ) Neve Macintosh.
To every peake's fan who'se maybe reluctent to watch  the movie in fear it might spoil the book for him i say go for it if only for the sake of watching her performance. Whenever i think of Fuchsia - it's her i see.
There'se also a delightfull apppearrance ( as always ) by stephen fry as professor Bellgrove and of course- develishly handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the devious Steerpike.
 I think the meddling with steerpike's character and the attempt to make him seem more human and volnurable is in bitter contradiction with his description in the books but never the less, he gives a great performance.
To conclude - i think the sworn fans of the books will find this
series to be enjoyable since the  design of the production is very beautifull and imaganetive, and i think it does justice with peake's vision of the world of Gormenghast.
Those who have not read the books, i think will love it even more because it is a good movie and it has many moment of suspense and horror and loughter, and as i said before, the best actors England could offer and a spectacular production.
To those who will watch and like it  i can only recommend also reading the books, wich are immensely better.
