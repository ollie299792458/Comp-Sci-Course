5rambo gets out of jail because the gov has a special mission for him.they want him to go to nam and find proof of nam pows.he goes and finds some.the army ditches him and he goes psycho and thrashes the viet kong.he eventualy flies home with many pows!sly stallone plays rambo.they say this was the first big movie he did.i dont know how many billions they need but rocky did quite well.death race 2000 was good.its very bloody and too much for kids id say.its not as good as the immortal first blood but better than #3.i think the people who were there may find it a bit touching when he comes home with some of the troops.his co is very evil.not troutman but the fat guy.when rambo has his little outburst at the end,its the bomb!id like to have seen him end it a  bit differently though.id say this one is better than all the rocky movies and every other movie slys ever been in but death race 2000 and the first rambo.id like to see a part in between 1 and 2 where rambos in prison and a prequel to where he was in nam.done correctly that could be the best action movie ever!but you know hollywood.they cant do anything right.
