Some of my favorite films from the past were "Citizen Kane" and "Forbidden Planet," which are very different in most ways but which are both highly skillful, imaginative and visually stunning.  "The Fifth Element" by French director/writer Luc Besson is all of those and more, and for someone who is interested in and appreciates the mechanics of great screenwriting, watching the way the scenes and dialogue lead perfectly from one moment to the next is a joy.  The characters are strange and wild but the actors are never over the top and they grab our emotions. It's part comic book adventure, part satire, but just "real" enough to make us suspend disbelief and propel us along.  It may be my new most favorite film.  There are a few flaws.  I saw it first on TV, and a few brief scenes or moments had been edited out.  When I saw the entire film, oddly enough, I agreed that the excised portions hurt the film more than helped it.  Even so, if you like science fiction, or epic films, or just well-crafted movies, you should see this one.
