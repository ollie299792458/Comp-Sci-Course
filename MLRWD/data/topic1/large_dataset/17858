Virginia is a charming but rather insecure girl who lives with her father Tony in a building in New York where he is the put-upon janitor.  Virginia is tormented by muddled memories of her mother, who disapeared when she was a young child.  Strange things begin to happen in their lives when a Prince who has been turned into a golden retriever escapes from his magical world into theirs.  He has been transfored by a wicked queen who wants to take control of the Nine kingdoms.  She sends her werewolf henckman and a group of hideous trolls in pursuit of the escaped Prince.  Tony and Virginia find themselves obliged to return to the Nine Kingdoms and help the enchanted Prince in his quest to defeat the Wicked Queen.  They end up travelling with the werwolf, who has an eye for Virginia, but is he friend or foe?  This is an absolutely wonderful series, which is full of dazzling special effects, superb acting, wit and charm.  There are som very funny scenes, like the one where the werewolf has Virginia's grandmother trussed up and ready to cook,the one where Tony is given some wishes and makes the most of his chance to humiliate his obnoxious employer, and the scene where Virgina has to enter a shpeherdess contest and sing a song, "We will, we will shear you". Virginia's father Tony (John Larroquette) is my favourite character, his commonsense approach to the weird fairytale world is great, ("What is the point of having an evil door?").  And there is a delightful if strange romance between Virginia (Kimberley Williams) and the wolf (Scott Cohen).  An absolute delight.  Only one regret, at the end of this series there is a hint that there may be furthere adventures to come, but so far we haven't seen any.  Is a sequel too much to hope for?
