I suffered through Gerry along with about 1,000 others at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Heads bobbed, people groaned and shifted uneasily, there was some snoring audible; but Gus, Matt, Casey, and big brother Ben were there in the audience...so nobody left.
The film has many well done parts, the cinematography is great, the dialogue very funny. The problem is that every shot is 4-10 times longer than it should be. This is similar to a technique used in the French film "Humanite" (1999); though the uncomfortably long shots mostly feature landscapes, rather than faces, in this celluloid sleeping pill.
Personally, I question the filmmakers' motives. Are they looking to see how far they can go into the absurdly pretentious and boring, before someone stands up an screams "Stop in the name of all things holy!!!"? Given the festival buzz, I know that the reaction will be polarized, with some already hailing it as genius. But come on, we watched a sunset in real time with no diologue and little action. I can't believe that even the biggest fans weren't fighting fighting to stay awake.
There is one clue as to the possibility of this being a big joke on the audience..in the film they refer to a screw-up as "a gerry."
