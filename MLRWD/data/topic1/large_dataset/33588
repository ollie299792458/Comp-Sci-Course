I am not a big fan of Zhang ZiYi, however, I did like "Road Home" a lot! Comparing her usual roles as a tough sword fighter such as in "Hidden Draggon Crouching Tiger" or "House of Flying Daggers", I think this kind of movie suits a lot better for Zhang ZiYi. Speaking from Asian point of view, she is not the prettiest girl you can find in Asia but she definitely has the quality of sweetness and confidence in her look, which fits perfectly with the role in this movie.

The story is indeed a celebration of great and undying love between lovers. What gives a greater impact on this movie is the way the story is set in a backward Chinese village where grand love is least expected to be found. The kind of simple yet passionate love between the two lovers in the movie has almost become extinct in reality.

This kind of movie is very refreshing to the audience because it does not follow the typicality of most American movies where stories start off happily and end happinly.

I strongly recommend this movie!
