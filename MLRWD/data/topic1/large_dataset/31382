Recently, this show was brilliantly parodied on SNL because of the sex scenes. There may be a grain of truth to the accusations.  However, if the show wasn't so good, no one would bother.  Game of Thrones is the best series on TV, in spite of a few flaws.  HBO should hire the crew who put together that parody, because of their exceptional work, and keen perception of the material!

Season 2 was fantastic, the highlight being Episode 9, written by George R.R. Martin himself.  It was like a top-notch feature film.

The TV version of Game of Thrones is an interpretation of the original books.  David Benioff and D.B. White use their own expertise to bring the books to the screen.  It's not child's play. They are thoroughly familiar with the source material and bring it to life in an entertaining way.  Their work is groundbreaking.

My only complaint was in Episode 10.  While I've been able accept CG direwolves and dragons, I was disappointed with the CG White Walker on a horse.  A cartoon isn't scary enough.  Hopefully, the production team can come up with a better idea...

Meanwhile, fans are anticipating a great Season 3.  Wonderful show!
