Alright - so "Trog" is no great masterpiece of the cinema. It is not meant to be up there with "King Kong" in terms of sci-fi horror, nor is it up there with "Sunset Boulevard" or Joan Crawford's earlier effort "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" as a Grande-Dame horror. This was Joan Crawford's fifth Grande Dame Guignol entry after "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Straight Jacket", "Beserk" and "I Saw What You Did" - and it is her final film.
The effects may be schlocky and the dialogue sometimes corny - but the film is a lot of fun and not without its merits. The central relationships in the film are strong - even in his silly costume, the movements of the eponymous Trog (A defrosted caveman placed in the custody of Doctor Brockton - played by Joan Crawford.) manage to convey a sense of vulnerability and pathos. The strength of Crawford's acting reveals her earnestness and care for her prehistoric charge. The relationship between the two is genuinely tender.
The other interraction, a real treat to see, is the tension between the scientifically minded Brockton and a narrow minded local developer played by Michael Gough. Seeing British horror legend Gough go up against crawford - an icon and by this time a horror star in her own right, is a delight.
If you can put aside the cheap effects and corny dialogue - you can enjoy "Trog". The pacing and tension build nicely and there is action, suspense and some neat motifs. Sit back and revel in the melodrama and great performances in what is a campy, fun, popcorn classic.
