Two attractive people living familiar lives in unremarkable parts of New York City endure, what can also be familiar there, a rain-soaked autumn. Out of such plain stuff is spun an opera for the eyes, a parable in the language of color, a cinematic poem sparing in words, rapturous and beautiful.
It is oriental art delightfully beyond us. In six voices -- painting, ballet, drama, music, poetry, and silence -- it tells one story and illuminates another, yet it is as indifferent to our discovering its humble philosophy as nature is. 
Even these hints may be telling too much:
View "Breakfast at Tiffany's" first. "Autumn in New York" is contained by something universal at the heart of that film and the short novel it was based on.
Look at the screen as you would a painting, there are messages there. Notice colors in relation to the progress of the season and in relation to characters -- the colors they wear, but also the colors that share the screen with them.
Allow that walking can be dance, if expressive enough, likewise just a  gesture of the arm. Allow the oriental view that the hands are the center of dance. This is a ballet hidden in a drama. Try to pick up the threads of its movement and gesture, and follow. Understand what is expressed in dance alone.
Turn the volume up plenty to mask ambient noise. At the crisis of vital scenes there is a deep silence, one that gifts us with cat's ears: in that vivid wakefulness there are noises beyond music.
One fortunate enough to come under the spell of this beautiful work leaves a little  wiser to color's meanings, a little more a fan of the ballet that is hidden in life's drama, a little more awake to silence, and a little more ambitious for what movies ought to be.
