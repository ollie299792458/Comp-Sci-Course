I'm not going to write my usual verbose review here. Suffice it to say that some of the unfavorable reviews here are nothing more than the haughty opinions of typical classical music snobs--you know, the kind of people who do more than anything else to discourage more people from becoming interested in "classical" (or in this case Late Romantic) music? Like every opera recording/performance--esp. one as monumental as "The Ring" cycle--this set may have its flaws, but most of the quibbles that some reviewers have with this cycle are nothing more than  nitpicking. At least some negative reviewers are honest enough to admit that maybe Wagner is just "not their cup of tea" (it is certainly understandable that his grandiose gestures are not for everybody).
Let me put it this way, when one considers all the elements that it takes to bring off a successful realization of Wagner's massive conception--and to do it in the original Romantic spirit that Wagner intended (not some space age reinterpretation)--there has never been a better version of the Ring on "video" (or DVD, in this case)...nor is their likely to be, anytime soon. I would normally give this set four-and-a-half stars, but I am giving it five stars to "bring up the average" a little, since a three-and-a-half star average review is simply not acceptable--or accurate--imho.
