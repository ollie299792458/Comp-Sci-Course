Warning if you believe the old testament word for word, do not see this movie as it will undoubtedly offend you!

This is just another case of a comedian (Jack Black) doing a movie based mostly on slapstick/childish humor without a real storyline.

If the movie was to mock the history of humankind represented in the old testament, it spent most of the time just mishmashing parts of the bible into a nonsensical stand up comedy. While this might work in an SNL skit, it should not be dragged out into a 100 minute long movie.

short synopsis, the movie begins with the beginning of humankind (biblical timeline) where one cavemen (played by Jack Black) eats the forbidden fruit to obtain godlike knowledge & his sidekick "O" (played by Michael Cera) is compelled to follow him throughout most of the movie.

Kicked out (of I guess paradise) by their tribe for having eaten the forbidden fruit, the two cavemen venture forth into the unknown stumbling from one biblical storyline to the next.

There seemed little purpose in this movie except the use of satire on parts of the old testament. While I do not think the humor is that bad, I agree with most that it is not great either and without a real storyline to go by, the movie lacks any purpose or motive for one to watch it.

Compare this to Monty Python's "The Life of Brian" and you may understand why  a storyline is so desperately needed.

Unlike "The Life of Brian", "Year One" jumps from one story to the next and there is no real purpose to their adventures except at the end when it is indicated that no one person is chosen by God to lead/follow any particular belief/ritual, but that all are chosen by God to make her/his own decision as to what is right or wrong. Pretty weak and a bit of a copout if you are trying to make a point in a movie.

Oh well, I do not hate it because I saw it on cable, but if I had to pay for it in a movie theater, I could understand those who gave it one or two stars.
