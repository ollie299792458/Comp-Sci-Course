Thank you Baby Hands Productions for taking the guesswork out of communication with my granddaughter. The results are amazing.

When Alexandria was 8 months old, I was caring for her while her mother was out.  It was bedtime.  I had just bathed her and was playing with her as I was dressing her for bed.  She was not giggling, or playing as she had done during the day with her mom, instead she was systematically waving her left hand at me.  I waved back which resulted in an even more dramatic wave and then a push back at me.  When her mother arrived home I explained the behavior.  She said, oh that means she wants to go to bed - "no more playing put me in bed - now!  And, if you don't, I shall cry loudly."

I was thinking back when I had my own children, the little ways that I knew what they wanted. Sometimes it was very hard, particularly when they began to speak, and I could not exactly understand them. Recently, I had heard about "My Baby Can Talk".  I bought the DVD for my daughter and granddaughter.  We watched the DVD together as well as the excellent tutorial.  Little Alexandria, was totally absorbed.  Within days she was giving me the sign for milk.  Within a week, she was making the sign for more. Now she signs "go"  and "car" in sequence.  My daughter and I have used the Baby Hands Productions website for more words and signs.  The outings to the park are now quite enjoyable, as Alexandria signs duck, bird, dog, butterfly and is ecstatic when a policeman comes by on a horse.

This artistic, creative, engaging DVD has taken the guesswork out of communication.  Alexandria still uses her own sign to say put me to bed, and on her own created a sign for telephone, just from watching her mom on the telephone - which is pretty close to the "real" sign.  She is so attentive to hands.  If she says a word, and I don't understand, she signs at the same time. Anxiously awaiting the next DVD in the series ...
