A bleak but very powerful movie, a product of its time in post WWII Britain, with old certainties falling apart, but the swinging sixties not yet arrived.

Tom Courtenay plays Colin, a thoughtful, wary young man recently sent to a borstal (young person's prison). He is resigned to his lot, that of the underdog, always running from, and fighting with, authority. As shown in extended scenes from his earlier home life, his family life is grim (his family live in poverty in the shadow of the factory where his dying father has worked for his whole life). Colin sees no hope of any permanent escape from this life. There are two things that offer glimpses of alternatives; one is the freedom he feels while running long, meandering races through the countryside--he sheds his hunted-animal-look and smiles openly and honestly. Secondly, brief snatches of fun, joyriding in stolen cars and taking girlfriends to sleazy seaside hotels, offer glimpses of other possibilities. But his closest ties are with his father, who, on his deathbed, defiantly refuses medicine and hospital treatment--he wants no help, no charity, from anyone. As the movie progresses, Colin turns into a fast and talented long-distance runner and is given an opportunity to use these skills to--dare we say it?--better himself. In a gripping finale, racing with a running-star public-schoolboy character (played by a very young James Fox), he is shown making a difficult, shocking decision.
