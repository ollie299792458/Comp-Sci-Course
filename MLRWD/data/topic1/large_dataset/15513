Let's face it, this entire movie is a fantasy. It is basically an MTV video about fancy underground car racing or a "Need for Speed" movie version.

What did I learn from this movie? well, just because I like to play video-games of this genre, I may not necessarily like watching a movie about it. Don't get me wrong, I have 14-18 year old nephews that love this type of movie due to the cars and of course, the girls. This is why I took them to see it. They of course love it, that is why they have the DVDs and watch it again and again.

The story line, young underestimated underground racer makes move on girlfriend of nince's kingpin, kingpin challenge to race, both make a mess on the way, and he ends up deported to Tokyo, where he practically does the same thing. Of course, he meets his "sen say" and ends up becoming kingpin at the end of movie.

They are no surprises, you watch this movie because you enjoy watching stunts, girls and cars. It's all about image, and the movie is an entire facade.

My issue with this movie is not that it wasn't meant for me, is that it was meant for lets face it, teenagers, and the message that is being set about value and women, etc. is pretty empty, vain, superficial. Particularly since they tend to watch these movies over and over.

I don't know, maybe I am getting old. Then again, I loved Batman begins. So, Maybe I just like movies with substance.
