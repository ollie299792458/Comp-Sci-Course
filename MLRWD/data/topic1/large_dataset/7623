Although I'm a big fan of Audrey Hepburn this movie wasn't very good. I had heard about it for the longest time and finally watched it with my mom. She left halfway through the movie, and I stayed (being a devout believer in finishing movies no matter how bad). Mickey Rooney's part, I must say, was excellent and so very funny. He had me laughing so hard. Audrey plays the misplaced Holly Golightly, not belonging anywhere it seems. However, unlike other movies, she had no real purpose in this movie, except to keep the action going. Her mood swings are what threw me off. Nevertheless, her wardrobe is simply ravishing. I like how she befriends her upstairs neighbor, whom she endearingly calls Fred after her brother. The movie gives her a "bad girl" image, which really isn't the Audrey Hepburn I know. One minute she likes you, adores you, even seems to love you, and the next she hates you for wanting to get close to her. The movie has no real depth, although it brushes issues such as prostitution, drugs, and other illegal activities. And the movie title really has nothing to do with the movie. A brief scene at the beginning with her eating in front of the store really doesn't cut it, despite her obsession with Tiffany's and her later entrance into the building. I will say that Audrey does has style, but no class in this movie portrayal. And what's style without class? The concept of the story was annoying, odd, and downright confusing. You never know what to expect from her character, and from Peppard's for that matter. The DVD features are okay ie. languages, special features, etc. This movie is not one I'd recommend, but it's definitely a unique plot.
