Remember your adolescence when you befriended the wild, unpredictable classmate? They never got good grades without cheating, grew pot in their bedroom, and were always the one with the fake ID. You knew your parents didn't approve of them and yet, spending time with them was without a question some of the best times you had as a kid.

It seems that Tom Cruise has become the film industry's version of the wild child. After leaping over Oprah's sofa a few years back he transformed from the most bankable star in Hollywood to the fodder of Late Night talk show hosts. He has been characterized as unstable and maybe even a little delusional.

It was only a matter of time before a film would take advantage of Tom's new persona and cast him in a film that pokes fun at such an individual. Tom stars with Cameron Diaz in "Knight and Day," opening today in theaters across America. Tom plays a spy, with much of the characteristics he has personally been accused of possessing. His by chance encounter with Cameron Diaz sets them off on an adventure around the world. Diaz' character June, becomes an unwilling participant in a game of espionage as she and Roy (Tom Cruise) fight to remain alive through a maze of unpredictable plot twists.

The film is packed with a plethora of action sequences with plenty of funny gags added to the mix. Some of the special effects are weak, but as long as the characters keep moving and entertain us, who cares? This is not a film that will win awards or even be number one at the box office this week. Plain and simple, this is a fun film with a few minutes out of our busy lives to relive the thrills of being reckless and impulsive. So leave you worries about the bills at home, go to theater and order the large popcorn this time. Sit back and enjoy a few moments with the wild child.
