I love baseball. To my mind, there's never been a more perfect sport. So when I see a 'baseball movie', the first thing I ask is 'was this movie REALISTIC about the game?' It's important to me that the film-makers  respect the game as much as I do. "The Natural" is perhaps the  most UNREALISTIC baseball movie ever (rivaling "Major League",  but at least they didn't take it so darn serious). And allegory shmallegory  -- if the only way to pick up on all the references is to read the book  first, then why make the movie at all?
This kid starts out as a better  pitcher than Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, and Lefty Grove  all rolled into one. He doesn't have the body of a home run hitter THEN,  much less decades later, when he suddenly becomes the equal of Babe  Ruth.
And the team! They play worse than your average semi-pro team until  he arrives, and then suddenly they have the grace and talent of the '27  Yankees. This technique has been used in all kinds of sports movies, but  none of them pretend to be realistic, as this one does.
I could go on and  on (the lightning strike, the blood through the uniform, the halo on Glenn  Close in the stands, yada yada yada), but I sum it up thusly:
"The  Natural" LOOKS great -- it is a supremely beautiful film. But as Roger  Ebert said, "Why didn't they make a movie about baseball?"
