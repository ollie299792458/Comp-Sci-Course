One of the most classic turning point lines in the movie, Ben Hur is by far one of the best films of all time that I have ever seen along with a sound score that I find the most incredible that I have ever heard in a 1950's biblical blockbuster. The story really shows a character named Judah Ben-Hur who is vengeful and strong-willed to fight for the freedom and justice of his people and family and defeat his power-hungry Roman best friend, Messala, who has turned evil and betrayed him, his mother and sister,for not siding with him,Caesar and the Roman Empire. As consequence,Judah battles many tests in his life,from imprisonment, to being a galley slave, competing in the classic chariot race against Messala, and a long desperate search for his mother and sister who have now become lepers cast away in a far away valley. It is non-stop action and thrills in this movie as Judah overcomes his hate for what his best friend has put him through and how he finds the heart to forgive,love and make peace with all that has happened to him when he has a chance encounter with Christ.
