"Tarzan" a Visually Stunning Full-Lenth Animated Feature Film from Disney. The Wonderful Fable about the little boy raised by Wild Animals in the Jungle Adapted from the Classic and Famous Story by Edgar Rice Burroughs, who doesn't know that one? The way this attractive version was done The Beautiful Paintings some executed on canvas with Bright Rich Thick Luscious Tropical Vegetation and all the Lush Colorful Flowers, the awesome way a lot of them are treated specially the evening/night backgrounds with different shades of Blue Colors so superbly Painted with most perfection and detail, and laid behind a Family of Lemurs with Piercing Bright Red Eyes staring at you, such a contrast and Great Art Work...Outstanding!

The Magnificent shots of the Island with the Ocean Waves Crushing against the Rocks and the well Orchestrated Reflection of Lights and Shadows on the Dancing Waters and the Excellence Under Water Sequences Dazzling Animation and Animated Effects,... I was hypnotized! With an assembly of Charming Characters and Captivating Funny Lovable Creatures. Some of the Big Action Sequences, the Destructive Burning Inferno aboard the Ship and the consequently Shipwrecked. How about a most Thrilling Chase through a Labyrinth of Swinging Tree Vines and Branches or an Elephant Stampede through masses of tumbling trees and Jungles of Bamboo Grass
