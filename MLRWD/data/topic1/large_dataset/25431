We saw this movie in the actual theaters - it was GREAT - INTENSE and highly motivational.  I LOVE that this is based on a true story & believe me, most of this movie is totally accurate to the real events.  We visited the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame a couple years ago BEFORE this movie even came out or was advertised & so we were already informed of this story from that visit.  You will laugh, cry, cheer, jump up & out of your seat and you will just LOVE to watch it!  And let's NOT forget the HUMOR...John Malkovich is GREAT, he is the comic relief & yet plays a sensitive side of the story (for he & the world sees himself as a total loser).

They did a great job! Now THIS is a REAL family movie that IS completely family friendly with regards to morals, perspectives, what is right & wrong & just the plot of the story line - it was real, not fake.  Just an amazing story.  I would not recommend it for young audiences of younger than 7 or 8 years old as some of the scenes are very "intense".  I do not support "gambling" of any sort, but if you look past the gambling part, it is still a great "underdog" story of human nature & life of a horse athlete.  I would just simply state - amazing movie!  Don't miss this one.
