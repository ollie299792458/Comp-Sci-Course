Its amazing to look back and view this film again to see how " we made out"!
Well we didnt! "The Hospital" underscores the malaise that was beginning in the early 70,s in hospitals.  That malaise has now spread into a full blown epidemic. Today, 2004, the hospital,mostly any hospital is one of the most dangerous places to reside in.
They are unhealthy,replete with staff shortages, racked with mal practice suits, hammered by HMO's subverted by medicare rules and regulations and emeregency rooms that are packed with aliens getting their initial health care!
This film shows how organized mayhem effects health care and converts that to disorginized health care. George C. Scott is totally defeated physician who is rejuvenated by the allure of Diana Rigg( who wouldnt be) Its too late for Scott and many of the patients that fall to DR. Wellbeck's unsteady hands or Bernard Hughes' philosophy.  
In the end Scott stays on in his quagmire sort of like a Capt who chooses to go down with his ship. 
Unrelenting and terrific film hits all the marks  so get ready!
