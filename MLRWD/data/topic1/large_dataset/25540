Few movies drive home a point as sharply as this one does. Yep, I will never, ever be mean or angry with a waiter or food preparer again.

"Waiting" is definitely one of those F*** Bomb a minute, gross out sexual humor sort of movies.  But what makes it stand out from the majority of these usually brainless and nearly unwatchable movies is the sharply written script by first time writer/director Rob McKittrick.  McKittrick knows his subject, as he was writing from personal experience.  The characters are well fleshed out and recognizable, and the dialogue is quite funny and intelligent.  The ensemble cast - Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, and Justin Long among them - do a great job.

As others have already mentioned, "Waiting" is like "Office Space", in that it is a movie focused on one peculiar micro-culture of our modern society.  Instead of Cubical-ville, the characters live in the world of those familiar chain restaurants with the ersatz instant "history" and "character" stuck to the walls, where the waiters gather at your table to sing "Happy Birthday".  Think T.G.I.F. or Bubba Gump, more upscale than Denny's or Carrow's, less upscale than Macaroni Grill (the local one here has someone, usually the head waiter or a cute girl, sing "Happy Birthday" in Italian, as an aria).

And, I now appreciate so much more the budget steakhouses like Ponderosa/Bonanza that show you the cooks grilling the steaks right in front of the customers.  Great idea, all restaurants should do that...

Yes, this movie is what happens after the "coming of age" movie, when the kids leave the comforts of home to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives.  Have you noticed how the people in these sorts of jobs are usually young, usually turn over constantly?  It's a way station in life, the entry point into the cold, hard, realities of our fiercely competitive society.

Be kind to them all, while they figure it out...
