The Alamo has gotten a lot of bad rap, but it's really quite a good movie. Although, it may not be as wonderful as I say it is, especially if you're not a Native Texan. However, this is still a wonderful film.

:::ACTING:::

William B. Travis: Well, despite what everyone else says, I think that Patrcik Wilson, of Oklahoma! fame, does a wonderful job as William B. Travis, and he plays well against Jason Patric (Jim Bowie). Wilson certainly makes a more interesting character out of Travis, and also a more attractive one.

Davy Crockett: Billy Bob Thornton makes a wonderful Davy Crockett! He certainly helps to hold the movie together, and adds a few comical moments. His preformance is definatly worth an Oscar-Nomination.

Jim Bowie: Jason Patric is possibly the worst actor out of the four main characters. However, he still pulls off the role quite well. After all, there isn't much you can do with a role that requires you to be bed-ridden a good 3/4 of the movie.

Sam Houston: Of course, he's Dennis Quaid! Do you really think I'd have something bad to say about Dennis Quaid? He is an amazing actor, and the role of Sam Houston suited him well.

:::DIRECTION:::

To put it bluntly, the direction sucked. Ron Howard would have done a much better job, enough said.

:::VISUALS:::

Very pleasing visuals on this one, indeed. Despite the small budget, they managed to pull off a few good special effects. Well done.

:::TOTAL SCORE:::

All-in-all, I give 'The Alamo' an 'A'. And yes, that 'A' stands for amazing. You truely will 'Remember the Alamo'.
