I have just recently become interested in the classic cinema, or classic world cinema in this situation, and I have not delved too far yet into fully understanding cinema in general, but being an extreme history enthusiast I was compelled and influenced by outside forces to purchase the Eisenstein Sound Years Criterion set. I thoroughly enjoyed the "Ivans", but unfortunately the "Nevsky" film and dvd fell a little short of oustanding. The film itself I believe is an important lesson in understanding Soviet propaganda and the limitations set on artists during Stalin's regime, but the actually story and pace of the content is a little...old?(!) I also do agree with this being a milestone in the terms of film epics, and the costumes and cinematography seem to be very good for its time. The only problem I have is you barely begin to understand any characters for the film can only have so many sequences before the epic battle scene, but perhaps I am saying this for I believed both "Ivans" to be artistic and in-depth looks at a complex human being. I will have to show a little dismay also in the dvd, for I know tranfers must be hard to accomplish but the score and film itself are still somewhat grainy. I will not go into the cons very much, for I still see this as a very important film for modern times, and you can easily see the influence in nowadays epics (ie. Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings). I guess my main point is not to come towards the film after reading about it and expect one of the most amazing pieces of art ever made, but instead pull it in as a study of modern propaganda and Soviet Philosophies. As stated, I enjoyed the "Ivans" much more, but considering the restrictions Eisenstein had faced prior to making "Nevsky", it is still a film far above par and unique.
