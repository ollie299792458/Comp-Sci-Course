I must admit that although this movie is stunningly bad, I oddly enough enjoyed it.  As a person who is not terribly religious, I can still appreciate good actors trying very hard to make a bad movie good.  Kudos to Michael York and Michael Ironsides in that respect.  York shows off his acting talents while delivering the silliest lines ever, and Ironsides does his usual badass performance as an intense gun toting bodyguard and #2,  his outfit seemingly lifted straight from Schwarzeneggers "Total Recall".  I guess all bad dudes wear leather blazers, who knew.  There is one line that he says with a straight face that is so hilarious I can't even mention it....you must watch the flick yourself I won't give it away.  As for Casper Van Dien, his acting ability has the depth of a kiddie pool.  This is verified by his wonderfully bad role in "Starship Troopers".
I can credit christians for one thing....they toned down the violence and had the decency to make the camera cut away when York was shot in the head.  Too many hollywood flicks seem to have an orgasmic love of 'head shots', something I personally don't consider entertainment.
If you are a christian you will love this DVD.  If you aren't, well you might still like it.  Have an open mind, remember Harrison Ford wasn't available.
The ending was kinda disappointing, but I guess they had to stick to prophecy and avoid a hollywood version.  It ends on a good note of sorts.
