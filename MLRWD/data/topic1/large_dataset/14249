What a movie! I watch this movie two-three times a month. I cannot get enough of Noah and Allie. The producers could not have chosen a better cast.  One of my favorite parts is when Noah and Allie lay in the middle of the street watching the lights change. I love to hear her laugh when they have to jump up quickly when a car comes down the road.
I love their fights, their heated romances, the genuine love they have for each other. Noah sticks with Allie when her terrible disease takes over her mind. He waits with hope that Allie can remember for just a moment. Tears will spill over in your eyes when Allie remembers who Noah is, and for just a brief few minutes they capture their love for each other. Then the terrible disease comes back and she does not remember Noah, and medical attention is requires. "I'll Be Seeing You" is the perfect song that is sung by Jimmy Durante.
This movie shows that true love will carry you through all the good times and bad. Noah and Allie die in their sleep together.
