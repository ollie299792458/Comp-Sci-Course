From the famous opening line "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.." any fan of Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same name will be satisfied with this story of an incredibly naive,silly and nameless young woman who meets the dark and mysterious Max DeWinter in the South of France and marries him in a flash, not realising that his life is haunted by Rebecca, the beautiful drowned first wife of incomparable beauty and talent.
The movie follows the book faithfully, (except for the cause of Rebecca's death, presumably for audience sympathy to Max)recreating the gloomy atmosphere of Manderly, the ancestral seat, the insanely loyal retainer Mrs Danvers (great performance and casting to perfection)the bumbling Colonel Juylan, and the smarmy blackmailing Favell.
But kudos go to Joan Fontain as Mrs Nameless DeWinter the Second:is such silly simplicity possible in a grown woman? She plays the part of the witless besotted wifey perfectly for that time and setting, whereas  the never seen, ever maligned, gutsy independent but very dead Rebecca is my true heroine! Great for anyone who loves atmospheric black and white suspense.A must for Hitchcock fans.
