A sad, slow and hard movie to like:Affliction, the film that restaured James Coburn's career and earned him an Academy Award, is a difficult drama. Directed with coldness and distance by Schrader, Affliction is about  a problematic sheriff who is scared of become like his old man, a violent  and full-of-rage person (Coburn, in a complex part- he does a great job).  After a so-called hunt accident, that ended up in the death of a powerful  man, Nolte's character decides to seek for the truth as a way in which he  may finnally find redemption. This is a Schrader film, so don't expect  happy endings, but is exactly this aspect that makes Affliction such a  vigorous psychological drama.There are very similar points between Copland  and Affliction, but Copland is more likable, once it has a redeemer ending,  and Affliction is a punch in the stomach.Nolte is perfect as a man who is  about to have a nervous breakdown, there is a particularly memorable scene,  in which Nick's  character is looking at himself in the mirror,  confused.This film is closely to a masterpiece, but the slow rythm and the  lack of basic action and emotion turns this drama into a good, but not  excelent, film.
