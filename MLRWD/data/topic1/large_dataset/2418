I first saw this animated classic when I was in my late teens and had just started college. I remember watching "Wizards" at the free theater on campus the same year. It was a great time for an emergence of sci fi, fantasy and adult focused animation. I bought "Heavy Metal" magazine for years, wore out the soundtrack on cassette and vinyl (double album!)

The story that binds the vignettes together is what keeps you focused through the movie... but each segment, done by different artists, is as wonderful and unique as the last. We all have our favorites, from Harry Canyon and Denn to Captain Sternn and Gremlins (I actually remembered this story from an old issue of "Creepy" many moons previous). I remember identifying with Taarna. What a kick butt female role model!

I see negative reviews from people who should know better, but I suspect many of them are seduced by the modern animation that is readily available now, and perhaps their taste runs more towards the less hopeful tone of modern anime. There is no comparison in my mind. The people at "Heavy Metal" (Metal Hurlant) had full on vision here. This is what the manga to anime folks are doing now.
