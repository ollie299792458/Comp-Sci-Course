"The Song of Bernadette" tells the story of a simple French peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous from the small town of Lourdes in France. This young girl saw a beautiful lady in a niche in a cave. In time, many from throughout France came to believe that this was a miraculous apparition of the Virgin Mary. This lady eventually told Bernadette to dig up a spring and to drink and wash there. The waters of this spring almost immediately became the source for numerous miraculous healings. When asked her name by Bernadette, the lady said that her name was the Immaculate Conception, a title used to describe the Virgin Mary.

This film "The Song of Bernadette" relates this remarkable story in a very engaging and even sentimental way. You follow Bernadette through her struggles with her family, the local authorities, and the local Church as they all try to prevent her from continuing with the claim that she sees an apparition of a lady in the Grotto of Massabielle . But throughout all of these trials, Bernadette's simplicity and honesty silence all of her critics.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Lourdes or miracles. As well, the film is of interest to those curious about nineteenth century France or learning about the lives of saints. Finally, this movie is a classic and as such it should rightfully be enjoyed by anyone who is fond of beautiful cinematographic productions.

As well, this DVD includes the biography of Jennifer Jones, a woman who eventually lived a rather tragic life herself.
