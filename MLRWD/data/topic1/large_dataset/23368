From the beginning you get a glimpse of what the movie is going to be like. I really liked how truthful the female characters are portrayed in this movie.  I really liked how they portrayed the dating and club scence, it is so honest of how it is out there. I thought it was so funny and have to admit in the unrated version with two particular scences one of them being a musical number and the other with Selma Blair being literally stuck in a comprimising position was a little too silly but somehow works when the whole movie is seen throughout. It's the humor and unpredictable moments and great chemistry among the three actresses Cameron, Christina and Selma that make this movie work. I liked that they showed their main characters as sexy, smart, beautiful but flawed all at the same time. Towards the ending is a truth in what Christina's character has to say about getting tired of the dating sense when all your really looking for is a connection with someone special.  Kudos to especially Cameron and Christina in their hilarious performances and not being afraid to be silly and blunt.
