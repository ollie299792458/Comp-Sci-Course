I agree with the disappointment in how the DVD is set up.  It really is no better than a VHS.  The only advantage you have is not having to remember to rewind when you are done.  It's not much, but after awhile you resent being held hostage through the warnings and logos at the beginning that you can't fast forward through, and the lack of chapters is disappointing.

The other thing these DVDs need is a feature where you can turn off the talking and just have music like Tamilee Webb has on many of her DVDs.  You either like Leslie or you don't, but I bet that she could increase sales among those who like the workouts but hate the chatter by including this feature.  If you're going to make a DVD, you might as well give it some DVD features.

I like the workouts on her WATP-Abs for themselves.  I like wearing the belt, although you'd do just as well with a stretch band or weights.  I'm not convinced they really do work the abs, but they definitely work your upper body.  It does seem odd that her excercisers for the most part are not wearing the belt correctly--they have it on quite loosely.  I would LOVE, however, to be able to chapter ahead to the cooldown when I don't have 45 minutes to exercise.  I do have the shorter workouts, but they are not as challenging as the 3 mile.
