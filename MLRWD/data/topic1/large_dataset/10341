Adapted from Joe David Brown's Addie Pray, Paper Moon is the story of grifter Moses Pray, who offers to take orphaned Addie Loggins to her aunt for the express purpose of squeezing some money out of the man responsible for the death of her mother. But Addie is no sweet little child; she's a pragmatist who overhears the money deal and wants the bucks for herself. So Addie and Moze travel the prairie (changed from the Alabama of the novel) in a story filmed in gritty black and white, buncoing innocent shopgirls and making their living. A particularly humorous interlude comes when Moze is captivated by a hoochie-coochie dancer, played con brio by the marvelous Madeline Kahn and offers her and her maid a ride. Addie and "Trixie Delight's" maid Imogene bring the interlude to a satisfying conclusion.

The only trouble with Paper Moon was that they never filmed the second half of the book; I think O'Neal and O'Neal could have done it justice (but I'm glad they didn't do it if they were going to cast Mae West--ugh!--as Amelia Sass). If you like the movie, read the book--it's excellent; a lot more details of Addie and Moze's escapades!
