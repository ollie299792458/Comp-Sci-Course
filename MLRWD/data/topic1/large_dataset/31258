True Lies is one of the greatest action movies of all time pushing Arnold Schwarzeneger as a spy for the greatest nation on earth to be all he can be, managing to conceal his action-packed identity even from his wife for 15 years, until it was time to save her and his daughter from the very terrorists he has sworn to defeat. For the nation, he falls prisoner with his wife behind enemy lines as a CIA agent who is forced to verify the terrorists' nuclear capability much like Alias at the brink of torture but fights his way out much like Rambo with a little James Bond in fashion. Soon his whole family, including his teenage daughter, have no choice but to risk their life for the country by foiling the terrorist's plot to bring the nation down to it's knees with a nuclear threat. The family's dramatic reunion in the end is propelled by their courageous patriotism that puts an end to the terrorist threat. This movie also featured one of the greatest footage of an AV-8B Harrier in action on an urban setting, outmaneuvering a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile from truck-bound terrorists, then firing a pair of AGM-65 Maverick Missiles that destroys the bridge highway under the pair of trucks used by terrorists and later flown by Arnold to fire an AIM-9L Sidewinder Missile at a terrorist-packed helicopter, with the terrorist leader hilariously caught on the tip of the missile, going through the wide open hole blasted open earlier by the Harrier when it shredded other terrorist members with it's 20mm machine guns as Arnold hovered up to one of the top floors where they've set up camp where his daughter was held hostage who later escapes with the detonation key and also resists by all means she can. A timeless action-packed adventure indeed for the mind, body and soul. This is one of those great all-in-one movies that have it all--action, comedy, drama, suspense, high-tech gear, adventure, great inspiring characters, great mind-boggling story, and more, all in one movie!
