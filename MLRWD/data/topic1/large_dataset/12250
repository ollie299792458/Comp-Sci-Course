To me Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm is one of the best, if not THE best superhero adaptation ever. It has some unique qualities among, I think, ALL superhero onscreen adaptations:
- Animation is more friendly to comics than film - I'm getting more and more to this conclusion. With animation, there's no fuss about costumes or CGI or make-up. It allows the movement and sound and some of the 3-D effect you can't get from a comic book without things looking too campy or silly. 
- Extreme faithfulness to comics - This feature is a smart and tight combination of the Year One and Year Two storylines. There's nothing here to piss-off fanboys: no stiff rubber suit, no leather jackets, no skinny guy as the hero, no caricatural or Power-Rangish villain - the Joker is actually quite creepy - no turn-back-in-time ending.
- Spot-on characterization - Like a lot of two-hour movies don't get to, this hour-and-a-half piece gets to cover in a fitting way all the basic issues of the character: why he can't get over the death of his parents and try for a happier existence, why he uses a dark symbol to fight crime, why he works outside the law, why he isn't a murderer, whether he's as crazy as his enemies or not. His skills are all featured as well: the womanizing playboy facade, the detective, the scientist, the martial artist, the acrobat, the badass. It finds na ideal way to tell his story, connecting past and present. You get to see a lot of Bats at the prime as you also get to follow his first steps. 
- Great romance story - I never thought a romance story with Bats would work - at least if it didn't involve Catwoman. But this one is incredibly fitting with Bruce's character arc. Andrea, at first, seems to represent the lighter side of what he could have had - a happier, more normal life. Then she turns out to be the darker side - the murderous, all-about-revenge vigilante he could have been. It's also a rare case of a great Batman story that focuses a lot on Bruce Wayne, giving it a very human appeal.
- The scene where Bruce asks to be released from his promise could well be the most poignant superhero moment onscreen ever: never a superhero begged so hard to put all this madness behind him, and never had so much of a right to: when Supes decides to give up on his powers for Lois, the audience goes, "don't do that, you moron! The world needs Supes more than ever! That chick isn't worth it!" Not to mention Clark LOVES being Superman... When Bruce says, "It doesn't hurt so bad anymore. I can give money to the police... to hire more cops. Let someone else take the risk", even a hardcore Bats fan has to think, "you know what, that makes sense". A robot would feel sorry for Bruce when he says, "I didn't expect to be happy". Yes, a character can be brooding and emotionally difficult and still engage and touch the audience, Mr. Ang Lee...
- It broke ground for feature animation - like the animated series on TV, this feature did a lot for its genre. Superhero movies usually make their innovations on the FX area, but for the time, MOTF was very unusual for an action animation, even more in its storytelling than in its technical qualities. It pulled no punches, with people being murdered, some legitimate creepiness, and the story getting darker and darker as it progressed, with an unhappy ending.
