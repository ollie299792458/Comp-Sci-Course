for the record I don't usually enjoy 'pot' movies that show people getting stoned and being stupid.  Trailer Park Boys (TPB) puts a different if subtle twist on a purple haze type life.  these characters are stupid and poor first which leads to growing drug, drinking too much and having disfuncional relationships.  hidden deep in the middle of these characters are occasional tender hearts who are trying to come to grips with being messed up and being ok with that type of life.

The show is shot kinda like a documentary with cameras following people and doing the occasional interview to get the characters thoughts on events that just occoured.

I like unusual films and stuff, but not just ANY unusual films.  as mentioned earlier I didn't enjoy "half baked" or "harold and kumar"  but I did like Undercover Brother in which some drug use was a side issue to the character's motivations.  I liked zoolander where most of the characters are out of this world, but because the whole film is populated with them it helps to believe in the unbelievable characters.  unlike blades of glory where two or four characters are over the top, but everyone around them are normal, thats when the over the top acting becomes annoying for me.

search some TPB youtube and see if you laugh at them, if so start your TPB collection!
