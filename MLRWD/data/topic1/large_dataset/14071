For those who know Marlon Brando only from his recent fiascos, such as The Island Of Dr. Moreau, it might be hard to believe that not only was he the greatest actor of his generation, but his acting set the standard and style  for many of his contemporaries and most of those who followed over the next  10-20 years.  Take a look at Streetcar (and, while you're at it, his Terry  Malloy in On The Waterfront), and there can be no question of his  greatness.  But what is most amazing is that, while this is one of the  greatest performances in the history of cinema, it does not overshadow the  other three leading performances.  In fact, Vivien Leigh's Blanche du Bois  is also arguably one of the greatest performances ever captured on screen,  and Karl Malden and Kim Stanely are just as perfect in their supporting  roles.  Elia Kazan was always an actor's director, and this was never more  apparent than in this film. Even the censors could not dilute the power of  Tennessee Williams' play (as they would a few years later with the  adaptation of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof), but it will always be the acting that  will keep the viewer mezmerized.
