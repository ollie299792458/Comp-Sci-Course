Those of us who were lucky enough to see the original premier of the first Star Wars film in the 1970's were amazed at the high level of realism created by the new technological innovation of computer animation. What was also surprising at that time was that this new advance came not from Walt Disney Studios, but from a new group called Industrial Light and Magic. As ILM developed the technology over the course of each new Star Wars movie, Disney looked to the future and decided to produce a computer animated film of its own, Tron. The great Disney artists showed how beautifully they could use the new medium by creating a vision of a living world within a mainframe computer--more than a decade before the Matrix trilogy. In the story the Master Control program of a computer technologies company gains power by drawing all programs within the mainframe into itself. Its counterpart in the real world is an ambitious programmer who rises to the company's top position by pirating the work of a video games innovator. The sinister Master Control program uses this knowledge to gain a foothold in the real world. The only barrier in its path to control of both virtual and real worlds is the video game wizard, Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges. Master Control uses an experimental program that transposes matter to electrons to pull Flynn into the mainframe world. His plan is to destroy the programmer on the game grid. But Flynn is the game master and escapes to help the beings that inhabit the digital landscape regain their freedom, as well as save the real world from the MCP's plans. Although the story is simple, it is told with a visual complexity that is still a delight to the eye after 30 or so years. Tron maintained enough popularity over the years as a cult classic to inspire a sequal over 3 decades later, Tron Legacy. This is a must-have video for anyone who is a collector of films that are landmarks in the industry.
