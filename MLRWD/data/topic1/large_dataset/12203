This movie has been the movie all year that has impressed me the most. Guy Ritchie, in his sophomore directorial outing (the last being 1998's fantastic and critically acclaimed "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels").
The movie is different than what you're advertised though, the movie takes place in England and everybody including the American actors (except 1 or 2) have heavy heavy accents, it'll be hard for you to break down some of the dialogue so the first time you watch this watch it with subtitles on, even though i watched this on VHS on a TV with no closed captioning. It'll help you get a little more about the movie.
The movie has several plots that cross paths including betting on illegal boxing matches, the war over a diamond and mob wars. It's really confusing but it's worth sitting through, it's better than 90% of the movies we get in America. I dont want to spoil the plots so i wont get into detail.
All in all this is a big step up for Guy Ritchie and it's even better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. From the looks of this DVD (Which is a two DVD set with a whole disc of extras, yay), it looks like a must buy. Anyway, which ever route you go you need to give this movie at least one viewing for yourself. It's definitely worth at least the price of rental but i'd advise you to buy this DVD that's been put together for us.
I'm surprised that a film with such substance and great acting/directing/writing was a big hit in America, we usually like 100 million dollars of explosives and silly teen comedies meant to capitolize on the few with substance like American Pie.
Odds on best of 2001, i can't wait for Guy Ritchie's next film.
