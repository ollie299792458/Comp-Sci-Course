Although the acting is fairly poor, the dialogue stilted, and the plot non-existent, this movie--as the Re/Search book "Incredibly Strange Films" notes--is about as close as one gets to the flow and feel of a  dream. I would attribute the mood to the bravura visuals--classically  composed still shots a la Peter Greenaway; planes of saturated color  winking on and off as characters move through a outrageous deco sets;  swooping lens movements worthy of Sam Raimi's  "wraithCam"--working in tandem with the gorgeous, occasionally  incongruous prog-rock stylings of ELP keyboard whiz Keith Emerson. Scenes  of great formal beauty are intermittently jarred by stabbings, immolations,  strangulations, eyeball-gougings, and rodent attacks, all fairly gratuitous  (just like in real life!), and Emerson's synthesizer flailings are equally  prone to erupt without warning--often to miraculous effect. The music that  accompanies one woman's taxi ride through the rainswept streets of Rome is  wild and offbeat and sticks with you, and the Gregorian finale--the  repeated incantation "Suspiriarum, Lachrymarum,  Tenebrarum,"  referring to the "mothers" (all of them witches) who cause the  film's mayhem--sounds like a rock opera version of Orff's "Carmina  Burana" (it's hokey, but trust me, it works!). I have also seen  "Suspiria," but prefer this film on the level of pure, macabre  experience.
