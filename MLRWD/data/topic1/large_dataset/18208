Conceived as a vehicle for comedian Richard Pryor, Superman III is the least successful of the series.  Despite a somewhat prescient storyline dealing with the use of computers to manipulate the economy, the script has no depth and very little entertainment value.  Margot Kidder's Lois Lane has been reduced to a brief walk-on part, and the rest of the cast appears to be merely going through the motions.  Even Christopher Reeve, who was reportedly very angry about the producers treatment of Kidder, is lacking his usual charm.
The visual effects are not on the same level as in the previous two movies: models blatantly look miniature, most of the flying sequences look two-dimensional, and there are numerous instances of visible wires...  In short, there is none of the epic-scope that marked the first film and most of the second. ...the final confrontation between Superman and the supercomputer is flat out boring--looking as if it has been lifted from a cheap 1950s science-fiction movie.  Lester's Metropolis scenes lack the razzmatazz of Richard Donner's scenes in Superman I.  
The picture quality on the DVD is good but not outstanding.  The sound is flat and lacks dynamic range.
