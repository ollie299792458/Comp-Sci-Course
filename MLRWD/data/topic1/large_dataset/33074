I think enough people already gave a movie premise (brother and sister drive home from college and sees a demon). 
This movie does the job, it scares the hell out of you but i couldn't give it 5 stars because of the small holes.
I know the writer/director wanted to stick to the basics but we as an audience have grown use to origins of the killer. Why does he kill? Where did he come from? How can you kill him? This movie doesn't say at all. 
But the most damaging parts in the movie was the dumb mistakes that the 2 main characters made. People in the theater literally couldn't take it anymore and started to leave. Me, i stayed because the monster in the movie is the coolest i've seen since Freddy Krueger. Not to spoil the movie but, one of the dumb mistakes was: the brother and sister are riding in the car as a police officer escorts them out of town, the "Creeper" lands on top of the police car and slices his head off. When the 2 main characters see the severed head they stop and check to see if the officer is alive. At this point i'm like "DRIVE AWAY IDIOT" then the "Creeper gets out of the car, grabs the severed head and eats the tongue. While all of this is going on, THEY STILL STAND THERE?!!!?
Love the fact that it's brother and sister instead of boyfriend, girlfriend. Also i love that the female character is the strong one while the male lead is the sensitive one. How original.
