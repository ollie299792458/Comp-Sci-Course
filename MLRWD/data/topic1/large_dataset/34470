"WTF is wrong with those Nazis?!?!". I lost count how many times I said that to myself while watching this film. It blows my mind that this happened not even that long ago and it just makes me so angry that there are still racist people today. Why can't people just realize that we are stronger united because we can learn from all different cultures instead of fearing each other which holds us back!

Ok, I'm done ranting...onto the film then =)

I'll admit I put off seeing this film because I wasn't ready for what I thought would be a very sad and heavy movie and while it is that, it is also uplifting, hopeful and beautiful. Roman Polanski shoots this film in a way that is very honest. I didn't feel that he tried to manipulate the way you feel by emphasizing the killings and suffering, he merely shows it to you and lets you decide the way it affects you by showing you only a little bit of reaction from the people in the film.

I only recall one scene in which Adrien Brody really cries, he is walking down a lonely street lined with abandoned belongings scattered on the ground. This makes the movie much more poignant and haunting because your reactions are completely your own instead of the actor's and actress's.

Being a pianist myself I really felt Adrien Brodys anguish when he sat down at the piano but couldn't play it for fear of being discovered. The final piece played in the movie is by Chopin and it was a wonderful choice because it is sad and hopeful at the same time, exactly like this film.

I recommend this movie for all teenagers and adults. Parents should watch this movie with their teens and ask them what they think of racism afterward.
