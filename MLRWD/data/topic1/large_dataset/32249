This is the "Miracle on 34th Street" I remember from childhood.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time and none of the remakes compare.

The set includes both the black and white and colorized versions.  The colorized version is the one shown on television, not something new and improved.  The opening scene was grainy and the color was distorted, as if to remind us this is an old movie.  The black and white version is crisp, as it was meant to be shown.  Both versions offer the option to view the movie with the Maureen O'Hara commentary, which she does throughout the movie.

I found O'Hara's commentary interesting.  Sometimes, she just described what was happening in the scene, which we could see for ourselves.  Other times, she would describe what it was like to work with an actor or what was happening behind that scene or on the set.  That was a special treat and I sat glued to the set to watch the movie a second time just to hear her talk.

"AMC Backstory" gave a history of the movie and some of the problems behind the set.  I found it fascinating, but I did not like that it was cut into clips and run like on television with all the pauses put in for commercials, except we didn't see any commercials.  Certainly those pauses could have been edited out.

Also included are the Thanksgiving day parade footage, promotional shorts and the poster gallery.

I was looking forward to the little booklets often inserted into DVD sets, but this set lacks one.  Still, it is a wonderful set.
