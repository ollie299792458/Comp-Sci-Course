I've watched the movie Penny Serenade many times and I remember that when my husband and I lost our child in death, our marriage wasn't strong enough to endure the pain of it all.  We didn't know how to communicate our grief and pain, instead we mourned the lost to ourselves to an extent each blaming the other, where there was no fault at all.  In our pain, we said and did hurtful things to one another and in the end it destroyed our marriage. I watched this movie tearfully and I rejoiced that in the end this loving couple found each other and were blessed with another child. I know I speak for many parents when I say that the death of a child is a pain  that is undescribeable.  It has taken time, and much prayer, but now when I remember my beautiful daughter, I do so with happy tears and laughter.  You see, she brought so much joy in all our lives, and left many wonderful memories for us to hold onto.  If you are in pain and don't know how to share it this movie will help you get thru it.. I know it helped me. Since my divorce my exhusband and I don't speak about her. that used to bother me but not anymore.  You see my guilt is over and now I am at peace!!!!
