I believe this movie will be remembered for a long time.  It didn't make the "bang" with the public that it should have, but that's ok, it would have detracted from the whole ambiance of the film about enthusiastic  criminal-wannabes.
A lot of people will say things like "this was  stupid" or "what's all the 'hype' about?", but I guarantee  you one of two things. 1) They didn't understand the total deadpan  hilariousness of the movie, its wonderfully understated brilliance, 2) they  can only laugh at blatantly, extrovertly funny people like Jim Carrey.
If  you have the patience to actually listen to the dialogue in this movie  instead of having the humor hit you over the head, you will get a great  reward.  Excellent, witty comments, hilarious plans, and wonderful  performances.  Dignan saying that Bob "...has no character  man..." when he wanted to go help his brother in jail almost killed me  I was laughing so hard.
PLEASE give this movie an HONEST chance.  Don't  go in expecting to have everything spelled out for you, this is a very sly  comedy.  
FOR DVD buyers:  The DVD could use a lot more extras on it.  I  hope that Criterion will provide a treatment of this classic as they did  the other amazing Anderson movie, "Rushmore".  However, the DVD  is double-sided, providing pan-and-scan as well as widescreen.  The picture  is crisp as usual and the sound is fairly rich IMO.  It's 2/5 stars as far  as DVD's go, but 10/5 for the movie! :)
