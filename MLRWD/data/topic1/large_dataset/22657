Oftenly sited as the last film noir picture along with TOUCH OF EVIL. Not only that, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW is arguably one of the finest films noir of all time. It also should have recognized as one of the best films of director, Robert Wise. For this one, Wise took a job of producer to make sure that the whole thing would be HIS FILM.

As a dedicated film craftsman, Wise always was innovative making his films great, and made them quite memorable. His ingenuity particularly reflected strongly on ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW. Beautiful quality B&W photography is still astonishing today, sharp editing is stunning, use of John Lewis' jazz score is entirely artistic, and the characters' mood is perfectly suited to lead us into a grim, nihilistic, yet a very poetic noir environment.

Players were perfectly chosen too. Robert Ryan, Harry Belafonte, Ed Begley, Shelley Winters, and Gloria Grahame are all wonderful. Espesially, Ryan proves himself again as an effecive noir anti-hero. He succeeded injecting reality of a fallen man who feels fear, hate, loneliness, and hoping for the last.

All together, "Odds Against Tomorrow" should be remembered as one of the most artistic contribution for the film noir genre, as well as the masterwork of great director, Robert Wise.
