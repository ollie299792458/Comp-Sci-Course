Let me start out by saying that I read many books on dog training before and after bringing home our English Cocker Spaniel puppy and put the training techniques to work immediately. We took our pup to socialization and obedience training classes.  Despite all that effort and training, our happy 11 month old puppy developed "issues" of hyperactivity, jumping on people and dogs, being possessive of her toys, whining, destructive chewing, and pulling on her leash. All the positive training methods recommended for resolving those issues were not effective.  Just when I was at wits end, another dog owner introduced me to The Dog Whisperer.  That now feels like divine intervention.  Recently I purchased the DVD set of the first year episodes of the National Geographic channel's Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan's book together.  I watched, read, assimilated, and applied the rehabilitation advice and methods contained in Cesar's DVD set and book. I must report that Cesar's advice and methods have worked like magic to resolve our puppy's "issues."  In one short week, I have applied calm assertive leadership for our pup, and she has absolutely thrived on twice daily "primal" walks, consistent discipline (rules, boundaries, and limitations), and affection - in that order. As a result, our puppy is in a calm receptive state of mind 99% of the time.  Her "issues" have all but disappeared.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  Spread the word: Cesar Millan's dog psychology and rehabilitation methods are right on.
