This movie is basically a good and fun movie to watch when you are lonely or depress or just wanna be entertained. I do admit there are better movies out there...but I cant resist the landscapes of the rainforest and volcanic region of Congo depicted in this movie. Its fascinating !
I owned the video a few years back and now I just got the DVD.
Its plain good old fun adventure movie not to be taken seriously.Dylan Walsh, Laura Linney, Ernie Hudson are all OK in here...not to bad or good.
Perhaps not so much of the story it self but for the scenery and some of its action sequence, I found myself watching this movie several times...just to see the volcanic landscape....the river ride...the forest itself , I was even fascinated by the scenarios within the city of Zinj...this movie basically have a " safari" feel to it...and basically, thats whats the movie is about.
Story of killer apes in here may seems unbelievable...but then again on the other hand, a vast amount of the world's rainforest are not explored...so we may never know.
Comparatively, in term of story line or discovery, this movie is much more believable to lets say,compared to Jurassic Park, which I also enjoyed tremendously.
My recommendation is that anyone who have a liking for adventure based movie should at least see it once.
Watch this movie with a fun, open mind.
