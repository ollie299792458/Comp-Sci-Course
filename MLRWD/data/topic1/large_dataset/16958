Imagine being someone else for about 15 minutes, then suddenly you are dropped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike. Imagine explaining what happened to your friends. Imagine if they saw this as a business  opportunity. That's what Being John Malcovich is all about. Imagination is  the key. The entire story has a creative adolescent spirit. There is  nothing complicated here. A man (John Cusak) finds a door on the 7 1/2  floor of a building and it takes you inside of John Malcovich for about 15  minutes, then you're dropped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike. Form  this revolves a plot involving sex, greed, and voyeurism. This simple  elegance is what makes this film so enticing. Who hasn't imagined what it  would be like to live in another's shoes. This movie brings reality to an  idea most of us dismissed at the age of 12. Suddenly we're in a surreal  place where an office can exist on the 7 1/2 floor and you can actually be  another person. The movie takes your intellect on a thrill ride. 
This  kind of idea and environment is what Spike Jonez was put on this planet to  direct. You feel as if he, and only he, could bring a film of this  substance to life. The whole thing cannot be described as a movie but  rather an experience. It is unlike anything you have ever seen. 
This  movie is for people who liked to be challenged and entertained by new  ideas. If you like films that simply feed you information, you'll probably  hate this movie. You have to be willing to try something different.
