Himura Kenshin is a wandering swordsman.  Ten years before, he was an assassin and a warrior for the Choshu clan, in the revolution against the Togogawa Shogunate(forgive me if I spelled it wrong), and he was called Battousai, the Manslayer.  Wanting to repent for his sins, for all the lives he took in the revolution, he has become a wanderer, with his Sakabatou (reverse-bladed sword) he helps others in pain, and fights those who still oppress others.  As Kenshin wanders around Down town Tokyo, he meets a girl on the streets named Kauru.  After saving her from a ruthless killer, who was going under cover as "Battousai the Manslayer", Kauru invites Kenshin to stay and live with her.  As the episodes go along, they meet Yahiko, a pickpocket who is a descendent of a long line of samurai's, and they also meet Sanosuke, a.k.a. Zansa, the fighter for hire.  Overall, this video is really great, and I recommend it and this series to anyone who loves action, comedy, and a great story.
