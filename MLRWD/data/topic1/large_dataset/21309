His amazing trail of impersonations and forged checks gets started at age 16 and continues for a madcap five or six years.  He successfully impersonates an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  He never finished high school, but after two weeks of study he passes the Louisiana bar exam!  Tax your credibility??  Well, it's a true story based on the life of Frank Abnigale and his autobiographical novel of the same name.  Follows the book pretty closely, except for the addition of a good deal of fictional detail regarding his relationship with his father and mother.  Those relationships become the motivation for his criminal escapades, a major departure from the book, and presumably from the true story----but it makes for a compelling and VERY entertaining movie.  And we identify sympathetically with Frank and his bold and technically sophisticated crimes.
He is relentlessly pursued by the dogged and persistent FBI agent played engagingly by Tom Hanks.  The opening credits give us a clue of a Pink Panther-like tale, and Tom Hanks reminds us a little of Peter Seller's Inspector Clusoe---without being anywhere near so broadly comic.
Great performances by all, and another triumph for Spielberg.  My whole family LOVED this movie!!
