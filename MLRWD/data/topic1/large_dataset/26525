If, like me, you remember The Thin Man movies, then you will love The Donald Strachey Movies from Here!Network and this second in the series. The film adaptations of Richard Stevenson's novels about a gay private detective in Albany, New York are all around well done. The screenplays are well written and the acting is everything from wonderfully understated (Daryl Shuttleworth's Sean 'Bub' Bailey) to loving overacted (the Drag Queen seen in short appearances in both Third Man Out and again here in Shock To The System).

Donald (Chad Allen of Dr.Quinn, Medicine Woman fame) and his life partner, Tim Callahan (Sebastian Spence, an under-appreciated Canadian actor best known for B-movies and his role as Cade Foster in First Wave), have been called the gay Nick and Nora Charles. Their witty repartee and loving exchanges make watching any scene with the two of them a real treat.

Rather than risk spoilers I will simply say that this installment to the Strachey Library deals with death, reparative therapy and of course, Donald getting ambushed by clients' irate cheating spouses whom he has exposed. I recommend the Donald Strachey movies to anyone who loves the 'hard-boiled Detective' genre or any fan of Chad Allen, Here!Network or LGBTQ themed films.
