For those of you that aren't familiar with this movie.  It is a fun, entertaining, well-paced movie that everyone can enjoy.  This was Cary Grant's next to the last movie, and I think his best.  He is in top form as Walter Eckland a social-recluse who's oblivious to the WWII events taking place around him.  Having divorced himself from society, his philosophy is: "If the world can't learn to get along, they'll have to do it without me".  Trevor Howard plays the British naval commander with the code name "Big Bad Wolf".  To avoid having his "$200 yacht" confiscated, Cary is forced to "volunteer" into the coast-watching service and assume the radio code-name "Mother Goose".  The interplay between these two old pros, Trevor and Cary is great to watch.  Also a great scene when Cary tries to teach Leslie Caron how to fish: "Quiet,here she comes."  "How do you know it's a she?"  "Her mouth is open, now be quiet!"  Great chemistry between the two and very funny!  A charming movie the whole family can enjoy.  Highly recommended!
