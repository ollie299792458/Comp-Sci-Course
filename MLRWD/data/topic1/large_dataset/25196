I just don't know how to feel about this film.

The performances are all first rate. The story evokes many emotions and presents so much that is disturbing. You may find it hard to admit that you have enjoyed this film.

Mr. Gilliam has again presented a work that will reckon you to your core. It flows like the random thoughts of a daydreaming mind bent on completing a single thought that keeps itself just out of reach.

The young actress, Jodelle Ferland gave an absolutely remarkable performance; especially for a youngster of her age. Casting her was perhaps the most brilliant stroke in this film.

All this having been said, your average individual is not likely to enjoy this work. The story is so distrubing, it is nearly impossible to see the hope and good being in any of it.

The film is beautifully shot. It has a quality about it that is somewhere between a dream and waking state.

I recommend you risk viewing this film. It grows on you.
