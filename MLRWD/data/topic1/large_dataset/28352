This is an amazing movie. SPOILER SYNOPSIS:
It is about Mary Rafferty who falls in love with Paul Scott while she is a maid for his rich family. The Scotts run a large mill. She tries to deny that she's in love but eventually get engaged to him. But trouble takes over at the mill. The workers are upset with the Scotts and Mary's father backs them. He has never liked the Scotts, much less his only daughter marrying one. The Scotts are going to get strike breakers to dismantle the violent gang of workers until Mary makes an agreement with the workers to put off the strike breakers if they can discuss a compromise. The workers agree. The strike breakers are already coming, so one of the Scotts (a brother?) is sent to call them off. But he gets drunk and doesn't call the strike breakers off. The Scotts and workers have met at a bridge to make an agreement until they see the strike breakers coming. Mary's father tells the workers to attack and shoots Mr. Scott. Someone shoots him. Mary is devastated and tells Paul that they can never be happy together and calls off their engagement. Years later, Paul is married to an old sweetheart. They have a son but aren't in love. Mary visits the mother, who is very endeared to her from the time when Mary was her employee. The mother dies. There is a reading of the mill. The shares for the mill are divided into like 5 or 4 parts-including Mary. One of the brothers wants to sell the mill-the only catch is that all share holders have to agree. Mary doesn't agree because she knows that the deceased mom wouldn't want it that way. She ends up convincing enough of them not to sell. She is leaving when Paul hurries to catch up and rides home with her. It is insinuated that mary may finally settle for happiness with Paul.
I hate those insinuated endings but they are pure art. It is a wonderful movie if u love Greer Gargon and Gregory Peck!!!
