The Beatles Anthology is essential to any Beatles collection.  This DVD set, based on the mini-series from 1996, tells the Beatles' own story in each Beatle's own words. The sound is fantastic, the videos are great, and the interviews are very informative and often humourous.
If the DVD set has one shortcoming, it is in the presentation of the video footage.  I would have personally enjoyed watching the music videos in their entirety.  Only clips were shown of some live footage, and I would have liked to have seen the entire song performed. Also, the interviewees were speaking and sometimes shown during the music videos and live performances, a great annoyance.  It was like watching MTV's TRL at some points, with only a shortened version of a video while someone is talking.
Overall, the DVD collection is absolutely fantastic and well worth its price.  A great companion to the DVD is The Beatles Anthology book.  It provides twice as much information as the DVD and is a compelling read. To understand the Beatles in their own words, both are essential as the DVD leaves out much of the book, but the DVD also has information the book doesn't.
