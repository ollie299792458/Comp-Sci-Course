"American Pie" is smart, funny, and unlike most movies directed at teenagers, this one is extremely realistic. I was very suprised at how great the acting was in this film compared to many other teen flicks.  Not  to mention, the casting was nearly perfect.  
Though I dont think this  movie will receive an academy award, I really think it deserves one.  Any  movie this funny and enjoyable should be rewarded.  The characters had a  ton of depth and by the end of the movie, you feel like you know them.
I  recomend this film to pretty much anybody.  My parents, who are in their  50s loved it.  I loved it.  All my friends loved it.  In fact, I have yet  to meet somebody who did not love it. After you see this movie, you will be  saying quotes from it for years to come.  That is how memorable this movie  is.  An instant classic! 
Also: Watch for the awkwardness between Jim  and his father.  It is absolutely hilarious.  Every scene containing these  two characters were very well done and painfully funny.  (I especially  liked the scene where Jim's father was giving him a lecture on  masterbating)
