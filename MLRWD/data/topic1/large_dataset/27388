At least it's better than the Costner version which I saw again recently and was surprised how bad it was. This is far better although I personally feel that Bergin's lack of charisma ultimately holds the film back. Not that he is that bad, he's just never more than ok and doesn't do any justice at all to the role. Too many contrived grins and unconvincing acting. For me if you are doing Robin Hood it has to have the feel of an epic, of a great story. It has to have that larger than life quality. After all this is supposed to be the birth of a LEGEND. Otherwise what you're left with is ..... this - a worthy effort, but no pizzazz! On the plus side, there are a lot of great moments and I loved the sense of the period that we are shown. The change from Robert Hode to Robin Hood is brilliantly done and the forest scenes are all atmospheric. As another reviewer said it is a great prequel to Robin & Marian. I enjoyed the movie because I love the whole Robin Hood genre and if you are a Robin Hood fan then if you come across this film I recommend seeing it. But of course if you REALLY want to see a truly magnificent Robin Hood film it has to be the Erroll Flynn version which is exactly how to do it. That is a masterpiece of cinema. Now I read another reviewer say that Peter Jackson should direct a Robin Hood film. Now that would be worth waiting for. Since I wrote this review the Russell Crowe version has been released. Mr Bergin should take a look at HOW TO really play Robin Hood. Now that film I 100% recommend.
