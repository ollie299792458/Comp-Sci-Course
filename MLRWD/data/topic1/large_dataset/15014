This movie is pure fun.  Not violent fun like Die Hard.  Not comedy fun like Rush Hour or Shanghai Noon.  It's like closet chocoholic fun.  You don't want to admit you've seen this or even like it.  Yet you do.
The premise may turn you off.  The story is about rival cheerleading teams who are duking it out for Nationals.  The road is a rough one for both teams.  The side of Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushka (hee) find that their routines have been stolen for the past (we can assume) 4 years.  The other side comes from what could be considered the 'Hood because they have no money to get to Nationals.  Oh, did I mention that Dunst's team stole the routine from their rivals?  
From where I came from, cheerleading is treated as a joke.  It's for brainless, bubble-gum popping, ditzy girls.  As for male cheerleaders, "that says it all".  IF YOU CAN PUT THAT ASIDE, it's a very enjoyable film.
Upon seeing the routines, you'll wonder why YOUR high school wasn't nearly as athletic as what you are watching.  Have you ever watched the cheerleading comps on ESPN?  The routines in the movie equal to what you see on ESPN.  The routines are just awesome showing that cheerleaders can/are athletes themselves.
I really picked this movie up because of Kirsten Dunst.  Yet, she almost gets shadowed by Eliza Dushka who brings in a certain sexiness that Dunst doesn't do.  Both girls do an excellent job of fitting into the high school society (they aren't that far from it...) and it reminds some of us why high school wasn't that great.  
The movie is full of fun moments ("THOSE AREN'T SPIRIT FINGERS!!!") and other goofy scenes (a spitting contest between Dunst and Bradford).  
This is a great movie and a pleasant surprise.  If you enjoyed SHE'S ALL THAT, Can't Hardly Wait, or any other 90s high school movie, you'll love this one.
