This is a disappointing unauthorized movie "soundtrack" CD for Irving Berlin's THIS IS THE ARMY, released by Warner Bros. in 1943. Most, if not all, the selections appear to be lifted (poorly) right off a release print of the movie. The sound is often noisy and unintelligible. There are bits of dialog along with sound effects which interfere with the music. Too bad better source materials could not be located to prepare an official CD.

One plus: this CD contains the complete song THE ARMY'S MADE A MAN OUT OF ME which, was apparently cut from most or all prints following initial release. Where did the CD producers obtain this song? It must have come off a print as it is preceded and ends with audience applause as do the other selections on this CD. The cut song is not included in the recent Warner Home Video re-mastered DVD. However, you can see a glimpse of it in the trailer.

This is an excellent, memorable Berlin score with Oscar winning (deserved) Ray Heindorf musical supervision, which would easily rate 5 stars with a first rate presentation, unfortunately not given here.
