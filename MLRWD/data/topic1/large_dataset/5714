To me....this made absolutely no sense..........

I will never understand how anyone could have possibly considered this particular movie a candidate for Amazon Gay Pride. This movie is nothing short of suspense, and heterosexual dialog, scene after scene after scene. Where...do they see anyone in this movie engaging in any homosexual conduct??? I, as a lesbian, went to purchase a movie within said sale, only to find this movie, one of my classic favorites, wedged inside of said sale, and was shocked.

This is not a Gay flick, nor would anyone in their right mind, who has actually seen it, assume it to be. Maybe the poor soul was merely looking at the title. "Silly ole' bear", it's just a title, describing the stalking of one woman hell-bent on insidiously dethroning a famous  Hollywood actress merely for the glamour and glitter that she desperately craved, not summing up the sexual ramifications of a sorted love affair between two lesbians.

I could have accepted The Children's Hour, Frasier, The Ellen DeGeneres show, 9 1/2 Weeks, even The Odd couple, due to the gay scenes or actors present in these flicks...but this is never doable. Please Amazon screen your sales selections better. At least, make them watch the movie, before selecting it as part of Gay Pride.
