When I first saw this film in the theatres, I was a teenager. Many aspects of the film scared me, and I wasn't sure I liked it very much at that time. Now years later, I caught part of the movie on T.V., causing my interest to come back. So much so that I searched high and low for the video. I rented it, loved it, and watched it many times over the course of the week. When trying to buy the film, I found out it was out of print, but was told to try amazon.com. What luck, I found it and purchased it! This is truly a wonderful film, and for those who find the opening scenes too horrible to watch, I urge you to watch this film until the VERY end. Even though the plot is somewhat strange, it flows nicely and is quite intriguing. Also the performers are fantastic. Unfortunately, I have yet to see the principal actors in anything else. Nicholas Rowe is a perfect Holmes, and Alan Cox is a winning and amuzing Watson. I love the references to Holmes later life; the pipe, cloak, being a bachelor, etc. And the humor and suspense are top rate. Give this film a try, it is truly one of the best action mysteries I have ever seen--too bad it was not a box office hit and is so scarce to find!
