I took my sister to see this movie, and I ended up loving it!  
It apparently took Wallace and Gromit four years to created this movie.  It was well worth it.  The claymation adds a lot of character to the movie, and it looks so much better.
The story is cute, but entertaining for everyone.  It's written on two levels so that everyone will like it.  There are scenes that little kids think are funny, and there are hilarious jokes that fly over their head.  The plot is interesting and well-written, the "characters" have definite personality traits and defining characteristics, and you will find yourself attatched to them.  I actually got excited in the movie and nervous about the outcome, and found myself pulling for these clay chickens!
The fact that it is British is icing on the cake.  I love british accents.  I think that is so cool.
This is truly a quality movie.  In everything, from the anmation to the story to the characters, the time and effort put into this movie is apparent.  Dankesch&ouml;n, Wallace and Gromit.
