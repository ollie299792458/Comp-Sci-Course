Matchstick men in an enjoyable movie in which Nicholas Cage plays the obsessive compulsive Con Artist Roy. He and his "business" partner Frank make their livings conning unsuspecting people into forking over cash in exchange for a crappy product and a tax free car... After mastering that they move on to even bigger cons...

Roy had been seeing a doctor for his obsessive compulsive tendencies and that doctor was giving him medicine illegally, one day Ron drops the medicine down the drain, calls the doctor for more only to find out that the doctor has packed up and skipped town... Now Roy must see a shrink in order to get help, so his "business" partner Frank sets up and appointment for him with a shrink he found.

Roy begins seeing the shrink and talking about his life, and the last relationship he had, fourteen years before. He was with a woman who left him after finding out she was pregnant, so he never got to meet his child... the doctor suggests he contact the woman and try to meet his kid but he is to nervous and begs the doctor to contact her....

So the doctor calls the woman and tells Roy that she doesn't want to see or speak to him but his fourteen year old daughter Angela is dying to meet him....

So begins his father daughter relationship with Angela. She begins spending tons of time with him and even follows him along and helps with some of his cons...

While his new found relationship is great we watch Roy's life crumble around him...

This movie is a great funny, heartbreaking, and semi-action packed film. Dealing with family, friendship, betrayal and more I recommend this to anyone looking for a movie with a stupendous plot twist...
