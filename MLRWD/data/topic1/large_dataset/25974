What this movie had in action it lacked in heart.
This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by a Pixar film.
I tend to write to what emotions were evoked or what about the film I enjoyed rather than plot points so I will primarily stick to the same here with some interjections regarding theme.
This was mostly a "spy" movie.  Great animation, excellent voice acting all of the technical wonders that Pixar can bring to the screen.
The plot was decent, but a little advanced for most kids 8 or under.
Guns...lots of guns.  Yeah, I know that they are not people, but kids get the inference.  "Things" get shot, in that they are animated and infused with persona, "things" die.  Not suitable for a G-rated film.  Not suitable for my child.
Lastly and most important-where was the heart and soul present in all other Pixar films?!  There was kind of a broad message about staying true to yourself and your friends, but this was tucked away with jokes from Mater (Larry the Cable guy) and an almost absent Lightning McQueen who is not the protagonist of this film.
I came away heartbroken.  My just seven-year old son said it best; when asked which one he liked best "Cars" or "Cars 2" he noted "Cars 2" because it had so much more action.  Of course he did.  He does not usually get to see guns blazing or perpetual motion in his movies.
I give this movie a 2-star rating based on some great animation and use of technology with a decent story, but take away so much for missing what Pixar has always provided-A message, a real story and true heart.
