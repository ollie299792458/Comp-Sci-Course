These days more people, as we are commonly used to, end up one way or the
 other in a mental hospital. Normally a fatal burnout on the job which
 escalates gets you right in there. Yeah, i have seen a mental hospital from
 inside some time ago. Watching Gothika, with this knowledge in mind, makes
 the screen writer a winner from the start.

 The actual result is quite good, but one senses that the movie team had to
 catch the late night train to the Oscar elections in Vegas, before finishing
 this movie. Certain things should have been given more detail. The really
 fast ending was like pulling the power cord out of your DVD player while the
 credit titles were still rolling.

 The cast makes up 200% for this, especially Halle Berry of course. Now lets
 try to compare Gothika to a real world mental hospital. Well it indeed all
 matters if the director/warden is a good guy. If he's a bad ass, walking
 around with gothik tattoo's displaying women in flames, the writers script
 might not be a total unrealistic story.

 Always keep in mind, and never forget this, i've been there, experienced it,
 these medical dudes can juice you up with injections, any which way you don't
 like. Seeing a occasional ghost do a fly-by ain't nothing in such a scenario.
 Actually in the movie Penelope Cruz was given her monthly shot, after which
 the "devil" with tattoo had his free ride in her cell.

 Now to question why such a high profile casting was introduced in this movie?
 I don't know. Maybe in a couple of years, if such FBI cases do exist and get
 released in the open, we might know more.
