Beneath the 12-mile Reef, 1953 film

The movie starts by showing boats on an ocean. This is the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida. Sponge fishermen have a dangerous occupation gathering sponges from the ocean floor. [This explains why natural sponges are so expensive.] Their catch is auctioned off. The best sponges are in dangerous waters. They pay off part of a loan. There is a ceremony in retrieving a cross thrown into the sea. [Some tie a string nowadays to aid in its retrieval.] Sponges are becoming scarce, so they try a new area. They are successful, but meet their competitors and are ordered away without their sponges. They will take care of this by themselves. Will there be trouble? The arrival of the police creates calm. [Note the wearing of knives.] Are there bad feelings between the Conks and the Greeks? There is a fist fight.

Mike will fish the 12-mile reef for sponges. The harvest should be much better. But there was an accident. A too rapid rise from deep water causes "the bends" (nitrogen bubbles in the blood). Ice is used as an emergency treatment Is it too late? "I'm sorry." Will their sponges be stolen? A fire on the boat creates danger and damages their boat. Arnold assumed those sponges were from their area. Another man took most of the sponges. Arnold beats up Tony and tells him to stay away. Gwyneth goes to Tony. Can they get a load of sponges to sell and repair their boat? Tony talks to the money lender about supplies for sponge fishing. Gwyneth goes with Tony out to sea. Beneath the sea Tony harvests sponges. What will the octopus do? Another boat draws near - more trouble again. But Tony shows his good character in saving Arnold. "He's alright."

This is an interesting story about the sponge fisherman on the west coast of Florida. [But why do they all talk like Yankees?] I wonder if this movie was the inspiration for "West Side Story"? Overall, its average but educates you about sponge fishing.
