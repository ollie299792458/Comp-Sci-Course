Like most people who had read the book and anxiously awaited the movie release I felt betrayed after going to the theater and viewing the film.  As I left the theater I along with others who had read the book were complaining about how they (Hollywood) ruined a great suspense novel.  However, the friend I had gone to see the film with seemed to have really enjoyed the film.  I couldn't understand how, but then he had not read the book.  
A few months later I had the opportunity to view the film again at the cheap seats and to my surprise I found myself entertained.  This time around I quit comparing the book and the movie and just watched and it wasn't have bad.  
After talking to others who have read the book and were initially disappointed with the film I have come to the following conclusion.  While almost everyone who has read it believes that the book is a much better story than the movie, the movie isn't half bad if you can quit comparing every change.  Of course you still notice the changes but don't spend as much time dwelling on the changes while watching the film.
I hope that Hollywood makes Grisham's THE PARTNER into a movie, it is as good as if not better than THE FIRM.  I also hope they stick to the original story this time.
