An impressive work of craftmanship: fluent and though-provoking story, beautiful photography and excellent acting. Michael Caine in particular is breathtaking as world-weary journalist, Tom Fowler, in love with a lovely young Vietnamese, Phoung. It is a measure of his performance that a preference of Phoung for him rather for a much younger American, played by Brendan Fraser, appears entirely credible.

And yet the film leaves me with a sense of a malaise. This is not so much because for all his charm and professionalism, Fowler is a deeply flawed persona, who ends by up mortally betraying somebody whom he claims to be his friend. This ambiguity is at the heart of the Greene's book and the very seductiveness of Michael Caine makes it more salient. No, my problem is with the Hollywood twist: introduction, at the end of the movie, of a seemingly innocuous sequence, which is not only anachronistic in relation to the book but also gratuitously moralizing and oversimplifying. As if they did not believe in the force of Caine's perfomance, the film producers make Fowler not only stay forever in Vietnam but also file dispatches (shown with end credits)that record various steps of US involvement, ending with Tet offensive. In this way, producers apparently hoped to kill two birds with one stone: first, to show the extent of Fowler's redemption; second, to draw a parallel with Iraq. They only succeeded in demonstrating the persistence of old Hollywood tricks (who really had a final cut on this movie?) and the strength of more recent liberal prejudices (Irak will be like Vietnam, get it?).
