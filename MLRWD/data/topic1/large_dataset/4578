I bought the original book version of Neverwhere some years ago and was intrigued by the characters, setting and story. When I found out they had created a BBC mini-series of the book, I immediately went out and bought it.
Suffice to say I was not dissapointed. The cast, though mostly made up of unknown actors (perhaps more so to American audiences), is supurbly done, each person fitting their role just as you might imagine if you had read the book. This series is also a testiment to the fact that not everything good has a million dollar budget and high tech special effects. The effects that do appear, though low in quality are so uniquely done that you never laugh because they blend in.
The costumes are subtle but still unusual and surprisingly the script follows the original story very well. The opening and ending credits, done by Gaiman's long time collaberator, Dave McKean are simply beautifuly when accompanied by the music talents of Brian Eno.
The closest series I could recommend that has a similar feeling would be Lexx (though where Neverwhere is an urban fantasy, Lexx is a science fiction fantasy). If you like odd plots, interesting but quirky characters and dark visuals, or even if your a fan of The Sandman comics or Neil Gaiman's books, then you'll like this series.
