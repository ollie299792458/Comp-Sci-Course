This is a thinking man's action picture. If you simply want to be entertained, it's not for you. Huge difference between a film not being "for you" and it being a bad film though.

In essence, it's an exploration of ego. Deeper explanations would ruin the movie for you. There's plenty of shooting and interesting crime world characters. I think what makes people uncomfortable with the movie is two things. 1- They're caught up in their ego and don't want to admit it. 2- It's just not a straightforward formulaic Hollywood flik. It's just not.  3- They don't "get" it.

I hate it when I don't get a movie and don't know where to turn at the end too, but the director deals with this. When you're done watching the  film, stay for the credits and listen carefully, it's spelled out for you. Repeated viewings and director commentary reveal the film on additional levels.

Some say it's a pretentious film, but that isn't true either, not by definition of the word. It doesn't come across as trying to appear more important than it is. In fact, the struggle of the ego, whether internal or external, is THE most important battle any of us faces. Ego maturity is directly related to whether and how we evolve, learn or grow. Honestly, what in your life is more important to you than you?

Jason Statham dug a little deeper than usual for this performance. Andre 3000 was a little bland in line delivery, but in overall portrayal, awesome. Lots of good lines in here too. But take note that the books it claims to quote from or reference don't all exist.

See this when you're feeling introspective, or when you're ready to take your exploration of self to the next level. It's got high replay value as well, every time I see it I learn something new about myself and notice things I didn't see before.
