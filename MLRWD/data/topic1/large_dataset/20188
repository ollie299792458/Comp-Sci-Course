I have long enjoyed the film One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.  the special endition release of this film on dvd in 5.1 channel sound at long last does justice to this  movie.  the sound is exquizitly suttle in the sarround channels which are not used very heavily in this presentation; however, they don't need to be as this film is primarily an indoor film and therefore does not need to rely heavily on the use of the ombiance channels.
The comintary provided by Milos Forman, Michael Duglous and Sol Zants is perhaps one of the most information filled and inlightening comintaries I have heard on a dvd.
Being a totally blind person, I can not comment on the pictoral aspect of the film; however, I'm sure it lives up to the high standards set by the dvd format.
Here is a tip for blind purchacers of this dvd:
From the start of the long piece of music after the disk loads, press the down arrow twice then press enter.  After that, press down arrow once then press enter.  After the start of the music, press enter again.  This gets you to the commentary.  To get to the french version, press the down arrow three times rather than twice.  To start playback from the disk load, press enter at the start of the long piece of music.
I simpley can not say enough good things about the way in which this dvd has been rpesneted!... It is very well worth what you'll pay for it!...
