<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITV92">All the King's Men</a> This is a must see movie! It packs a powerful punch when it comes to showing what politics and power can do to the most honest of people. Willie Stark had great ideas and great intentions. He also brought about some necessary changes to his community and state. Somewhere along the line though, the corruptness that surrounded him eventually tainted him and drew him into it's web.

Broderick Crawford gave an outstanding performance in this film, as well as the rest of the cast. Their characters flowed out of them effortlessly with no detection of "acting," meaning, they were in the skin of their characters and actually living their characters, not just reading lines and moving around for the cameras.

I only wish there were more actors like Broderick today. Now there is someone who didn't need a lot of special effects, or fluff n stuff. He was a real actor who knew his craft well enough that any character he did just seemed to flow out of him effortlessly.
