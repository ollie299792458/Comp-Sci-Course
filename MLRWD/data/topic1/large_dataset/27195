This fascinating documentary records the evolution of a collection of camps known to most of us as simply Auschwitz. It contrasts some of the other camps, but it is primarily just about Auschwitz and how and from where the prisoners came to be there.  The documentary details how what started out as a facility primarily for political prisoners and forced labor grew through trial and error into an efficient killing machine.

Why I rated this with five stars:  The focus on the managers who made it happen rather than the top level of the Nazi party; the interviews with the perpetrators; the explanation of the variety of victims sent there, and the discussion of the resistance and/or complicity of the non-Nazi governments.

I have been to the Bergen-Belsen Memorial -- it is chilling how little space is required to bury 2,000 or 5,000 or an unknown number of thousands of bodies (some of whom were transported there from Auschwitz at the end).  If, as Eisenhower feared, anyone reading this ever encounters a person who does believe the truth of the Nazi policy of mass murder, make them watch this and the PBS DVD, "Frontline -- Memory of the Camps."
