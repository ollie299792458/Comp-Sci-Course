After reading the biography of disco-superstar 'Sylvester' this summer I was intrigued about a mention of 'the mayor of castro street' and I went to a screening of 'The Times of Harvey Milk' here in London. The film, released here fully and lovingly restored (with a whole other disc of extras) is something everyone (gay or otherwise) should see. This Oscar-winning documentary pieces together like an aids quilt the inspiring and tragic story of Harvey Milk, who was a beacon of hope and a brave leader in the then fledgling fight for gay and lesbian equality. Its an incredible tale and one you will need a box of kleenex for, it's one that many of the younger 'friends of dorothy' should see as it will school you on the battles fought and now perhaps, sadly taken for granted. Incidently, if you get this handsome volume you will be in good company as no-doubt Mr. Sean Penn is studying all those 'harvey-isms' as he will be starring in the up-coming bio-pic directed by Gus Van-Sant. What else can i say about this film except that i'm very pround to own it and that its narrarated by Harvey Fierstein and is scored by a then un-known Mark Isham. It's one that you will no-doubt lend out to friend's regardless of their orientation because as you will see Harvey championed the right of every minority in a time when that was a very radical concept. p.s. a friend of mine saw this film when it was released and it moved him to tears (lots of them) and he came out of the closet.
