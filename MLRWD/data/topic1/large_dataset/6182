I first saw these programs on Disney. I was struck with the star of the shows which was not an actor but the scenery. The time period costumes are absolutely beautiful and it makes one want to be able to dress in such rich fabrics and such flattering patterns.

The story is about Sarah Stanley who was raised by her nanny and her wealthy father in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Her father, who due to unjust business troubles, must protect his daughter from the unsavory publicity and decides to send her to live with her dead mother's family in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

The King family are still grieving their dead sister's loss and blame Mr. Stanley for her death and for taking her away from them when they married. When Sarah comes to live and learn about her mother's youth the healing begins to heal within all of the family members.

Sarah comes to live with her spinster school teacher, Aunt Heddy and writer, Aunt Lydia. As they become comfortable with each other they realize they are all very much alike. After being an indulged, only child, she must learn to get along with her King cousins who are not so happy to welcome a newby into the fold who is perceived as the new competition in town let alone the tight knit family. The character developments are wonderful and you are drawn into the King family yourself.

The adventures are wonderfully fresh and fun. The other part that I also notice is the simplicity of life that is also rich in the materials that they wore, tools that were used, the educations that were taught with so much discipline and homes that they lived in. Come enter a time long past.
