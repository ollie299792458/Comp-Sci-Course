I purchased this for my 4 year old granddaughter, Catherine (a.k.a. the Princess). She owns everything "Barbie," and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I buy new Barbies for her every week.  When she heard in August that this video was being released in September, she asked if I would buy it for her.  She then marked the days on a calendar so she knew when it would arrive, and when it did arrive on Tuesday, September 13, she watched it immediately.  She has now watched it at least 5 times and it's only Thursday.  Not only does she love it, but even her 7 year old sister enjoyed it too.  I like all the Barbie movies because I know they are free of bad language and inappropriate situations.  When she arrives this weekend, I know I will have to watch this with her at least 3 times, but that's OK because it will be a change from her last Barbie movie that I have watched about 50 times.  She is simply enthralled with Barbie.  So if you have a little Barbie fan in your home, order this with confidence because it is certain to entertain.
