I absolutely just love this movie but I gave it only 2 stars because of the song change during the dance scene.  As the person before me pointed out,  in the original version, the song was "I Love the Nightlife."  The dancing was choreographed to that song only and the song that is played does not go with the dance.  I was highly disappointed as this was perhaps my favorite scene out of the entire movie.  I'm sure that somehow they lost the right to use that song in the DVD, but when I saw that scene my heart sank and I actually don't like to watch it now because of that.  It's a black mark that nearly ruins the movie for me.

Other than that change, I can think of no other reason not to get this movie on DVD.  The movie is just one laugh after the next so please do get it if that change does not bother you.  For me, it's very hard to get past.  I would love to see "I love the Night Life" make it back onto another release of this.  It would get 5 stars if that song would be put in where it's supposed to be.
