The Prophecy is a tale of warring angels and the humans who are involved with a particularly nasty event within it; Gabriel (Walken, in a typically excellent performance) is seeking a secret weapon to break the war's deadlock, and won't let anyone get in his way.

This film gets a solid 'A' for effort, and for taking on a subject matter way, way beyond its limited budget.  On the flip side, it's funereally paced, and sometimes it chooses to be darkly comic instead of dramatic.

Also puzzling to me is the nature of the secret weapon (minor spoiler, nothing earth-shattering).  It's the soul of the perfect killer, which good angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) passes on to a young girl (Moriah Shining Dawn Snyder) to hide it from Gabriel.

Huh?  The perfect killer is a psychotic Korean War vet?  Aside from being somewhat slanderous to veterans, it's also a real head-scratcher.  Without raising nary a bead of sweat I suspect most of us could think of a few past world conquerors, dictators, or serial/mass murderers who would contend for the crown of 'the perfect killer'.

All in all, an oddball offering which is still worth your time on a rental.
