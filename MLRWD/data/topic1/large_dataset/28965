I first read this story when it was published many years ago. I'm pleased to report that the filmmakers rendered it cinematically in much the way I imagined it, with a few insignificant differences.
The most telling aspects of this film were the revelations-always reinventing the wheel, after a fashion-that we are condemned to be creatures of habit. Ritual makes us, all of us, what we purport to be and the goings-on in this story lay it bare. Of course, this is what gives it such hilarity, beginning with the title and ending with the last words spoken. Only H.L.Mencken said it better, in "In Defense of Women".....But read it for yourselves, then watch the film again.
While the story is not improbable, aside from the telepathic dog, one would be better suited to accepting the apocalyptic premises if one had already had plenty of experience (and a great sense of droll humor...)practicing suspending disbelief in entertaining any such fiction.
Is it rife with Oscar performances? Maybe not, but I don't think the director intended to win any prizes-just produce something that was, as I imagine the author intended, thought-provoking.
