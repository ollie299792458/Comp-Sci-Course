I have had the movie on VHS since it first came out!! I had a couple of friends come over and we decided we wanted to watch The "Wraith" I said that sounds like a plan!! beings we have not seen it for such a long time! I put the tape in, Cracked open my beer!! (MGD of course) we started to watch the movie! We got halfway thru it and the VCR decided to start crinkling the tape to a point, it snapped!!! Stretched it out and broke the tape!!!!!!!!! OHH I WAS FURIOUS!!!!!!! I have always cleaned the tape path of my VCR!! and not by just sticking a tape cleaner and calling it done!!! NO WAY I took the cover off and cleaned the entire path and stuck new bands on it as well!! thats how it lasted me ever since The "Wraith" came out!!! Thats why now I seen it was on DVD? I knew I had to have it!!!! I didnt care How much it cost!! I wanted it!! I give this movie 10,000 stars if you were able too!! AMAZON!!!!had Just like they have everything else!! I will never shop anywhere else EXCEPT RIGHT HERE!!!! AMAZON.COM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "The Wraith" Buy this movie before its gone!! it's already out of print!! EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!
