Ugetsu is certainly a classic piece of Japanese film but to say it's "one of the best films of all time" goes too far.

Ugetsu does two things: it portrays the plight of the peasantry and tells a ghost story. The problem is that the two halves of the film don't congeal into much of a message or statement. A bunch of stuff happens in Ugetsu but on the whole it's not as complete a work as the better Kurosawa films.

The Criterion edition has a marvelous transfer, but the film has not aged all that well. The relatively modest special effects and camera work often make it seem like you're watching a play, rather than a film-- a character flicks on a match and the room becomes illuminated, obviously by lightbulbs. Parts of the river sequence are too obviously shot in a studio. The ghost woman looks less like a ghost than a woman in white makeup.

Again, Ugetsu is a good film of its time, and definitely worth a watch, but let's not over-praise it just because of its age.
