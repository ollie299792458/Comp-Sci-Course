If you watch only one version of A Christmas Carol, this should be it.  The fact that it was shot entirely on location in England gives a great sense of realism.  Also, the characters are superbly cast.  George C. Scott will remain, at least for me, the actor I think of when I think of Ebeneezer Scrooge.

The faithfulness to the text is also evident.  Scrooge becomes less a man to be feared than one to be pitied.  It isn't that he is angry with the world as in other versions, is is more that he is missing so much.  When he puts his arms around his nephew and his wife and says, "God forgive me for the time I've wasted," tears come to my eyes, even after 22 seasons of watching.

The interplay between Scrooge and Belle are interesting.  You get the impression that they should have been married and would have been very happy except that Scrooge was in love with money and not her.  When she walks away, I want to scream at him.

You can watch other movies at Christmas, but if you want to be moved, watch this version of A Christmas Carol.
