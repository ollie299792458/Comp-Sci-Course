My personal favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson's films, Hard Eight quenches my thirst with a good twist and ending.  Boogie Nights and Magnolia seemed to me to be primarily centered around the characters (which is great in it's own respect), but both movies left me wanting a bit more.  Philip Baker Hall stars this time as elderly lonesome gambler Sydney, who, for reasons unknown, helps two young confused kids find love and peace in the world.
  This film deals with issues of regret, guilt and self-redemption as Sydney's generosity and charity is not as selfless as it may seem.  And so we follow the daily lives of Sydney and these young adults, as their neuroses guide them into very unique situations which brilliantly outline the chaos they feel in their lives.  The characters are sad, realistic, and evoke empathy from the viewer simply on maintaining their everyday lives.
  The question that is raised is whether or not personal guilt of the past can ever be abolished by performing acts of kindness in the present. Can a man redeem his character even when he is in his 70's, or have his bad choices set the tone for his existence? Is covering up the past while refusing to deal with it head-on a detrimental decision? These questions are left unanswered in this compelling story of a lonely old man's attempt to clear his conscience.
