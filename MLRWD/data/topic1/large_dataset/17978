I purchased this item (and the entire series) as a Collector's Edition because I was hesitant to buy the Quadrilogy (due to the rumored compression errors).

I'm rating this 4 out of 5 stars because of the packaging, which is a flimsy digipak.

A cardboard flap on the right holds the booklet inside the inner sleeve.  The discs themselves snap into plastic cases glued to the back of the cardboard sleeve, which folds up like a letter that slides into the main case.

The biggest annoyance to the packaging is that the back of each sleeve is covered in a piece of artwork printed on a flimsy sheet of paper that's glued to the back of the it and held in place by a gob of adhesive.  This actually came off when I tried to pull the DVD sleeve out.

As for playback, it wasn't flawless (to my immediate dismay).  After 53:32, disc 7 skipped while playing the Special Edition of the movie.  The DVD continued to spin in my player until I hit stop.  I then re-loaded the disc and selected the same scene ("Ripley Comes Through"), let it play up to the same point, and never encountered the problem again.  I actually played the scene three additional times without it skipping so I suspect it has something to do with how the DVD was mastered, because it seems like there's a slight jump at 53:33.

I hadn't seen this movie in a long time and it was better than I remembered, especially with the new 8 minutes of additional footage (which contains an alternate opening sequence and ending).

Disc Two seemed to play fine, as I watched about 6 of the documentaries.  My favorite was "In The Zone:  The Basketball Scene."

Despite the shoddy packaging, the 2003 cut of Alien Resurrection is well worth the purchase alone.
