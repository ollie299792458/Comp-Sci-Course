Serendipity: noun: faculty of making fortunate discoveries  by accident.

What a clever title to a movie. I love it!!! So clever. I didn't know serendipity was a real word. I'm so glad it is. I saw 'Serendipity' and loved every second of it! I can totally relate to it, or at the very least dream that something like this could really be possible for people anywhere.

Two people meet who seem so perfect for each other, are put to the ultimate test. Is it really their destiny to be together or just a fleeting romantic attraction that was never really meant to be?

To test fate and destiny, Jonathan (John Cusack) is persuaded by Sara (Kate Beckinsale), to write his phone number on a money note travelling from wallet and purse, in the hope of reaching her again. While Sara signs her name and address in the front page of one of Jonathan's favorite books and sells the book to a bookshop by her in the hope he'll find it one day and be in contact again.

A pair of black cashmier gloves also take Jonathan and Sara's fancy - but are then split in two. One glove for each of them. Intended to spur each character on and never stop looking until they meet again and the pair of gloves match.

John Cusack is an ideal lead, and Kate Beckingsale is absolutely ravishing in this sweet, time driven, life altering tale.

One thing I noticed was they never asked each other what number each of them pressed in the lift. If they had I'm sure it would have been an even sweeter indication for them to decide if the time for them was right or wrong.

Serendipity is a movie that gives me a lot of hope. It warms my heart against the snow and I'd want to skate and dance on the ice with someone I love. Pull them close to whisper in their ear, hold them close, and breath in the purfume on their neck. This movie is nothing short of wonderful! For anyone who appreciates a charming romantic tale. I'd love to live in a serendipity world!
