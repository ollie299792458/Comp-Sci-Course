All I can say is WOW!  The picture and sound quality of this release are breathtaking.  Right from the first opening scene where Julie Andrews is  twirling on the mountain top as the camera moves in, you can actually make out tiny yellow and pink flowers in the grass!!!  The images are so sharp that the actual grain of the film can be seen.  This really makes you feel as though you are watching a film and not a video transfer.  I own several versions of this film (VHS, DVD & the old Laser Disc) and I can say this is a major leap forward.  The extras on disc two are quite nice.  I really enjoyed the bits about the technical aspect of restoring the film for hi def. I wished they had longer segments on that.

I did read the very few 1 star comments, most of which were from people who had yet to purchase the product.  It DOES indeed come with DVD and Blu Ray--this seems to be confusing people.  It comes with both.  Also someone posted being disappointed in the picture quality.  This is confusing as I wonder if this person actually watched it on a hi def TV or, like a friend of mine, was confused and not hooked up his blu ray player and HDTV using a HDMI cable?  I wonder. Either way, the film is amazing to look at in this format.  A large thanks to the talented people who restored such a precious piece of our cinema history.
