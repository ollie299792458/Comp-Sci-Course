This is a remake of a Japanese horror film, which I am completely in love with. I have One Missed Call, and One Missed Call 2. I have even seen One Missed Call Final. I really love this series. Needless to say, I almost pissed my pants when I heard this was being re-made.

Of course I didn't expect the remake to be half as good as the original, as I hope any who have seen it would. This movie wasn't scary, per say, but it did have a few shocking, and creepy moments. There are also a few things changed from the Japanese one. Of course these changes are minor and don't change the plot. Putting aside the fact that this is a remake, I still believe that this is a good movie.

I don't know why I liked this one so much; maybe it was my love for the Japanese one that helped? It isn't scary at all to me, but I thought it was just a good watch. People who want to be scared out of their pants prob want to stay away from this title. As for others who have seen the Japanese one, well it could go either way. Some will love it, some will hate it. Either way, I simply don't think it deserves as bad a rep as it's getting. I do think it's worth the watch at least once. If you don't want to buy it, I still suggest renting it.
