This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  He is doing everything in this movie.  You would expect him to be on a horse out West, well he is in Africa, not on safari but gathering up animals, with a lot of good actors and bringing you to the chair to sit and watch all the fun and danger in gathering them up for the zoos.  The little elephants and the one young girl in the movie makes it, as she is smart and also got her eye on John right off of the bat.  The elephants love her and she ends up with three elephants, and fun in trying to keep them fed, going out with the crew to capture others and not learning until the first trip that she should ride inside.  She even is good at dancing and playing the piano, but best of all, is teaching John how to kiss.  A darned good movie and I would never be without it in my DVD collection.  Thanks Amazon.com for having it on hand.  I purchased it and began watching it and have lent it out to others and they feel the same way.  Loving John Wayne in a whole new character.
He seems younger in this one, had to be to help corale these animals, especially the little monkeys that Red Buttons has a gimmick to capture and earn them alot of money.  Buy it, you will never be sorry and you will save it as I have.
