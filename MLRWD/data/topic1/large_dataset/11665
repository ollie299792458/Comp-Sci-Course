If you are a big movie buff and know about other movies and directors Brian De Palma is influenced by, you may think this movie is a joke (based on reviews I've seen here and elsewhere).  I think some film buffs who aren't that critical will love it though and general audiences who just watch movies as something fun to do will love it too. A snippet of a B movie with unrealistic naked girls (perfectly B movie unrealistic girls) opens the movie, (my mother got this movie through a movie club and immediately turned it off and gave it to me), but then we see that the opening is just a set up to introduce us to the characters. Quickly we are led into a completely different type of movie which has a bit of everything, a tense underwater rescue, a political assasination, corrupt cops (in a flashback scene), a bit of romance (nicely done without any makeout or sex scenes), a bit of insight to the seedy underbelly of society, a psychotic killer, and a beginners how-to in filmaking as the real heart of the movie. Many reviews harp on mistakes, "that character should have" moments and the ending they don't like. But I believe most first time viewers will see past all that. You'll want to watch it again (and there are things many will not pick up on the first time), just don't get hung up on the what if's and how comes.
