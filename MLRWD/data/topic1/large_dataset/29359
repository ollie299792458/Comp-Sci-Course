Thank you for Smoking is a subversive story about spin and the people who engage in it. Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, the spokesman for Big Tobacco, whose job is not so much to defend cigarettes as it is to descredit those who oppose them, which he does with great alacrity. William H. Macy is a crusading Senator who wants to put a skull and crossbones on every pack of cigarettes, whom Naylor shows to be in the pay of the cheese industry, which clogs arteries. Katie Holmes is the reporter who will do anything (and I mean anything) to get a story. The precoious Cameron Bright is Nick's son, who is increasingly admiring at his old man's skill at selling a product that kills 1200 people a day.

The story of Nick Naylor's rise (as he tries to get cigarettes back into the movies; the image of Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta Jones having a smoke after zero gravity sex in a scifi movie is an image that should have gone on the screen), his fall due to Katie Holme's reportage and an absurd kidnapping by anti tobacco terrorists, and his rise again is both instructive and entertaining. Recommended to all who want to see all sides of an important debate and laugh at them.
