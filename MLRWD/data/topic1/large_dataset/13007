In essence, this is a real-time war movie with minimal editorializing* and no detectable post-modern storytelling gimmicks. The movie that comes closest to it in spirit (to my mind) is "Black Hawk Down". Only the actions of adversaries are portrayed; motives are not explained. The movie's main objective is to try to answer: "What happened aboard the plane?"

(*The only editorializing I could discern was the inclusion of a male character with a German-like accent urging the other passengers of 93 to just follow the hijackers' instructions.)

The DVD comes with insightful commentary by the director, particulary on the nature of organizational 'systems' and the snags in their attempts to communicate with each other expediently and process what is going on.

Those aboard United 93, he notes, were among the first people forced to answer the question, "What do we do now?" In a striking remark that draws a parallel between the battle for the cockpit of United 93 and the political maneuvering for "the world's controls" today, the director, in effect, asks, "What do we do now?"
