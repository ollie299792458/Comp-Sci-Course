I received this Season one pack yesterday. Disk#1 with episodes 1-3, turned out to be defective, unreadable, and would not play what so ever. Disks 2-5 are all okay. I am now in the process of returning this item for replacement.

This being the only reason I give this item 4 stars. The show itself as a whole, is most definetly 5 stars, and recommended highly to any Sci-Fi enthusiast.

As most have stated in previous posts, I sure hope they come out with other seasons shortly. I did however find a sponsored link from this site and other sites such as google sponsoring this site with the sale of a complete box set of seasons 1-7, below being the link....

I will wait a bit longer but I think I might say, &^%%$^%@, and buy this full set....its the only I could find on the web as being a sponsored site....I do not know however if these are cut versions of the original episodes.....it seems that other seasons from here or others just are not ever going to be released.

I hope this helps others, and again I would like to re-iterate that this show is very highly recommended, a five star most definetly; more stars if I could give it.
