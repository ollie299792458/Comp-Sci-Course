The film is wonderful: a flawless version of the Tempest. I'm glad I got it.

But I'm going to sell this rotten blu-ray disc the second I can get the DVD.

I've waited a year, and I got the blu-ray because I just couldn't stand to wait any longer for the DVD. The film on it is wonderful, but the blu-ray that carries the film is horrible: It fails to load promptly on my old player, and what it does slowly load is bloody awful advertising for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A8ZWUQ">Pirates of the Carribean</a>. What junk! The instructions displayed to skip around the advertising (which is not what I paid for) make this blu-ray hang up the player if I tap either of the 2 menu keys it says to use; the third key it doesn't say to tap aborts the junk. The blu-ray usually hangs-up the player on the second feature played, and it always hangs the player when I try to play the 'Los Angeles Rehearsal' feature. And of course, the blu-ray won't re-start where it was when I quit for an hour's break.

The problem is not the player, it's the studio's nasty java-based copy protection software embedded on the blu-ray disc. The recently-purchased David Attenborough '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PHSTWK">Madagascar</a>' blu-ray plays with no troubles (no java).

I recommend waiting for the DVD if you can stand it; the film is strikingly visual, but I don't think it needs to be high-res for the beauty of the film to come through. On the other hand, if you only will settle for blu-ray resolution, you can buy my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y5H5JM">this awful disc</a> very cheaply once <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M9ZI0M">'The Tempest' on DVD</a> is available.
