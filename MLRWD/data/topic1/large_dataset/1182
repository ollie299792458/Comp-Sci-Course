I LOVE the first BJD. It was brilliant. Great music, great writing, directing - all that.

This one? Not so much. The above "Amazon.com" review is 100% accurate. Colin is sexy as always, but Bridget is MOST unpleasant on the eyes. They made her all shiny and bulbous - hard to believe someone could look THAT BAD after only "6 weeks" since we last saw her. Especially someone who has found the love of her life and, if any difference, should only look better after only 6 weeks.

The quirky dialogue and social blunders so amusing in the first movie have been reduced to mere slapstick. Painful to watch.

Redeeming factors: Half-naked Colin! Also, and worth the price of the DVD, is the BONUS FEATURE where "Bridget" interviews Colin Firth. HILARIOUS! Seriously the funniest thing I've ever seen! A VERY accurate portrayal of Colin being interviewed by a breathing female anywhere, at any point in time. Makes me feel sorry for him, actually. Giggly, bothered things that we are. Always bringing up P&P and imagining him all wet...he's such a good sport.
