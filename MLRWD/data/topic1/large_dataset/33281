I don't think I have missed too many Clint Eastwood movies , in fact I go back to my teenage TV time and not missing an episode of "RAWHIDE," His name was Rowdy Yates and they were all on a cattle drive.
Blood Work isn't one of his best, but he did a great job. I was convinced he had an heart attack, in fact it was a little annoying, as I thought he was going to have a real one.  I imagine this is his swan song as far as shoot'em up run 'em down movies of his younger years. And why not! It would still be good to see him in any detective work, forensic or otherwise. A great actor! 
Craciella Rivers, 'Flawless, The Insider,' did a great job as the sister of the murdered girl and whose heart was given to Clint.  She tracks Clint (an x FBI agent) down and wants him to find the killer. The story drags a little and Paul Rodriques, city cop 'Ronoldo' display's his angst toward Clint and in another movie, Clint would have slapped him around, but instead he gets the last verbal shot at the raving Renoldo. Very funny scene. I was wondering what Angelica Houston , 'Buffalo 66 ,' Ever After-was doing in this small part as the Dr. taking care of Clint, but then remembered that Clint was a great friend of John Houston, Angelica's father! The plot will be transparent but if you like Eastwood in the raw then you must see this flick. I gave it a 3/5.
