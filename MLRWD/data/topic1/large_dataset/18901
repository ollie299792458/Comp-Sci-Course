Brad Pitt got most of the praise from this film for his portrayal of the demented son of a wealthy Bio-tech researcher. However, I think most people overlooked Willis' performance in this role. In my opinion this is one of the first films in which Bruce Willis shows just how good an actor he can be. Sure the Die Hard films had already cemented Willis as a movie star, but he pulls out all the stops here in Terry Gilliam's sci-fi genre bending flick. 
Willis shows us how good he is at being quiet and contemplative--something that went on to win him accolades in films like 6th SENSE. But Willis also brings this haunting sense of desperation and pain to his character which he hadn't shown in his work prior to 12 MONKEYS.
As for the DVD it's got the goods when it comes to extras. Fans of Terry Gilliam will be happiest as the documentary "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys" centers on Gilliam's vision for the film and takes you from pre-production meetings about set designs all the way to Gilliam's publicity tour to promote the film's release.
Great story (with an ending filled with so many subtle twists that it still causes much debate on Internet BBS), excellent performances, and outstanding camera work by the director and cinematographer. 12 MONKEYS is a must have for any DVD collection.
