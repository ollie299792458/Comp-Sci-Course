Any review of this movie that calls it out as being bad, would be dead on.  I'm not sure how anybody can watch this and decide it ranks as 5 stars.  If this doesn't strike you as over the top creepy when a guy working the night shift at a small hotel, then stalks and finds an attractive guest on the other side of the country, I'm not sure what to tell you... I do think you should probably talk to a counselor, or possibly the police.  It felt like Zahn's character should have had human body parts in his refrigerator or carving images of Charley Manson into his skin with a safety pin.  That Aniston's character allowed that creeper into her highly competitive and cold corporate life is COMPLETELY out of character.  I'm just amazed she read this script and decided it was a good call to be a part of this project.  I'm sure there were a lot of zeros behind whatever number was offered to her.  Or it was some sort of hostage negotiation deal worked out we will never know about.

The script if terrible, the acting droll, the story horrendous, and the outcome shameful.  Don't see this movie.  Please don't see this movie.  As for buying it, I'm sure there are plenty of weirdos out there holding hope they can chase a 10 across the country, offer her nothing, and still come away with the girl in the end.  Stalking isn't weird if it works, right?  If you answered "right" to that question, then this movie is for you.  So is the affection afforded by your dog thanks to peanut butter, but you already knew that.

Just...terrible...
