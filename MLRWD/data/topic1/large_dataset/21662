Britney Spears can act.  Maybe not yet at the level where she will be getting any gold trophies to go next to the music awards, but she can hold her own in front of the camera.  In fact, this film almost tries to help her out too much, as if she is not able to handle the material on her own.  You can't go 10 minutes without a)seeing Britney in some skimpy outfit or b) hearing her sing or c) both.
If she were not able to handle the role, these things would be necessary.  Then the audience would not have to realize they are watching a no-talent hack.  But that is not the case here.  What's possibly most impressive is that the script is nothing special at all, yet the movie is touching and real.
Spears stars as Lucy, class valedictorian and beauty who has lost touch with her two best friends over the years.  On their graduation night, they agreed to dig up the time capsule they buried together when they were 10.  None really want to do it, but they all meet at the place and see what their dreams were at the time.  
One of her friends (Mimi) had the ambition to have the world and she sees herself succeeding in music.  She is heading to LA for an audition in a couple of days and invites her friends to go.  Each girl has her own agenda and reason to go west, so they pile into the car of a local hunk for a ride and head off.
A few things almost always happen on trips like this (breakdown, amorous feelings between two of the passengers) which makes it seem that this movie is predictable and has nothing to offer.  Not so.  The characters and acting are superb and the story has enough turns to make it interesting.
I am looking forward to seeing Britney in another movie.  This was not Schindler's List by any means, yet she was a reason to watch and not just because of her beauty.  Like I said, they could have toned that down a lot and let her act.  She was very good, time for an encore.
