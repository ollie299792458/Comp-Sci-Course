"Alien" is one of the scariest films in the history of modern and classic cinema. The plot goes great with both those old 50's movies and today's slasher films. The creature itself is not totally shown to the very  end of the film... but thats not as bad as it sounds. It's made up of a  great plot where all the crew fears for their lives and an all around  enjoyable to watch film. Those little face huggers are so cool, that I  bought a full size version from "Kenner Toys"! Ripley is one of  the screens greatest heroines (so good that "The Disney MGM  Studios" made an entire sequence with Ripley and the Alien on  "The Great Movie Ride").  When the one and only alien finally  totally shows itself... it's one of the scariest monsters that I have ever  seen. It's long, black head and striking inner mouth are some of the best  effects for the 70's, and those effects still are great today! It's much  better than all it's sequals but, "Aliens" is really cool too!
