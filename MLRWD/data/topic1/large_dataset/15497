The sequel that should have never been. This movie lacks everything that James Cameron put into Terminator 2....plot development, charachter development, and somethign that makes you actually give a damn about the charachters. Both Furlong and Hamilton refused the parts unles Cameron directed it which was a very wise move.
  first, the story: Terminator 2 made it very clear that the ranchise was over....Bison was killed by swat officers, Skynet was destroyed, and the chip and the arm along with the terminator was also destroyed. No explanation during Terminator 3 was given to let the viewer know why judgement day has not been avoided.. it was just "postponed".
  The charachters: there was nothing in this movie that had you caring about the charachters. Arnolds acting was subpar compared to T2...where you actually believed he was a machine because of the way he spoke.

Here is how I would have done it:

T3 would be a prequel to T1 where they have the battle of the machines, conners role as a general in that battle, and so on. throw in the typical protaganist/hero struggle, and end the film with the terminator and Kyle Reese (?) being sent back to 1984. It would have been much more plausable then this film.

ugh...BAD
