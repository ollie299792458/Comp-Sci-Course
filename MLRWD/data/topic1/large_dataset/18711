Simon Birch has been reviewed by a plethora of folks. So--WHY do I write a 5-star review at this late date?  Simpley for the sake of the

quality of this film's acting, in and of itself.

To begin, what I speak of is the 1990s and 21st century phenomenon of Joe Mazzello. This film is the quintessential example of his always consistent and steady acting capabilities.  He and Ian Michael Smith (aka, Simon)carried this film beautifully in addition to TOP-notch performances by the superb David Strathairn, Oliver Platt, and Ashley Judd.

Joe Mazzello and Ian Michael Smith forge a chemistry in this film that is PALPABLE to a high degree!  Make no mistake.  It is a boy friendship as REAL and moving as the on-screen friendship between Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn.  You could almost feel the chemistry jump off the screen.  Oh yes.

Joe has continued to act and also is forging his path in Directing, whereas Ian has been enrolled at Massachusetts' inimitable MIT.  The scene of their embrace prior to the church bus leaving for the weekend trip was as REAL as it gets.  Joe's motto about acting is:  "Just make it look REAL!"  And Joe, Ian, and the supporting cast did JUST that!
