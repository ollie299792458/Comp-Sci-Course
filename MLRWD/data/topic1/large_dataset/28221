I saw this movie roughly when it came out and then a few more times on television.  Parts of its stayed with me--and yes it is Reeve's finest performance by far (the "first kiss" scene is among the top three in cinematic history in my book). The musical score is, well, haunting; it creates an aural impression of Romantic longing. Last summer I happened to be on Mackinac Island; I visited the Coin Shop by accident (no longer a coin shop, so definitely go in and check out the SIT memorabilia) and decided to see the movie again. It took two months but the Collector's Edition was in the local video store....

Yes, there are continuity flaws, yes there is the fantastic time-travel dynamic, yes there are the wrong umbrellas at the Grand Hotel for 1912, yes there is the canonical ending--BUT, not since Wagner's leibestod has there been a more powerful artistic expression of the love that transcends mortal temporality. One might call the film a guilty pleasure, but, well, they just don't make movies like this anymore--and it deserves to stay in circulation. It is, well...timeless. Definitely worth your time.
