Made in the 70's but set in the 60's, this film still entertains.
I first saw it at age 13 (about 5 times)  when it first came out and now watching it again it reminded me how I was introduced to some incredible music at a young age and how much I wanted to be just like those 16 year olds in the movie!  The soundtrack in particular has stayed me with ever since as one of the best collections of music from the late 50's and early 60's.  I can still remember the order of every song on my cassette.
Most memorable moments with the perfect matches with music include: At The Hop, Green Onions, Smoke Gets In Your Eyes....

Even though nothing radical really happens in the movie, the quality acting, directing and the sharp script together with the music keep you intrigued to the end. And the cars! Wow, how huge were they then! A Smart Car would have fitted in the boot of one.

Yes, It feels like a Hollywood movie with the Hollywood ending, but the journey is a great revisit of a long gone innocent era.  Teenagers seemed so naive then too....
This film will always be in the top 5 movies ever for me and mainly because of the soundtrack. However, it's fascinating to watch it after more than 30 years and see a super young Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford already showing signs of having that 'something' special that has made them all in to the stars that they are now.

A thoroughly wonderful trip down memory lane for anyone who wanted to rollerskate as a waitress or drive a hot rod while listening to Wolf Man Jack play awesome tunes.
