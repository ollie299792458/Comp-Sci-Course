.....Unfortunately this film was allowed to fall into Public Domain which resulted in many bad copies being on the market.  Most of the complaints of the reviewers concern the quality of the DVD transfer. I bought the REMASTERED DVD 2005, STUDIO [...].

.....The movie was shot on location in Key West and Tarpon Springs and was the third film to be released in CINEMASCOPE and the first to be shot underwater. The film received an award for the CINEMATOGRAPHER. The color was good and the underwater scenes were spectacular.

.....The second bad rap on the movie was to call it a ROMEO & JULIET love story which it was not.  It was a love story between a man and a woman from different backgrounds and did not have the passion or tragic climax of SHAKSPEARES CLASSIC.

....I think Director Robert Webb got a bad rap for his laid back direction of the love story.  I did not see it that way.  I think WEBB did a magnificient job of letting the love develop slowly from antagonists to lovers. Also he did a great job showing the hero worship of Tony (WAGNER) of his father Mike (ROLAND) Also the love of Tony's parents for each other and for their children.

.....I don't think the criticism of Wagner and Roland of not being "GREEK" enough was fair. I mean this was a movie and ANTHONY QUINN'S performance in "ZORBA THE GREEK" won this MEXICAN actor an Academy Award.

.....One of the most touching scenes in the movie was when Mike dies from the bends and a stunned Tony wanders off to find his fathers cap.  Gwyneth follows Tony at a discrete distance wanting to comfort him but afraid of intruding on his grief.  I think WEBB did a beautiful job developing the love story between these these two young actors who were both 24 and in the star development stage of their careers. As an aside, Moore was in the stable of HOWARD HUGHES harem of young starlets at this time and a jealous HUGHES kept close tabs on her to make sure she did not get involved with WAGNER.

.....The movie was loaded with strong character actors to back up the pairng of WAGNER & MOORE. GILBERT ROLAND who was once considered to be the successor of VALENTINO or GILBERT as the LATIN LOVER of the Silver Screen. J. CARROL NASH AS SOCRATES, RICHARD BOONE & PETER GRAVES who moved on to greater sucess in TV.

.....All in all I enjoyed this movie very much and I think its critics were looking for things they expected and were disappointed when they didn't find them. I could watch this movie once a week and still enjoy it.
