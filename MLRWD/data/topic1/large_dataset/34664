Positively chilling is the word that comes to mind when I watch Vosloo (Pik Van Cleef).  Vosloo plays the murderous henchman of Emil Fouchon (Lance Heriksen), who recruits homeless combat veterans for a deadly game of cat and mouse. Vosloo interviews rich "clients", who pay upwards of half a million dollars for the pleasure of hunting and killing these Vets, which our society has "forgotten" about. These henchmen then burn the dead bodies in abandoned building in order to make the killings look like freak accidents. They even have the town (New Orleans) medical examiner in their pockets.
The movie starts with a homeless man running for his life. He is being viscously hunted by a gang of henchmen, equipped with automatic weapons on the prowl. The hunter's goal is to reach the river before the henchmen and the paying "client" gets to him first.  Well they do get to him first and his death leads the police to undercover this secret "service".  The dead man's daughter, Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) along with Chance Boudreaux (Van Damme), seeks to find out what really happened. After Chance proves the death as a homicide, a new autopsy is ordered--which tips off the henchmen. They want to stop her and Chance but they have other ideas.
Van Damme and Butler do a good job on the run from the hunters. Van Damme's high-flying kicks and fight scenes are awesome. But it is Henriksen and the amazing Arnold Vosloo, who STEALES the SHOW! They are soooo baaaad you cheer them on throughout the film. Vosloo's performance is especially chilling as he expertly maintains a dignified yet heartless persona.
