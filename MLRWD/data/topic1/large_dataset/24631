The irony about this film is that the reason it is so well done, is a result of it not getting adequate advertising and promotion when it was released.

The horrible film "Quest for Camelot," was Warner's previous animated film, and it performed poorly at the box office.  They decided to shut down their feature animation department after The Iron Giant.  As such, none of the executives and "suits" at Warner concerned themselves with the Iron Giant.  They let Brad Bird complete his vision without the typical interference of an animation studio production, but they also did not set up any real promotion for the film.

By the time Warner Brothers realized what a gem they had, it was too late to advertise it properly, and it failed at the box office.

This film is one of my top 3 films of all time, and not just animated films.  It has emotion, heart, drama, tension and wonderful characters along with tremendous animation.

This is also one of the best examples of 3d computer animation being integrated with 2d cel animation.  The main character -- the Giant -- is a 3d computer animated character as in PIXAR's films, but everything and everyone else in the film is a 2d drawing like Disney animation.  The two styles are integrated seemlessly.
