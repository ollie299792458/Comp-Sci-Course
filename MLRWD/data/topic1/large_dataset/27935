First of all, this is not a review of the play, which is brilliant. My rating is solely based on the quality of the DVD, which I found to be very disappointing.
Criterion has made a name for itself by distributing good if not excellent quality versions of movies on DVD. Having said that, I would like to warn people that the audio quality of this DVD is an absolute disaster. I returned the first DVD thinking the reason the audio wouldn't play was because I received a bad disk. However, the replacement Amazon sent was just the same. If you purchase this DVD, you might be lucky enough to get it to work, but I think I can safely say that you will be very disappointed in the audio of this DVD.
Having looked at the reviews of this movie, I find it annoying that so many of them are based on the VHS tape version. (I suppose that when you click on 'See all customers reviews' it scans the entire database giving you everything related to this play.) This seems to be a disservice to someone looking for the quality of the media not the quality of the play.
