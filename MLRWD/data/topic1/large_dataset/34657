When widower President Andy Shephard meets feisty environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade the obvious happens -- they fall in love. What makes this movie a charmer is attention to detail: Sydney's encounter with the guard when she first goes to the White House, her sister's comment when she rejects the advances of the President ("He's handsome, intelligent, charming, funny and he's the leader of the Western World. Aren't our standards a little high?"), the riotous (and painfully realistic) futile attempts Shepard makes to personally send flowers to Sidney. 
There's a ring of honesty to the story that's rare in Hollywood movies today. Presumably Reiner and staff had plenty of opportunity to view the Clinton White House in action. It's too bad they didn't pay more attention to protocol. There is no way the President could/would have danced first with Sydney Wade at the dinner for the French Ambassador. Protocol demands that the President dance with the Ambassador's wife for the first dance...THEN he might have been free to choose Sydney. There were a couple of mistakes involving protocol that shouldn't have appeared but in all the movie is romantic, witty and vastly entertaining.
