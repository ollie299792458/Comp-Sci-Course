This is an old black and white movie with no action at all.  It takes place in a jury room, where an all-star cast is meeting to decide the fate of a young man accused of murder.

It looks like a slam dunk, and just about all of the jurors want to convict him and send him to the electric chair.  Only one man on the jury is unsure and he asks that they spend some time and talk about it before rushing to convict the man and send him to the electric chair.  He stands up to the hostility of the others who just want to get out of there and get on with their lives, but they start talking about the case and things get interesting.

While they talk it over, we learn all about the case and learn quite a bit about the jurors and what's making them vote one way or the other (other than the facts in the case itself).

I saw this movie when I was about 10 years old and didn't remember much about it.  When I found it on dvd I had to check it out, and I'm happy to say it was even better than I remembered it being.  The acting was excellent and so was the writing.
