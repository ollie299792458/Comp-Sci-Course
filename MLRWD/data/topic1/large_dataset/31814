I just finished watching the DVD of the Graduate.  When I first saw the film I was in my early teens, younger than Ben.  I saw it on the big screen in college, the same age as Ben. Now I'm in my 30s, older than Ben.  The movie stands the test of time.  I have to give it Five stars.  In fact, right after watching it, I had a desire to watch the whole thing again.  I don't think the movie will ever grow old!  (For those of you not familiar with the movie, it's about a young man who's just completed college.  He does not know what to do with his life.  He is seduced by the wife of his father's business partner.  Eventually he falls in love her daughter.  The sexcapades not withstanding, I think anyone can identify with not knowing what to do with your life.)The reason I only gave the movie 4 stars is because I was averaging it out with the DVD treatment.  I would give the DVD treatment 3 stars.  The DVD contains the extras that were added to the 25th Anniversary edition of the videotape.  They include a documentary, an interview with Dustin Hoffmann, and the movie trailer.  (The film is also in widescreen.)  For a videotape that would be in incredible.  I like DVDs with more extras.  If any DVD ever warranted a Director's Commentary, it's The Graduate.  Additionally, this DVD warranted a Music Only soundtrack.  Finally, the DVD had not been cleaned up.  There were glitches and spots on film.  I believe The Graduate deserves better.  Nevertheless, I do recommend it.  It's a timeless film.
