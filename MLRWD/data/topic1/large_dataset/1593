I was lucky enough to get a ticket to the sneak preview of "Miracle" because it was a sell out. It's about a coach (Kurt Russel) trying to mold the U.S Olympic team in 1980 into a family unit so they can beat the Russians. You don't have to be a sports fan to love this movie. Apart from the conflict among the team, the coach also faces trouble at home because he is a workaholic. The acting in this film is amazing. What's even more remarkable is that Disney didn't try to flood the film with big name stars, but hired actors for their talent. The woman who plays Kurt Russel's wife steals every scene she is in and you really feel for her. My eleven year old brother liked the film, but it does seem to be more for teens and adults. There's no crude humor, sexual or drug references, but it's just not something I can see kids getting real into. The cinematography was amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if it's nominated in that catagory for next years Oscar's. They invented a new camera for the ice and it is used real creativeley in a scene where it's zooming through all of this action during a game. That shot alone is worth seeing, but this really is an awsome movie.
