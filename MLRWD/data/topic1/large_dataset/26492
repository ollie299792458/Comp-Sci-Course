Ending with one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking endings ever filmed, Midnight Cowboy is on of the world's most unforgettable contemporary classics.
Though Dustin Hoffman's performance is alarmingly  similar (if only in terms of the voice) to his later performance in  "Rainman," it is one which deserved, entirely, it's Oscar  Nomination. He plays Rico "Ratzo" Rizo, a down and out bum on the  streets of The Big Apple. A character who finds sad hope in the dream of  someday shaking of the illness which cripples him and moving to Florida (a  fantasy played out with alarming alacrity by John Schlesinger). The hope is  so moving that one finds it impossible not to be inspired to the point  where you feel to the point of tears.
But Jon Voight in his portrayal of  the naive wannabe hustler, Joe Buck, takes the cake. His rugged honesty and  hope are what break him in the urban jungle of New York City. Joe is the  epitome of the small, personal American Revolution of the Sixties. With his  hard, tough exterior broken he is almost weak. What holds him together, and  pushes him to commit violent atrocities, is his love (which developes from  pity) for Ratzo.
One of Voight's lines ("I'll tell you where you can  put your dishes. And if you won't I'd be happy to oblige, I truly  would!") backed with Harry Nilssen's Oscar winning version of  Everybody's Talkin' is pure magic. 
Take a hint and watch this beautiful  film and don't be put off by the earlier X rating because this movie  captures a beauty not seen since then until the magnificent 1999 film  "American Beauty."
And by the way, John Barry's overwhelming  score (especially "Midnight Cowboy") is worth quite a listen as  well.
