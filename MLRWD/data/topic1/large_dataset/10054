I was very surprised when I saw this movie the other day just how great it was. I was expecting maybe a decent movie predominantly featuring Madonna's 4 songs from the soundtrack and a laid back script that probably wouldn't make much sense. Well, the plot did NOT make sense, but to be fair, it didn't make sense in classic 80's fashion. What we have here is arguably one of the best comedies of the late 80's. (I read another person's review of this where they said Desperately Seeking Susan was a better movie but not as funny. I agree. DSS was slightly better, but not nearly as funny.) Of course, this movie is much more Madonna than DSS was. Griffen Dunne is priceless as a young, engaged lawyer trying to keep Nikki (Madonna) in line as a favor for his fiance's father. No matter what he does he does not succeed. It's bad enough that he also has to pick up a rare species of panther, his fiance's father's "pet". When Nikki leaves prison, he tries to take control of her and make sure she gets on the bus to Philadelphia as planned. Before he knows it, she is driving his in laws' car, or rather body-slamming it through suburban traffic. She also boosts tapes from a mall (you get a glimpse of longbox CDs in there) and gets a man arrested just so she can do so. By the end of the day...so much 80's-esque zany comedic situation has occurred you won't believe it. You won't be able to stop laughing, especially when they are chasing a UPS man in hot pursuit of a priceless necklace WHILE being chased by 2 men they thought they ditched who have a rift with Nikki. Just hilarious, and then, the next day, Dunne's wedding day. You can imagine! WHO'S THAT GIRL is a priceless comedy, bargain-bin 80's style, and one that should not be missed by fans and non-fans of Madonna. I certainly hope it's released on DVD soon. It deserves to be.
