Are you ready for the must-see documentary of the year, America? The reviews are in! America is excited! Watch this documentary to get the true story behind George W. Bush, which the God-hating, liberal media will not you see!

"This documentary made me cry"

Victim 1

"I can honestly say I have never seen anything quite like this."

Victim 2

"This documentary provoked a strong reaction from me"

Victim 3

"Do people actually believe this piece of sh*t? This is laughable tripe. I can't believe a certain segment of American society is so fantatically religious and so under-sophisticated that they would actually buy this crap. Can I get my money back? I thought this was supposed to be a "factual documentary". If I wanted to watch a vulgar, tasteless comedy, I would have watched Deuce Gigolo European Gigolo."

God-hating, America-hating Liberal

"I am calling a hit out on the above evil, God-hating liberal. I call on the Bush administration to assassinate all God-hating, America-hating, freedom-hating, traitorous liberals. It's cheaper than rounding them all up, and packing them onto a gay-themed cruise-ship where they can practise sodomy with each other, and snort cocaine off each others' genitals, and all that sinful stuff the Blue-State, latte-sipping Liberals do, and sending them far, far away never to return to the shores of our Christian nation, America, again."

Pat Robertson

"GEORGE W. BUSH IS A MAN OF GOD! HE WAS CHOSEN BY GOD'S DIVIN GRASE TO FIGHT A HOLY CRUSADEE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIUR AND LORD, AMEN, AGANST THE SATANIK, EVIL, FORSES OF MUSLEMS! AFTR I SAW THIS DOCUMANTERY AT CHURCH, I WENT AND GOT ME MY GUN AND LOOKED AROUND FOR A MUSLEM. I FOUND ONE..
