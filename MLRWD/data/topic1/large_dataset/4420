I did this DVD for the first time yesterday and woke up with every muscle in my body aching (in the best sense possible!) I am a runner and have done Jillian Michael's 30-Day-Shred and Killer Buns and Thighs. I like Jillian, but her workouts are so long (40 minutes) and so intense that I sometimes feel sick after doing them. I also find myself doing them rarely, as it is hard to find the time and motivation for such a long and hard workout. Jackie's workout is great because each routine is only 15 minutes long. Furthermore, both routines are so fast-paced and alternate so quickly between movements that they feel like only 5 minutes. I actually find myself looking forward to doing the routines. They stretch out your body, target muscles that are often ignored in other workouts (hips, back, arms, etc.), and make you feel like you've had a good workout without wanting to fall over from exhaustion. The standing routine is somewhat easier than other workouts I have done, so I use it as a warm-up for the floor routine, which is the real killer. The standing routine speeds up your heart-rate and warms up ALL your muscles while the floor routine really targets your abs. In fact, I could only finish about 10 minutes of the floor routine! I don't think doing just the standing routine will do anything for your abs, but paired with regular cardio and the floor routine, I think you will see good results!
