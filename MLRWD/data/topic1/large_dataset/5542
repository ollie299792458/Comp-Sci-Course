WWE From the Vault - Shawn Michaels
  This DVD shows 7 matches that made Shawn Michaels career what it is today. This DVD is also filled with extras such as: pre-match promos, events leading up to matches, after match brawls, and ads for the PPV in which the match was on. But it is definitely the matches that makes this DVD great.
AWA Tag-Team Championship Match-  In this match him in Marty Janetty team up to take on the AWA tag-team champs in a decent brawl that gets real bloody. This match is significant because it finally gets him noticed and he soon after heads to better days in the WWF. Nothing scientific about this match, mainly just punching and kicking, but a great brawl and a fun match to watch. ***
Ladder Match for IC Title- This match comes from WM X against Razor Ramon. Just about every wrestling fan knows about this match and knows how great it was. This match was one of the first of its kind and both comepetitors pulled out all the stops to match this match great. Sick bumps by both Shawn and Razor make it even that much better. A revolutionary match to lead the way for other great ladder matches and hardcore matches. This is definitely the best match on the DVD. No wonder it stole the show that night from Bret and Owens ***** classic. *****
60 Minute Iron Man Match- This WWF Heavyweight Championship match against Bret Hart comes from Wrestlemania XII. Many fans say this match is boring but they are the fans who don't appreciate true wrestling which is what this match was. Not as good as the Rock-HHH Iron man match but it was still decent.****
No Holds Barred Match- Shawn Michaels first PPV title defense since becoming champion and he goes up against Desiel who is on his way out. Great brawl as Shawn really gets a great match out of Diesel in what is Diesels only great match. *****
WWF Heavy Championship Match- This match comes  from IYH: Mind Games against  Mick Foley who is playing the character of Mankind. Foley calls this match the  finest  of his career in his book and it  probably would be if  not for the blotched ending. ****3/4
Hell in a Cell- In the first ever Hell in a Cell match HBK battles the Undertaker in a great brawl with some sick bumps by HBK. Once again, HBK carries a decent oppenent into a great match with a memorable but bad ending.*****
Unsanctioned Street fight- After 4 years of retirement, HBK is ready to step back into the ring again. This time he goes up against friend turned enemy, HHH. This is a decent brawl in which Shawn is trying to prove that he's still the Showstopper. Great match by HBK in his first match out of a 4 year retirement. ***3/4
Bottom Line: The worst match on this DVD is 3 stars!! Go pick this up if u already haven't.
