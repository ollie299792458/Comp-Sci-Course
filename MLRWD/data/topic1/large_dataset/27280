I'm not normally a fan of chick flicks, but I liked this one. I'll admit that the only reason I rented the movie was to see Amber Tamblyn from Joan of Arcadia, but I found that I really enjoyed the story. Basically, there are four teenage girls who've been friends for their entire lives. One summer, each of the girls is going in a different direction. One goes to Greece, one goes to soccer camp in Mexico, one goes to visit her dad in Charleston, and one is staying in Maryland to make a documentary and work at a department store. Before the girls go their separate ways, they mutually purchase a pair of jeans that magically fits each girl perfectly. They believe the jeans will bring them good fortune when they are apart, and agree to share them one week at a time for the entire summer. The movie, which sounds pretty dopy at first, is actually a sweet coming of age story. The characters are fun and interesting, and also pretty believable. I didn't expect to like this movie, but I must say it was quite good. Not quite Stand By Me or Now and Then as far as coming of age stories go, but close.
