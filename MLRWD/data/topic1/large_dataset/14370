I never had the chance to see this film on the big screen.  I wish I had.  And the only other opportunity was on commercial tv where of course it is interrupted and cut to pieces for commercials.

On so many fronts, what a film!  It is beautifully filmed and what a cast!  Many of us recall John Hurt as the mad and obscene Caligula of I Claudius fame.  He does great justice to the transformation of Richard Rich from friend to opportunist.  Susannah York is superb as Margaret, and what can one say about Paul Scofield's performance but brilliant?

This film is a truly great one in that it is not only about the political rise and fall of figures in the erratic times of Henry VIII, but more a story of human beings, principles, integrity, honour, and strength.  Faced with the things More was faced with politically, spiritually, ethically, what choices would WE make?  Would we face all as More did, or would we choosed bend with the wind and opt for survival and advancement as Richard Rich?  Would we be a Matthew, the steward, who says there is a limit to his loyalty, survival being the ultimate one?

Take a trip to a rich period in history and to your own inner self with this film.  This is a true masterpiece!
