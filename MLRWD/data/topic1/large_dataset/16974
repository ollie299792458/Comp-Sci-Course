This 1 of the best movies ive seen if not the best!
This made me Laugh Out Loud this is an extremely funny movie.Soon as i saw this on dvd i quickly brought it.Ive watched this so many times and you will do the same as it is so funny.This is like a very long roller coaster ride and you dont want it to stop, such as the road house incedent, then policeman incedent  it doesnt stop it just keeps getting funnier and funnier and you will be saying during the movie what else can these idiots do next.It is such a great movie and i would call it jim carreys most funniest movie(and that does say alot)it kicks ace ventures ass!
If you are a COMEDY fan it would only be a waste of money to hire this as you will end up rehiring it out again so just buy it i doubt you will be dissapoited and bored!
Oh also look out for the 'we got no food,no money, OUR PETS HEADS ARE FALLING OFF' this line will leave you gasping for air and it isnt even the funniest scene!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
If my review helped you & you agree this movie is great click the yes button!
