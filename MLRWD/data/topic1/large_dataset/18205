Sometimes even truly bad movies redeem themselves by providing enough entertainment value in spite of themselves that they still manage to hold your attention for two hours.  Then there are the ones that commit the unforgivable sin of being bad *and* boring.  "Stay" falls, nay, plummets irretrievably into the latter category.

I don't think I've ever been less interested to find out what happens to a set of characters than I was while watching this film.  The tone of the film is dreary and bleak; everyone has suicide on the mind in one form or another; and a disjointed series of scenes follow one another without much coherent narrative thread to connect them.

The lack of a coherent narrative really kills this film.  I'm all for a convoluted, confusing plot that keeps the audience in the dark until the very end, but if you're going to go that route you've got to throw the audience just enough to keep them interested and compelled to keep viewing.  A sympathetic character, a good action sequence, people with clear goals to achieve -- hell, Naomi Watts doing a pole-dance just to keep us entertained would have gone a long way toward saving this movie.  As it is, we just get a morose Ewan McGregor running around a dark cityscape, being confused about his identity, the identities of the other characters, and generally not doing anything remotely interesting.  The main plot thread of trying to prevent his patient's impending suicide gets tangled up and loses momentum almost immediately, leaving the movie aimless and meandering.  I assume it ends at some point and provides some resolution to whatever it is Ewan McGregor is trying to accomplish, but I turned off the DVD long before that happens and derived much greater entertainment value by watering my girlfriend's plants.  Wow, that African Violet is really starting to bloom!
