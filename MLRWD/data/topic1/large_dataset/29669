Mick Jagger, Gena Rowlands, Malcolm MacDowell, Vincent Price, Liza Minelli, Susan Sarandon, Paul Rubens, Robin Williams, Carrie Fisher, Jeff Bridges, Christopher Reeve... these are just a few of the mega big-name stars that agreed to act in Shelley Duvall's Faire Tale Theater, a decidedly dorky (vanity?) project which aired on Showtime in the early to mid '80's. I was about 11 years old when it debuted, and so I remember watching and enjoying it to a certain extent, even though I thought it was a bit lame. Young people watching this now will probably find the cheap soundstage sets, the bad wigs and costumes, not to mention the very presence of Shelley Duvall herself, laughably dated. And yet the sheer amount of "talent" will boggle the mind. The question isn't who's in this, it's who ISN'T in it. And I'll admit the years have given it a certain charm in the midst of Cable TV's panoply of profanity, sarcasm and slickness. Faerie Tale Theater shares the awkward, sweetly earnest air of those old PBS specials, like the musical of Studs Terkel's "Working" (if anyone remembers that) or even Sesame Street.  I got this to watch with my 2 year old daughter as a break from Elmo, and she seems to enjoy it, to a ceertain extent, as well.
