My husband and I were slightly disappointed with Guess Who.  With Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac, we were expecting constant hilarity.  Don't get me wrong.  It was funny.  We did laugh quite a bit.  However in this day and age, a movie that relies on racial bashing continues to tell us it's ok to judge people on the color of their skin.  Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and Theresa (Zoe Saldana) were a happy, in love bi-racial couple.  From the moment Simon arrived at The Jones home he was judged solely his race.  When his girlfriend's father thought he was black everything was wonderful.  Simon was all but forced to tell "black jokes" at a family dinner and when one was told that the Jones's didn't like, he was almost lynched.  Simon never had an issue with his girlfriend's African-American heritage.  The Jones family obviously had an issue with his heritage.  Eventually, Simon is accepted in to the family after his relationship is almost destroyed by a judgemental family.  In this day and age we are supposed to be teaching our children racial equality and practicing that ourselves.  Do we have it now? No.  With movies like this, we never will.
