I had almost forgotten what a good actress Halle Berry is after a series of bad movies like for example the recent Perfect Stranger with Bruce Willis.

This is possibly her best acting since Monster's Ball. At one point both she and Del Toro, who is reliable as always, verge dangerously close to over-acting but it is clear these are good actors. Duchovny gives a good perfomance as well and provides a light note among all the misery.

The story of grief and addiction is where the movie to me is disappointing. Ultimtely I didn't sympathize enough with the characters to feel absorbed by the story. I could feel for the characters at first but after two hours they just came over as too weak and self-pitying. The ending offers some resolution, but very little.

After seeing a movie I either like to feel I've been entertained or to have been offered some insight in the mystery of life. No Country for Old Men, which I saw two days ago, does both and that makes it a great movie  to me. Things we lost in the fire did neither to me and with such great actors I find that disappointing.
