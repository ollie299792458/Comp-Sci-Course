This is basically the author of the horror films.  The first horror film was actually done by Thomas Edison; it was a movie short of Frankenstein.
Anyway, This movie is one of the greatest treasures in the history of film as well as of course the world of the horror films.  This is an eerie film that sticks to your mind and you cannot easily forget.  It is a must for cinema fans.
It has not only been called as the first horror film, but it is the first zombie film.  Its plot is an original one that has been modeled after since its release in '26.  
First offered to Fritz Lang, he declined it to shoot Der Mud Tod (Destiny, another great).  One of the lead actors in this, Conrad Veite (the zombie), was listed down as one of the replacements for Dracula after Lon Chaney died.  
There is so much history to this: one of the great German films beside that of Metropolis.  
P.S.: I gave it a four only because of the poor D.V.D. transfer: they show a bar on the top of the screen in several frames throughout the film.  I understand they did this because they would have had to crop out part of the movie if they didn't.  Especially in parts where they show dialogue over the set, I agree with this method.  But for fans of the film who would like to see it over and over, it is a bummer.
