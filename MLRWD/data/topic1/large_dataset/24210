What makes this film a classic for me is the way the movie investigates Andy Kaufman's form of entertainment in a way that brings out many different emotions (at least in me it did), as opposed to editing his history in favor of a comedy full of laughs. Some of the scenes of Andy's standup routine seem downright painful to watch, as we witness some of the stunts he pulled (e.g. the Fridays episode) that eventually led to his falling out of favor with the mainstream. In this sense it reminds me alot of the movie "Barfly" which was loosely based on the life of poet Charles Bukowski. We see the artist for what he is, and often it is hard to find out exactly, except to observe his art and try to make inferences. So was the case with Kaufman. There is no Freudian shorthand that can be supplied here. Rather we simply celebrate the person through his art and actions in life.
Finally I must commend Jim Carrey for his wonderful performance. He has the advantage of being an artist who is acting out the role of an artist, and in this sense we expect more from him, which is indeed the case.
