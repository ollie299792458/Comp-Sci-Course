It is not surprising that in an age where "The Simpsons" are so popular, that a movie like "Empire of the Sun" proved to be a box office flop. Our society has gone through a dumbing down phase with no relief in sight. Alas, I am digressing into social commentary, so on to the movie.
This is a truly gorgeous film, beautifully shot with tremendous acting by the entire cast. I agree with others that Christian Bale is superb. His range is amazing. He is a spoiled child that losses everything and comes close to the edge of insanity. Malkovitch is outstanding as well.
So many memorable momments: overseeing the adult couple making love, the saluting of the Japanese fighter pilot, the toy airplane at the custom party, the slap by the servant who is caught looting Jim's house. Those of you that have seen this movie, know I could go on and on. The end of the movie was perfect. Simply, perfect.
This is one of my top 100 movies, if not top 50. I hope to get around to the book someday.
I hope you enjoy it when you see it.
