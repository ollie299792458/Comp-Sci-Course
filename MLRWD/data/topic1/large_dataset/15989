If you do,then get this movie.  
The Good:
It adds a lot of little scenes that explain small gaps in the storyline.  The digital sound and quality of the DVD are better than the original.  I enjoyed the extras with included interviews.  This is a very nice 2 DVD set.
The Bad:
I found the original cut to be more fast paced and entertaining than the director's cut.  Don't get me wrong, based on my rating it's obvious this is still a good movie, but those scenes were removed for a good reason, they slow the movie down or add unnecessary campiness.  One example is during the famous engine room inspection.  Kirk refers to a crewman (related to Scottie) as a tiger.  Come on...that sounds so out of character.  I've enjoyed the television show and movies for years, but calling a cewman a tiger?  This is along the same line as the scene where Kirk discloses to Spock how he told David about being his father.  Spock's reaction is definitely out of character.
Conclusion:
If you have the original, keep it and this set for the extras.
