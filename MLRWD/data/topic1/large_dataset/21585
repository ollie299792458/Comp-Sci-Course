There are very few movies I've seen more than once in the theatre.  'Phantasm' is one of those. I saw it on the Big Screen in 1980 or so, was  SEVERELY creeped out by it. Then I went to see it again the next night. To  this day, it remains one of my favourite horror movies.
The story  revolves around Mike, a kid who discovers something odd is happening at the  local funeral home. He does some investigating and is soon swept up into a  vortex of nightmares swirling around the mysterious undertaker known as the  Tall Man. His older brother and the brother's best friend Reggie are also  caught up in the unfolding events which become more and more like a  nightmare.
Even twenty years later, I am amazed at how frightning things  that I might well laugh at in other flicks seems in 'Phantasm.' The  slow-motion shot of the Tall Man walking past Reggie working at his ice  cream truck; the chittering robed servents of the Tall Man; the flying,  skull-puncturing silver ball of death; the transforming severed  body-parts... all of these still seem scary, even from my now-jaded  perspective. Much of the film's power comes from its simple yet  well-crafted electronic score and a masterful use of sound effects. The  final moment of the film STILL makes me jump, even though I now it's  coming, and much of the shock comes from the audio rather than the visual.
