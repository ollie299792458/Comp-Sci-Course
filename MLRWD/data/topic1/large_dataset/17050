I haven't seen the original GET CARTER, I must say this stands well on its own. I have liked many other Stallone movies (JUDGE DREDD, CLIFFHANGER, FIRST BLOOD, DEMOLITION MAN) but GET CARTER was a different movie.
This movie is about a man who tries to come back to a family (his brother's) who he walked out on so many years ago. The only connection his niece has to him is a picture that sits around. But Jack Carter learns that his interrogating people only makes the people he's trying to get in touch with grow farther from him.
But yet Jack does not stop his quest to prove that his brother did not die in an auto-accident. As he goes deeper into the world of filth under Seattle, Jack uncovers Cyrus Paice, a man who likes to project porn on the Internet for money.
As Jack comes closer to the truth, he realizes that if he'd have been there when they needed them, none of this would have ever gone down. Jack begins to get in touch with his niece, and eventually develops a new sense of family and honor.
I recommend this one for fans of PAYBACK, Stallone, Crime-dramas, or just somebody who likes good movies. This one is like the case of BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The reviewers hate it and people don't like it and it bombs. But I liked both this movie and BATTLEFIELD EARTH. But you'll have trouble finding it. I had to drive for a while to find a place that had it, 'cause Movie Gallery's six copies were all out.
