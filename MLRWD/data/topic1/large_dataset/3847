This DVD is definitely a must for blues fans--John Mayall has contributed so much over the years.  I do have one beef with his song selection, which is that about 90% of the songs on here are 12-bar blues, which gets old after a while.
Mick Taylor was fantastic as usual.  His tone is still fat and full of sustain.  His playing hasn't slipped at all since his days with the Stones--it's a lesson in economy, phrasing, tone, and using speed only when it'll sound good.  When Taylor was onstage, he stole the spotlight from Whittington.
Eric Clapton, on the other hand, has lost it.  His tone was thin, tinny, and had no life to it.  His playing was also lackluster.  Compare the great 1966 version of "Hide Away" to the one on this DVD--the DVD version sounds like elevator music!  To his credit, his playing did get better as the night wore on, but it was still not what you should get from the guy known as "God," and it was not even close to being as good as Taylor.  Whittington stole the stage from Clapton, enough said.
