The Abyss is a great sci-fi movie of it's time, and one of my favorites.

But- The point of this review is to show that in 2002, squeezing 2 versions of the movie AND special features onto 1 DVD may have been a "money-saver" for the studio, but to have to listen to compressed 2-channel Dolby "Surround" tracks is torture if you have even a half-way decent sound system. (i.e.- not TV speakers)

The fact is- 'Dolby Surround' is not actually surround sound. Incase you don't know- Stereo is stereo, and if you imbed a reverse-phase track so that D. Surround decoders (on just about every 5 speaker reciever for the last 10 years) play audio in the rear, you're just listening to louder sound effects that are coming also from the front 2 speakers. The center channel is just taking the mono tracks and playing them independently (and there is more than just dialog in this). No ".1" track included either, your sub just plays some low frequency sounds from the crappy low res audio in stereo. Barely noticeable.

-Also, the video is actually a 'fullscreen' aspect ratio with the 1.35:1 movie aspect embedded inside of it. So the result is (even with progressive scan) LOWER RESOLUTION THAN 480p (technically lower than 480i on the disc itself)

Point being- even in 2002-2003, the studio (Fox) could have just spent a few more cents per unit to manufacture these in 2 disc form, and there wouldn't be a problem. Or just not make the decision to put 2 versions of the same movie in it.

GET THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION if you like this movie, which I do. I'm returning this one (if I can)
