I would have never thought that this movie would be so great.. but saw it and it held my attention from the first minute till the last!  This movie does not contain graphic violence, there is not huge special effects and action sequences, but what it has is something better.  Very interesting likable characters!, straight forward dialogue and action, and amazing direction.. however it is the "story" that blows me away.  A story about making the right choices, and decisions that ultimately set you on the right path.

A bad cop attempts to takes a witness to the court house to testify, but once he sees the corruption in the police force ... he does the right thing and his life is changed because of it , also the witness is so darn likable his life is changed too!  This to me is a movie about making the right choices for the sake of being a good human being.  I think all ages and all religions can enjoy this movie.
If you enjoy shallow, gritty, dark, depressing movies than DO NOT buy this!  I found this movie very inspirational and heart felt.  I will watch this again and again. Fun ride.
