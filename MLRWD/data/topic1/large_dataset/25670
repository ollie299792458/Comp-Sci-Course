So 'Ally McBeal' has finished for good now, although this compilation of episodes reminds us of what was great about it.  Centering around perpetually single, slender and kooky Ally (Flockhart) the audience is brought in on her hallucinations (brilliantly realised via some impressive computer animation), her loves, her losses and her job at a law firm that seems to embrace the weird.  What made this show great was that it was so different, with David E. Kelley's sharp writing bringing in a mixture of well-placed observations on modern relationships and absolutely hilarious characters.  Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the diminuative lawyer with a pet frog and a Barry White infatuation?  Add to this Richard Fish, who seems to wallow in his own male chauvanism, 'Subzero' Nelle (diRossi) and the deliciously nasty Ling (Liu) and you have a hot cast that's pretty much enjoyable whatever they're doing.
Although recent episodes have been slammed for not being funny enough this might seem unfair, although there's always a tendancy to be nostalgic about the older episodes that are on offer here.  It balances funny, romantic and sad remarkably well and these earlier episodes were genuinely revolutionary, paving the way for other more experimental shows.  Still, it would be nice to see the seasons in their entirity, as they are available in the UK.
