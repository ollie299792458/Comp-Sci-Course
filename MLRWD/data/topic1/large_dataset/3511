This DVD, plus Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance!, really are what Ana and Ravi claim - complete total-body workouts. Both DVDs have stretch, cardio, toning and strength elements and more than enough challenges to keep you motivated (and at times frustrated). But unlike conventional total-body workouts, these DVDs will leave you feeling both calm and energized.

I'm still undecided as to which DVD I prefer, but I can see myself using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L54TR8">Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance! ALL LEVELS - with Ana Brett and Ravi Singh</a> a lot more in its entirety, while there are certain segments in this DVD (eg the ab and upper body segments) which would be great as "add-ons" to other workouts.

Here is what I like the most about Cardio, Stretch and Strength:

1.  Breath of fire for 6 minutes straight!
2.  The ab section. Very original and very effective. You can really feel it the next day. There are no boat poses here. Plow (my favourite inversion pose) is used as an ab toner and then combined with a modified teaser (Ana calls it a yoga sit-up).
3.  The cardio dance segment has lots of fun moves (crazy legs, shiva dance, fan yourself, paddling) and music which stays in your head for hours. When I first did this segment, I was a bit distracted by the slow motion at the start, but now that I know the routine it doesn't bother me. Yes, there are jumping jacks but you don't have to do them. I won't do jumping jacks for anyone - Tony Horton and Chalene can't make me do them and Ravi won't either!
4.  Long relaxation followed by the Adi Shakti mantra.

By the way, all three of Raviana's new DVDs are "winners" for me. They are wonderful, unique, at times challenging workouts with excellent (as always) instruction, demonstrated to perfection by Ana. And yes, she looks absolutely gorgeous!
