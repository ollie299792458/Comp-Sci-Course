I first saw this movie at the local theater and except for the following feelings found the movie to be quiet enjoyable for a sci-fi/horror movie:

1) it being a sequel of another movie (the way the crew talk to each other before the start of the mission.

2) the strange start of the movie with the crewman running and getting killed while we watch it in a reflection

3) the lack of background information on the Ray Walton's charater

4) the catipiller scene could have been better filmed with a little distance from the action instead of repeated cuts to the monster's mouth.

5) the feeling that there could be a sequel to this movie as well

6) the ending sort of felt rushed when all the crew members except for 1 came back to test the "hero" of the movie to a final test.

Otherwise this movie was quite good as a stand alone movie and much better then "alien".

The comparisons of which "alien" was filmed with little or lack or any light and "galaxy of terror" was better lit to see the action and the monsters much better.

Unlike "alien" with its little quickie cuts and views of the monster until its finally blown out of the airlock where we can finally see the whole monster. "galaxy of terror shows clear and extended views of the creatures and doesnt resort to those quickie cuts (think 13 ghosts - the remake)

I wish I could find a copy of this movie (either vhs or dvd) to watch when cable and regular tv schedules show reruns to pass the time away with a good sci-fi/horror movie from the 80's. The current crop of sci-fi/horror movies SUCK!!

I also hope IF Roger Corman makes a "updated" remake he sticks with the original movie storyline and just fills in the 'holes' in the story and doesnt go on a wild tangent and totally rewrite and remake the movie - like his last remake --> humanoids from the deep
