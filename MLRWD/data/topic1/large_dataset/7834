I'd seen the trailer, but that's it. Given the current crop of fantasy movies, I was expecting a light, fluffy fantasy movie - NeverEnding Story, or the like. Boy was I ever wrong.
Bridge to Terabithia was anything but light fantasy. I'm glad I watched it alone - crying over movies is more my wife's domain, and I did plenty of sniffling. I don't see this as being a kids' movie - nothing terribly objectionable, it just hit hard in spots I didn't have when I was a kid. The acting is very good - a good thing. Despite the trailer it was all about the characters and the story. There was comparatively little CG - no Star Wars or Lord of the Rings here. Just enough CG to support the story. Very tastefully done.
My only disappointment is two bits of dialog, unnecessary to the story, that portray the usual Hollywood stereotype of Christianity. Disappointing, but not surprising, even from Disney.
Aside from that one minor nit, I don't remember being hit as hard (in a good way) by a movie since I saw Apocalypse Now in the theater in 1979.
