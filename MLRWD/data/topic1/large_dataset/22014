Hmmm... I am thinking what awful aspect of this movie I should cover first. Let me first explain that I was sooo excited to finally be able to watch this DVD. I put the DVD into my player and ran the movie. To my surprise, I find 3D animation of 2 scorpions fighting which kind of made me raise an eyebrow towards the lack of correlation between the movie and the animation. Nonetheless I started watching the movie. To my suprise, most of the favorites in this movie were not even given "significant" parts. You will come to learn of what I mean by this when you watch the movie. In my mind, I was thinking this movie would be about 5 guys planning and scheming a big casino heist in Las Vegas during some Elvis convention. Guess What?! The heist is only 4-5 minutes at the max. The actual movie is more about laundering the money and how the money keeps changing hands. So basically you have to guess who is going to keep the money. The only half decent actor/actress in this movie was Courney Arquette, who played a somewhat decent "whorish" single mother.  Putting it all together, 3000 Miles to Graceland, kept fumbling around with different ideas and character developments, yet failed to completely let the ideas and development flow through the movie.
