Design for Living is a witty little number produced and directed by the incomparable Ernst Lubitsch, written by Ben Hecht, based on a play by Noel Coward (okay, very loosely based), and starring Gary Cooper, Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins at the ultimate height of their talent and physical beauty. There isn't much of a plot other than a love triangle where best friends fall in love with the same woman, who unfortunately cannot seem to choose between the two. Gary Cooper was so incredibly beautiful it's easy to loose sight of what a marvelous actor he was, and completely underutilized in the comedy genre. Fredric March, although better known as a dramatic actor, thankfully dabbled more frequently into comedies, such as his terrific satire with Carole Lombard in Nothing Sacred. The surprising revelation, however, was the brilliant Miriam Hopkins. She had the most difficult role to conquer, having to continually portray the conflicted feelings of her character without appearing ditzy, mean, or self-absorbed. The supporting cast, including Edward Everett Horton, Franklin Pangborn, and Jane Darwell, are all a lot of silly fun and add substantially to the overall feeling of joie de vivre. This film is sexy, frothy, romantic, witty, and charming. Thankfully Lubitsch, well-known for his sophisticated film making style, was able to make this delight prior to the enforcement of the production code. Sublime!
