I am sorry to have to give this supplier a very negative review.  Being ignorant but trusting, as I assume may of you are, I assumed that a product advertised as being shipped from the USA to the USA would be "playable" in the USA.  The product was mark as being a "zone 2: video, but I was unaware of what this meant.  I just assumed that USA products were playable in the USA.  No so!!! This product is only playable in zone 2 which is Europe.  I contacted the company to see if they would be willing to replace it with a copy of the product playable in the USA and they said that they would only reimburse me for the cost of the purchase of the movie (after deducting the original cost to ship it to me and my paying the cost to ship it back which left me almost no net refund).  This company will not get any of my business in the future and I will spread the word as far as I can that their advertising, although technically correct, is misleading to the average purchaser.  An issue they could have solved with very little cost to themselves and much less than the negative advertising that they will receive as a result of their failure to admit their misleading way of selling.  Poor business practice!!!  I assume that this is an indication of the rest of their business practices.  Technically correct, but misleading!!!  What else do they not tell their buyers?
