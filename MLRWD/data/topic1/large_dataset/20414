Though few dramatic climaxes can match or surpass the choking moment of fear in "Down Neck" as A.J. Soprano reveals his father's secret or the amazing and spectacular hospital scene in "I Dream of Jeanne Cusamano" that left us wondering whether matriarch Livia Soprano was suffering from a stroke or really relishing in the aftermath of her murderous plot against her son, the second season of HBOs fantastic groundbreaking Mob epic "The Sopranos" has its own surprises in store.
Perhaps the continuing success of the series, with its current 22 Emmy nominations, may yet convince James Gandolfini to stick it out as Tony Soprano for the fifth season and beyond, as the fate of the series beyond its possible culmination after the fourth season is now being discussed.  With the unconfirmed reports of AOL Time Warner pitching $20M at series creator David Chase for his continuation on for a fifth year, we can only hope that the company's offer will similarly sweeten Gandolfini, who was been public about his anger over the show's violence and his desire to end it after the upcoming fourth season.  
What is left in store?  Will Uncle Junior go to trial?  Will he finally testify that Tony was the acting boss during his reign so that the Feds can get to Johnny Sac and eventually the NY families?  Will imprisoned Gemayo, superior to original boss Guacomo "Jackie" Aprile, finally be released and challenge Tony's power?  Will A.J. show further signs of following in his father's footsteps?  And will Paulie abandon the Soprano family for Johnny Sac and NY?  The answers are only 39 weeks away, as the series starts again from the beginning this Sunday on HBO.
This second DVD set is worth every cent.  I haven't met a person yet who hasn't loved the Sopranos, from the deep psychological problems of mob boss Tony Soprano as unraveled by his psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, Goodfellas Oscar-nominee), to the Shakespearean and Greek tragedy undertones.  Definitely pre-order this.
