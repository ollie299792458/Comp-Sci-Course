I thought this movie was one of the best martial arts movies ever, BUT you could tell that Bruce Lee was EXTREMELY nervous about his impression on the American audience.  It seems Lee's goal was to enthrall the entire world,  but, being a natural born American citizen, he seemed especially intent on  making this movie work.  Most people look strictly at the martial arts, but  Bruce Lee was a trained actor...he had been acting almost since birth.  I,  personally like some of his action scenes in other movies better then  "Enter The Dragon", although there were a select few that were  incredible.  What really stands out is his drive, which partially derives  from his life of acting (although it seems a little lacking, only because  he spoke broken English)  In closing, I don't think the world could have  handled Bruce Lee if he would have lived past the premier of this  movie...he IS a legend, and legends just can't live in the present.  He  accomplished all he was allowed to, and we're all extremely grateful.
