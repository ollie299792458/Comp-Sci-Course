No Lucas politics here, just considering the films on their own merits.  And their merits are truly terrible.  These are awful films that, if the Star Wars name was not attached to them, would be forgotten by now, and mocked in the same breath with such movies as "Norbit", "The Cat In The Hat", "Catwoman" and "Battlefield Earth".  Gorgeous (and very artificial) visuals do not make a great movie all by themselves, and the original Star Wars trilogy understood this by utilizing special effects to serve the story and the characters.  These 3 movies have it all backwards as story and character take a back seat to the visuals, which while technically dazzling, ultimately leave the viewer emotionally cold and distant.  The narrative is a mess, and the dramatic tension almost non-existent, because we simply don't care about any of these one-dimensional characters and the nonsensical things they do.  The story and character decisions are mostly incomprehensible, and it's only in the third film that some of the mistakes of the first two films start to be rectified - but it's far too little, too late.  The spellbinding fun and gravitas of the original trilogy is completely absent here, and it's like the two trilogies were made by two entirely different filmmakers.  (Actually, that statement may not be far from the figurative truth.)

George Lucas was once a brilliant auteur, but it's clear that he's since lost his touch and no longer knows how to make a great film.  However, if a video game company ever needs  some great visuals to go along with a game project, Lucas might be the guy for the job.  Unfortunately, great video game visuals aren't what I want in my gritty Star Wars movie watching experience.  Ignore the 4 and 5 star reviews, these movies simply suck.
