I don't have too much to add but wanted to help bring up the average a little.

I found this film on NETFLIX -- "ho hum, nothing much else to watch, but at least this trash monster flick is honestly labeled" -- and I watched "MONSTERS". Wow, I watched it again -- three times in a week! Now, I'm here on Amazon looking to buy a copy.

Everything worth saying has already been included in the other 4 and 5 star reviews. If you enjoy the typical Hollywood "SCIFI" blockbuster, chances are that this film could disappoint you. Truly, this movie is everything that "Battle: Los Angeles" isn't.

If you enjoy watching -- and re-watching -- great science fiction films like "Solaris", "Blade Runner", "The Quiet Earth", "District 9", then this film is for you. If you enjoy reading speculative fiction but you have given up on there ever being a SF movie made for adults, then give this one a try.

Excuse me now. I'm off to buy a copy of "MONSTERS". I know I'll being wanting to watch it again before long. I'm not sure -- yet -- if it's a classic, but it's definitely a keeper!
