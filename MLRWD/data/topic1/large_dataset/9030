Just saw the 'New' Grit and I could not help thinking about the original True Grit. Although the new flick offered a few powerful moments... poor Bridges had some BIG shoes to fill and sadly he could not fill them. (Not even close.) Everything he did seemed to shout "Hey, I'm acting here!" His annoying, fake, garbled speech and goofy mannerisms could not hold a candle to the humor, piss and vinegar of John Wayne. Wayne glided through his performance with an ease and grace that made you feel no one else could have played the part of Rooster. And apparently no one can! Of course Damon was superior to a signer turned would-be actor. That was a given and Damon did a very decent job. But then there was the new 'Mattie'. Please. Why does every director these days insist on casting only young actresses with porn star lips and come-ravage-me doe eyes. She was not even close to believable as the math wiz Mattie. Her exchange with the horse trader (so hysterical in the original) lacked any of the punch that it should have had. The miscast new girl did okay in a few parts, but she was certainly no Mattie! About the only real standouts in the new flick were the bad guys. They were more believable and scarier. But even with its pluses, the New Grit can't hold a candle to the True Grit.
