First off, there are things about this film I really love. The play between Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan is great, (a pity it wasn't utilized a bit further but that's the price you pay for action at every turn) as are the scenes with Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott. She provides Indy with the perfect antithesis to his stoic, cool behaviour. The spike chamber is a brilliant setpiece and something that everyone will remember once having watched it.

It's in the second half that things go a bit wrong. When Lucas described Temple Of Doom as the dark sequel to Raiders (a la Empire Strikes Back) it confused me slightly. The underlying storyline is indeed darker, as it depicts Kali worshipping, human sacrifice and children being on the receiving end of some nasty violence. However, the overriding tone of the film is more frivolous than any other Indy flick. This comes from small, incidental snippets of comedy that appear in inappropriate places and points where it just turns outright silly. Examples of which would be the gross-out comedy from the palace meal; Shortround beating up fully-grown men, etc. All this stuff would be great in a film aimed solely at kids but then this isn't. It seems that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to alleviate the darker passages of the film but instead went too far in the other direction at some points. This leaves you with a strange concoction that doesn't actually know what it wants to be. It's a bit too silly for adults and too scary for children. It is a heck of alot of fun when it does work, however.

I would argue that Raiders is in fact the darkest in the series. Whilst it has that overriding sense of fun and a good portion of humour, the violence is played much straighter and the ominous, mysterious danger of the ark permeates the film (helped no end by Williams' great score).
