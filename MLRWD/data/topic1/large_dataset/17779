For the 20 years since i have been watching films, one film has stood out from the rest.That film is JAWS.People always talk about Star Wars being the mother of all films, well if thats the mother then JAWS is the Grand daddy.When first watching it at the age of 5 i just loved the shark scenes but over the years i have learnt to appreciate the finer aspects of the film and the attention to detail to which Spielberg and his crew went to.Everyone knows by now that what makes the film so frightning is the music by John Williams(SUPERMAN,JURRASIC PARK)and what you dont see. Remember using your imagination is the best tool to scare yourself.In my opinion JAWS is is near enough the perfect film.Firstly you have the 3 main characters who are beutifly constructed. Roy Schieder is so right for his part and  was born for the role as the chief of police in Amity island.One of my faverite lines is 'Its only an island if you look at it from the water'.Hooper and Quint although sharing the same passion have incredibly conrasting personalities which makes their screen time together all that more memorable.All 3 characters have very different relationships with each other and this is shown by what they call one another.Hooper calls them Martin and Quint where as Quint calls them Chief and 'Hooper yer idiot'.On the other hand Brody uses the names Quint and  well this is interesting because only on the odd occasion does Brody use Hoopers name, the only occasion i recall is 'Let Hooper take a turn'.Strange but true.What sets JAWS apart from other films of similar type is that the film builds up to a grand finale.In deep Blue Sea you see the the shark in the first 5 minutes need i say more.As you readers may well know the making of JAWS didn't go to plan, but that in my view wasn't a bad thing because they had to work round this and develop the characters on land making them more humain and normal people whom which we could relate to. I myself ended up really liking the 3 characters in different ways.The way Brody was always worrying,trying to do the right thing and him hating the water was a terrific combination.Hooper who although rich ,really did love and was dedidacted to his work. All he wanted was to be given a chance to explain himself and put his views across and the Mayor and Quint didn't like this.While on the Mayor he plays a very good part as a stubborn son of a a bitch.Quint in many ways is also stubborn.He is very intimidating and has a strong presence around the room in the the very first scene we see him and ihe Indianapolis classic scene. Without doubt that second scene i have just mentioned is a show stopper and is acted masterifly by Shaw.The character Ben Gardner who helped write that scene has a small part in the movie and it is his head that pops out of the hull of his boat. That was probably the bit of the movie which made me jump most first time around.What made me die with laughing was on a documentary about JAWS the character who plays Ben Gardner talks about that scene.He talks about how smart and tidy the shark was to leave just his head by the hull of the boat and the sarcastic manner at which he says this is too funny to put into words.I recommend you see that documentary if you are an avid Jaws fan.Thats about it ive spoken my mind in the last half hour and i hope you enjoyed my review.Thank you for making the film, Jaws Mr Spielberg is the best piece of work you have ever done.In fact its just the best piece of work.
