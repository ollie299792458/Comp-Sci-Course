I'm a huge fan of Kubrick.  This film is not about him or his style--with the exception of the music--which is virtually a free-standing element.  The music is from various Kubrick films.

Conway wasn't even well-versed in Kubrick lore--he was conning people more ignorant than he was.

Overall, it's rather depressing and disturbing--if, like me, you are easily influenced.  Conway is miserable in every sense, and a poor excuse for a human being.  His marks are somewhat pathetic.

But it's an excellent film, both in how it's put together, and because of Malkovich.  He brings his sly glee to what would have been a joyless exercise in perversity.

I agree with R.Z. that this has a somewhat 1-note quality, but disagree that there are any poignant moments.  This film avoids any sort of poignancy entirely.  Not a feel-good movie.  But a short con is not a Gacy.  To compare them is insane.  Conway may be a hollow man, but he's no serial killer.

Oh, and Malkovich's *accents* are worth the price of admission.
