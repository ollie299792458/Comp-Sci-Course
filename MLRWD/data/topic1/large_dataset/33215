Usually, we pre-purchase Disney DVDs, but for some reason I did not pre-purchase this one... and I am glad I did not.  We instead decided to rent this DVD to see if it would be a keeper.  What we found was simply minute after minute after minute of the single worst animated Disney movie myself and the rest of my family have ever seen.  This movie actually makes Lion King 2 look like an Oscar winner.
Mr. Eisner?  Did you really view this project before allowing the Disney name on it?  I simply cannot believe you did.  Peter Pan 2 was well done, Little Mermaid 2 was well done, Lady and Tramp 2 was well done, but this movie, a sequel to a timeless classic, is end to end mush.  The animation is second rate; especially Cinderella although the wicked stepmother is excellent.  The plot is nonexistent.  The music is uninspiring.
About 20 minutes into the movie, my daughter, who by-the-way owns ever single princess item available from bed sheets to headboard to wallpaper to every DVD and doll and clothes..., took the remote and turned it off herself!  I turned it back on and we struggled through the rest of the movie.
Mr. Eisner, for goodness sakes, if you are going to put out trash at least make sure does not involve one of the very classics that made you the success you are today.
