All of a sudden a film pretends to be more original, but this film does not shine, it is not a sun-film (my term), but a moon-film. A post-unclear something right-wing future where religiouisity has turned to sentimentaility, but it is not the sensitimentality of the left, but a relefection of it. As the sentimentaility of the left turned to a religious policy of state without any declaration - Stalin to be a pretentension of it!

The workers of  the organs in this film, appear repressed and this is expressed in a silence when Jude Law enters the factory, and some are even shot, by the poeple that are supposed to protect what they make. It reminded me of the silence in I Robot, when the hero enters the factory, the production line there represents silence, or a bowing down. But  a right wing future, with non-exsistance counter left force will lose it's sense of power with religioius diginity towards a sentimentality through virtue of lack of opposition. As would a winning left wing government lose it's sentimentality towards a reflecting religiousity which would pretend to be state of policy. Also noboby complains that these people are being killed beacuse they can pay installments, which supports the idea of a post-propaganised governement. Hail Ceasar, maybe if I was less able to think.
