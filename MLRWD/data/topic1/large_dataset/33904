I'm well past being simply sick and tired of some calculating corporate flunky telling me what constitutes the "best" of anything. The complete Dean Martin shows have a natural ebb and flow, and the "lesser" sections are just as important to the experience as the highlights. By concentrating solely on the celebrity appearances, these kinds of collections reduce a beloved memory to an aggravating series of fits and starts, as if nostalgia is having a stroke.

The "best" of the Dean Martin Show is Dean. Missing from these clip jobs are all the little winks and mumbles (not to mention THE SONGS) that gave the program such a welcoming quality in its day. And until the complete programs are released as a piece, casual viewers will have no idea why these shows were so fun. It was the casual humanity and warm sense of fraternity that an HOUR of variety at it's genuine best could deliver. People didn't tune in every week for highlights back then, and I won't anytime again in the future.
