I had to watch every episode of this third season, as I got hooked on the show a while back.  The characters are such nice people (except for the snotty dressmaker).  The scenery is lovely.  The stories are a bit slowwwwwww.

Having said that, this season did feel a bit more soap-opera-ish that the first two.  It felt like the writers were desperately contriving conflict to add drama.  Now, I know drama generally has conflict involved, but honestly...the writers were wringing it out in this season.  Every episode had not one, but several "Oh NO!" moments...seriously, at one point I started laughing because it was all too much.

Two thoughts: How come Robert Timmins is the only man in the village with any sense?  He always has to be the voice of reason for the Lark Rise mob.  It's kind of funny.  Also: Why is the serving girl SO incredibly stupid?  They play it as though it's funny, but she acts stupider than Forrest Gump or Corky (from Life Goes On).  Really, that character's IQ must be somewhere between 5 and 10.  It's not funny, it's embarrassing.
