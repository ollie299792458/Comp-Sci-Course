I watched it when I was 5 or 6 yrs old. I had no idea of the moral behind it, and it was horror movie to me. To me, it was a 'high body count' film with kids 'dying' all over the screen. The drowning in the chocolate river was scary and the Umpa-Lumpas looked like monsters. It was almost pervertic because there was this song and dance when kids are 'dying' all over in a beautiful chocolate factory.

And for a typical 5, 6 yrs old kid, isn't it a dream to watch a lot of TV while chewing gum, eating candy and nagging your parents to buy more toys ? (you can't teach a dog a lesson by beating him up unless he understands what he did wrong)

However, as an adult, I really loved the movie and regreted that I didn't not watch it again at, say, 10 years old. I thought I knew what the movie was all about and because I was turned off big time when I was a kid, I never considered watching it again until quite recently. It should have a disclaimer "Not for immature kids who do not understand the concept of morality".

Also, it will be helpful if the supervising adult clarifies some of the concepts to the kid afterwards. Because Charlie's character does not stand out in the film as he is not a look-at-me screaming & flashy boy, and kids with short attention span might not understand why Charlie is rewarded in the end.
