This was one of the best movies of 1998, but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience.  When I try to think of superlatives to desribe it, the one that keeps coming to mind is "cool."

Most of the coolness factor is owed to two things:  Steven Soderbergh's steady directing and the chemistry between the actors, especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Back before we knew that Clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles, he defined suave in this movie.  And back before she was J.Lo, Lopez was that IN LIVING COLOR fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress.  Here she gives the best performance of her career.

While all of the cast (Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in cameos) is solid, after Clooney and Lopez the real star is Don Cheadle.  He is quite convincing as the prison boxer Snoopy.  He oozes rage and steals every scene that he's in.

Plots based on books by Elmore Leonard tend to be above average, but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes.  Thanks to the talent of all involved, this movie is one of the best.
