The film is spectacular in Blu-ray format, enough that I don't feel frustrated about buying the at-the-time impressive 40th Anniversary Edition. Read the more detailed descriptions (below) because I want to point out how reading the product description COULD have avoided a handful of one-star reviews. One of those speed-reading morons presented a good example of NOT reading THE VERY LARGE PRINT before hitting the "Add to Cart" button. The Amazon description says: Disc 1 - Blu-ray. Disc 2 - Blu-ray. Disc 3 - DVD. How does a person infer, after reading the description, "You would think (in) a 3-disk set in a DVD box labeled DVD + BluRay, (that) at least 2 of the disks would be DVD"? That same reviewer bought this edition even though the item's description was in a "font was too small for me to read." Then adjust your monitor so you can, fat head! Two keys: "Ctrl" and "+" and you're set. You're welcome. This same reviewer whimpered how DVD users "lose" when they buy this 3-Disc set. DVD users LOSE? Compared to Blu-ray player owners, you bet! Time marches on. Better technologies supplant others. And so it goes. . .
