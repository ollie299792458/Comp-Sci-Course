If you need one word to sum up this film, that word is FLAT! Dennis Quaid is miscast as the depressed college professor/father (is that very fake gut pillow necessary?) And Jessica Parker as the new girlfriend/physician (do female doctors really wear their long hair hanging down around their face all day while treating patients in a hospital?)  is also working beyond her range here. What is supposed to be dark comedy is unconvincing and forced. You get the feeling there was no time for rehearsing scenes which only magnifies Quaid and Parkers' limitations. The characters are so under developed that you  end up having to believe the people here are what they are, feel what they feel and do what they do, simply because the others say so. Even the  talented Haden Church (Sideways) and Ellen Page (Juno) are wasted on a very stiff screenplay.
I can't imagine most fans of any of these four actors will find any satisfaction in this uninteresting tale.
 The one upside is a pleasant,  youthful, soundtrack which unfortunately seems tacked on to give the scenes emotional depth which just isn't there.
