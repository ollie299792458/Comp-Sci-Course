There are many great Dracula films, and this one is definitely one of greats at least in my opinion, I saw this version years ago, and back when I first saw it I didnt quite fully appreciate it then, I guess its because I was a bit to young then, I remember seeing it with my big sister and I also remember the two of us laughing at the love scene between Frank Langella character and Kate Nelligan, it was the love scene with psychedelic red laser lights haha, and now when I watch it today I still find that scene a bit funny and cheesy but to spite that scene I still enjoyed this film a lot lol

The DVD is has some great extra stuff like interviews with Frank Langella, and the director, and I enjoyed watching the extras and getting a little insight into how the film was made, and what happened during the film shoot, and ironically frank didn't like the laser light scene ether lol, but I must say frank played one of the most sexy versions of Dracula, I think this film should have gotten way more notoriety then it did, because everyone in this film did a great job over all, and I definitely think this film got lost in the shuffle because there has been so many versions made over the years, and because of that I think this version sometimes gets forgotten, but I think that if you love vampire films like I do then check this one out, its one of the best do overs made.
