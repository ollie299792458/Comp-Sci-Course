First of all this is my favorite Ernest movie. In it Jim Varney gets to be both the hero and the villain, which he is very capable of doing.
It begins with Ernest as a lowly bank custodian dreaming of one day being a clerk, which is not likely to happen because of his....clumsy and goofy nature. Luckily for him he has a supportive clerk friend who also happens to be an attractive woman (another reason I love this one, Ernest actually seems to get the girl!) Unfortunately for Ernest there is a criminal on death row who happens to look EXACTLY like him. To make a long story short the criminal swaps places with him, Ernest has to survive jail (and the electric chair) and save the people he loves from his dastardly look alike. There is a lot of physical humor in this Ernest, and all the kids love the scenes where Ernest gets electrocuted and becomes magnetized. The only problem I have is with the DVD. I used to have this on VHS but sadly it died. When I bought the DVD I was horrified to find they'd cut two scenes. The first scene I didn't mind so much, it was when Nash's girl friend came and visited Ernest in Jail, but then they cut the very final scene of the movie.
(spoiler)
The DVD ends when Ernest falls out of the sky burnt to a crisp and says the famous lines, "I came, I saw, I got blowed up." The REAL ending was after that, when we see that Ernest finally got that clerk's job he wanted. While sitting at his new desk he's shocked by the computer and becomes magnetized again and the filing cabinets start chasing him. It was a much better ending.
