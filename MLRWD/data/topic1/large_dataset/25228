And by titling it the way I did I am not saying the actor is bad. I do have a difficult time believing Benicio Del Toro though. I normally love him as an actor and when I first saw the announcement I thought he'd be a natural in the role immortalized by such greats as Lon Chaney Jr. and Paul Naschy (Spanish Wolfman films). Mr. Del Toro show little emotion throughout and seems to drift through the film as more of a spectator than a participant...If that makes any sense. He's not bad in it by any means. He just never really gets into the role. The rest of the cast is slightly above par.

What really makes this film work though is the thick, gothic ambiance that has been created through the set designs, cinematography and costumes. The mood is further carried along by Danny Elfman's classic-inspired score and Rick Baker's excellent gore effects...again proving to the world he is the best at his trade and that CGI will never be an acceptable substitute for in camera, down and dirty prosthetic effects. it's great to see in an era of complete computer rendered nonsense.

Bottom line is: If you enjoyed Universal's Monster flicks growing up, The Wolfman won't disappoint.
