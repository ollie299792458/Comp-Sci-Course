I love "Army of Darkness" and so I watch Bruce Campbell whenever possible.  This movie is NOT on par with AoD but it gets 4 stars for 3 reasons:

1. Bruce Campbell - The worst movie in the world would get bumped up a star just because Bruce Campbell is in it.  There is just something about Bruce that makes a stupid line in a stupid movie fun to watch.

2. Grace Thorsen - Who the heck is she?  That is what I said, especially when she took off her apron for the dance scene.  She bumped the movie up TWO stars.

3. The special features, all of them, are fun and funny!  I'd go so far as to say the the special features are maybe even better than the movie... and they are just about as long as the movie.  This bumps the movie up another star.

So, you do the math.  4 stars rating and all 4 stars are accounted for in the previous 3 items.  I guess that means the actual movie comes in at zero stars, but who cares.  It was fun.  I have suspicions that Bruce Campbell made this movie just to put a paycheck into the pockets of the 36 or so friends of his who were involved in making it and to have fun in his back yard during his time off from Burn Notice.  The movie kind of sucks but you can tell they had fun making it and it is fun to watch.  Go watch it.
