This is both one of my favorite Cary Grant and Frank Capra films and in my opinion it is  also one of the funniest movies in the history of cinema.

There is an opinion among some that Grant's role as Mortimer Brewster was too over the top. In fact Cary Grant would agree with this opinion as he said Arsenic & Old Lace was one of his least favorite performances. Of course actors do not know everything and if I could speak to Cary Grant beyond the grave the one thing I would want to tell him is how much I loved his performance in this film. We all love the debonair & charming Cary Grant who was a master of light comedy but it is nice when we get something different from him and this is exactly what we get here. Instead of that charming & debonair leading man we get a man who is completely out of his element. He is surrounded by insane people but his reactions to the crazy situation he finds himself in make him come off the most insane. This creates some delicious irony which makes an amusing black comedy about sweet old ladies poisoning old men even more hilarious.

The rest of the cast is also excellent with 3 of the actors (the two Brewster Sisters and Teddy Brewster) reprising their roles from the original Broadway play to appear in the movie. The only sour point is Frank Capra was not able to get Boris Karloff to reprise his role as Jonathan Brewster (instead this role was played by Raymond Massey). However to make up for the lack of Boris Karloff, Frank Capra brilliantly cast Peter Lorre as Doctor Einstein which might be the best casting decision of the movie.

Although this movie is especially perfect to watch during Halloween with the mixture of humor and horror, it is great fun to watch anytime. It's the type of movie that even if you know what is going to happen it never gets old. Although the lack of extras on the DVD is disappointing this is a great classic that is definitely worth adding to your collection
