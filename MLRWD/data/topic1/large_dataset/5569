I won't rehash the wonders of this delightful animated film--but what I will say is that it is great to see ALL of it once again! I first saw it when I was five--and it scared the willies out of me. As I grew older, I grew hooked on all the wonderful songs, just like everyone else.

It was not until I was an adult that I finally taped it off USA Network--this was back in the early 90's. It had been edited significantly, and I found myself scratching my head...wasn't there some scene with Magoo in Times Square singing something about being 'Back,Back,Back on Broadway?" Wasn't there an argument in a dressing room? Something about 'bringing the house down' (I actually stole that line during a play when the scenery did collapse during the show--but I'd forgotten where it came from originally)? And what about 'Winter Was Warm' and Belle and her snow globe at the window?

I knew the 'Grinch' had been clipped of a few verses of "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" and the last seconds of delicate harmony of "...glory to the new-born King" axed from Charlie Brown. And what about the full-lenght 'Misfits' song from the earliest version of "Rudolph"? But it seemed like about 15 minutes of Magoo was missing somewhere.

I was never a fan of UPA's styling but it beats Hanna-Barbera for style and heart by a mile. To me there are a few specials I MUST see every holiday: The Grinch, Charlie Brown, and Magoo. And...yes...my mother DID make 'razzleberry dwessing' every year. Oh, and savy Toonheads will quickly argue that the voice of Tiny Tim is absolutely NOT June Forray! Listen carefully--Ms. Forray has a slight husky throatyness to her voice--Smurfette is a perfect example and you can hear it in Rocket J. Squirrel, too. This voice is absolutely smooth. Compare it to Cindy Lou Who and you'll agree--aside from the fact that she would definitely have been credited as usual, as she is argueably the greatest of all female voice artists, and in the top three with Mel Blanc and Paul Frees.
