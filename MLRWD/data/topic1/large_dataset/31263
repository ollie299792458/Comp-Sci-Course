The movie is nothing short of incredible. While the mini series was even better since it had more time to recreate those periods of boredom which  are described in the book in such meticulous, almost boring detail, I could  watch the movie on DVD, which meant DD5.1 soundtrack. The sound effects  alone would warrant the 5 stars, but... there is more. The picture. It's  fantastic, but we're used to that on DVD. Nevertheless, I found it quite  exceptional in its quality. The Making of... is a masterpiece in itself,  astounding you with creativity of the movie crew as well as their quest for  ultimate realism.  And then there's the movie itself. You feel as if you  were part of the crew, cursing your heart for beating so loud when there's  an English destroyer above you. You scarcly get to see the sunlight, and  when you do, it appears almost mocking. From the hilarious beginning, free  of any political correctness (no, they're not advertising for Nazis, if  that's what you think) to the end, which is, to put it mildly, shocking,  you never truly enjoy the movie in the traditional sense of the word.  You're scared, wet with sweat, you can hardly breathe...  It's the lost  great Greek tragedy, uncovered only now. You'll turn off your DVD player  sad, perhaps crying, but somehow, you will feel cleansed. And that's what  Greek tragedy is all about.
