I agree with an earlier review that it's very hard to rate this movie with conventional measures. In my opinion there are three areas where you could rate:
1) Credibility; sometimes very poor - even unaceptable for hard-core sci-fi fans:
Sometimes you really have to close your eyes and go through it in order not to waste the "mood", since the used tools and story twists are close to ridiculous. E.g. the printed tissues they lay on one's face to connect to the brain.
2) Visual effects; unprecedented:
Not only the cgi visuals are very good but also "standard" visual effects are sometimes extraordinary. E.g. where Vince walks down stairs and drags cloths behind him which span the entire room. Salvador Dali might have loved this picture. It offers some very interesting surrealistic impressions. Unfortunately they're sometimes extremely pervert and disgusting... but in the end that's what it's all about..
3) The idea; "To get into a murderer's mind":
This is actually the only part where I could be persuaded to recommend this movie to someone. For me it's like a game, playing with thoughts and ideas what a psycho's mind, his fantasy and dreams could look like.
Summary: It's not a movie for everybody - not even for the audience who's interested in horror movies. I get the feeling that the viewer sometimes should get offended and sometimes intrigued. Maybe it just uses some pseudo psychological knowledge to draw a plot but maybe there's more behind it ?
