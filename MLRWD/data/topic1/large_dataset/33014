I was almost expecting to be disappointed by this movie because of all the critic bashing of it I'd seen.  This is a good movie with many memorable scenes.  I believe the director's cut also flows better than I believe the original version did.  The DC version first establishes Alexander as the man he was - conqueror, leader, inspirer of men, strong willed.....and then, reverts back to him as a young man before his father was assasinated.  I must say, some of the bad reviews on I've seen here seem downright juvenille.  It's okay not to like a movie and say why but to resort to some of the things I've seen makes

me doubt the validity of the message itself.

  Anyway, Colin Ferrell did a good job........maybe a bit of overacting here and there.  And I can see where some critics say he came off as a 'crybaby'.....but that was maybe just one small scene.  All in all his acting is passionate and he projects the leadership and drive the real man must have had.  The battle of Galgamela.....awesome and worth the price of admission.  Other telling and memorable scenes were - Alexander showing all he could ride the horse Bucephalus....Phillip taking his son on a tour of the cave to recount the history of the titans and gods.  The wedding celebration where Alexander is insulted by a guest and then berated by his father.  The battle in India.......all great scenes and well done by Mr. Stone.  Some themes in the movie were a bit overdone I thought...sexuality here and there....and perhaps his mother like snakes a bit too much.....but this is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  All in all  a good movie which closely parallels his real life.  Powerful scenes that are well complimented by Vangelis' musical score.  Worth the time to watch and if you don't know anything about Alexander, you may be saying as my wife did as we watched the battle where Alexander drove Darius from the battlefield....." Did this really happen? "
