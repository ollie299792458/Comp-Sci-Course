I haven't ready of the books, I won't lie to you about that.

I haven't seen much Sci-Fi beyond what's universally known (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.)

But I will still tell you this much...

This is one of the best mini-series I have ever watched.  You get everyting in this, drama, suspense, action and so much more.

If you're planning on buying this to get a war miniseries, an all out action miniseries, or even a "cool and trippy" sci-fi miniseries, this may not be for you.

It's so much deeper than that and unfortunately I don't think a lot of people will be able to appreciate it.  That being said, if you're in the mood for a good story, I'd recommend this one.

I would however behoove you to check out the first miniseries,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000639EV">Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Miniseries) (Director's Cut Special Edition)</a> , before watching this one, if only to get a full appreciation and understanding of what's going on.
