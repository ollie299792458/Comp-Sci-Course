I totally agree with most of the reviewers that loved the film, so I am not going to repeat all the praise. I just want to add a strange element which I haven't found anyone else mentioning it (as yet) and which gives, possibly, one more interesting view of the story; unfortunately a sad view. The main character, Asa, has just returned home after completing his stint in the Russian navy. But, why the Russian navy? He is a Kazakh and Kazakhstan is a landlocked country. A sailor from a landlocked country, and even more so, a sailor from the steppe? Apparently Kazakhstan does have a Navy, but, according to "Wikipedia", this is limited to a small number of boats in the Caspian Sea, which is a lake; a huge lake but still a lake. So, why does the film have him serve in the Russian navy and posted in the far away Pacific ocean? There might be a military cooperation agreement between Russian and Kazakhstan but I haven't traced something like that on the Internet. Is Asa putting us on? Is this just an element like all his other tall stories about huge octopuses, etc? Is it just a subconscious wish? A wish to bring the water element into the arid steppe? Of course, another element to tie in with this water theme is his friend's, Boni, favorite song: "By the rivers of Babylon".

The film is set in a steppe, without much water around. Animals are suffering because of the arid conditions but the two main characters are associated with water symbols. Well, symbolisms for water abound and they are generally associated with water as source of life; however, the film doesn't point to a very optimistic future for this traditional way of life. If Tulpan is the only suitable bride left in the steppe and she is going away, this society is finished. A pessimistic ending in a film that is definitely more upbeat than indicated by all these comments. It is an achievement for Dvortsevoy, the director, that he can present this dead-end in an uplifting, sympathetic and often oddly funny way.
