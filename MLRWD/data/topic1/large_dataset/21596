STAND BY ME- a golden movie.  It is the story told in flashback by an adult form of one of the main characters, and set in the late 50's.  Four boys, Chris Chambers (played by the magnificently talented River Phoenix) Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern tessio (Jerry O'Connel) decide to sneak off from their sleepy Oregon town to find the body of a missing boy their own age.  Along the way they get through leeches, an evil tempered junkyard man and his dog, and numerous way-too-close train encounters.  The film is full of all those little details, like old song tunes and show jingles, that make a movie classic.

All four boys are varying misfits, so there's the dynamic of their personal struggles as well as that of four 13 yr old boys hiking through the wilderness of Oregon.  With a wonderful core cast, and a supporting cast of Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, and Bradley Gregg.

I remeber my brother and all his friends watching this movie when they were little, and me, even smaller, just watching quietly from a corner.  The movie always stuck in my mind.  I love STAND BY ME; so skin it.  Deffinately check this movie out.
