I lost 20 pounds in 3 months, and have 45 more to go.  Diet alone wasn't doing it, so I bought this to alternate with a couple other exercise DVD's so I wouldn't get bored.  I have a toddler, and it's very hard to do floor exercises without my daughter hanging off my legs or tripping me.

These DVD's are perfect for me!  I can do them when my daughter is around without fear that I'm going to whack her in the head with my leg.  She marches along too!  I save the DVD's with floor exercises for when she naps.

The 1 mile is great for when I don't have much time but I want to exercise, and the 2 mile makes me work up a sweat.  It's great because before you know it, you walked the 2 miles.  Leslie is a little overly perky, but she keeps me going.

I haven't tried the 3 mile yet, but I'm sure it's just as good as the other 2.

I have only been using these DVD's for a week, but I can already notice that I can walk farther and faster in real life than I could before without getting tired.
