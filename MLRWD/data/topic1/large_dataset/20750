Richard Price is my favourite author. From Clockers to Freedomland and Samaritan, his stories haunt and stay with you. Unlike Clockers and the Wanderers (other great Price novels turned into pretty good movies), this movie adaptation - Freedonland - was painful to watch. Shudders. How a story with such potential was converted into this lame piece, is baffling. It had everything about it that should have fallen right into place. But Julianne Moore is possibley the most abysmal and insipid actress to begin with - and in this role does not break with tradition. Scripting in general was pretty bad but boy you just can't help but shake your head watching Moore in an even worse than usual performance (she even manages to bring down Jackson's performance). This should have been handled like Mystic River or Law and Order instead of like Homicide Life on the Street with the tricky camera angles and choppy dialogue. Man, glad I didn't drop 15 bucks for the movie ticket! I hope that the next Price book come movie is handled and casted more carefully.
