I really enjoyed Defending Your Life. It started about twenty years ago when my mother rented the film to help me cope with my fear of dying as a teenager. Blessed with a strong memory, I re-rented the film on Netflix years later and loved it so much I decided to buy it. There are several reasons why. First, I could relate better to the characters since they did not take on strange appearances in the afterlife (i.e. broad Marvel-style superpowers, sci-fi alien structures). Second, I loved many of the lines used in the screenplay, particularly from leads Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep. Finally, I felt I was able to learn things that I could also use during my time on Earth, most notably overcoming my fears. While I don't really believe in reincarnation as the world was presented there, I do believe the choices we make have long-term, sometimes eternal, consequences. Therefore, I strive to do the best I can with what I have and hope others do the same. Additionally, the film seems to be underrated. Granted, many films and other media sources can discuss life and death in a variety of forms, but a big reason I connected so well is because it is sentimental and, to a great degree, simplified. I hope this film has helped others, even in a smaller cult following.
