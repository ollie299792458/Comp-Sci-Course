After having had my mind bewitched and my senses ensnared by Alan Rickman after watching him in the Harry Potter movies I started looking up Rickman clips on YouTube and then I decided that I needed my own collection of Alan Rickman movies. Sense and Sensibility is the first AR film I've purchased. It is glorious and beautiful and most likely the most perfect example of a Rickman movie, save for Harry Potter. The whole movie is wonderful and I've watched it several times already. Emma Thompson and Ang Lee did everything so perfectly that I cannot find fault with this movie. It is everything a romantic English drama should be and all of the actors were perfectly cast. Of course my favorite is Alan Rickman, but I loved the chemistry and dynamics between all of the principals. Hugh Grant is really sweet and gorgeous in this movie too and Emma Thompson is beyond reproach. Probably the best scene in this movie is at the end between Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, but I won't describe it just in case you have not yet seen this movie. It was awesome and it made me cry.  Kate Winslet was great too, although her character is kind of a pain in the neck. This film is what a great romantic story is all about, unlike Titanic in which I thought the script and the dialogue were ridiculous and dreadful and there was a total lack of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, which is too bad, because Winslet is a fabulous actor. Now for the question all us romantics have asked ourselves: Why would anyone choose Willoughby over Alan Rickman???  Here's another thought for all the Harry Potter fans. Wouldn't it be great to see a whole movie about Severus Snape in heaven with Lily, played by Kate Winslet?
