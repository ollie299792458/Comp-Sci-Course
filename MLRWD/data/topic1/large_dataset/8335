This version of Eraser is Region 1 and is uncut as opposed to the Region 2 dvd and vhs copies which are cut by a couple of minutes(certainly the copies i own).I saw this film in the cinema back in '96 i think.
 The picture quality i think is quite good.The special effects hold up well,especially the guns, even Arnold's airplane exit looks good,the crocodiles look well too,except when Arnold shoots one in the head,but still a lot better than some effects today.There are probably a few places where there is some fuzz but not that you'd notice unless you went out of your way.
  The sound is good,great bass and even dialogue.No extra's just like my dvd copy!
The film itself is good,a couple of parts between Arnold and James Caan were a bit over done,dialogue wise.The actings fine,the late Robert Pastorelli is quite good in his role(he was great in Murphy Brown).
  Arnold is solid(no pun)in his role as is Caan.
 Oh yeah this is a region 1 blu-ray,you can't buy it over here,it's region free though. Overall worth the cash,which wasn't much anyway.
