This is probably Disney's most unique choice for one of their musical animated motion pictures. And the result was something beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly touching. I wish people wouldn't give a  horrible review of this film just because it didn't stick with the book  plot or because it's "not kid-friendly". My brother first saw  this movie when he was five or six, and he had no problem with it. And  while Disney's ending is much different than Victor Hugo's (I'm reading the  book, and I must say I _prefer_ Disney's ending), the truths in the book  remain in the film. What makes a monster and what makes a man?  This is  something everyone, child, teen,  or adult, should learn. I also like when  Quasimodo says to Frollo, "All my life you've told me the world is a  dark, cruel place. But now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about  it is people like _you_!" The world has evil in it, but it also has so  much good, and that's what this story is about. I love that. The music is  beautiful, the characters wonderful. My brother likes the gargoyles, but my  favorite was Clopin, the self-proclaimed gypsy king. If you see this movie  for no other reason, see it to hear this guy sing. What a voice!  Clopin is  a great character because he knows more than he says, he has all these  secrets but won't tell. He's the one that poses the "riddle" in  the beginning of the film: Who is the monster and who is the man?  It's a  great introduction. He steals the show in every scene he's in.  I imagine  Disney must get tired of cutesy-mouse/bear/princess flims and decided to  take a chance with something just a little bit darker, a little bit lighter  (in more ways than one), and a little bit deeper. Give "The Hunchback  Of Notre Dame" a chance. You may be surprised. To the bells of Notre  Dame!
