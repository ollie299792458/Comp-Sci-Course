I like western movies. When I first saw it I thought it was boring,but later when Scott Glenn(Emett) and Kevin Kline(Paden) go to rescue Kevin Caster(Jake). I kept on wondering the whole time that what will happen next because the was so interesting, especially the part when Kevin Kline(PADEN), Scott Glenn(Emett), Danny Glover(Mal), Kevin Cartner(Jake) reunite and defeat the cruel and selfish bad guys. I did not feel like getting of my seat even when the movie ended because I wished there was more of the movie. The soundtrack was also pretty interesting. It was kind of the music which heroes use when they come into rescue. The music was also the one which plays in the army when soldiers march in the parade or into battle. It is also the victory music. The whole 132 minutes were cool! The fights in the movie were kind of real-life likein the wild west.I do not care if the movie was fake or real, all I care is that the movie was interesting. All the stunts in the movie were cool espically when Kevin Cortner(Jake) nephew jumps from the building on the horse. It was the second best western movies. The first best was THE WILD WILD WEST. Also the stunts,talking,moves.speed, and qualties all make the movieslook different in their own way. There are preety cool  stunts in western movies and also when the cowboys are riding,shooting,or jumping in a mad way it kind of looks wierd because if a cowboy gets shot, the other cowboy will not figures out, wheither he is having fun or is he deying. Some cowboys also talk in a way as well. I can not figure out how the cowboys keep on shooting even when the bullets run out.This is what I think about western movies and Silverado.
