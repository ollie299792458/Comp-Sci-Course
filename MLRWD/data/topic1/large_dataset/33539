Well i have to hand it to all of you who already added reviews citing poor visual quality w/ this blu ray transfer. It's true and it dropped my rating of this movie from a 4 to a 3, although it will always be a classic that brings me back to the golden age of action/adventure movies, the 80's.
Realistically speaking, i do understand that the analog video media of 1984 did have quality shortcomings as compared to the digital media of today, that goes without saying. But regardless of this movie being in the 16.9 1080p blu-ray format or not, the "graininess" of the picture was in fact way too noticable for me. Not on all but on many occassions, especially in some of my favorite action parts (battle with Gozer and Stay Puft M-man, the crossing proton beams end-scene) as well as comedy highlights like Weaver's body floating off the bed and Venkman's showdown in the mayor's office with "this man has no dick" Peck.
I did notice the colors of the film to be somewhat more vivid than the DVD version, but the sound whether you run thru 5.1 or 7.1 surround is standard, nothing really "jumping out" or impressive in the soundtrack. Ray Parker Jr's famous hit title song actually sounds kind of "mono" like while its playing on the main menu screen, and this is with full 5.1 Dolby or 5 Channel Stereo setting on my system.
Extras on the disk are OK but nothing too special. All in all, I do recommend this movie in this format if you're hell bent on upgrading your entire DVD collection or you're the type who "has to have" blu-ray regardless of quality. Keep in mind, the DVD version of this movie also has the graininess and sound imperfections i mentioned earlier. But if visual defects are the least of your worries, then save yourself at least 15 bucks and get the DVD. You'll pat yourself on the back later!
