Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.

I made two previous attempts to try to explain my point but as I started reading the other reviews I found one that explains everything I was trying to say.  One review stated the following:

I gave this 5 stars because men who rape women deserve an awful death.

Why?  When is it justifiable for a man to take revenge by killing a woman?  This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.  To defend your self is one thing but to intentionally want to kill is simply murder.  The fictional female character (not the actor) in that story should be sent to prison for life for her alone deciding to be the Judge, Jury and Executioner.  I also despise movies where the man does the same thing.  But, it is only a movie.

I gave this movie 1 star because you have to give it one.  Yet, that one review makes my point about the majority of these kind of movies.  Movies should stick more to reality when they are doing a film about something that could happen.

If this movie really is based on a true story than it is sick.
