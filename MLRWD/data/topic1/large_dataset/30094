I enjoyed this movie.  I think Gerard Butler did a great job, similar to Hopkins characterization of Lechter, showing just hints of emotional reaction (except when faking it).  Maybe a mad man, maybe not.  Foxx did a good job with his role as well.

I don't want to say too much, and don't read on if you haven't seen this film.  It's exciting, it's worth seeing, I personally was disappointed a bit by the ending . . . you might love it.

Towards the end, I was disappointed by the sudden 'breakdown' of cleverness, and the lack of backup alternatives, from an otherwise ingenious individual (maybe he just couldn't foresee even a single problem, but that didn't seem likely, given his intellectual abilities).  I would have loved a more 'Silence of the Lambs' like ending, with a bit more growth from Foxx's character (everyone around him seemed to be learning from the devastation . . . what was his problem?).

Still, I enjoyed watching this, and it kept me rivetted until very close to the end.  I think it's worth trying if you haven't seen it.  I suspect there are many who will enjoy the ending as well.
