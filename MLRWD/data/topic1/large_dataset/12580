A man called Truman (Jim Carrey) lives on an island somewhere. The life inside is quite normal for him. He looks like a current guy who works in an office, but actually, he's the most regarded man in the world. I explain: the whole island is in fact a hidden TV studio, full of cameras placed everywhere in order to follow him, because he is the main part of the programme on television. All people know this, but Truman doesn't, so they act to make the stage a normal city. However, he begins to notice some weird events, for example, the surprise of seeing his dead father like a beggar in the street and a large amount of people who suddenly bring him away.
 This movie is so funny because of these incidents, which make you understand the trick and laugh all the time. Nevertheless, when he realizes all this, you see that it isn't funny at all, because he feels he's been living in an illusory world. Nobody loves him in fact, so he decides to escape out of the island in order to find a place with no lies. All is a trap. In this moment you see his frustration because of the incapability of being able to do that inside his comical appearance. This is the first movie in which Jim Carrey stars in with a serious portrayal, despite he's amusing in many moments.
 I liked it a lot. It is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen because of the so entertaining situations in which he gets involved. Also, the comedy turns into a drama at the end. Will he finish living in a world where real people exist and love, without lies nor being the point of attention to everybody? Anyway, even being the man who attracts all people's interest, nobody cares about him when he crosses the door outside the island to an unknown place and they just finish up by ignoring him and choosing another channel.
