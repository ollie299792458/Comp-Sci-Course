I had somewhat high expectations for this movie based on what some others told me about it.  I'm a fairly big fan of general Kung-fu type movies, so was looking forward to seeing this one.  It's kind of a mixed bag.  The best way to describe it is its similar to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode but with new footage instead of just offbeat comments.
There are several laugh out loud moments in it, especially at the beginning of the movie.  But after watching half the movie, the jokes get kind of stale and repetitive and it gets less and less interesting.  The last 20 minutes were just bad and there wasn't really anything funny at all going on in them.
Overall I'm giving it 2 stars.  It had good potential, but it just ran out of steam halfway through and made it a chore to actually finish it.  It did have some great individual lines/parts though, especially during the first half.  It's also incredibly short, just 81 minutes - which is good, because it would have been hard to really sit through anymore.
