Ouch... that was my first response to the workout afterwards. I found it exhilarating, and fun. First I started out with Kristin McGees Mtv Pilates dvd, which is a nice pace and good workout. After a month I wanted something more challenging, and I found this! I wont lie, I am NOT Ms. Iron Abs, so this workout burned every part of my body. And I mean EVERY part. The cardio blasts get your heart rate up, and really focuses on your leg strength. Then the pilates parts are just ridiculous (for someone just starting). Some of the moves she does look like something only a ninja could do. I've only attempted the workout flow 1. But you will get stronger, and it does get easier. Just be ready to be sore afterwards. I love it, and recommend it.

Update:
I've been doing this dvd for a month now 6 days a week, while wearing an ab wrap, and I've lost 11lbs. Be ready to sweat like crazy in Flow 2 of this dvd. Honestly I've never felt this kind of strength in my core ever. This is now apart of my everyday routine, and I can see the difference. If you can push yourself, and want a stronger core, this dvd is definitely for you!
