Date Night brings together Steve Carell and Tina Fey - to star in a hilarious comedy that every married couple can relate to.

Phil and Clare are a married couple with children who go on a weekly date night routine to  keep some spice in their marriage. During a book club meeting with friends, Phil  and Claire discover that friends of theirs are divorcing because the flame has died in their marriage.

So the next date night Phil and Claire go to "the city" to a new restaurant Claire has read about, but are denied a table because they don't have reservations. While waiting at the bar, the couple hear a reservation called for the Triplehorn party, which no one replies to.

Phil decides to pretend they are the Triplehorn party, and that sets the stage for the rest of the movie- that is a wild adventure for Phil and Claire. A case of mistaken identity leaves the couple fighting for their life.

 I don't want to give too much away, but both my husband and I laughed out loud during the entire movie.

 A must see!
