This is the sleeper movie of the decade and easily the best dark comedy I have seen... period.

First of we all know this is a spoof and is supposed to be funny. And it really is! But who knew there was going to be some serious depth to it.

The script had tons of foreshadowing. When you watch this movie the second time you start cracking up at the characters you see before they are zombies and the part they played. I have not seen such funny and creative foreshadowing in a movie ... period.

The romantic conflict was well done. Questions are raised about what a relationship is supposed to be like and the role others play in a relationship. It even had a great fight scene that I have to say resembles more than a few I have had in my lifetime.

The inner conflict as the main character becomes acutely aware of his life wasting away was almost inspiring... in a funny lazy sort of way.

The zombies were suitably creepy and had bits of fright amongst the laughs.

You care about the characters because of all the internal and relationship conflict and the roles are very well acted out. Amazingly well, acted out.

I have to give warning due to the language and gore but if you can hack it, get this movie you will not be dissapointed.
