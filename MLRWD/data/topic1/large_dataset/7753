I am a *huge* fan of the original 'Ginger Snaps'.  By that, I mean that I have been responsible for some 40 or so people seeing that film who never would have seen it otherwise.  I have bought 5 copies of it for friends.  I have sent copies of the initial Canadian pressing to the US, with all of its glorious extras and widescreen presentation that weren't available on the initial disc.  I have, in other words, done my very best to ensure that everyone I know who might be even slightly interested has seen 'Ginger Snaps'.  
Therefore, it was with a touch of trepidation that I picked up the sequel.  I lived too far from anywhere running it in a theatre to see it properly, and had to wait for the DVD release.  So, release day came, I put the DVD in, and...  
Wow!  What a great movie, and certainly what a great follow-up to the first film!  'Unleashed' starts off with a bang and really doesn't let up until the end.  Throughout the film, we're treated to fantastic performances from Emily Perkins and the rest of the cast, once again mostly female, with the notable exception of the uber-creepy Eric Johnson.  All the ingredients of this film are just as potent in terms of metaphor and things, just in new and different ways.  If you loved 'Ginger Snaps', you'll love 'Unleashed'.  Really!  Also, be aware that the new prequel, 'Ginger Snaps: The Beginning' should be out soon too, and also looks super amazing.
