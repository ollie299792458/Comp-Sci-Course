I've never really been all too interested in the Green Lantern since, as a kid my allowance wouldn't accomidate for a Superman comic + another one. But w/ the animated releases, live action movie, up coming animated series and other things Green Lantern sparked my interest and I decided to give this a shot.

Since I only knew the very basic of basics on the backstory of Hal Jordan, the ring and the Green Lantern Corps., this did a very good job as sort of an introduction to the the mythology. The action was pretty good, the animation was excellent and the stories were very 'to the point' with little unnessecary fluff.

You get 5 stories being told while awaiting a crisis to unfold in present time. Granted some of the stories are better than others but I found them all to be enjoyable. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't really focus on the Hal Jordan character since he's one of the Green Lanterns that's well known, but they do have characters that caught my attention. So much so that I actually purchased a few of the trade paperbacks.

Again, I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of Hal Jordan and during some of the stories they had flashbacks and that is something that makes me roll my eyes. I find flashbacks during flashbacks to be monotonous. But other than that I was very pleased and entertained. Plus the voice acting by Henry Rollins and "Rowdy" Roddy Piper was an unexpected bonus. Die-hard Green Lantern fans seem to be on the fence about this by either loving it or hating every aspect of it but die-hard fans are a very difficult consumer to cater to.

Overall, if you're a Green Lantern fan you're not bothering in reading reviews and are just going to watch it and for people not too familiar w/ the Green Lantern world, this seems like a nice starting point that gives you the jist of what the mythology is all about.
