I'll be honest--I'm not a good movie reviewer.  Out of the hundreds of films I've seen, I can count on one hand those that I felt aren't good.  Motion pictures are an art form, created with many hands to achieve a product that, I believe, is completely subjective.

I'll also go ahead and say that I have always been an avid fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, so it follows that I will obviously like their feature films.  I'm biased, in other words, so stop reading now if you want an objective review.

Despite how well the movie was received by critics, how much money it made at the box office's opening weekend, or any other quantitative method for computing a film's success, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Sure, the destruction of the borg ship in the beginning seemed a little too easily handled and the subsequent time travel to the past (and back to the future at the end) also seemed a little too conveniently done.  Especially given how difficult it has been in Star Trek's past to time travel, one is left to wonder why, after discovering how easy it is by the end of this film, Starfleet doesn't use it all the time, pun intended.

Despite those two plot conveniences, this really is a good action-adventure.  Not very much technobabble, for those who hate it in the series and earlier films, and it's also quite accessible for anyone new to the franchise as a whole.  One might argue that watching the episodes "The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I & II" are necessary before seeing this film, but I disagree.  Just as seeing "Space Seed" (ST:TOS) isn't necessary before watching "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," it does, admittedly, offer more flavor and backstory.

Bottom line:  Excellent action-adventure movie.  Not much meat or drama, but a good romp for anyone who just wants to have a fun time.
