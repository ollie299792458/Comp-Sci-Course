In the continuing tradition of movies that James Spader just can't seem to turn down, "The Watcher" served as yet another vehicle for Spader to perform well in, while the rest of the cast just seemed to go through the motions of acting.  The film had an interesting premise, that of a serial killer that stalks women in order to kill them, but first send photos of his intended victims to a cop that he has drawn into his web of murder.  Unfortunately there are plot holes in this film that I could drive a bread truck through.  For instance, Spader plays a LA cop that quits the force and moves to Chicago so that he can live in squalor, but before you know it, he's serving as a FBI agent hot on the trail of Reeves, over-playing the part of the serial killer.  It was refreshing to see Reeves in a role where he didn't play some sort of goof, but instead was the antagonist of the film, although he acted in his characteristic style.  While the storyline has been played before, the filmmakers decided to spice it up by adding a bit of history to the characters played by Spader and Reeves.  Marisa Tomei plays the psychologist that is helping Spader deal with his inner demons, and of course is eventually confronted by Reeves, and drawn further into the plot of this film.  The special effects are rather cheesy, and when things are set on fire, the flames look particularly cartoonish.  I've certainly seen all three of these actors in better films, but this one is at least worth a rent.
