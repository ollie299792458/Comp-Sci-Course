I admit that I am not the biggest Sandra Bullock "movie" fan. I say "movie" fan because as you all know, she has been type cast as a romantic movie actress. Romantic films are not my general preference. Although, when done well, a romantic comedy can be refreshing! Furthermore, I must state that my previous and further stated opinions are soley based on personal movie preferences, and not the quality of Sandra Bullock's work.
  The best way to describe this film is that it hits a home run, or in reference to the movie, scores the winning touchdown! Based on true events, it paints images of a teenage boy in need of a helping hand, and a loving family who takes him in as one of their own. Despite her previous roles, the most amusing thing in this film was Sandra Bullock's witty diologue. I realize that she has previously acted in non-romantic movies. However, this film really shows her dynamic ability as an actress. The only thing that I would have changed about this film is to have the character of Miss Sue, played by Kathy Bates, as a more prominent character.
  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It has a solid story. The development really makes you care about the characters. It is very lighthearted. Although there is the ever-expected "sob scene", the entire movie was a strait shot for the goal line! This movie is very significant in the way that I can't think of one other new movie worth comparison!
