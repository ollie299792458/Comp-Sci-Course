The first time I watched this movie, shortly after its release, when I was a small lad, something struck me as "different" about this movie. The direction was good, the plot was VERY simple, and the acting was  wonderful, with plenty of comedic and ironic elements.
However after  watching it again during my high school years, I remember picking out  dozens of metaphorical and symbolic items from the plot. Every evil or  destructive force in Joe's life is symbolized by the company logo that the  film features at the beginning, right down to the lightning bolt featured  prominently later in the film. The fact that every woman important to Joe  is the same girl, the lovely Meg Ryan, carries the theme of recurrence  quite well.
To sum it up, Joe is an individual who has died, if not in  reality, in spirit, stuck in a dead-end job after personal crises drove him  to hypochondria. He discovers he is terminally ill, then is confronted by  an eccentric millionare who wants Joe to sacrifice himself to a volcano on  a small polynesian island to secure mining rights for his superconductor  company. Joe proceeds to go on an endless stream of discovery, realizing  that while he may be dying, he was never more alive. The recurring themes  in this movie, such as the jagged line logo, Meg Ryan's appearance, his  luggage, and the bizarre but likeable characters he's confronted with  throughout make this movie seem more like a vision quest for Joe than the  last few weeks of his life.
The plot is simple, but hides deeper meanings  and morals, like any great fairy tale. This is possibly the best movie I  have ever seen, and very worthy of purchase.
Now if they'd just put it on  DVD.
