Apparently, this is all real and the film is an actual documentary -- cuz you probably couldn't write stuff this funny! Wow.

"We're gonna use your California ID and pawn one of my guitars to  make this photo shoot happen!"

"Are you ready for this, are you ready? Check it out: tell em to wear f***in' white and come when I call."

"Holy s***, he kicked me in the head!"

That last one is part of one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie in 10 years, maybe ever...

Also amazing: the demented look on Anton's face when he's looking into the club at Zia and she's talking about him not wanting to actually kill them... Precious.

Oh, and the music is just amazingly atrocious!!!! HA-HA-HA-HAAAAAA!!! MWA-HA-HAAAAAAAAA!!!!! I love how the only people saying how brilliant these bands are are the bands themselves and their A&R leeches! Too f-ing funny, man...

P.S. -- After you watch this, buy Da Capo by Love, just to restore balance in the universe.
