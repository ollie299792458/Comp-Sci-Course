I had a strong reaction to people's negative comments about this movie... I must admit, when I saw the movie in the theater, I can remember it being much more fast-paced then when I saw it for the second time on dvd in the 2000s...I also remember it being funnier...And I suppose the special effects are not up to modern standards... But to call Time Bandits "dated, dumb, and dull," as one reviewer wrote, is in my opinion a great injustice to a great movie.

People have to realize- Time Bandits is NOT truly a comedy or even a fantasy/sci fi movie- and those elements of comedy and sci fi/fantasy that exist in the movie are incidental to its true purpose:  being a social/philosophical commentary on the evils/perversions that technology, when left unchecked, can impose on us (or more accurately: how we impose technology on ourselves and others, especially our children), and how people can lose their souls when they love and desire things, money, and power instead of  people/living things, morals, and love- which are the truly important things in life. And considering how more than ever before (because there is more technology and things available to us than ever before), almost all of we Americans are about our things, acquiring more things, and having more than the Joneses next door, I think Time Bandits is MUCH more relevant, and has much more to teach us NOW, than when it came out (1981).

Since my second viewing of Time Bandits, I have watched the movie more times, and it grows on me more every time. I love the points Time Bandits subtly makes, as well as the thoughts, imagination, ideas, ideals, and feelings of adventure it provokes... I love the general feel that the movie has. Time Bandits is a great movie, and is considered to be a cult-classic by many-  but if you are only into the all-too common modern mindless cookie-cutter films, which lack any real deepness, originality or imagination, you might want to rent this one first before purchasing it.
