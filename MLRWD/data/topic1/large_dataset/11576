In 1999 "Joan of arc" received two updated film adaptions. One was a big budget motion picture titled "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc" which starred singer/actress Milla Jovovich. The other was a simple made for TV movie called "Joan of Arc" starring Leelee Sobieski. Hollywood's sudden renewed interest in the character of Joan was basically an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the TV series XENA (about a warrior princess).

The film "The Messenger" took the "warrior princess" approach, concentrating on action over substance. The finished product actually displayed none of the qualities that made Xena a hit TV show and played like a low-grade "Braveheart meets Conan meets Red Sonja". Simply put, it's a horrible film.

The writers and producers of the made for TV movie "Joan of Arc" decided to take the high road. Instead of churning out just another throw-away "action flick", they assembled an incredible cast and then backed them up with an amazing script. The result is perhaps the best film version of the "Joan of Arc" story and a movie that anyone can enjoy regardless of religious beliefs.

Leelee Sobieski is perfect as Joan, I cannot imagine anyone bringing more to this role than she does. Peter Strauss proves once again that he's a very underated actor. Peter O'Toole delivers an incredible performance, certainly one of his all time best! Shirley MaClaine, Maximillian Schell, and yes, even Neil Patrick Harris deliver fine performances!

The last half hour of this film will have you riveted to the screen. Not by showcasing mindless action, but by the sheer power of the script and the incredible performances by O'toole and Sobieski. I highly recommend this wonderful film!
