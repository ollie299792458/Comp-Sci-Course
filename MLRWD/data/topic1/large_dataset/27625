Who knew that a kids movie made in 1979 would still be entertaining to me AND my two-year-old daughter many years later?  With all the technological advances, it seems this movie would be too "simple" for us now, but it's as great as ever!  I can remember all the hullabaloo about it when I was a kid....Kermit rides a bike!!!  Now, my daughter, who normally won't sit through a full-length feature film, is in love with the Muppets....especially Kermit.  The great Paul Williams did a wonderful job with the music in this movie (even making a cameo!--as do many other stars of the era: Bob Hope, Madeline Kahn, Richard Pryor, Carol Kane, Milton Berle, Elliott Gould, Charles Durning,etc).  The music is upbeat, sarcastic (only the adults will get that part!) and a joyful noise!  Sure, there are imperfections.....it's a little fuzzy here and there, and it was OBVIOUSLY made in 1979, but that's part of the fun of it.  The first time I watched it, I loved that the opening credits looked like something I saw in the movie theatre as a child.  My daughter doesn't know the difference (as most kids won't notice!), but it brought back a feeling of nostalgia for her dear old mom!  If you remember the movie from your childhood, you'll love it just as much now....maybe more (I do!).  Give your children a chance to share the joy and fall in love with Kermit and Miss Piggy....not to mention Gonzo and Camilla!  Dance and sing to the music of Paul Williams, and sing every word of "The Rainbow Connection"----you know you remember it!
