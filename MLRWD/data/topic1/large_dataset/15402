This season was great. IT was very emotional, It was definitly the saddest season. The first episode when you first get to really see buffy back from the dead she's so quiet and gloomy. Then Dawn telling here how hard it's been for her without Buffy.  That sets the whole theme for the season. It almost made me cry when Buffy sings to the scooby gang that they took her from Heaven. I loved the Spike-Buffy relationship, I thought they were so Hot together. I loved the Musical episode, I thought it was well written and really moved the plot along. IT was really funny too. I loved the episode where everyone loses their memory it was hysterical. Anya and giles thinking they were engaged, spike believing giles is his father. It was so sad when Giles tells Buffy he has to go, he's just holding her back. Then at the end of the season when Willow wants to end the world, buffy has to try to save it when the whole season she hasn't really wanted to live, she's been miserable, and she finally realizes how much she wants to live.
