I didn't expect much from this movie. I was hoping for just something fun to watch on a Saturday night. What I was left with was a movie that highlights everything that is wrong with the movie industry today. This film looks great, sounds great, has great special effects, and even has decent actors in it. So what's wrong? That is all it has. It is poorly written.

The idea of the film is interesting, battle robots meets professional boxing. They took that and packaged it with a father and son coming together story. I could still be on board with this, but than they take an annoying six year old kid and make him the smartest person in the movie. And that is not to say he is smart, it is just that the rest of the adult characters are unbelievably stupid. Hugh Jackman's character is out right despicable and makes decisions in the movie that are almost comedic.

The whole movie is just lazy. Most of the scenes are drawn out and elude to events or ideas we never learn anything more about. Even the premise that the father and son luck upon a fully functional world class boxing robot in a junkyard is lazy. After a quick hose off of the bot, the worn down Jackman and totally inexperienced monster child are ready to conquer the world of robot boxing. All this being said, they still are able to drag the movie out over 2 hours.

I know the idea of the film is silly, but a better story with better developed characters could of made this something more. Instead we get another Michael Bay like film, which younger people can't wait to fork over their money to see. This is why less and less adults are going to the movies, the shows on television are far superior when it comes to the writing and that is a driving force behind any story, not special effects or big name actors.
