Harrison Ford the everyman man's man is back as Jack Ryan, the uncoruptable, loyal CIA agent based on the chracter created by novelist Tom Clancey. This time around Jack is acting CIA Director Who faces betrayal and trechery from his own goverment when trying to capture a Columbian Drug Lord responsble for murdering the U.S President's best friend &amp; Family. Great action sequences especally when Jack &amp; his men were trapped under fire during a terroist attack. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER Is much more of drama with action blended in rather than it's predesscor PATRIOT GAMES(1992)was an all battle of cat &amp; mouse between good and evil. I hope Ford one day will do another installment of the Jack Ryan trilogy because with Ford's acting style you know it won't turn into a James Bond routine. Even though when Jack Ryan was hanging onto the rails of the Heloicopter during the cliamatic finale it looked liked a scene cut out of a James Bond film. Nevethless a truly magnifcent performence from one of Hollywood's Best.
