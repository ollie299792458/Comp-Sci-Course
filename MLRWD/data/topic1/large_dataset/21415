The story of mutiny on HMS Bounty has been told and retold many times. It may be classified as an allegory for what power and corruption can generate (think American Revolution).  When people are pushed too far, either in reality or in their own mind, the result is backlash, such as occurred on HMS Bounty. There have been many theatrical versions of MOTB from the first in 1916 to the last Gibson-Hopkins version in 1984. The most notable were the 1962 Marlon Brando and the 1935 Clark Gable versions.  Of all, the most memorabe one was the 1935 run.  The acting was top-notch and showed a compassionate Fletcher Christian torn between duty and human responsibility culminating in the mutiny in the 1780s. On the flip side was the superb rendition of Captain William Bligh by the indomitable Charles Laughton, one of the greatest actors ever to grace stage and screen. Like a politician, Laughton displays a man who is doing everything to insure his future comfort at whatever expense to his conscience or to others. He is totally self-centered with little regard for his men and possesses a somewhat sadistic flair.  The entire film is enjoyable from beginning to end and draws the viewer in with it. Now for the 2-star presentation! It appears that this was a straight transfer from a previously produced VHS Print. One wishes that Criterion could have gotten into the act since they do not usually put out a product unless it has been pain-stakingly restored with images that are clear and sharp as the original film was (Hint to major studios releasing their films).  Overall, however, the rating remains 10 on a one-ten scale for one of the finest motion picturs ever produced.
