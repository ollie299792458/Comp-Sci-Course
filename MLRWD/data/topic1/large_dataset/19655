Dario Argento has again pulled out all the stops to create a most effective horror film.  His style should be known by now and again his use of camera shots and colours are quite effective in this film.  A daughter of a popular movie star is the protagonist in this film as she can see visions and control insects to solve, yet again, like David Hemmings in Deep Red, a series of brutal killings in Switzerland.  Donald Pleasance adds the contemporary English prescence as does Jessica Connelly as the American student plagued with sleep walking disorders and out of control telekinetic powers, hence that this movie was directed at American audiences.  Again, Dario Argento presents to us a situation out of control and tries to show how those who are involved in them try to cope with them.  In this case &lt;I cannot reveal all&gt; a murderer is loose trying to cover up the crimes of a supposed pyschopath.  Only Dario Argento can use lighting and wind effects to show a mood and he does this so well while conveying a story. This is a very moody film, a bit dark in places, but again that sets the tone for the mind of the killer.  Jessica uses her telekinesis to full effect to find a brutal murderer and succeeds in spades, up to and almost including her own life.  The characters are a bit woody in places, as they really are just props in this film, but the overall affect is pure horror and a showcase for more grisly death scenes.  The ending of this is really a shocker and for those who do not know this, Jessica Connelly REALLY DID swim in a pool of live maggots in this film. The use of insects and a primate also keep us aware that others outside of us can sense things too, a very clever aspect to use. This film is rarely talked about or seen, but thanks to DVD and today's accessability, it will be and it's more than worth a view.
