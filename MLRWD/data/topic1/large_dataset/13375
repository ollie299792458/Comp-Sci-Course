The film adaptation of the Broadway hit, 1776, was an immensely entertaining movie.  With the magic of imagination and plenty of melody, movie viewers get to see Thomas Jefferson (Ken Howard), John Adams (William Daniels), and Benjamin Franklin (Howard Da Silva) sing and dance.  The film hearkens back to the rollicking entertainment movie musicals of the 1950s, but this is not a Rodgers and Hammerstein production, but a blend of historical fact and fiction set to choreography and music.

Director Peter Hunt brings history alive and shows members of the Continental Congress of 1776 attempting to meet a consensus for independence from British rule.  Indeed, these men were a partisan group from all walks of life, and one can see that in 1776 there had already existed a disturbing divide between North and South amongst the delegates of each respective state, and the issue of slavery; this may be one of the serious aspects of the film as well as the depiction of the writing of the Declaration of Independence.  However, aside from all seriousness, Hunt integrates the humor and the eccentric behavior that was exhibited by each member of the delegation within Independence Hall.  This was displayed in scenes with Adams and Jefferson and Franklin choosing what kind of bird should be used as a symbol of the United States, and their ideas ranged from a turkey to an eagle.  There is also an interesting and somewhat peculiar scene where Franklin is brought into the building where the delegates are gathered, and two men carry him in a carriage as if he was royalty.

Overall, 1776 was a delight to see in DVD form.  The film is pure entertainment and enthusiastically commemorates one of the most monumental events in American history through song and dance.
