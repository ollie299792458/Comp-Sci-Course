I was very disappointed with this series for the first half of it. Each episode was a separate story. About the pain and suffering of an innocent person who seeks revenge on the person who has wronged them. I had a hard time getting into it with no characters to get attached to, but about half the way through just before I was ready to give up on Hell Girl something happened. A plot began to form. A freelance journalist and his 10 year old daughter were introduced. Hajime, the freelance journalist, was investigating the Hell Girl phenomenon; and his daughter Tsugumi, who had a psychic connection with the Hell Girl, began following the people who were seeking revenge and tried to talk them out of it. Their interference was quite an annoyance to Hell Girl and her servants. After Hajime and Tsugumi got involved the story got really good. I don't think I've seen an anime that so thoroughly bummed me out in the first half, and rocked my world in the second half. His and Her Circumstances was the opposite. The first half rocked and the second half sucked. I would give Hell Girl 5 stars, but the first half was really a bore. I think 4 stars is generous. All in all I really like this series and I would recommend it to anyone. Just bear with it for about 10 episodes or so.
