The second installment in the Harry Potter Series is this DVD adapted from the book of the same name.  Most people know the story of Harry Potter- he is an orphan boy whose parents were killed by an evil wizard when he was just a baby.  Harry finds out he is a wizard also and is taken to wizard school.  Hogwarts is being terrorized by a mysterious monster who lives in the chamber of secrets and harry must do find out how to save his friends who have been petrified by the monster.  This is a simplied plot but the beauty of this DVD is many.
1.  Faithfulness to the book- Harry potter fans will not be disappointed.  The scenes in this book are awesome, bringing to life the unique world of HP.
2.  Lots of DVD extras- including a brief synopsis of Year one, spellcasting, extra scenes etc
3.  Crazy enchanting characters- like Dobby the house elf, 
This DVD seemed geared for kids, but adult fans of the series will enjoy this film adaptation- but as always, the book is better--read the book first!!!
