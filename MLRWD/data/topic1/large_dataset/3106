As a Peruvian, I have felt deeply insulted by Steven Spielberg. I admire him as a great moviemaker, but this film sinks irremediably in the ocean of the Great Mediocrity. If he ever visited my country, at least he should have made the script previosuly reviewed, by somebody who had visited Peru!!!!

George Lucas, David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson were also the great collaborators for making this movie, one of the greatests BLUNDERS of Cinema history... Where did they get the foolish ideas for the script and the locations? From those old Carl Banks' 'Disney Ducks' comic collection???... From Belgian cartoonist Herge', the great maker of 'The Adventures of Tintin'???... I cannot imagine how these supposedly "greatly reputated" film makers (Spielberg & Lucas) got associated on making a disastrous film like this!!!

Imagine... A typical town of Peru, Nasca (where the magnificent Lines of Nasca are drawn in the middle of desertic soil), located pretty close to Cusco???  Hey you, there are some hundred miles from one place to the other!!!!  And... Mexican music played in a Peruvian town market???...

C'mon messrs. Spielberg and Lucas!!! Don't you ever keep thinking that we Peruvians and Mexicans, are the same thing!!!

Spend your valuable money in any other of the great items sold by Amazon, not on purchasing this movie! IT SUCKS!!!!
