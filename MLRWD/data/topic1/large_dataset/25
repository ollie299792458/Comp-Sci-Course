This was one of the best TV mini-series, this sequel to "The Winds of War". The producers had a good idea when they cast Robert Mitchem however they must have been thinking of him when he was actor in his younger days when he didn't 'act' so bored. Mitchem was miscast. He shows little emotion and in fact drifts through this series as if he were on valium. He acts as if he just doesn't wnat to be there.  (That's something Jan Michael Vincent must have been on in the "The Winds of War"; he was terrible.) What got my attention however was the epic scope of the story and visuals, as well as Polly Bergen's performance. She's incredibly good and her characeter is truly like one of those sad and silly women of those 1940's films.  Jane Seymour and other cast members are wonderful too. The scenes in the concentration camp are powerful and will break your heart. Network television doesn't make them like this any more.  We have to depend on the likes of HBO and pay for the service.  Grand, sweeping and worth whatever you pay for it.
