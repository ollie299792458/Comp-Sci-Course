Even though you probably haven't heard of this film it is exceptionally well made. The Battle of Britain from the eastern european pilot's perspective--but it really centers on the friendship of two pilots, a Polish and a Checkoslavakian flying in the RAF to defeat the Germans who over ran their homeland- who fall in love with the same English woman---a married woman at that. The aerial scenes are spectacular and seem more real than any fighter combat scenes I have seen in other WWII fighter combat films. Not a ton of money but you get a visceral feel for being in one of those old fighters--spitfires, hurricanes---and having to take on another fighter in mortal combat and at harrowing speeds. I highly recommend this film but I will warn you it is told through the 1950 perspective of the pilots who returned home after the war only to be jailed. So although there isn't a great deal of time spent in their prison it casts a sad net over the entire film that I wish wasn't there because so much in the heart of the story is light and beautiful and about the power of friendship.
