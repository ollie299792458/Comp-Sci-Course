I had wanted to watch this since it came out, but never found the time.  But since it is available streaming now and my oldest boys are in 7th and 8th grade I finally made the time to sit down as a family and watch it.

As most have noted it is superbly laid out and organized, and thankfully witty and engaging even for teens. I say thankfully because starting in 7th grade the attack on free-thinking and tolerance for anything but the Darwinist narrative is often revealed in all it's ugliness by many of the faculty teaching our kids today.

I deplore that science has been perverted by the statist mindset to the point where the actual true answers are no longer as important to discover as the politically correct answers.

And of course since the answers from primitive scientists 150 years ago are increasingly in doubt with each new discovery of irreducible complexity etc., the devotees to them are increasingly strident and nasty in their opposition, to the point as illistrated so well in the movie, that no freedom of thought is to be tolerated...evidence be damned!

The movie is excellently produced, covers a lot of really important historical as well as social and scientific ground, and is a must-see for those who prefer education over indoctrination.
