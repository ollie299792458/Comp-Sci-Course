In case you didn't know, this movie is based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Sapphire is an author and she wrote a book called Push. This movie is based on that same novel written by Sapphire.

By this point, you've probably figured out that my review here is nothing more than useless. I give it 4 stars for various reasons already detailed out by others. The only commentary I have is that this Sapphire lady must really think highly of herself. I have to wonder if making sure "Based on the novel Push by Sapphire" would appear in every possible incarnation of the films' title was the deal breaker on Sapphire giving the story rights. The DVD special features also make sure that you, the viewer, know that Sapphire exists as an author and the she is indeed a real person who wrote the novel Push. Her name is Sapphire.

Not only that, even when people talk about it on TV they mention that it is based on the novel Push by Sapphire. For the life of me I cannot understand what is so "precious" about the novel Push by Sapphire for I highly doubt everyone keeps mentioning it constantly out of genuine affinity for the novel Push by Sapphire. I have never seen a "based on the book" line so lauded as this one. This movie is not called "Precious." This movie is called "Precious based on the novel Push by Sapphire."

Based on the novel Push by Sapphire.
