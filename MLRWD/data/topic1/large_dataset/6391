Ethan Hunt, with all at his disposal, perhaps is bested at being the one man who can put an end to this, by none other than would be action director John Woo. I have NEVER been a Woo fan. His previous "action" films bored me to tears. Really, I don't understand people. Um, ANYONE can direct a bunch of people to mock shoot at each other, while fireballs are being blown up, and pigeons flying, all to a ridiculous "storyline". It's not that difficult. I don't buy that Hong Kong bs. There are good action films that have come out of Hong Kong that actually posses a story. He just happened to do someone in Hollywood a favor. He's cancerously overrated, much like this film, which is a travesty to action films period. Why bother calling it Mission Impossible 2? It has NOTHING to do with the MI series. I liked the first film because, guess what? It actually had something to do with ESPIONAGE, which in case anyone forgot, is supposed to be what the DAMN FILM IS ABOUT!!!Why didn't anyone tell that to Woo? Oh yeah right. To busy admiring himself in the mirror.
