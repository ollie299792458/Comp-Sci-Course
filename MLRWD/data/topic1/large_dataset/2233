Entertaining movie for the family. If I had to sum up the movie in one phrase I'd say it was "Home Alone 5" but instead of a child being left behind this time we have a ex-K9 police dog that is suffering from mental trauma. Zeus is no longer on the force but has been adopted by a (surprisingly) normal family that is in need of a watchdog due to resent neighborhood home robberies. The family leaves the house on Christmas eve to visit Grandma and Zeus now alone. What could possibly happen?

Unlike the first Home Alone movie slapstick is much milder and the crotch jokes have been left out. Except for some passing gas humor this movie should be okay for the younger kids.

Gary Valentine plays the father and for me gets all the good laughs. The under-the-breath comments reminded me of myself which caused quite a few out-loud laughs on my part. The directing leaves a lot to be desired but since it was made for TV and since your kids really won't care it's not a big deal.

I'd say the movie is worth owning. The kids will enjoy it way more then you will but compared to must movies that are passed as "family movies" you won't role your eyes when they want to watch it.
