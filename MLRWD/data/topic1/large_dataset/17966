Let me begin by saying that Im a huge fan of the horror genre. I have read the foundational works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker. I have seen many of the werewolf movies like Howling I & II, American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers, Beast of Gauverdan, but none, NONE have come close to the pathos and sheer characterization that Ginger Snaps has. Two girls who are inseparable, struggle with becoming women and undergoing their first menstrual development into womanhood. Both are fascinated with death and live typical ansgsty suburban lives. Both experience first hand the absolute horror of becoming werewolves. Plainly said, this movie takes the metaphor of growing up and turns it upside down. Like Joss Whedon's Buffy, these girls have to confront what it is to be female and what it means to be an outsider.

After renting this movie I have now purchased all 3 of the Ginger Snaps movies. While the second two dont achieve the magnificence of the first, they are worthy of the title (the 3rd is actually a prelude that tells the story set in the 19th century). I highly, highly recommend these movies to enthusiasts of the horror, werewolf and supernatural genre!
