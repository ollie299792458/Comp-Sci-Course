It's seems that the Sci-Fi shows of the 21st century need to be dark and "edgy" before they receive large levels of praise.  Because of that this fun and often campy series is seemingly forgotten.

Looking at it today the series in not a masterpiece of writing or acting.  While the actors definitely do a good job filling the roles and are having fun with the show, this show is also clearly written quickly.  Plot holes and deus ex machina events abound and more than once the writers don't bother to try to hide the plot holes they are leaving behind.

But despite the flaws, this is an incredibly fun series to watch.  The writing is clearly a product of its times and bad puns and quirky humor appear in every episode.  In fact the only real complaint I have is that this kind of series is now longer made.  It fits what I want in a TV series.  Its light, quirky, entertaining and doesn't try to send any "messages."  The writers went out with the idea that they were producing something that people wanted to see as entertaining.

If you want your entertainment to be full of messages, or to be "edgy" this series won't excite you.  If you are looking for a fun series that wants to entertain you.  This will fit right into your video library.
