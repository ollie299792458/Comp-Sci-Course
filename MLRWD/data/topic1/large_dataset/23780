David Lynch is a genius. From his more "mainstream" movies, such as Dune and Elephant Man, to his quirkier works like Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet and more recently Inland Empire, his films have been dark, creepy, moody and often, at the same time, hilariously funny. His visual imagery, while often simple and stark is also awe inspiring. He uses light and shadow with music and sound to create mood like no one else. Surreal twists of fate and bizarre happenings mark all of his work. He took all of that creative brilliance and changed television forever with Twin Peaks. People often ask of his work ",What does it mean?" I think his most lasting gift is that it always means whatever you want it to.
  Eraserhead is a masterpiece, creating for us a lonely, dark, industrial world of looming shadows and ominous stretches of silence peppered with clever twists of plot and dialouge. It is an introduction to the world of David Lynch, rich with all the promise of the filmaker's career that it ushered in. Perhaps one of the most atmospheric movies ever made it stands alone as a classic in a genre it created. Brilliant!!
