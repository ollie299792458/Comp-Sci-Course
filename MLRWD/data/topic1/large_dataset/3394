This is a complex, sophisticated film and one that most closely captures the essence of the Hulk comic.  True comics fans who love the individual character development and the art first and find the violent action a delicate garnish should LOVE this movie.  I wouldn't be surprised that these true fans also dislike the Batmans, daredevils, catwomans as these are horrible schlock that pervert the comic form.  Even Spiderman and X-men, while paying tribute, do not quite capture the spirit.  The best true comic book movies to date are not even Marvel or DC:  Sin City (but its graphic novel style) and Unbreakable.  Hulk is the best of the the DC/Marvel crowd to date  for those of us who were buying the phoenix series, electra and captain marvel fresh off the shelves...true believers.  It also beautifully sets up sequels, but it is clearly above the heads of the average moviegoer and tragically appropriate sequels may not get made.  Reminds me of 1990 when these morons were shelling out $100 a ticket for phil collins and aerosmith when they could see the pixies, jane's additiction, nirvana, soundgarden...etc almost free in local clubs.  Same thing happening today with U2/Coldplay/Radiohead etc. when bands like Cold Duck Complex are there in small clubs for the taking.  Go figure.
