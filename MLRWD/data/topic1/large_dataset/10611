For my money, Pauline Kael was right that this film contains the sexiest single scene ever put on celluloid--you'll never forget it.

It also has the most interesting non-sexual relationship.  To me, Persona is Bergman's best.  Can't be distilled, described, or explained.  It's also sometimes boring and annoying as hell, which is part of the point.  Unlike his other celebrated films, this one doesn't try to seduce or impress you by being aggressively "deep" and Scandinavian.  There's genuine tedium, hatred and contempt here--and friendship and honesty--not self-conscious angst and pretentious symbolism.

Loved this film when I first saw it in college and still do, even though I can't watch most of Bergman's other "greats" anymore (Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Seventh Seal, etc.), they're so serious and self-important (though I do still enjoy "Wild Strawberries").  Persona's different; somehow it gives you space, you seem to develop your own relationships with the characters, you become part of it but without losing yourself in it or feeling manipulated.  Can't recommend it enough.
