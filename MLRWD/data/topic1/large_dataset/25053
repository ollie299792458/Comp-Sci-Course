I first saw this movie on HBO and I absolutely fell in love with it. It's touching, funny, eye-opening.. Oh it's just Great! The acting is perfect, they make you feel all the emotions you're supposed to feel in different scenes. Its 3 short stories that all have a different meaning/struggle within lesbianism. The first one is about and elderly lesbian couple and how they had to hide all their life even after one of them  was gone. The remaining "wife" was left with no one else in the world. The second one takes place around the hippie era when feminist activists were at large. It shows how the butch type lesbians were looked down upon. The last one stars Ellen and Sharon Stone as a lesbian couple in the 20th century trying to have children and how difficult it can be. I hope I didnt give away too much but its just hard to explain the plots without giving it away! I really do recommend this to everyone. I say everyone not just gay people because I think its something that even straight people need to be aware of. It just takes you through different times in the 1900's and some pretty rough situations for the lesbians in those certain days.It's just honest. And wonderful. A must have for your lesbian collection!
