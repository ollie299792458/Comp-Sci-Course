I just saw it tonight, and it's worth your while if you have any real interest in the subject, but in the final analysis, it's horribly silly. It does capture some of the personality quirks and high drama of the man (which even in real life was much tongue in cheek).

 Unfortunately, it took a very rich and complex subject matter and reduced it to a one-dimensional pulp fiction version cast in a cheesy Dr. Who plot, and threw in some elements of Jack the Ripper in for good measure. They essentially took all of the wild rumors about Crowley at face value and then upped the ante by having him gratuitously kill hookers at every turn. Oh yeah, he can also travel in time and access the digital world behind the world ala The Matrix.

On the other hand, hearing Simon Callow's reading of Crowley's lewd poetry is worth the price all by itself. I think Crowley would have a damn good belly laugh at it if he were around to see it, and you should too. Just don't read much into it as even a semi-serious biographical work of the man. That would be like trying to learn the pawn shop business from Tarrentino's movies. One last bit in favor of it: Iron Maiden was involved in its production and the sound track!
