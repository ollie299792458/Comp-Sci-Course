"The Birdcage" is an inordinately lame remake of one of the great French comedies of all time, "La Cage Aux Folles".  Amazon sells "La Cage Aux Folles" with English subtitles, and even if  you don't like subtitles, do yourself the favor of hearing the great Michel  Serrault emote his way through the role of Zaza.  Nathan Lane and Robin  Williams are both outstanding American actors, but they are not Serrault  and Ugo Tognazzi, and what's more, here they've been put into a 1990s  Politically Correct vehicle that tones them down WAY too much.  Gene  Hackman is one of the greatest actors in American filmmaking, but he pales  beside his French counterpart in the role of the blustering father finding  his daughter marrying the son of a gay nightclub owner.  And don't EVEN get  me started on the role of Jacob, the houseboy.  The French actor was  hilarious.  The poor American who was forced to adapt the role in PC  America of the 1990s was most certainly (I repeat -- MOST certainly) not.  Even if you don't like European films and have never seen any reason to get  excited about Ingmar Bergmann, in this case do yourself a big favor and get  "La Cage Aux Folles". There's a reason why it was made into a  musical on Broadway and spawned two (inferior) sequels in France, but  "The Birdcage" ain't it.  No way, no how, ne pas.
