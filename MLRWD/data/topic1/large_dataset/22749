I thought this DVD was going to kick my rear in the literal sense. Unfortunately it was more intermediate than I expected. I am a Firm junkie and do a lot of Cathe as well. I consider myself on the low end of advanced.

This is a nice workout and I will do it again. But it will enter my rotation as the workout I do when I am sore or tired from my more advanced tapes. It is NOT a cardio workout. It is all about sculpting, which is fine, just not what I really expected. There are also Cathe DVDs that are far more advanced for sculpting and weight work.

The workout did go by fast and she is excellent when it comes to demonstrating good form. She was not irritating and her background folks demonstrate lots of different modifications. You do need some equipment, but there are multiple ways to use what you have to make the most of the workout. If you do it just the way she suggests you need a barbell w/ about 20 pounds of weight, 5 and 10 lb hand weights and a step or bench to use for exercises where you are on your back. You can do the workout without the barbell, but you must have hand weights.

UPDATE:
My Cathe kick wound up leaving me injured. I was under strict instructions to stop "leaping and jumping" (LOL). I never expected it, but this is the workout I come back to. It is low impact on your knees and feet but it is still fairly intense. It has been 2 years now and I still use it.
