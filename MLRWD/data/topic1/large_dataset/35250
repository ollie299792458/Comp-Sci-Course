I am one of the people who grew up watching this movie. Overall this is actually a good action film. Anyone who doesn't like it, obviously didn't get that it was meant to be a satire of all the typical, cliches of action films.

John McTiernan, whether or not it was his approach, knew that the only way to truly satirize something, you must be as close to the subject matter as possible. Although he directed such great action films as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, he still manages to pull off his style and being true to the genre, while still managing to turn out a smart parody.

I am one for urging Sony Pictures to release an anniversary edition of this film, to be represented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and having a DTS mix in it as well. All fans of the film at least deserve that much. along with some interesting new special features with more then just a trailer.
