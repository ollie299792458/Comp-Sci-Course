I got this DVD not expecting much.  I work out a lot 5-6 times a week.  I do all sorts of excercises and started adding some of Leslie Sansone's videos just to top off a harder work out.  I saw this and thought I would give it a try.  I have never heard of Madeline Lewis but I must say this was a good work out.

This is slightly more advanced than leslie's but not majorly high impact.  I like that she does do toning with actual weights as opposed to belts.

The video has 3 10 minute workouts and a 10 minute stretch.  It would have been nice to have made it a good 40 minute workout but you can customize the workout to do one of the 10 nminute sessions on repeat.

As mentioned before this will get your heart pumping a little harder than Leslie's videos and one improvement I would make is that the creators of this DVD could have put in how many miles you have worked out like Leslie's but on those days you want low impact but a little more challenge this is it.
