I have to admit I enjoyed this film probably more than should be legal.  It still delights me.  I love action movies, horror movies, and have a soft spot in my heart for all of Universal's monsters, as well as just about any movie ever done of Dracula.  Yes, Peter Cushing is pitch perfect as Van Helsing, and Anthony Hopkins makes him an educated and entertaining psycho, but Hugh Jackman turns him into a dashing and lethal killing machine.  Oddly enough they all work.  The cast is great.  Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, and Kate Beckinsale do a terrific job as the heroes. Richard Roxburgh delivers a Dracula that is charming, dangerous, and ridiculously self-absorbed, and Shuler Hensley comes very close to Mary Shelley's misunderstood monster.  The pacing in this movie is on fast forward all the time, but is pretty much flawless.  Everything is explained, even with several things happening at once and it all converges at the right moment.

The atmosphere was suitably spooky (especially the stagecoach ride through the forests at night), and the sets and costume design were gorgeous.  I have to give credit to Stephen Sommers too for managing to include all the monsters in a story that actually worked.  It has been tried before, but usually the story seems contrived or the characterization just doesn't work.  Not only did he manage a good story, but he created an interesting universe with the church employing its own hitmen and scientists to take care of supernatural evil when it pops up.

And yes, being female, two hours of Hugh Jackman and David Wenham are an absolute pleasure, and Richard Roxburgh is no slouch either.  The female characters were fun to watch too - Anna Valerious was a take-no-prisoners tough girl, and the brides were catty drama queens with some fabulous lines.
