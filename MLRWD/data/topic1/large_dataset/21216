I purchased the video because I am teaching Nathanael West's novel this term and wanted to see what Hollywood did with West's view of Hollywood. Well, there were pluses, serious pluses: Burgess Meredith was a great Harry Greener; the cockfight scene was well-played; Karen Black was a good Faye Greener, except on those occasions when the director or script misguided the character into moments of sincerity.
And that misguidance highlights the weaknesses of the film. There is no sincerity in Hollywood; there is no reality beneath the plywood sets; if they collapse, there is nothing beneath: that is the tone of the West book. Hollywood is 99 &amp; 44/100 percent image, and as such represents a human society which is likewise a combination of glitter, misdirection, and pointless desire. The book is a trip into existential despair. The movie fails to wallow deeply enough.
The other big disappointment -- well, more than a disappointment, is the filming of the concluding riot scene. The filming is too 70ish -- gore mixed with psychedelic flashing between scene and imagination. The horror thus communicated is an individual horror. It is strong (part of the scene made my spouse physically ill). It is not, however, universal and despairing. Subtlety and selection leaves a longer impression than spectacle (that, of course, is a lesson Hollywood never has learned; and that is part of West's story).
Overall, some very good moments, some good acting, but the tone does not quite do justice to West's book.
