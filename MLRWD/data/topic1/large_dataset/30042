Like most of the other reviews, I too found this jem when I turned on the tv to him coming down the stairs, calmly walking past bodies and blood and leaving the house, leaving me to wonder "Wow, what is this?" Let me just say, ever since, this has been my favorite movie. I'm lucky enough to have it on VHS, but I am SO HAPPY its finally coming out on DVD. There's no question where I will be on October 13!

I love everything about this movie except Jim Ogilvie and his idiocy. Come on! He KNOWS where Jerry lives, knows what he's done, and STILL gets freaked when he sees him all bloody, thus fumbling with his gun (IN HIS POCKET NO LESS) like a moron. Just watching that part makes me embarrassed for him.

I'm a huge horror movie freak, and seriously, in my opinion, BEST MOVIE EVER! (but I might be prejudiced since I believe this movie got me started on them all,...) This is one of those movies I've seen like, 20 times, and it's still as wonderful as if I was seeing it for the first time.
