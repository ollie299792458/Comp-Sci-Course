If there's one thing I really dug about this movie, it's the first person/into the camera narration style a la FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. It's a great way of telling a funny story and John Cusack is great as Rob Gordon, the down on his luck loser. We've all been through a romance gone completely sour and believe me, Gordon has been through enough to last 2 lifetimes. You have to sympathize with the man as his heart is repeatedly dragged through the proverbial mud, much to our comic delight. I think both men and women will appreciate this movie because it honestly presents both sides of a break up. Throughout the course of the story, we learn that yes, men are inherently jerks but women are just as guilty! Cusack is backed up by a decent supporting cast, particularly Jack Black, who plays the smart alecky, customer offending employee of his store. He's definitely a comedic talent to look out for in the future. Cusack does a nice job of carrying the movie and provides many of its funniest moments. It's a solid comedy which will appreciated by music lovers and movie fans alike.
