After hours is by far one of the best neglected films of the last 20 years. Packaged like a sleazy B movie from the 1980's, i mean look at the video box for chrissakes, it toataly sneaks up on you, partly because  you've never even heard of it and secondly maybe because your a fan of  those sleazy misogynistic morally ambiguous films, like myself. But instead  what you get is a kinetic whitehot pitch black comedy that seems to  reinvent editing techniques and camera movement with every scene. This  movie is so energetic and hip you would have guessed Scorsese was 19 when  he made this, perhaps he was in a mid-life crisis. But who cares After  hours is by far the best comedy of the 80's , employing all of the themes  that ran through the latter and the decade in itself and pulverising it all  into a feverish mush.If you have begun to question the validity of  scorsese's work, perhaps because hes been placed on a pedestal by those who  are in no position to do so, check this thing out and discover that the  masses have finally got one right.
