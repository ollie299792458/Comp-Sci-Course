This is a cool movie.  Not the best movie you'll ever see, in fact not even close, but still worth watching.  Mark Wahlberg does a surprisingly good job playing a rockstar.  Jennifer Aniston does a pretty decent job, although I think she usually plays the same type of charachter in every movie.  This movie is basically about a guy named Chris Cole(Wahlberg) who sings in a tribute band that plays songs by his favorite band, Steel Dragon.  He copies everything about Steel Dragon and is completely obsessed with them.  Anyways, one day Steel Dragon calls him up and asks him to come audition to be their lead singer.  He makes it, and his dreams come true.  That's not the end though, but I'm not gonna tell you the rest.  I will tell you one thing though:it's pretty predictable.  I'm not saying that this is a bad movie though, it's very enjoyable.  Also, Zakk Wylde plays guitar for the fictional band, and is in the movie a bit, and of course he's an incredible guitarist.  I have to admit, their songs are pretty cool.  However, this is not a great movie, and for better movies about rock bands, try "Almost Famous", and the hilarious "This is Spinal Tap".
