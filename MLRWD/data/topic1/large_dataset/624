I love the asanas chosen in this dvd as well as the sequencing of the asanas.  Many other reviewers are correct that the cueing is not  synced well with what is on the screen.  I purchased this yoga a couple of years ago when I was newer to yoga and it didn't work well for me due to the cueing issue.  I recently pulled it back out and have found that it is not a problem at all for me.  I rarely look at the screen and just follow the verbal cues.

I highly recommend that you start the practice with the menu pick titled "Breath".  It only runs approximately 4 minutes and includes breath of fire and ujjayi breathing.  It is nice to start with this so that you don't forget to use the ujjayi breathing throughout the practice.  I even run through the breath portion twice sometimes before moving on to the asana practice portion of the DVD.

The asana practice is 1 hour in length which includes shavasana for approximately 5 minutes.  Lisa's voice is very nice.  When going through vinyasas she usually instructs you to do chataranga dandasana all the way to the floor and then into cobra, however you can do chataranga to upward facing dog if you prefer.  Depending upon how I am feeling some days I may hit the pause button to hold some of the poses longer, but usually not.  There is such a good variety of poses in this one hour practice.  I will be using this once or twice per week in addition to my own personal practice.

** EDITED -- I am coming back to add some comments.  I had not done this DVD for some time and pulled it out the other day.  I do not think that I will use this DVD again as it moves through the poses quicker than I like.  I enjoy a flowing vinyasa practice, but I like to move with my breath, which is much slower than the pace of this DVD.
