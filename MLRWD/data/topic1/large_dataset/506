I don't care that it's historically inaccurate (for heaven's sake, like King Arthur is historically accurate?!).  This was a fun movie, with drama, romance, fight scenes, nifty costumes, and a happy ending.  There was a refreshing lack of overdone "spectacle," with sweep skilfully suggested rather than shown -- this movie doesn't beat you over the head with CGI anything.  The casting created a refreshingly un-Hollywood take on the stock characters: the taciturn commander has a sly sense of humor, the mystic is making most of it up as he goes, the girl doesn't go "soft" to the point of complete uselessness, and the men have served together for years and it shows in their interactions, both verbal and nonverbal.  And the kid grows up believably -- he doesn't turn into a venerable statesman overnight.

I do wish the DVD had the extended cut, and not just the deleted scenes.  But I liked seeing the fights choreographed, and from the "making of" documentary, it would seem that the cast had as much fun making it as I had watching it.  Another reviewer wrote something to the effect of "one star for the cast, one for Rome, and one for King Arthur," to which I would add one: just because.
