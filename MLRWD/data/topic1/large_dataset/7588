Having belief and respect for creation is surely a positive way to view the natural world around you, but it is hard to imagine that so many feel the need to pick a side and to hell with the other belief.  To the delight of the open-minded, it is possible to enjoy a belief in both creationism and evolutionary theory.  In short, if it is believed that God is all knowing and people are not, then the idea that the animial world has been given the ability to evolve as part of such a perfect design should not be so quickly dismissed.  Why would one feel it neccessary to discredit the divine ability to factor in the processes of evolution into the beautiful design of all living creatures?

And for those who may not believe in a divine being, is there really no feeling of some inner sensation that you simple can't explain when trying to fathom the remarkable diversity of the world around you, let alone your own existance?

If only more people were as insightful as David Attenborough, not so much time would be used on judging and disregaurding the use of such a unique capacity to learn and understand the natural world around us.  Attenborough's celebration of the life around us is done with passion and appreciation, and is evident in the presentation of "The Life of Mammals."

Just relax and enjoy the opportunity to contemplate the natural world with Sir David Attenborough.
