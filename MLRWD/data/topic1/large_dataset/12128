A screwball satire that was a huge success in 1937. Ben Hecht, who wrote the script, has the "little people" dripping crocodile tears over a girl they think is dying of radium poisoning (and enjoying every minute of it). There are classic sequences: March, the New York City sophisticate, arrives in a small New England town and learns how the natives feel about strangers when a little boy runs up and bites his leg - the swozzled Lombard passes out while showgirls (impersonating the heroines of history) parade in her honour - plus the terrific slugging match between March and Lombard. Walter Connoly is great as the dyspeptic big-city editor as is Charles Winninger as the alcoholic small-town doctor. William Wellman's direction is more leisurely than usual; he has such good material here, that he takes his time. This marvelous black comedy classic was originally filmed in Technicolor and the DVD print is clear and sharp! Lombard is priceless in her interpretation of Hazel Flagg; her zestful playing is freshly modern and one can see what all the fuss concerning her comedic gifts was about!
