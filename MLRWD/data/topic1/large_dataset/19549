After reading some of the customer reviews here on Amazon.com, I almost didn't purchase this DVD.  "To Catch A Thief" is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies of all time (yes, I know it's not "Vertigo", "Rear Window" or "North By Northwest" -- but "To Catch A Thief" wasn't supposed to be serious, it was simply Hitch & some friends having fun!), and I already owned the video.  So when I read that the DVD was little improved from the admittedly poor video, I opted not to buy it.  Then my video went south, and I was forced to a DVD purchase.
Imagine my happy surprise when the colors leaped off the screen at me, when the crispness of the pictures knocked my socks off!!  Wow!!  Whoever wrote that this DVD is "washed out" probably needs a new TV.  Granted, I'd love to see this movie digitally remastered -- and soon!! -- but until that happens this DVD is a far better version of this movie than any I've ever seen.  I am unfortunately too young to have seen the original in the theatres, but I'd have to guess that this DVD comes pretty close.  I'm frankly thrilled with it!!
Cary Grant is wonderful, Grace Kelly is divine, the supporting cast (especially John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis) get their chops in, and a good time is had by one and all.  And even beyond the stunning visuals, the scintillating dialogue and clever wordplay are easily worth the price of the movie!  Don't look for Hitch's usual suspense or intrigue here; there's relatively little of those to be had.  Rather, think of "To Catch A Thief" more as a very stylish romantic comedy, filmed in the inimitable Hitchcock fashion.
My vote is four stars -- a very worthy effort, and a happy new purchase, but still a movie that could stand a serious remastering!!  If that ever happens, I'll buy that DVD, too!!  (That's a hint.)
