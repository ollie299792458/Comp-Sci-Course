I didnt really see the preview, but from the time the movie started rolling i had a thought.  Wow... is this odd.
Zoolander is really really funny.  But it's not funny because it's funny as in "incredibly good joke" funny.  It's funny because you pretty much spend the whole movie saying "What the heck!" it's funny because the jokes and the delivery are so obscure, it's practically genius.  Me as a person makes tons of obscure references, and the best way i can describe this movie is being stuck in a room with me for an hour and a half when i'm hyper.
Some people find me really, really, really, funny... and other people cant stand me.
I saw this movie w/ my best friend, and the funniest thing was watching him cringe... he hated it, and as soon as the movie began i figured he would.
I quote everything... and i loved mystery men, and i think Zoolander is something you should at least experience once.  I havent laughed this hard in a long time.  And it wasnt cause the movie was funny, but because it was stupidly something else... and that's part of its charm.
