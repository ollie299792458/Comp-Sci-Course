The cast in this film are wonderful, subtle, and honest in this really fresh take on the teen comedy genre.
Steven Kaplan shines as the awkward, conflicted teenhero , Danny, buckling under the pressure of his oncoming Prom and the enormous status that his culture attaches to it. Rather than allowing him to enjoy an evening of fun with his childhood friend, (Played with both humour and sadness by Alia Shawkat), Danny pursues the dream of landing a hot date to share his pre-booked limo and hotel room.
The frustration of both Kaplan and Shawkat's charaters is palpable as time runs out and their special moment threatens to be ruined by the hype and hormones beseiging Danny.
The real thrill of this film is that it explores friendship and family in a dry and honest way - and does not veer into sentimentalism or romance. William H. Macey and Cheryl Hines are a delight as Danny's dysfunctional parents, creating believably cringe-worthy  situations.
Ashley Benson is pretty, believable and perfect as Danny's dream girl - the ambiguous, teasing friend who turns out to think of him as a brother. It would be great to see more of her.
See this film - it is funny and charming.
