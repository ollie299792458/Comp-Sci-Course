..but life went on nontheless, and this long and twisting story is redemptive and moving and completely worthwhile for its humanity and portrayal of bravery.
Boris Pasternak, the story's author, was born in Moscow before the revolution and tells of the tragedy masterfully.
Doctor Zhivago represents the thin flame of humanity and, ultimately, sanity in a society beset by madness. Omar Shariff performance conveys this human dignity flawlessly, with his burning eyes.
Lara, Zhivago's second love played by Julie Christie is equalled by Tonya, played by Geraldine Chaplin for their beauty and brave kindness in the face of their descent into sadness and sorrow.
And the film is radiant, with stunning colors, facinating period costumes, and a good deal of symbolic and cinemtographic experimentation that makes the film much more than a shmaltzy epic.
With this DVD version, you can watch the 3 hour and 20 minute movie once, then watch the entire thing again with a commentary track. The bonus DVD is loaded with historical and film documentaries.
Buy this film, it's an inspiration.
