Perhaps it's because I'm a huge fan of film noir where women got to play just unrepentantly 'wicked' fun characters but I loved Michelle Pfeiffer's character in this movie. She was devastating. I couldn't wait to see what she would be up to next. I think Alison Lohman's character (Astrid) was so comfortable with the russian woman at the end because that was the only person you felt could have gone toe to toe with Ingrid. Their philosophies of life were very similar.

I'm not identifying the characters much or giving out plot points here because it's been done in so many other reviews (too many plot points if you ask me).

Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellwegger were both revelations here and every other character was also played pitch perfect. Alison Lohman of course was outstanding. I'd never seen her before and now I will seek her out. Ms. Pfeiffer once again validated everything I've ever loved about her. You can just picture Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of Ingrid and in case you don't know, that's a huge compliment. Where the heck is that Oscar fer cryin out loud?

Apparently it's a good thing I never read the book.  This movie should stand on its own merits. I just finished watching it, I'm recommending it to all my friends and I believe I'll go watch it a second time right now.

Hmmmm ..... bet you can't say 'Film Noir Worthy' three times fast.
