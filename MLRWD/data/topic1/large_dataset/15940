Loved this movie. Won't repeat what's already been said. Ditto the good reviews. Really enjoyed the non-traditional storyline. Acting was superb by ALL of the actors -- both known and not so well-known. Loved the exclusion of nudity, violence and special effects in telling this wonderful story. Still very compelling. The movie is done beautifully and is a simplistic work of art in acting, cinematography, and musical score, etc. Thank you to the more well-known actors for contributing your time to these kinds of movies, lending your names to pull in the funding needed to keep creating these wonderful tales. Thank you John Turturro (totally fascinating in this role!), Matthew McConaughey (brilliant and cute), Alan Arkin (loveable), and Amy Irving (classic). As for the other actors, of which there are really too, too many to mention -- BRAVO! To the sisters who wrote this, Thank You. Great job! Great commentary (about 25? mins) on the DVD version about how the movie came about. Don't miss this one!
