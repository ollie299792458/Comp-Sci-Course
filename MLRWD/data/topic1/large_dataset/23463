Over the Top ruled! Lincoln Hawk is a down on his luck big rig trucker who tries to impress his wussy son with the powers of big riggin and arm wrestling. Unfortunatly, Hawk's mean father in law wants custody of the boy so Hawk has to get the Arm Wrestling First Prize money to win him back. Someone should have told him though that ramming a semi-truck through a house does not look good in court. A word of warning however, there are approximatly 600 mullets in this movie but Sly himself doesn't have one, so he has to compinsate by turning his hat backwards, which is the international sign of (A--) kickery. One of the better parts of the movie, (and most confusing) is when his son tries to escape his big rig truck and runs into highway traffic. Hawk catches him and grabs the child as he tries to struggle. It looks very, very bad and if I were a motorist and saw what was going on, I would call the authorities toot suite. Other then the cheesy 80's Pop and the pointless arm wrestler interviews this movie rocks.
