...Not every story needs to be full of a deep and profound meaning. This story has its share of social commentary, if that's what you're looking for (in the form of Chinese repression of American music). Otherwise, enjoy the marvelous acting, exquisite music and glorious colors and cinematography. The jumping back and forth in time is actually not as confusing as I thought it might be. This format is used to feed you information of the violin's origins very slowly as you see the travels it has taken. I LOVED this movie and wanted to see it again immediately after I saw it the first time. A fan of violin music MUST see this movie, but if you just want to watch a beautiful movie full of passion, beauty and mystery this is it. Watch for the progression of the violin in owners. There is meaning behind it (from unborn child to child to youth to man to child again, if you must know).
If you like this movie anyway, it is imperative that you get the soundtrack (though Pope's breathing is not on the track of his concert piece. A pity). It makes great relaxing music and the best car music (good for driving through beautiful scenery).
See this movie! If only for Samuel L. Jackson (a different performance than his usual, but amazing all the same. Fans should be  pleased)!!!
