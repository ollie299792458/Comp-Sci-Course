I'm glad to see this classic film has been re-released in different formats. There are two generations who have no knowledge of that period in our history and I think they should see what was in the 60s "is new again." We now have an all-volunteer military, and the country is supporting them very well. But the causes of the wars -- and the consequences -- are the same.
I knew Ron Kovic casually and if you read the credits you will see that he co-wrote the script. It's absolutely honest and there's nothing superfluous in the movie. He hits on major events in his life, during peace time as well as war, and shows us the monumental changes that occurred not only in his life but in the country as a whole.
I remember watching on TV as Ron rolled his wheelchair down to the floor of the convention hall. Already a member of the antiwar movement, I broke down crying when I saw him do that. And I cried harder when I saw how the convention members reacted. I think people who don't know or remember this period need to see this.

When I heard they were making a movie of Ron's book, I was really happy.  Then they announced Tom Cruise would play Ron and I was really upset.  But, I'll tell you, Cruise's performance was excellent.

Other reviews here, if you've waded through all of them, tell you all the details of the movie. I just wanted to add the importance of seeing this film again, perhaps in a format newer than the VHS we owned, and showing the DVD, blu-ray, or whatever, to your kids, grandkids, friends, and the town hall where we will all pay homage to America and those who fought and died for it tomorrow.
