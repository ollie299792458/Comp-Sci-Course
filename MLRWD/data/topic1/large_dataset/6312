This movie was amazing! I was really impressed with the story. At the very beginning, the music and the art of the spirits are so intriguing. Brother Bear features so many themes in it; rivalry, family, humor, sadness, celebration, and themes of the beyond. Kenai, our main character is presented with his totem he has been wanting. He ends up getting the bear of love, but he was expecting something more. That is just what he will get in this adventure.
 This is definitely a movie I would recommend to a family, but the best group would be a group of brothers or male friends who have been through a lot together. Kenai ends up turning into a bear and his brother thinks that bear is the bear that killed him. The brothers are fighting in an epic battle to turn the truth up to what happened.
 There is sense of what animals are feeling in this movie also. Koda's mother is killed early in the movie and Kenai finds out later that as his human self he was the one who killed his mom. Because of the mindset that animals have no feelings or family, he does not see it until he is right in the mist of it. Kenai decides to stay with Koda to comfort him and take care of him.
 The culture in this movie is my favorite part. The shaman at the very beginning is talking to the spirits of the mountain to found the young adults stone that represents him. The shamans are someone who talked to the spirits of the dead and the way they portrayed that in this movie was really interesting. Another interesting fact is that they used animals to represent the dead and how his bashing of the spirits ended up turning him into an animal to teach him a lesson; this goes directly with what they believed the spirits would do. It is called divine intervention.
