When I saw the price on this Blu-Ray DVD, I had to have it.  The free digital download was nice to have, as I watched part of the movie while waiting for my disc to arrive.  One of my favorite 'escapist' movies, pure fun and entertainment from start to finish.  'Blues Brothers' has some of the most inspired silliness and humor ever, in a cutting edge, for the time, big budget blockbuster setting.  It hits on all cylinders the whole way through.  The transfer to Blu-Ray is fine, crisp, clear and detailed.  I am no expert on all the ins and outs of Blu-Ray viewing, but I can tell you as a long time fan of this movie through multiple viewings, it has never looked or sounded this good.  I am guessing that most who read this review will be big fans of the movie, but for those not familiar with it, I will point out that it is worth watching just for the musical numbers alone.  There are many priceless 'moments musical' throughout, but 3 of my favorites are Aretha Franklin's 'Think', 'Rawhide',  and especially Cab Calloway doing his long time favorite 'Minnie the Moocher'.  I get chills every time I watch that one!  It is definitely worth going onto YouTube to see videos of him doing the longer versions of the song at various points in his long career.  But I digress.  The movie itself is a blast to watch, and gets better with each viewing.  This DVD is now my default way to watch it.  Definitely recommended for fans and fans-to-be of this classic, esp. at Amazon's great price.
