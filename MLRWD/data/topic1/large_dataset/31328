This was another one of those horror films that looked frightening in the commercials, but was a complete disappointment in that it simply utilized elements from past horror classics (The Exorcist, Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity) without adding anything fresh to the mix. In reality, the scariest parts were some of her physical contortions...and I could just watch contortionists on Youtube with scary music in the background if that is what I were looking for. There was suspenseful build-up, but the climax was not until the end, and it wasn't even scary. The minister had similar issues with his faith as Father Karras (the Exorcist), who was followed around by a dumb camera-man and director, but was one of the least likable heroins I've ever come across. There was some blood--but who cares? It barely incorporated one of the vital elements of the genre, which is to invoke psychological fears. Again, it just blundered through these borrowed, piecemeal elements. The acting was mundane and mediocre at best. Plus, the girl possessed by the devil was super annoying (and just as dumb as the documentary crew), and the father was more fickle than a politician. There were just some weird, twisted features to drive the predictable plot forward that were vaguely thought provoking, but not suiting to a horror film...maybe a Lifetime movie? I'm glad I saw this on Netflix rather than waste $10 on this ridiculous movie. Too bad I wasted 2 hours or so of my life.
