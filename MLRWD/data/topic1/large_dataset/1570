This is the ultimate Chevy Chase movie, he excels & exudes pure charisma as Investigative reporter Irwin Fletch, who is hired by corrupt billionaire Stanywck (slimy Tim Matheson)to kill him so his wife can collect the insurance (he pretend to have bone cancer). What makes this movie work so well is Chase characterization of Fletch & the numerous disguises he wears (taking on various different personalities from John Cocktosin to Harry S Truman)there is also good support from the likes of the late M Emmett Walsh. The only characters who come 2nd to Fletch is Clark Grisworld (From the vacation series) & Ty Webb (Caddyshack). I won't bother with plot details as you will have gathered this from other reviewers. What lets this Bluray down is the extras (Copied from the Jane Doe Edition dvd), the first featurette is okay with cast & crew reminiscing the 2nd which is on the disguises is a self indulgent love in & favourite Fletch moments just appear to be hastily tacked on. The absence of Chevy Chase, deleted scenes or commentary is what lets this down, so why is it still worth getting well that would be for the movie itself it is just sheer brilliance. HD Picture quality is good given the movies age, with only slight grain here & there. A sequel followed in 1989 titled Fletch Lives but nowhere matched the brilliance of this movie.
