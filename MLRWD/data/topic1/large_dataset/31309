I don't know who that guy is, but he's emphatically not Lupin III. Lupin is a sexist, arrogant jerk, and the hero of this film is eminently likeable -- a gentleman thief with a quirky sense of humor, honorable despite himself and a terrific reluctant hero. He's an action hero who's more interested in showing the villains up than in killing them.

Lupin has just committed a daring heist of cash when he discovers the money he's stolen is counterfeit -- they're the legendary "goat bills," near-perfect forgeries created to devalue the world's coinage. Tracing the money to its source, he finds his way to Cagliostro, a fairy-tale kingdom full of beautiful women, hidden treasure and deadly perils.

Like most Miyazaki films, Castle of Cagliostro feels like it was aimed at adults while remaining suitable for children. There aren't any terrifying moments like in Spirited Away, just a fun spy romp. Young kids may need the concept of counterfeiting explained to them, though.

This film is, however, very similar to Laputa: Castle in the Sky, though with fewer fantastic elements and a simpler ending. Overall, I'll admit that Laputa has better visuals, but Castle has more interesting characters and holds up better on later viewings.
