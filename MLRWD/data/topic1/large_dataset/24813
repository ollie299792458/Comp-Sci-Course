An absolute classic from beginning to end. A twisted love story interwinded within the mafia between an ageing mafioso(Al Pacino) and an FBI undercover agent (Johnny Depp). In short this film tells the story of undercover agent Joe Pistone, using the alias Donnie Brasco to infiltrate the mafia. He meets Lefty 'two guns'Ruggiero played superbly by Al Pacino who immediately befriends him and thorugh him Donnie Brasco antoher stellar performance from Johnny Depp manages to enter the mob and learn first hand the true workings of the mafia. This films defers from any other mob film in the fact that it focusses on a strong friendship based on a lie; that could kill any one of them. Lefty is an ageing mafioso who besides his quirks and misfortunes is slipping fast, never would he have not realised that Donnie was an agent back in the days. Set in the early 80's in New York City, this story is one that must be seen and heard and this film gives this unforgettable encounter true justice. It is a must have for any true crime, film noir, mafia movie collector.

The special features on this DVD are few but insightful, there is also an interview with the real life Donnie Brasco who also served as a technical adviser on the movie. We also get to meet the superb cast behind the scenes. The likes of Al Pacino , Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Anne Heche et all, help in making this movie so great.
