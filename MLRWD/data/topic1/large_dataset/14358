"Das Boot" is by and far the best submarine movie ever produced.  After seeing quite a few submarine movies that range from decent to all out horrible, this is the one to see.  Wolfgang Petersen is a very skilled director when dealing with very claustrophobic environments, such as a hijacked 747 in "Air Force One," or a quarantined town in "Outbreak."  But in "Das Boot" he truly outdoes anything done before or after.  This movie is filmaking at it's finest.  By being so long and drawn out, which was at first kind of a turn off, it makes the viewer become more and more drawn into the plot and the predicament of the crew.  By the end, you have a real idea of what living for days and months at a time under the water is like.  I'm a US submariner, so I have first hand experience.  This movie has the ability to at least give the viewer a taste of that.  Some American viewers won't like it, it's a European film, so it's not a typical Hollywood blockbuster.  For that the viewer should go pick up "Hunt for Red October" or the new "U-571."  This is a dark, brooding and not very happy film, yet extremely gripping.  The performances were very good, especially Jurgen Prochnow's portrayal of the crusty, old guard submarine captiain, who is actually only about 30 years old.  All in all, this movie comes highly recommended, and should be watched by anyone wanting a real idea of what life is like on a submarine, even one of our modern nuclear submarines.
