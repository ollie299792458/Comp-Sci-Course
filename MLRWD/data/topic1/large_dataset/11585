If there is anything at all depressing about this movie, it's that you want more. Somewhere hours and hours of this brilliant improvisation sit unseen, and I must "settle" for the pleasures of the most  enjoyable 84 minutes of film-making ever.
The cast is incredible, led by  Guest's brilliant portrayal of Corky. Posey, Willard, O'Hara, Levy all have  their moments, but the best supporting role is no-name Michael Hitchcock,  the "councilman/pharmacist" whose worship of Corky is responsible  for some of the biggest laughs in the film.
Never has another movie come  around that I've needed to see more than a couple of times - with Guffman,  I'm in the upper teens, and it keeps getting funnier. Each time I watch, I  have a new favorite line, but Corky's entranced delivery of "I was  shopping for my wife Bonnie, I buy most of her clothes..." could stand  up to any. 
I'll occassionally confound (OK, frighten) co-workers by  blurting out lines from the movie. They think I'm crazy, but I know the  truth. Christopher, if you're ever peeking at our comments, do us a favor  and open the archives. I'd be "happy as Mongoose."
