When I first did this DVD I did it without the bands and it was a decent cardio workout. I do have 1LB hand weights that fit in your palm and I used them with this DVD also... However, I went and got some medium level work out bands (a bit harder than they ones they use in the video) and man does it change the level of the work out. The kicking is pretty much the same... but if you have a good workout band while you're doing all the punching - it is hard to keep your hands up the whole time. I have a feeling some of the people that didn't like this DVD and thought it was easy were either not using the bands or using ones that were too easy..

 It is a bit disorganized and I try to focus more on Shelly on one of the other people while Billy is talking b/c he is a bit distracting. Plus once I got used to the sequence of the exercises I knew when he was going to have us quit early or do an extra set so it didnt bother me as much.

 But overall this is a good workout, by the end I am (no lie) dripping sweat onto the floor. The kicking can be a bit much for people that are not that flexible - so you may want to be cautious of that.
