Based on essentially a sketch of a story outline by H.P. Lovecraft, the tale is of a police psychiatrist Katheryn Mc Michaels(Barbara Crampton) who is put onto a case involving a man who seems to be getting strange visions in his head,after working on an "Resonator" experiment with Dr Pretorious... so he is locked up in a mental hospital run by a rivalous and sadistic female head doctor and her brutish orderlies. Mc Michaels is more understanding however, and wants to get to the bottom of what happened by taking the patient back to the lab, to re-create the experiment. What follows is a descent into the netherworld of Lovecraft-the theory that insane people, thanks to their malfunctioning brains and a strange gland, are really seeing visions of creatures from another dimension, trying to get in, a theme Lovecraft explored well in his other stories. What makes the film remembered so well are the in-camera and on-stage make-up FX work, all done on a low budget and before the overused CGI of today. Also Barbara Crampton(Mc Michaels)in an S&M outfit is worth the ticket alone. Later, as things get out of control,and the mutating patient is re-committed to the hospital, it is now Dr Mc Michaels who no one believes-dressed in her S&M garb- and she herself is involuntarily made a patient-happily so,by her rival doctor- restrained,gagged and scheduled for electro-shock treatment to "quiet her down". Thanks to a power outage by her mutating subject who throws an orderly into a fuse box, that doesn't happen. She brains an orderly(who deserves it) and escapes back to the lab, where the ongoing "experiment" reaches it's explosive and drippy conclusion....
