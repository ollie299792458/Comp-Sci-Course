This series was surely one of television's greatest achievements. Those of us who saw it when it was originally broadcast have never forgotten it.

Clark was an upper-class Englishman whose outlook was formed before the Second World War and so his idea of civilization is unabashedly European, Caucasian, and Romantic (in the sense of being inspired by Greece and Rome).  Art, for him, is the high art of the European masters (chiefly southern European; Clark was a noted Michelangelo authority), civilization the condition of humanity by which such can be created. He was by no means unaware of the art of other cultures; but, as several  comments during the series make clear, he would not have agreed with the more recent convention of considering "culture" and "civilization"  nearly-synonymous terms. Compressing two thousand years into several hours does result in some omissions and oversimplifications, as Clark knew perfectly well. But anyone with any interest in the history of European art, architecture, or thought simply must watch this series.

Before editing, this comment suggested that the DVD was made from a  faded print (the series was made on 35mm film); the fault turned out to lie in my DVD player, not in my DVD. The quality is pretty good; the colors are true. The technology and techniques used show their age -- the picture lacks a bit of crispness and scenes are often not as brightly lit as they might be nowadays -- but the picture looks quite nice even on a large plasma screen (using a progressive-scan player). I had docked the DVD one star for the picture problem; I would now give it five stars if I could figure whether and how Amazon's edit function lets me do that.
