First off, I am a huge fan of Judd Apatow and his work, however Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a miss for me. Some of the cast members seem rather flat. Kristin Bell seems to have a hard time delivering one believable line through the entire film, often seemingly sleepy or lethargic. If you're a fan of Family Guy you will instantly recognize Mila Kunis as Meg. (A fact that cannot be shaken for the duration of the film, which ensure that any scenes of intimacy are rather awkward) Russell Brand's irresistible casanova of a character seems rather contrived, it's just boring and predictable.

On the up side, Jason Segel does a wonderful job and it is superb
to see him step into a leading role. Jonah Hill does a fine job as well. Paul Rudd adds a few unexpected chuckles in his severely limited role. That being said, let it be noted that none of these fine men live up to their comedic paramount.

The plot is very simplistic and at times a bit slow. At almost 2 hours in length, there are points when you just wish it would end. Some of the jokes are funny, but most are not. This is certainly not the uproariously funny sort of story that Superbad, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up have made one come to expect from Mr. Apatow and his team.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a movie that is best rented before or in lue of purchasing. Try it on for size before you drop the money on it. If you're looking for a really hearty laugh try The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad or Knocked Up first.
