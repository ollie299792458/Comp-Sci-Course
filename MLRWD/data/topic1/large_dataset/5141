Good points: Yul Brynner does an excellent job as the menacing, devil-eyed gunslinger. He's so much better than the other actors, you want him onscreen as much as possible, even though he's a villain. The film has an interesting concept, even today. It's watchable all the way through, if you turn your mind down to low gear.
Bad points: Calling a film "watchable" is far from saying it's good. This one is not. Richard Benjamin is just not a very good actor, never has been, especially in lead roles. James Brolin doesn't have much to do, but he's weak anyway. Most everyone else is playing robots, and they act like it. The scientists in the film are cardboard cliches of "geeks with white lab coats". Dick Van Patten has a small part as in several 'comedy relief' scenes, which are so bad they're almost unwatchable. The film is amateurishly made and directed (though not ridiculously so), and gets worse as it goes along. There are large lapses in logic and believability. It has very little rewatchability - you see it once and move on quickly.
But none of that matters too much, because this type of film is not meant to be "Citizen Kane". In fact, it's somewhat similar to "Terminator", another mindless movie, though much better made. "Westworld" is a mildly pleasurable way to spend 90 minutes, but you might feel like you've had too much cotton candy when it's over. The DVD has no special features except the trailer, but the widescreen transfer and soundtrack are fine. This is better rented than owned. You won't be returning to it very much unless you're really desperate.
