...But be sure the neighbors aren't home!  This DVD (with the possible exception of "Apollo 13") has been the closest thing to the movie theater experience in the genre.  My home theater system was BOOMING.  A  great digital transfer complements and showcases this action  thriller.
You've read the synopsis so I won't bore you with my critique  of the screenplay and acting.  However, superb casting, a twinge of reality  play by Nick Cage, a captivating Ed Harris and the evergreen suave presence  of Sean Connery carries the cookie-cutter script playfully and  effectively.
I came short of giving the film five stars only because of  the "Die Hard" formulaic aspect of the film; a collection of  hostages, weapons-savvy terrorists and the everyday Joe who saves the day.  Otherwise, the movie is chock-full of memorable special effects, one-liners  (Connery's annecdote of the "prom queen" is spectacular) and  Director Michael Bay's talented use of atmosphere to tell the story.  All  of these aspects make "The Rock" a welcome addition to my DVD  library.
