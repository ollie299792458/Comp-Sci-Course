You will either hate this movie or be blown away by it.  I was fortunate to see it in the theatre and it was one of the first DVD's I purchased.  I was blown away by it...my wife didn't understand it and thought it was depressing.
I have always admired Nicholis Cage as an actor.  He has a way of commanding the screen and drawing you into his deeper self.  The people he portrays always seem to be touchable and real.  Elizabeth Shue did an excelent job as her role as a street walker.  Besides the acting, the cinematography and music also lend to the film's character.  Yes, it is a depressing movie about a drunk who has managed to loose everything and a street walker who's life is spiraling out of control.  But it is also a movie about 2 people finding happiness, even though it is short lived, in this crazy world.  They come to depend on each other till the end.  I have always said that a minute of happiness is worth more than a day of dispair.  
All in all I liked this movie and would recomend it to anyone who likes movies with a "deeper meaning."  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
