First know that I grew up in the UK and Judge Dredd is my favorite comic series and has been for some time.  The movie:  Stallone seemed like a decent cast, after all Dredd was somewhat based on him originally apparently.  Now, Stallone's acting ability has never troubled me much... if the movie is good than its not too distracting for me.  Some people detest him but I'm not one of them.  The story itself is based on a lot of bits and pieces from actual Judge Dredd strips and it stays fairly true to the past.  The special effects are pretty good and the costumes and sets are mostly great.  For me this movie was an absolute trip because of my background in Dredd... seeing a last walk, the block wars, the abc robot... awesome!  I eventually bought the DVD too.  Dredd fans will either love it (Because its Judge Dredd!) or hate it (Because its not Judge Dredd enough...) so rent it first.  Like I said, I love it.  True, it doesn't capture the entire feel of Judge Dredd, it leaves some things out and adds some things in but what did you expect? and yeah... he takes off his helmet... but overall I feel like Hollywood could have done much worse.
