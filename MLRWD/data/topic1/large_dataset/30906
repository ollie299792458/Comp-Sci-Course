I am reviewing this movie in 8/08 and was thrilled I got to see it.  Colin Farrell has made many movies over his career often to mixed reviews.  He seems to either be really good or not good at all.  But he has that star presence and I must admit he is one of my favorites.  Anyone with any doubts as to the acting chops of Colin Farrell must see this movie.  His acting here shows he is among the top in his field and he is capable of anything.  It is an acting tour de force.

This film is important on many levels and I think it was very underrated.  It truly deserves a place in film history as one of the best films about war.  And it manages to do this without having any battle scenes or even making it to the war.

It takes place in the army training program and shows what all this endures emotionally and physically.  The movie is fully carried on the shoulders of Colin Farrell.  He plays army infantryman private Bozz and has a very strong, rebellious personality while being very intelligent and full of potential at the same time.

I don't want to give away more of the plot.  It is a very real, intense emotional movie about the Vietnam War.  The whole ensemble cast is incredible and I have not watched a film that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, emotionally involved and that also left me with much to think about in a long time.  Colin Farrell deserved Oscar attention for this.

Highly recommended.
