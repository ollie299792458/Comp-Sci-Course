That gorgeous smile shows up in the first scene. The black and white movie opens with fabulous footage of New Orleans' French Quarter in the '50s, with vendors singing of their produce--an historical practice. A woman on a mule-drawn cart sings "Crawfish," and Elvis leans out a balcony window and joins in her song. As he sings, he ducks back inside and is viewed only through the sheer curtains, tantalizing his fans until the viewer is allowed into the apartment.

Elvis's favorite movie of his is mine, too. Good jazzy songs, good story, and yes, good acting by the young, trim Elvis. His lines were delivered without rushing them the way he did in other movies, and with an appropriate amount of emotion.

A few of the lines from the two needy women who loved him were a little melodramatic, but that can be overlooked, it's all so camp, cute and nostalgic, with a sweet song in a happy ending that brings tears to my eyes.

Written by Harold Robbins who also wrote _The Carpetbaggers_, "King Creole" is heavy drama with some PG violence and adult themes but '50s clean.

Interesting note: Dolores Hart, who plays good girl Nellie, also appeared in "Loving You" and the first "Where the Boys Are." She left Hollywood and became a nun. Now a Mother Superior, she retains her membership in the Academy and votes each year for the Academy Awards, so I have read.

The supporting cast all give great performances, especially bad girl Carolyn Jones, her "boyfriend," Walter Matthau as the villain, plus Dean Jagger as Elvis's father.

Elvis loved this movie and wanted to do more drama, such as Peter O'Toole's "The Lion in Winter." He hated the trite movies the Colonel pushed on him, hated that his wildly successful movies provided financing for good movies of less-received depth and drama he was not allowed to do.

"King Creole" shows he could have done them well. And the singing, of course, is wonderful!
