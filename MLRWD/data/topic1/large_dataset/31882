Forget alien species, abductions, cover-ups, conspiracies, and everything else as it pertains to The X Files.  All of those things are indeed quite fantastic, and this is supposed to be science fiction, but with a good and willing imagination you can still immerse yourself in the X Files universe and be fully engrossed in the story.

But now, due to recent history, much of the impact of Kurtzweil's revelations are now no longer suspenseful, as it has been proven to be so ludicrous that its unbelievability overshadows the rest of the picture.

That is, due to the events of the past week or two on the US Gulf Coast, I find it impossible to take the concept of FEMA as a well-run agency deeply involved with a high level alien/governmental cover-up that is poised to take over the country, with any degree of seriousness.  It is apparent that FEMA would have difficulty running a hot dog cart, let alone step in as the government.

"I think you know. The timetable has

  been set. It will happen on a holiday,

  when people are away from their homes.

  When our elected officials are at

  their resorts or out of the country.

  The President will declare a state of

  emergency, at which time all federal

  agencies, all government will come

  under the power of the Federal

  Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,

  Agent Mulder. The secret government."

Sure.
