I enjoy the police drama.  I have served in the capacity in real life for 20 years.  NYPD Blue, Hill Street Blues, and the Shield...enjoyed them all.  This one...Flashpoint...I turned it off in the first episode...I waited and tried a second time..I think that was even worse.  I've done SWAT for 12 years.  I don't mind that they don't use a full SWAT Team...that would make too many characters and would be too confusing.  My problem is that this show is going to be the general publics idea of what SWAT does and how it does it.  First off the same guy doesn't negotiate one minute, be the commander the next minute, then become a gun toter all before the critical incident ends...the sniper in the first episode...first he chooses to take a roof top position (ok..ok for dramatic purpose...I'll let that slide); however when he calls over the radio and says "I have cold zero"...did they even look up what that meant? That was even cheesier than an 80's Arnold line. Cold zero refers to your clean, cold bore shot. A Sniper needs to know where that first cold bore shot is gonna hit...then he/she needs to know where the next fouled barrel shot is gonna go....I got "cold zero"...I got stomach cramps after that line....I just couldn't let this show keep going with 4 and 5 stars.  You want to see a 4 or 5 man team kick some butt with some drama thrown in, watch The Unit.  At least the producer and creator of The Unit was in Delta Force....whomever did Flashpoint needs to find a SWAT technical advisor
