John Carpenter is a very uneven director, even in a genre where the standards are too often low.  The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness were outstanding--suspenseful, artistic in their look, disturbing and unsettling in a way that left the audience not quite sure where things were going.  In particular, the design and special effects were superb for their time.  But in other films, such as Vampires and Ghosts of Mars, he misses completely.  There is nothing new to the look of these films, nothing special about the storyline, nothing unique or even interesting about the special effects.  Ghosts of Mars is truly an awful movie, even for a B horror film.  Aside from the lunacies of the story, the fact is that there is no suspense at all.  The tale is told as a flashback from Natasha Henstridge's character's viewpoint, and while the fate of a single character is somewhat uncertain, we're sure at the beginning that most everyone is cannon fodder.  The monsters look like a cross between Alice Cooper, TNA Wrestlers, and the Orcs from Lord of the Rings--except the Orcs look better and are more frightening.  The suspense seems to consist of wondering how many more monsters Carpenter can pile into the mob--Night of the Living Dead was a lot more atmospheric and effective.  So there's one reason, and one reason only, to see this film--Natasha Henstridge.  She's gorgeous, plain and simple.  But whether that's enough reason to buy the DVD, I doubt.
