The New Guy will never win over the sheep that flock to the Coen Brothers movies.  And The New Guy will always be panned by critics and psuedo-critics.  But this is the type of movie where you just sit back for an hour and a half and just laugh at the stupidity of the film.  At it's core, The New Guy is a fun movie for anyone under 30.  Sure, the story is lame.  But DJ Qualls has the quirky charm he had in Road Trip.  Eliza Dushku probably could have starred in a much better indie flick.  But she gets to show off as a feminine sex object in this film.  Not the kind of rough, down-and-dirty girl that's she's played in Buffy and Angel.  The cameos help this film a lot.  Lyle Lovett is surprisingly funny as Qualls' father.  While Eddie Griffin plays a big role early in the movie, he moves to the background for a fair amount of time.  Some of his stuff is forced.  But in the end, you know this movie wouldn't have worked without him.
If you're looking to just have fun with a movie, I'd highly suggest The New Guy.  It's a good movie for a Saturday or Sunday when nothing is on.  If you can watch The Transporter, you can watch The New Guy too.
