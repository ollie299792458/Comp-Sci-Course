I love this show, became addicted to it way before Phil Hartman was murdered.  I fell in love with it because of Khandi Alexander; her sassy sister remarks and fine comedic acting was the clencher for me to continue watching.  The fact that even the producers and directors admitted that she was underused was a further incentive for watching, incase they opted to give her some more meaningful dialogue, which meant she would do more than just be added as "also starring....

I enjoyed Dave from the "Boys in the Hall" series and Joe from his stand up comedy.  The other cast members are honorable in their own right.

The only gripe I have with this show was with the previous reviews including the ones on the commentaries; yelping on and about the Lisa character, yeah she was cute in a non developed frontal way.  I enjoyed the Vicki Lewis and Khandi Alexander very much for their sardonic humour excellent timing and fabulous good looks. Phil Hartman without saying was gorgeously talented and I loved his face offs with the Lisa and Catherine characters.  Also I wish they had continued the Ton Luc character along with Junior.

Three scenes I thoroughly enjoyed which featured Khandi Alexander prominently were: (1)When she taught Bill ebonics for the beer commercial (2)When she was leaving and everyone had their take on that day, and when (3)she daydreamed how the office would be if it were really diversified.
