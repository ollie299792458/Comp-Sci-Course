Once again, I'd like to give a half-star rating, but alas . . .

As my by-line indicates, I am a former high school teacher.  Without exception, this is the version of Hamlet that is a class-room favorite.  (I show 2 others: Branaugh (2nd place) and the film starring Ethan Hawke (everyone hates it).)  It is accessible to younger viewers and is just a beautiful film all around.

The filming, camera work and sets are impeccable.  One is instantly transported into the world these characters inhabit.  As to the script, it IS heavily edited; however, most of what is omitted (see note below) is "shown" to the audience through visual media.  This isn't a "filmed version of the play"; it is a film based on the play.  In that framework, it is quite well done.  I particularly like the beginning scenes that make Hamlet's description of his mother - "Like Niobe, all tears" - come to life.

The acting, to my thinking, is superb.  The emphasis here is on Hamlet's relationship to his mother, Gertrude. That comes through quite clearly.  Gibson's Hamlet comes across as a soldier - a man of action - who agonizes over the eternal consequences of his acts.  He is believable in the role, masterful in some ways.  Likewise the supporting cast.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Glenn Close provide particularly vibrant portrayals of their characters.

So, why not 5 stars?  Without the "Fortinbras" subplot, some of the urgency in the play seems missing.  While definitely a secondary story-line, it provides a framework that adds tension to the play as a whole as the war is waged both outside the castle walls and within.

Overall, this production gets an A.  Very accessible.  Very easily understood.  And haunting in its own way.
