Film:  Wing Commander 
starring: EVERYBODY! 
I am overwhelmed by this Giant sleeping on our 'New Releases' video store sections! 
This is what astronomers would call a "Sci-Fi Supercluster"!  What the French  would call a "Tour de Force!"  What an American audience honed in  would call "Star  Wars for Grown Ups!"  what musicians and the  appreciators and lovers of music would call, "Music Marshalled  Magnificate!" (and so on,an on anon)  And it is what  this movie's  devoted fan can recollect from its most excellent script-- "Give'em a  BROADSIDE!..." 
Cinematic Science Fiction Will hark back to this  Golden Glory!  I promise!  There are not stars enough bespeckling the dark  gilded globe of night to measure this  Masterpiece!  We recieved the old  U-Boat Commander, the old Sleuth, the Time Traveller, and Nostradamus too!  What More and what more Beautiful leadership  could we have asked for?  Where were We in these scarlet hours with tin Rapier crates and a People  United under  Pilgrims?  Methinks there is nothing "new" under  "Silla's" grasp, nor under Sol, nor star, nor history's past.  
Some movies just knock you flat with their ensembled technical and  melodic perfection.  This is one among the few I can count to.  Just  viewing the movie's intro  credits and theme montage gives me shivers,  "nothing I've ever seen before"  WOW!  I remember that line  spoken in the film's scence obseving the unsteady  recklessness of youthful  moxie machismo, and I think it applies to this review:  "Now, what  were you saying?"--Black Pilot. 
Remember, Honor, Delight;  a No  Prisoners Production of  Wing Commander, a Chris Roberts Film, written by  Chris Roberts.  Thanks Chris, thanks all of You!
