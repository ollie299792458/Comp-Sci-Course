I didn't know if I'd like this kind of movie or not. Is it a typical comedy? Was it dark humor? What kind of movie is this anyway? Some kind of multiple bromance thing?

Well, it turns out it was a great romp. Basically what you have here is the quintessential surreal Vegas bachelor party adventure tale. And what a tale they tell. The premise of having these guys wake up after a night in Vegas with all sorts of strange repercussions, no memory of the events, and a missing key member of their group... it was a brilliant way to tell the story - much more so than if they had simply shown the events straight up. Unravelling the mystery is a blast, as they uncover one crazy stunt after another from the night before, and even continue on with some of them while they try to find their missing buddy.

The film sustains the momentum throughout the movie and ends with a blast with the credits. It's hard to precisely rate a movie like this, but it was a lot of fun and basically defines what people will think about when it comes to Vegas and bachelor parties for the foreseeable future. Fun movie.
