You have to watch this movie for the car chase if for no other reason.  And it is the car chase between McQueen's Mustang and the Dodge Charger that most people remember this movie for... But, there is more to it than  that. Steve McQueen is just about perfect as the world weary but dedicated  police Lt. Frank Bullitt. Out to get the killer who shot one of the police  officers assigned to his detail to protect a mob informer.  When politics  and self-interest on the part of Bullitt's bosses in the department, gets  in his way, he goes right ahead, bucking authority.  Jacqueline Bisset is  lovely as usual and is a fine plot point as well.  Setting us up for some  soul searching and to ask just what is the cost for dealing with killers  and victims day after day. The soundtrack is very good. Never getting in  the way of the story and propelling us along with it.  The bass line at the  beginning of the car chase gets you in the proper mood very well. A fair  piece of the credit for this film has to go to Don Gordon as Frank's  partner, Delgetti.  Perfectly played in udertones. He looks more like a  police detective than McQueen does. Also, this movie started a trend for  turtle neck sweaters with blazers... After this movie came out, if you  looked up "Cool" in the dictonairy, you saw McQueen's picture and  a note to watch this movie.
