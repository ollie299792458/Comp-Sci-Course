ok, I'll admit it, I have yet to see the actual DVD.  BUT I have seen all the episodes, so, I can tell you how they are induvidually.  By the way, I am a devout Christian myself!

The Passion of the Jew---4 stars.

This episode is totally sarcastic, you have to relize that.  It completely makes fun of the claims that the Passion was anti-semetic.  Cartman starts a Christian-Nazi group. Pretty funny.

Christian Hard Rock----3 stars

I understand the what they were trying to say, that Christianity is too exploited, but I think the eway they did it was a bit much.  OK, but not laugh out loud funny.

Red Hot Catholic Love---5 stars

Almost blatantly says to belive in the Bible.  At the end, the priest hold up the Bible and says "Sometimes bylaws are OK, but let's not forget what this church was founded on." Or something to that effect.  I was just like YES.  I could tell that this started out as supposed to be dealing with the priest molestation contraversy, but it kind of drifted off.  This is the best one on here.

The only reason I didn't give i 5 stars is because I think for that much  money, we should be getting The Passion of the Jew, Christian Hard Rock, Red Hot Catholic Love, Damein, Do the Handicapped Go To Hell and Probably, and Are you there God It's me Jesus.  And every other religious themed episode for that matter.  If you ask me, there should be a political DVD, too!  Anyway, they are funny, but needed to be a bit toned down.
