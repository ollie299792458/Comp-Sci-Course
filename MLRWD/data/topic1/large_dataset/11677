If you're a fan of movies that are so bad that they're hilarious, you have found a treasure in this movie. It's hilarious from the beginning to the end, the way "Evil Dead" is, wonderfully campy and bloody and over-the-top ridiculous. In a good way. (An awesome way, even.)

Possible spoilers (not that it matters too much with this movie...):
It features such amazing things as a character who stores mints in his fake eye (occasionally pulling it out of his head and unscrewing it to eat some mints, as casually as if he were pulling a candy tin out of his pocket), a plot that's more and more crazy as the movie progresses, and epic fight scenes. Including one in which someone tries to strangle their enemy by using their own guts. (Yes, you read it right, they take a knife, cut themselves and pull out their own guts, then use it as a rope to try and strangle their enemy. Completely randomly in the middle of the fight.)

I highly recommend this movie for any fan of campy bloody/horror movies.
