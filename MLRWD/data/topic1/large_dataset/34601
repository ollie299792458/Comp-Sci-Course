As action filled and romantic as I recall as a youth.  While chronologically first, Captain Horatio Hornblower picks up where AE's superb eight-part TV series leaves off.  The movie captures the essence of three of C.S. Forester's Hornblower novels: Beat To Quarters, Ship of the Line, Flying Colors.  Indeed Forester translates his own works, writing the screenplay for the movie. It's 1807.  The story takes the viewer from treachery on the Pacific coast of Central America to deception on the coast of Napoleon-controlled Spain.  In between there is leadership, battle, courage and romance. Everything you'd want in a classic seafaring yarn.  Peck is in fine form as the unflappable, sometimes stoic title character.  Virginia Mayo plays the love interest.  The principals are surrounded by a colorful cast that moves from skepticism to obedient service, good dry humor, and the occasional wager on just how skilled be their captain.  The DVD includes a nostalgic 1952 Lux radio (audio) broadcast of the storyline and a Warner Brothers Bugs Bunney-Yosemite Sam cartoon, "Captain Hareblower," for the youngters.

While the contemporary Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World - and Russell Crow's Jack Aubrey - in my view exceeds this film in many areas, including realism.  (After HMS Lydia fires two unanswered broadsides into a ship-of-the-line, one subordinate remarks, "There'll be no fooling her a third time I'm thinking," to which another replies, "For what we're about to receive, let us be truly grateful."  Grateful at the anticipation of receiving a 36-gun broadship?  That's Hollywood.)  Nevertheless, Gregory Peck is - well - impeccable and the action flows in this throw-back version of Rule Britannia!
