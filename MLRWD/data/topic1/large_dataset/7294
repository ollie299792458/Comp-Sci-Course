So I was home with a winter bug, I was bored, I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and I thought, hey, here's a science fiction movie I HAVEN'T seen yet! Why not watch it now?

What a mistake.

Now before I go too much into why it was a mistake, let me point out some good stuff: the movie is fairly hard sci-fi (except in one or two places where script-writers obviously wanted to take the easy way out), and the plot itself isn't half bad.

For the most part the score is decent enough to stay out of the way of the movie, and the atmosphere and effects stand up to most movies being released today.

Unfortunately, the acting is tepid at best, the characters aren't well enough developed to make the audience care about them, the dialogue is forced and unnatural, and there's this weird god-vs.-science subplot that distracts from the main story-line and never resolves itself.

What could have been a movie to rival 2001: A Space Odyssey for atmosphere and tension falls flat under these flaws, and suddenly I'm watching a movie that just... doesn't hold my interest.
Sad, really. It could have been a great film.
