I really enjoyed his movie.  Knowing the Bible's plaques and also knowing scientific facts of how they could be justified if you wanted to not take them to reason of it all being God's will I could appreciate this movie very much.  I found this gripping, intense and also touching at times.  I would say be your own critic in this particular movie.  Don't watch the special features first!  Not knowing how they did the locus scene made it more intense and horrific.  I didn't notice the rating of this movie but I would give it a R rating myself and not let small children watch this movie.  I would even not trust a PG-13 rating because of the occult message in the movie of Satin verses God message that was sent during this movie when they arrived in Haven.  This is just my opinion.  I am a Hilary Swank movie collector and have no regrets I've added this to my collection.  I thought she did a great job in this movie. AnnaSophia was delightful yet frightening at times when she gave that glare of hers with those beautiful eyes.  I am glad they selected her to play the little girl who lived in the swamps.
