I purchased this set prior to general release from the Highlander site and was excited to view the one season of the Highlander "universe" I hadn't seen. Unfortunately...it's a dud! The plots center more around police-type drama shoving the immortal aspects to the background; there is no chemistry between the two lead actors, and only Amanda's presence makes the show watchable. What disturbed me the most were the "Jerry Springer segments" that were included on each disk describing how petty and childish everybody remotely associated with the show appear to be! I mean really!! I kept waiting for the punchline, the "just kidding folks!" that never came. Why exactly should I care about Elizabeth's "sociopathic" boyfriend, her night with Clinton, her paranoia? Why do I care about people not getting paid what they wanted or not getting enough camera time? The frenchman who did the score was terrible....so, why did they keep him? And, why do I care again? The worst part though was the hammering away on the point of how the two lead actors hated each other...boy, really made me buy into the relationship between their characters. All in all, this was the worst thing I've purchased on DVD....save your money and buy a series of quality!
