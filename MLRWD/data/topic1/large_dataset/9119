On the way to a Bloodlust concert, two teenage girls stop in a rough area to try and buy some weed. They get taken to an apartment where four escaped felons kidnap them. They eventually take them out to the countryside where they humiliate, rape, and kill them. Ironically, the countryside is one of the girls' backyard. The killers take up with the girl's parents, who when finding out about the killing take up revenge.
Wes Craven tries to use light music and comedy angles to make light out of the rape and murder scenes. The ending was predictable and the last 30 minutes of the movie is completely stupid.
Another movie this is compared to is I Spit On Your Grave. Like that movie, this one attempts to make you hate several characters and then then give you the satisfaction to watch them die. The problem with them both is that they attempt humour where there should be none. The victims in both also put themselves through more humiliation in order to get revenge.
There is not even any good gore. This movie is for rape scene freaks only.
