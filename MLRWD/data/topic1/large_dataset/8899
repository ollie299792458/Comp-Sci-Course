Ha, years ago when the Internet was young, I got a video short of a young Melony Griffith naked in the ocean. Meanwhile a man and women were watching her through the bottom (glass) of a boat making funny comments. I kept that video short thinking one day, I'll try to figure out which movie it is, buy it, and perhaps see more of Melony's beautiful body in her prime.  Years and years went by; I didn't know I still had it.

Fast forward: I was cleaning out old files and stumbled on the old video short. Hmm, this movie is old enough that I didn't recognize Gene Hackman (too much hair, and mellow voice). So with today's Internet tools so advanced, I did a search on Melony figuring the movie had to be one of her first. (she's about 16 or 17 in the movie) I found this title that way only because Gene's name is Harry and the movie synopsis named the title character Harry. So, I bought the movie, in part because of a naked Melony, and in part because it's Gene Hackman. (whom I've always liked)

What a pleasant surprise this movie is! It's a classic murder "who done it" with many bodies piling up. Melony's nude scenes were completely innocent as she plays a girl who's quite used to being naked and not really one to like clothing. Typically, she's a teenage seductive of older men which doesn't work on Gene. This creates a very interesting plot line, and why she gets "loose with the clothes" in an innocent way. (which is very good) Obviously, the movie is dated, especially the clothing, but it takes nothing away from this good thriller.

So, Melony: When you get the royalty for the movie I bought, realize that a simple very short video clip of your naked body on the Internet, many years ago, is the ONLY reason I bought it. Well, having Gene Hackman as the main star certainly didn't hurt.

I highly recommend this movie to those who loved film before Hollywood films became computer programs, and simple nudity wasn't always porn.
