First of all this is a horror film-- that is, it's completely unrealistic: it's for fun.  So relax and don't expect the Godfather or Casablanca.  The characters are quite exaggerated: [the girl], the sensitive guy, the insensitve guy, the other not so sensitive guy, sensitive guy's distant love interest, the scary drifter, the party dude sheriff's deputy, and all the nutty townsfolk.  Some of the acting isn't so great- but overall the scenes are well shot with good suspense.  A creative look at horror where the bad guy isn't a killer but a disease, that starts to make the infected look like the bad guy.  Not like Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead (2004) where people become violent "zombies."  But a demonstration of how tradegy can either unite or tear a group of people apart.  If you liked Jeepers Creepers 2, Resident Evil, or Dawn of the Dead (as I did), then I would expect you'd like this one too.  I'm waiting for Eli Roth's next film.  Www.rottentomatoes.com has clips from this film that show some of the more exciting/neat scenes, as well as interviews with the director and actors.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and watched this film.  One of the criticisms is that nothing happens until the last half hour of the film.  Oh so not true!  Another criticism: "weak plot"... Well so what?  It was fun, all the plot you need is beware of the sickness, each other, and run/fight/survive/argue!
