This movie is one that you can watch 2002 times and never get tired of it. At first, I thought that the slight modern twist that is added to it was stupid, and a bad idea. After about 5 minutes of watching, however, I realized that it made was great idea. Language used, music, and dances from both the present and the past combine to give this movie an edgy and sort of magical feel. The sets and extras are equally stunning. With the extras fully costumed and sets like the times, one watching might feel like they are right there in the jousting arena. Heath Ledger gives such a confident and remarkable performance, I would watch it just to see him act! The rest of the cast features old and new faces that help this movie become better and better. Although the actress who plays William's(Heath Ledger) love is dreadfully disappointing, the "comic releifs" are very amusing. This movie may have little suspense and is fairly predictable, but I think that anyone who watches it will smile at least 2 or 3 times and admit that they enjoyed it. But enough reading. I suggest you back up to the top of the page, add this video to your cart and enjoy being taken back to medieval times right from your chair in the 21st century!
