When I visited amazon.com for the first time, and discovered this movie was becoming available, I ordered it so fast I left skid marks on my credit card! It's always been a special movie for me; my folks took me to see it  when I graduated Navy boot camp, during its original theatrical release in  1984. And I have managed to view it from time to time on a bad copy of a  "Disney Channel free weekend" (all the "to subscribe, call  now" captions getting in the way of all that natural beauty) I never  hesitated to recommend this movie to anyone who will listen, because it has  the rare ability to appeal to virtually anyone, a movie with true universal  appeal. Sadly, many people have never heard of it, and come back glowing  with wonder after viewing it, even with the Disney Channel copy. I cannot  think of a film director who has managed to translate to screen existing  popular literature into such a moving and masterful pieces of celluloid  art; one of my other favorite movies is the 1979 version of The Black  Stallion (wish it were available widescreen; is any body  listening? )These are what movies are supposed to be like, and I never  tire of watching either of these two American masterpieces, as they grow  more wonderous and comfortable at the same time.
