We see a lot of movies. A good chunk of the movies we see are independent; small is usually better in the industry. Well, not in this case.

As others have said, the box touts a "come as you were" party for mid 80's grads. Being two mid-80's grads, we were looking forward to the fun. But the movie starts with the hangovers & we don't even get to see everyone's "were."  It' s as if it starts in the middle. Watching this is akin to going to your new boy/girl-friend's reunion & sitting around listening to everyone talk about people you don't know.

Some of the performances are passable, most are bad. Eric Stoltz is embarrassing. He should be further embarrassed because he helped produce it. (We were wondering if they just filmed the whole thing in his house on the cheap). All of these 36 year olds act like 16 year olds...only in really boring ways.

The premise and much of the "business" given to the actors makes no sense (why would you scrub the grout of the bathroom with a toothbrush when there are bigger messes all around you to pick up?) The co-writer was a staff writer for South Park, so you would THINK that there would be something remotely funny here. You'd be thinking wrong.

What JBizzle said...get the soundtrack if you're feeling nostalgic...get this if you have insomnia. This is about as much like "The Big Chill" as "Ernest Scared Stupid" is like "Silence of the Lambs."
