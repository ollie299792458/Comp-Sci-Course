If you have followed Winwoods career his finished products or albums have been very polished. Even his latest, About Time, although done live in the Studio, really showed a "perfectionist" at work. The great thing about this DVD is its not overly polished. The filming is amateur, the spliced interviews are very random and he uses some psycadelic effects for a 60"s early 70"s mood. Yet he pays homage to a great band and in this case a Dear friend, Jim Capaldi, and shows what creating the Traffic Sound in the 60's and early 70's was about. It was about music not technology.

Winwood has publicly stated that Traffic was the material he was most proud of, as he continues to experiment and recreate the "Traffic Jams" in concert. Capaldi and him were there the whole step of the way. Unfortunately, Mason did not come along for the ride, but this is Winwoods tribute to Capaldi and even Jerry Garcia.  The Dear Mr Fantasy clip is special. Who knows what Winwood will do next, but if he closes the chapter on Traffic here, he did so with utmost respect to that era.
