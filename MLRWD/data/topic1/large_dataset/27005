Spike Lee hasn't quite gotten the recognition he deserves.  25th Hour is one of the best films of 2002 yet it was somewhat underrated and overlooked.  It is moody, powerful, and thoughtful.  It is not a plot-driven film as it follows a retired drug dealer during his last day before a 7-year prison sentence.  As the first film made in New York after September 11, the destruction and mourning caused by the attacks is very present in the film.  25th Hour has a powerful voice that speaks to everyone.  One particular scene in which Edward Norton talks cynically to himself may seem slightly offensive to some, but that's not the point.  The cast gives great performances with characters the audience can relate to.  Rosario Dawson gives a mature and believable performance as Norton's girlfriend.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a conflicted and mild-mannered school teacher, and Barry Pepper is an egotistical stock broker.  This film will make you reflect on your own life and the world we live in.  Our struggles, the decisions we must make, the prejudices and false judgements we have - they all come to life on screen through a character who realizes the mistakes he's made are going to change his life.
