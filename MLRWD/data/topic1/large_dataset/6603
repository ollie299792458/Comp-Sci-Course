Oooh, he makes such a delcious bad guy, even if he isn't the "bad guy" of the film.. it's rather confusing. Silly me, not knowing that this was a sequel! (the title doesn't really help, in French, it's the much more sensible "desperado II" but I can't complain...) I would advise people to see the first one first! (Yeah, that makes sense) Unless of course, you're like crazy moi, who just needs a good amount of screen time with the quirky Johnny D - something that this film delivers.
His character was definately the saving grace of the film - and the only reason why I liked it. One would think that after going throught what he does in this film -- won't spoil the surprise-- that he wouldn't be very happy, to put it mildly. However, the character of Sands still manages his dry sarcasm and great one-liners throughout the film. For the rest of the acting? Good, I guess, I didn't think Antonio was at his best, but then again, all he's required to do is look brooding. Ah well.
Thank you to other reviewers who spoiled the surprise of what happens to half the characters, now there's no suspense, but hey, I won't repeat it. Needless to say I was grapsing at the screen going "No!!! no, you can't do.... Ack!" at a certain point in the film. 
I loved the movie, my best friend hated it, but admitted that both Mr Depp and Mr Banderas looked pretty darn good. However, I'll warn you, if you freaked out when Jack Sparrow was stabbed in POTC, you're not going to enjoy part of this film... ((see my comments above)) I hope, like me, you have the DVD of PIrates or some other movie with Johnny Depp at home for you to watch once this one is over..... you may just need it...
