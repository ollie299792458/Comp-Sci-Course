um...this isn't going to be about the Godzilla Final Wars movie but more about the future of the big G.  I'm seeing a lot of reviews about this movie compaired to the past Godzilla movies.  I'm wondering how this movie rates next to that stupid Americanized version that the ID guys did.  If this should be the last Godzilla movie that Toho puts out I'd really liek to see another go by someone here in the states...now hear me out on this one.  I just went to see the new King Kong movie the other day and I have to say that you can see the love Peter Jackson had for the character.  While a Peter Jackson 3 hr Godzilla movie shall only be a dream of mine I figure there has got to be someone in Hollywood that could make a Godzilla movie with the same care that mr. Jackson put into Kong. I really don't see why they couldn't make an American Godzilla movie using the same Godzilla that they use in Japan except use CGI instead of a man in a suit. I recall years ago a rumor of Spielberg talking about a Godzilla movie....instead we got the garbage that was put out under the name of Godzilla by someone else and Mr. Spielberg is making Transformers.  There have been a lot of Japanese movies remade in America over the past couple of years that have done pretty well so maybe it's time for the Big G to get a second chance over here.
