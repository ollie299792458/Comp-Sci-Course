My husband and I both enjoyed this series. "Island At War."  It is about a small British Island that is occupied by the Germans who build an airfield there during World Was II.  The action involves several families on the Island as they try to adjust to living in an entirely different type of environment and way of life.  The Germans attempt to rule in a "friendly" fashion, but it is hard to live under a friendly enemy.  There are many subplots that keep this movie moving along at an exciting pace.  You actually become a part of the Island population because you come to know the people intimately.  We initially rented this series from Netflix and liked it enough to purchase it from Amazon to become a permanent part of our DVD collection.  That in itself is recommendation of the well produced film.  This is the kind of series that keeps you up until two o'clock in the morning because you keep wanting to find out what happens next.  Although it is about World War II, it is not a war movie, but rather a movie of people who try to live a normal life under occupation during World War II.
