It didn't take very long watching this movie to realize why Michelle Williams was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. About 15 minutes in you stop feeling that Marilyn Monroe doesn't look quite like herself and begin to believe you are watching the actual actress making a movie about herself. Michelle Williams disappears into Marilyn Monroe. The same can't be said for Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier. In fact, it took a bit of confusion before I realized who he was supposed to be (not quite as much with Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh). For a while they were just "Larry and Vivien" and I had no idea they were supposed to be portraying famous actors.

Another point of confusion was the R rating for this movie. I banished my 11-year-old from the room lest she see a lot of nudity or sexual situations. Instead I found the movie had no violence, very little sex past kissing and a skinny dipping scene where the audience got only the briefest view of someone's backside, and no nudity accept the aforementioned backside. I can only assume the use of the "F" word on one or two occasions elicited this R rating, because nothing else seemed to more than PG-13.

The movie itself was fascinating, engaging and never dull, if only for the behind the scenes portrayals of some very famous people. It's an interesting look into old movie making and the life of an icon in the 1950's. Highly recommended.
