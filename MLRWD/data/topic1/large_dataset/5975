I first saw Damage back in 93 on accident, I was not sure what this film was about and Sadly but true I was only in 4th grade when I saw it. I rememmber I wanted to see it because the Dad from Danny the champion of the world was in it. I am now a 21 year old actor and this film made Jeremy Irons my all time favoirte actor. I was obessed with this film for the longest time. I loved everything about it especially the haunting soundtrack. Now that I watch it as a grown man, what chills me is that this situation happens all the time, meaning you fall in love with a person no matter what, how or when. Even if the consequences are fatal and you know their fatal, you can not help but want this person and just desire them. Do I think Steven loved this woman Anna, yes and thats the problem, he never loved truly befor and I know this because I know people who have gone through this. Did Anna love Steven? I dont think so, to me she was the typical slut like rebel who will do anyone that comes across her, only this time she fetched a man who actually loved her. Also you can see she does not love him when he offers to leave his wife. it's a very sad tale but in my opinion It's one of the most realistic look on what happens when you love a person, but they dont love you back. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who is looking for something or has found someone else to full fill what they have longed for in life and just take a good look at the consequences one must pay.
