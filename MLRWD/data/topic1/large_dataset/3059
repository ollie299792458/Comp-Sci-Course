Believe it or not, this is one of my favorite comedy Christmas movies I've ever watched. I've seen it at least 10 times within the last two months on DVD, and I'll probably see it again another 20 on TBS today. The movie itself is pretty humorous. It reminds me of when I was a child in elementary and how fun that day was. The acting was so phenomonal to me, because all the parts were played well. My favorite part was when the Ralphie says in a very fast pace that he wasnts a Red Rider BB Gun to the Macy's mall santa, only to get the common response "You'll shoot your eye out kid...". Then he kicks Ralphie down the slide. This DVD is very fun to watch. This movie came out in 1983, and it's actually older tha I am. It includes a trailer, comentary, and interviews with the characters. Like I said before, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old at all. If you're reading this review right now today, TBS is playing the movie all day, so you can't miss it.

Peace!
