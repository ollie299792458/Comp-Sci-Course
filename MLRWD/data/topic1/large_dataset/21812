I loved the whole thing, Live at Aspen, Not Included and even The German Show but I felt that the Live at the Hollywood Bowl featured on it left out some parts. I mean I've never seen it anywhere else but it does seem to jump about like some parts were cut out. I still loved the whole thing but some things were better done on TV like the Silly Walk Sketch and the Socialist Game Show. Live in Aspen was a riot though seeing them all old made me kind of depressed but Micheal Palin aged quite well! Having Graham Chapman "show up" really made me laugh expecially Terry Gilliam's "accident". 20 years of Python was superb but Steve Martin [ticked] me off very badly. He tried too hard to be funny and he failed. Why didn't he just show the sketches? Anyone who actually watched that program probibly wasn't there for stupid Steve Martin. Seeing Graham so sick also made me sad and depressed but not for long because I just went back to the mosquito hunting sketch and laughed and laughed. dear god if you like Monty Python at all buy this DVD set. I don't have stock in A&E really I don't. I just want you to buy it because it is good. really.
