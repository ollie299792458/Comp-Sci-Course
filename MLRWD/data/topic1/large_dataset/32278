I absolutely loved this movie, and in my opinion, one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Now, a lot of people are saying that this is the worst  movie they've ever seen, because it's not FX-ridden, Tea Leoni can't act,  too depressing, and so on.  I actually agree with that.  For a  "blockbuster," the FX were very limited, Tea Leoni was monotonous  throughout the whole movie (I don't know how someone can say  "daddy" so unpassionately when it's SUPPOSED to be), and it did  make me cry a lot (this coming from a teenage guy...).  So, why did I love  it?  It affected me where my heart is.  It was a movie in which I could  emphatize with all the characters.  It wasn't like this was a joking  matter.  Obviously, if the world's gonna end, you wouldn't be trying to  crack jokes.  It touched me, and made me realise the importance of having  relationships, and keeping them. Also, Leelee Sobieski acted quite well.  I  think she could have done a better job of acting the main role than Tea.  The way she was heartbroken to leave her parents, the love she had for  them, was amazing. I think I've watched it at least 7 times, and each time,  I never fail to cry....  Yes, it might be depressing, but you know, hope  survives.  Life goes on.  You gotta make the best of what you have. And  that is all I have to say.
