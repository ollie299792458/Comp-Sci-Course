Bogart and Robinson.  That's what this film is about.  Yes, there is Bacall, tall, and sleek as a torpeado.  And there's fire in her eyes.  But the rumble is between two powerhouses, Titans of the screen.  The Florida  Keys light-up with crackling lightening and thunder, and Robinson (Rico)  steps out of his bath, in his robe, with his cigar, and he is an evil dude.  Bogart is no shrinking violet, however.  He has killed men in war, and  watched his best friends die.  He speaks softly, but there is payback  coming, payback for the joes who got blown-away in that good war while  lowlifes like Rico mopped-up big.  The gansters were the parasites, and now  the good guys were trapped in a hotel with the worst of them.  This film is  what alot of post war films were, character studies--good guys who layed it  on the line and looked you straight in the eye.  They pulled-up there  trousers in front of you and you could slap them and they'd never show  their hand if it wasn't necessary.  Heros.  Key Largo is so full of the  stuff of backbone and spinelessness it makes a guy want to check his  testosterone level after leaving the theatre.  Lionel Barrymore is a  wounded lion in a wheelchair who growls at the stench of the gansters  holding his friends and family hostage at gun point.  It's close quarters  and steaming hot fun to watch these Titans roar at each other.  And oh yes,  these were the days bad guys always lost.
