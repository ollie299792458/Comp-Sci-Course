Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon swept the world off it's feet with it's beautiful cinematography and an epic story of a legendary sword, unspoken love and revenge. Now this film is the highest grossing Foreign Language film in history.  The performances by Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are outstanding.  Even though Chow Yun-Fat is one of China's most famous action star, this is his very first martial arts film.  Most of his other films consited of John Woo gun battles, but finally we get to see this wonder possess a sword in some amazing fights.  But the real treasure is Ziyi Zhang, her perfomance as a young daughter of a Governor, dreaming of a different life than hers, a life of adventure.  The fighting skills she displays are simply amazing for such a young gal, I'm sure we'll see much of her in the future (just probably not in Hollywood). One of the reasons I felt Crouching Tiger was so wonderful was the beautiful Mandarin dialect that these actors spoke in.  Most of them had to learn this dialect (including Yun-Fat) so it was very hard to fight and speak a new language at the same time, but the language has this beautiful sound that is unlike no other.  Even though the english dubbing also available on the DVD is done quite well, only the original Mandarin does justice to this film.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing a great epic.
