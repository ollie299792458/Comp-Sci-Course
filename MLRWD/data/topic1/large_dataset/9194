Another fabulous film inspired by Sid the Elf. You must check them out if you haven't already!

I've been a Norris Fan for quite some time, yet I haven't seen all of his movies since he's got over 500 in his library. So I've been catching up on my Chia-Chuck lately, hitting the good & the bad. This movie is quite good!

First of all it has a midget in the movie. And it's not your usual dwarf/elf/stunt-double midget. This little bugger is, basically, cause for all the chaos in the film. Midgets need more positive roles like this one in Hollywood. I'm tired of elf movies.

David Carradine plays a bad guy in this movie, and does it well. I'm used to seeing him as Bill from the Tarantino flicks (and vaguely remember him in Kung Fu). So it was nice to get a younger Bill, and more evil I think.

Norris is his usual bad self. A blend of karate and NRA member he takes out some slimeball with gold teeth and most of everyone else in the movie. And how does Norris get to bed all these hot women? He must have them write it in the script or threatens to quit the movie. In any rate his Chia-Chest pulls them in like the Death Star's tractor beam.

The final showdown is a bid silly, as Norris doesn't really show off his karate against Carradine, until he gives a good backfist to Norris' daughter. Then he goes into "Hulk" mode and almost kicks Carradine's head off.

A great Norris movie that has only 1 flaw: they left the midget behind, with his cute little arms swinging in the air.
