10 DVD discs and not a single version of 'Rocket Ride" - This is why I only gave it 4 stars:

And I now own all of the box sets I cannot believe that 'Rocket Ride' is not included on any of them especially after Ace Frehley was such an influence on them and that they decided to honor him and Peter Criss in such ways but I noticed in the liner notes by Paul Stanley said that Criss basically tried his darndest to make everyone feel miserable during the final tour. I don't really know if that is true or not but Simmons and Stanley are after all 'marketing geniuses' and could have just said this in order to sell more copies.

"Rocket Ride" is a song by the American hard rock band Kiss originally featured on their 1977 album Alive II. A studio recording written by Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley and Sean Delaney, it was the first Kiss single to feature Frehley on lead vocals, and peaked at #39 on the American Billboard Hot 100 [1], making it the band's seventh US Top 40 hit.

"Rocket Ride" proved to be the only studio track of the five recorded for Alive II that Frehley would perform on, as Bob Kulick was brought into perform on some of the other tracks. Ace noted in the booklet for the Kiss Box Set, released in 2001, that this was the first vocal performance that he was satisfied with.

Ace Frehley's 2008 tour in support of his unnamed unreleased album is named after this song, The Rocket Ride Tour
