I really like Costner heroes because they are very "real" people. The Postman is not a perfect heroic figure - he is simply a guy, trying to get along in a difficult situation, but unwilling to compromise his own integrity.
THAT, and that alone, is what makes him heroic. His own moral code is not perfect - he's willing to lie and cheat in order to survive - but those values which ARE important to him, he will not compromise.
He finds, during the course of this movie, that one can accomplish a great deal when one works with a group of like-minded people. He learns that people CAN be trusted. He learns to fight back and he learns that he is willing to risk his own life for higher principles.
It's not an overtly moralistic story, but it is very much a story of doing what's right and standing up for what one believes.
The Postman is truly a hero.
Abby was likewise a very believable heroine. She was one of the strongest females I've seen portrayed in movies, to the point of seeming almost "crazy" in her insistance at being strong and brave. She helps make him the hero he becomes, and not through her own weakness, but through her strength. 
Giovanni Ribisi delivers a powerful performance as the mentally disabled boy. I didn't recognize him at first, he played this character so well. 
This was a wonderful movie, and I find it refreshing to see a movie that shows qualities like integrity and loyalty as heroic and valuable.
