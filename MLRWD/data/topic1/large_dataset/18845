I saw this film when it first came out and was fascinated by the dramatic theme behind the action. But now, having just finished reading the critically praised and popular P. D. James book on which was the movie was based, I realize this movie could have said so much more. To say that the book and movie are different is a huge understatement. The movie takes the central idea of the novel (a world where a child has not been conceived in 20 years and humankind is facing extinction) and then fashions a grim, overtly violent film that appears to be juiced to appeal to teenage/20's males. Only a couple of the scenes that occur in the movie are in the book and even those are dramatically changed. Sadly, almost all of the interplay between Xan, the Warden of England, and Theo, our protagonist, are absent from the film, making Xan's presence in the film inexplicable. Likewise, the themes change from remaining hopeful when all hope is gone and the examination of one of the oldest questions man asks (Is there a God and why does He/She allow this to happen?) to a much less interesting polemic about how we treat refugees (surprise -- badly) and the argument that most of mankind will become ruthless when forced to struggle for survival (another big surprise).

I think it is a shame that the spiritual undertones of the very entertaining book could not have survived the necessary simplification that comes from porting the written text to the movie's script. After all, the title itself comes from the Bible (Psalm 90:3 "Come again, ye children of men"). The birth, central to both the film and the novel but so much better portrayed by P. D. James, is a modern nativity scene. So watch the movie for the teen in you, but read the book to stimulate your mind and your spirit.
