It's fair to say that many of the characters are superficial and the plot is predictable. But this movie gets better each year - not as a piece of art but as a "Hollywood Party" guest list to rival *any* "star-studded" semi-epic in movie history.

By 2010, we can enjoy watching Scorsese players romp with "Sopranos" players in the lush playground of North Eastern Hudson County, New Jersey! A terrific chance to watch Keitel mix it up with De Niro (ah, what memories of "Taxi Driver"); and Cathy Moriarity reunite with Bobby D. - wish they had a scene together! She looks like she aged maybe...ten pounds in 15 years! I don't understand the level of her worldweariness - she's one of three female characters who deal with difficult dudes; one being, Jeanine Garofalo, not very convincing as a Cop, but with a good "feel" as the disenchanted feminist from upstate New York. Bruce Springsteen songs lend a little texture to the gray cinematography; and the all the angry agitation.

When Sly's Deputy decides to chill on him right about when he's most vulnerable, when he decides face his enemies just after sunrise, we know someone's been watching "High Noon".

Script does get a bit melodramatic and once or twice I had to suppress a laugh - had too much respect for Stallone to laugh when Kietel grimaced through one too many soliliques about how he found a haven for corrupt New York City cops. But overall, I would say, this is the best acting I've ever watched from Harvey Keitel.

Ray Liotta looks healthy, about five years past his Henry Hill role; has many good scenes, though just once I wish he'd take off that sweaty long-sleeved shirt and put on a cool, tropical short-sleeve. With all the perks of hanging out in Harvey's mecca, it seems no-one can afford an air-conditioner!

Likewise, this might actually be Sylvester Stallone's strongest performance. It seems he added some weight to his frame - maybe DeNiro gave him some pointers on how he ballooned up as Jake LaMotta!
