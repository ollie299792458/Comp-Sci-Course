I'm glad someone else has noticed the disturbing character of the film. You have carried Lovecraft a bit too far, fellow reviewer, the joke wore thin about half-way through your paragraphs. But then, so does the ingenuity of the movie, whose utter bleakness the fierce fancy of the director and the cast obstruct at first. Two things contribute to this eventual feeling the most: the sad, eerie score ("Craig's Overture" on the Soundtrack CD) and the fate of Malcovich himself. When he, having gone through and, literally, out of his own mind, cries out "I have seen things no man should ever see" this is, of course, a joke. Well noted, JSG. But, as you also know, he happens to be right, and the end of the movie is anything but funny, not even in the gallows humor sort of sense. The scene where Maxine thinks of making Malcovich, in whose body she is in, eat omelette off the table, is another little memory anchor. The film makes me think of rain; I do believe there are rainy scenes there, or this might be a false memory, but at any rate the grey palette and the music  remind me of a dounpour, cold, steely, never stopping, pouring down on some very miserable and confused human beings...

To those who have not seen it: by no means think this is a negative review in the habitual sense. I gave the picture 4 stars not because of this hidden theme but only for petering out somewhat in the second portion. Do, in fact, buy or rent it. You'll be glad you did, even if, in the end, you find yourself uncertain about the genre. It is, perhaps, better to be much delighted and a bit heavy-hearted than just amused; the displeasure is often a sign you have learned something uncomfortable and new. T.
