Season 2 of "The Dukes of Hazzard," which aired from fall 1979 to spring 1980, saw the show's producers trying a number of things to find their audience. You got some celebrity turns, such as Loretta Lynn playing herself and Mel Tillis and Dick Sargent playing others, as well as the not-yet-famous Audrey Landers and Gerald McRaney making appearances (and good ones -- McRaney is the only one who actually acted in that scene, in the episode "Hazzard Connection"). You also saw the Boar's Nest Celebrity Speed Trap kick into gear, with reluctant "guests" the Oak Ridge Boys.

Rosco and Enos and even Cooter, meanwhile, make some "dis"-appearances, which are explained on the show as appendix removals and such, signs of greater casting ups and downs to come in later seasons.

But, hey -- this season includes BRBTV's all-time favorite "Dukes" scene, in "Witness for the Persecution," when Daisy comes home from a long night at the Boar's Nest and finds the refugee Boss Hogg sleeping in her bed! It was just a sweet and hilarious scene. Long live those Dukes ...
