Treasure Planet is by far one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. I'm so shocked it gets such bad reviews!

It's a classic story of adventure and coming-of-age, adapted from the novel "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. No, it is not a direct interpretation! But that's ok. The characters and the story are adapted from the novel to fit with the culture and imagination of today's world, and given a magical twist, as if 1800s England had special sci-fi technology.

In this version, Jim is a boy of fifteen whose father-angst has left him committing crimes and having trouble at home and at school, much to the pain of his young mother, Sarah. A chance meeting with old Billy Bones, former cabin-boy to the dreaded pirate Captain Flint, ends with him being given the map and key to Treasure Planet, a fabled place that contains the Loot of a Thousand Worlds, taken by Flint. This begins Jim's chance to set out on his own and learn about the world and who he is, and what potential he has.

The relationship between Silver and Jim is similar, but not exactly the same. It becomes a deep father/son relationship, with Jim finding in Silver what he always wanted from his deadbeat father. Silver is enigmatic, double-faced, and powerful, but grows a deep, unexpected soft spot for Jim that changes his mind about the treasure he's always sought.

Overall, I think the movie is fantastic. The animation is buttery smooth and is visually stunning, the characters are unique and interesting and all have a history long before the story takes place, and the adaptation from the original novel is very clever and updates the story well. The music, done by James Newton Howard and Johnny Rzeznik, is absolutely gorgeous, with a touch of Celtic influence added to the powerful orchestrations and themes. The story is heartwarming and powerful.
