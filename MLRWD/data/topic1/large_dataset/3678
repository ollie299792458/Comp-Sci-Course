Sure, it's a fun movie, but it's best not to look too closely at the absurdity of it.  We have here a serial killer who despite his 40 hour week still finds time to keep a dozen or so women inside his underground  slave-brothel.  Think about it.  This chap doesn't even have a concierge on  his staff let alone a maid or a chef.  Thik of all the groceries he'd have  to buy, the meals he'd have to prepare, the clothes he'd have to wash and  the toilets he'd have to keep running.  He may be a ruthless sex-villain  but it's hard not to feel just a little sory for him.  And speaking of  toilets, there weren't any in the girls' cells.  Nor was there any sign of  baths or showers.  The killer was supposed to be an admirer of Casanova but  there was never any suggestion that Casanova liked his women filthy.  No, this is a typical hollywood film that may stir the blood for a short  while, but which is so poorly thought out that the viewer never really  suspends disbelief and never forgets that it's only a movie.
