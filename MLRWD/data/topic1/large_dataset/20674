On the front cover of this DVD in big bold letters it says in quotes "Outrageously Funny" - I didn't think that this movie was particularly outrageously funny, certainly not something I'd die laughing over, but if there were two movies on, One that I know is Outrageously Funny, and Forces of Nature, I would rather watch this movie any day. It is true that this movie did contain some lines of good humor, and some traits and sequences intended to make the easily laughable laugh, and I can see why people would write "this movie is horrible" in their review, simply based on this humor. But that just proves my theory that the best way to watch a movie is to forget about what everyone else is saying, forget about the fact that The box the DVD came in is kind of odd, or that the Interface is somewhat pixelated and over active, and just watch the movie looking to enjoy it. This movie deserves a 5 rating because it is a movie that I can sit down and watch, mainly because of it's fun attaching nature, and the fact that while it may be touted as a comedy or a love story or whatever else the reviewers may write, this movie is a perfect conglomeration of all the elements of film making with a little bit of every style, with not too much or not too little of any. Get this movie and watch it, you won't regret it.
