"Monsters, Inc." introduces us to a great number of characters, almost all of them monsters. As we get to know these "people," we begin to truly care about them. They aren't just cardboard cut-outs; they have complex personalities, deep relationships, and vital decisions to make about right and wrong. Out of these characters flows a plot about friendship, greed, trust, fear of the unfamiliar, and the fact that little girls will always have a special place in their daddies' hearts.
This two-disc version includes extra material, including introductions to the animation process, sound recording methods, and some of the technology involved. After watching these, I have a new appreciation for the amount of labor that goes into making a high-qualty animated movie that actually looks like a real, three-dimensional world, and greater admiration for the dedication and intelligence that goes into such a project.
"Monsters, Inc." is an expertly crafted story, beautifully rendered with breathtaking realism, full of endearing characters, deep themes, and genuine emotional impact.
