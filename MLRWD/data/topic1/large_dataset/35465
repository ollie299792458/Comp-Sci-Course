"Serendipity" could have been a good movie. Insted it was a big let down. I thought that movie was well stupid. The stroy line and plot are okay. With the cast the movie had it sould have been really goo (I'm not saying the acting wasn't good - it was).
It's just the script is just so badily written that makes the movie unenjoayble. They wrote a pretty much unfunny movie, only laughed a few times. The end was perdicatble. I knew had it was going to end for the tv spot. Well that was a disapointment. The DVD has extras but they are not good. Commentray is boring.
"Starz on the Set of Serendipity" wasn't okay it lasted to long (almost 20:00). The Deleted Scenes (nine) [stank]. I can see why they were cut. And most of them were alternate or extened. Only two were deleted this last almost 16:00. Stroybody-To-Fianl Scene-Comparesion was pretty good and it's last not even a minute. The trailer was okay it last two & 1/2 mintues. The soundtrack spot wasn't good. The "Bounce" & "Bridget Jones's Diary" sneek-peeks were good and came out to almost 4 mintues. There was also a dumb sneek peek "About Adam" lasted almost 2 mintues. Plus a Director's Diary(in text) it was boring. So this movie & DVD are a let down. I recomend only when every thing elese that you wan't to see is out!
4/10
