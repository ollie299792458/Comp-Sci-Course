when i first heard about this movie i was skeptical at best.  The fact that VII had been milked so hard for so many years led me to believe that this was just some poor excuse to beat the dead horse but i was quickly proven wrong.  Within the first half hour of the movie i was calling friends to tell them to buy it.  The action sequences are so intense that i found myself rewinding and slow-motioning every 5 seconds in order to see every single detail of what was happening.

as far as the story goes, I was impressed that it actually tied together what happened to Cloud after VII.  VII left me with a feeling of "wtf happened to the character that a just spent 50 hours playing as?"  but Advent CHildren closes the huge hole and explains how Cloud dealt with Aeris's death.

Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants closure for their time spent playing VII because it will be well worth the couple dollars you spend.  And by the way, the ending credits are the coolest of any movie i have ever seen in my 20+ years of watching movies
