I've seen this movie about six times in the last six weeks. We need other  people! If we get cut off for some reason, we become cruel and mean. The  movie starts with Melvin Udall (Jack Nicolson) throwing a cute little dog  down a trash shute. He has OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). There are  many theories running through this film. The theory that if we are cut off  from people and love nobody, we become incredibly cruel. The theory that we  may need to open up to some obnoxious people
because we really care for  them. The theory that we have to accept ourselves no matter what other  people say. Even our parents. This triad comes smashing together in a  suprising way. Simon, Melvin, and Carol. Bouncing off each other like crazy  without knowing that they are in a growth process. This film is a true  classic. But you may have to watch it a second time to really see the deep  pain that each of the three characters is experiencing. Beautifully acted.  Beautifully directed. Academy awards to Jack Nicolson and Helen Hunt.
