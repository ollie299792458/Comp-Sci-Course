I was so glad to find out that it wasn't just me who thought this film was full of cliches and stereotypes. 
Nicolas Cage has an intense proclivity for over-acting.  And Windtalkers is nothing more than a vehicle for glorifying the militant male "hoo-ah!" cliche.  This film has little substance.
However, Windtalkers does have an important value: it exposes many of the sterotypes that currently exist in dominant North American society regarding Native people.  And this film is an excellent demonstration of how the imagery that flows from these stereotypes serves to reproduce and reinforce them, and how it objectifies Native people in a way that makes them appear static and thus passive as political beings.  Probably the best examples of this are the scenes of Whitehorse and his flute.  Windtalkers very clearly exposes an internalized attitude that seems to be tied very much to the colonial history of North America:  that the European colonists and many of their descendents view the Navajo, the Mohawks, the Ojibwe, the Cherokee, etc., as being "our natives". 
The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Adam Beach's performance.  Although his character in Windtalkers seems to have been constructed to fit the sterotype of the "saintly Indian", this fact does not detract from Adam's skillful acting.
Judging by the body of his work so far, Adam seems to use the greatest care and integrity in choosing which projects to take on, and he seems to make choices that respect and that are responsible to his own Native heritage.  So, it is quite sad that John Woo took such an important and interesting subject and irresponsibly turned it into a film that pushes the Navajo code talkers to the very margins of the storyline.  John Woo completely betrayed the Native people who dedicated themselves to making this film -- I'm sure they could not foresee that Windtalkers would turn out the way it did.
