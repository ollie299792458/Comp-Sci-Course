Firstly let me say that this film is supposed to be a horror film.  Myself and my extended family( 5 adults and no kids (PS this film is not for children)) and I sat down to watch it recently and we knew what to expect from the beginning...ie- 1)no real plot, 2)bad acting, 3)bad dubbing, 4)over the top ridiculously fake gore and 5) a Fulci movie that would be so bad it would be comical. I mean what an opportune time to watch this film... we started laughing hysterically when the doctor was introduced...his character name...John McCaine. John McCaine kept us laghing throughout the film... I mean I remember the main female character running into a hospital with McCaine, she is hysterical because of all the zombies and McCaine raises his hand infront of her face to tell her "It's OK, I'm a doctor".....oh well that makes everything alright then I guess...lol. McCaines magical revolver is also amusing... firstly for those of you who do not know about guns, a standard 1980's revolver would hold either 4 or 6 bullets depending on the caliber of the weapon. Judging the size of the weapon McCaine uses in the hospital scenes it is a standard 6 shot revolver... McCaine upon first using the weapon is able to fire 9...count em 9 shots from the 6 shot revolver before its empty.  He then retreats into a hospital room, and upon the zombies breaking in and may I add without reloading the gun, he is able to fire 9 more shots at the zombies before the gun is empty again. After this Mcaine and his girl retreat into an elevator and he states that he has to reload the gun...... we were laughing to the point of tears when Mcaine is briefly viewed reloading the gun by putting 1 bullet down the barrel....... this movie was just as ridiculous as the above described scene throughout...... we gave it a 5 star review because we have never laughed so hard in a long time.
