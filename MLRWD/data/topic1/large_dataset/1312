I am a big Kahlo fan, and had read several books about the great painter before watching this DVD. I had even written a 30 page paper about the life of Frida for a college course. Therefore, I was a bit shocked when I saw that the Frida Hayek portrays in this movie has little to do with the real life Frida. For instance, Salma is far too beautiful in the film. It is not that Frida was ugly, but she did not look so stunning, neither. Second, Kahlo had such a crippled body she was in constant pain. It is the representation of her physical and mental pain that makes Kahlo's paintings so powerful, but Hayek totally overlooks this, and instead portrays the painter as a physically healthy woman, who can even climb pyramids.
These and other inaccuracies made me give the film four stars only. However, everything else in the film is outstanding, especially the acting, sets, and score.
 Most importantly,  Hayek has introduced Kahlo to a wider audience, and in the end this is what matters. In this respect, the film succeeds 100%.
