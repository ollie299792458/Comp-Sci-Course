See THE HAUNTING with a friend, not just because it is scary, but because there is so, so much you will want to discuss after you first watch it.  Although kids can enjoy it as a simple ghost story, most adults viewers  cannot help but see the not-at-all-submerged subtext of sexual desire,  specifically lesbian desire.  In just about every scene there is some  dialog, narration, camerawork (ex.- woman shown behind bars), symbolic  object, symbolic action, or metaphor of some kind relating to repression  and sexuality.  The obviousness of all this is really surprising given the  date of the film.  In fact, the date makes the "sub"text all the  more exciting.  To get the most out of this film, pick up an unabridged  copy of Freud's INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS. Then use  the book's index to look up Freud's analyses of things relevant to the  film, like 'staircase dreams'.  (Viewing the film's staircase sequence in  light of Freud's analyses is great fun!)  And you will certainly want to  read Patricia White's article on the film, entitled "FEMALE SPECTATOR,  LESBIAN SPECTER: THE HAUNTING" reprinted in the excellent anthology,  INSIDE/OUT, edited by Diana Fuss, published by Routledge 1991.  (One final  note: even though the remake stars the way-cool, indie-woman-of-my-dreams,  Lili Taylor, YOU SIMPLY *MUST* SEE THE ORIGINAL.)
