I love "Mulan."  I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the previous cartoon musicals I've seen (Aladdin, Lion King etc). I ended up loving it!!  I thought it was a very good message about defying the norms of society and being yourself.  a very big step for Disney.  Eddie Murphey portrays the amusing Mushu dragon who helps Mulan on her way to join the army in honor of her grandfather, who is sick and cannot fight anymore. The songs are great...especially "Reflection" which has beautiful lyrics (also song brilliantly by Pop singer Christina Aguilera on the sountrack).  The animation is great, and very similar to my fav movie "Pocahontas."  If you loved "Pocahontas" and didnt get to see "Mulan" in theatres, then I urge you to buy it. This in my opinion is the last great film in the wave of Disney musicals (beginning of course with a classic favorite Little Mirmaid). Now we have to put up with annoying stories of ape-boys and Aliens visiting Earth (yawn). So that said, I really reccomend "Mulan."  I think she is a good role model for girls and in addition the story is great! This will become a classic...and is reccomended to anyone of all ages (I was 15 when I saw it). Overall grade for "Mulan": A+
Thanks for reading!
