There's not a whole lot I can say other than that I love this movie. I was compelled to see it in theaters simply because I recognized the main actors and thought it'd be a good laugh, and this film most definitely delivered in the humor department. But what I didn't expect was to fall in love entirely with it-- it was one of those movies that I kept telling myself to buy on DVD and when I eventually did, ended up watching it three or four times in one weekend.

The story of Peter and his breakup with Sarah is hilarious and yet one of the most realistic breakup movies I've seen in awhile. The script is incredibly solid for Segel's first attempt (Segel also plays Peter), and is filled with unforgettable characters. The honeymooning couple is my favorite, and Russell Brand as Sarah's new beau Aldous Snow nearly steals the show. Especially pleasing to me, though, is the fact that none of the characters are without flaws, and while you can see why Peter and Sarah shouldn't be together, you can see why they might have fallen in love in the first place.

The DVD is worth it for the commentaries and the extended scene. Long story short, you won't soon forget Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
