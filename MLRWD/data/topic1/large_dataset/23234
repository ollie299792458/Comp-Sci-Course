Let's get one thing out of the way first - considering that no one actually believed the three mothers trilogy would ever be completed, the release of this film is reason enough for horror fans to rejoice. Now, as for the the finished product itself, I think it ought not surprise anyone. People have complained that Mr. Argento has failed to grow beyond the parameters of the zenith he reached in the 1980s. I would agree. But for what it's worth this installment does deliver much of the director's trademark touches - souped up with what can be described as a delirious abandon to the absurd. Nothing in the convoluted plot involving a diabolical relic that somehow triggers the destruction of Rome makes any real sense but then neither did those in Suspiria or Inferno. Writing has never been Mr. Argento's strong suit anyway. What seemed lacking here was the originality and verve of his mesmerizing visuals in Suspiria which had elevated that film to its deserved cult status. We do get in its stead a ratcheting up of the gore and the (intended or otherwise) camp quotient replete with nubile lesbians chaneling the Comme des Garcons school of witchcraft, a hysterical monkey and one hunky sympathetic detective. So, while this doesn't quite achieve the brutal beauty of Suspria, it does manage to close the trilogy with a film that is nothing more or less than classic Argento. And that's not a bad thing.
