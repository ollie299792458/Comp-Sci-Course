I've seen so many disney, barbie, and other girl-safe movies that I know what to look for.

This movie displays Tinkerbell in her usual impulsive nature and she creates a lot of trouble as a result of her impulsiveness.  its fun.  Its interesting.  She shows a great curiosity and interest in learning new things (a gold star for that).

The graphics are wonderful.  Blue ray on HD, some of the incidental effects (like rain on a windowpane) are done really well.  I feel that the animation was very good indeed.  The action really "pops".  I appreciated the fact that in the end the daughter trusts in her father and tells him "the truth".  This was a valuable lesson that many movies forgo - family unity and openness.

The story is very nice, with overtones of friendship and believing.  However.  The storyline really pushes the "fairies are real" buttons of your kid.  I felt that this was pushed a bit too hard.  I don't mind if my daughter believes in fairies, its not about that.  What I don't like is for a movie about fairies to overtly encourage that and even make it the central focus of the film.  There are many great fantasy movies with wonderful stories and they don't waste their time trying to convince anyone that their particular world is real or not.  This is not a creative, inventive storyline.

Overall, your child will enjoy it.  And the fact that it comes on DVD and Blu Ray is really cool so that you can still watch it on your car DVD player.  I really appreciated that.

So, I would probably give it 4 stars but due to the dull but highly visible theme of "are fairies real?" I have to remove a star.  C'mon Disney, lets try to actually think of an interesting story.
