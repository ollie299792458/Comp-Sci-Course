Fantastic. I've been saying for a long time that I'd like to have
Green Acres on DVD, but I didn't think it would happen for a good while to come. I also figured...it would be released as a "best of" selection instead of full seasons and that it would be expensive. With so many 50.00, 60.00 and even 100.00 plus dollar sets out there that I'd like to get, I figured I'd never be able to work Green Acres into my budget. Yet, here it is at Amazon for twenty dollars. Amazing! The picture quality is just fine, with only minor wear showing in the opening credits. The DVDs also are burned on both sides...which I think is great. The set takes up less room than a single VCR tape. Extras are fun, but it's the shows I really care about, so the lack of bonus features at this price is no problem for me, in fact...I'm all for the no frills approach if it keeps the cost this low and I can have all  the shows I like at very decent quality. SOAP was released this way too, and I think it's fantastic. Oh, by the way, the show itself is still great. Gabor and Albert have been very underrated and overlooked when it comes to TV comedy couples. Now, how about Newhart, Bewitched, Petticoat Junction, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, and the entire first Season of the Lucy Show? I say, buy this set and show support for the low price, no-frills, entire season format.
