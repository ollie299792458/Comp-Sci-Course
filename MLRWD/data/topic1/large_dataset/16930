Idea for the movie is great! Build-up it received during the last season of "Apprentice" made me think it was a great film. But was I disappointed... probably because I was expecting a space version of "Jumanji". It is far from it; underdeveloped protagonists in form of little pricks, and their very shallow connections. One thing is childish characters - but these were really really mean kids, and I think a bit too much on the mean side. One of the child-protagonists was portrayed as a cute and cunning little kid, but a dengerous pathological liar non the less. If there are kids like that out there, there should not be any movies with characters like it for our children to watch. So much more could have been done! To the director's credit, the old-school special effects are really cool, but they cannot replace underdeveloped story, mean characters. In conclusion, if you want to see a great family movie with your kids, great special effects, and a worthy story line with the point that will make your kids grow up into better people, watch "Jumanji" again and do not waste the time with this underachiever. Really - don't bother. Or do bother, and see for your self before showing it to your kids, and see what I mean.
