Hitchcock did no favours for Tallulah Bankhead by giving "Lifeboat" one of the least appealing titles of all of his films (alternatively, think of the built-in audience appeal for such words as "Notorious" or "Spellbound" or "Psycho").
But don't be fooled. This film, and Tallulah Bankhead's performance in it, packs a whallop.

"Lifeboat" offers no simple treatment of Hitchcock's beloved theme "the evil that lives among us" (explored most brilliantly in "Shadow of a Doubt"). Instead, it offers his most unflinching, direct look at evil's social agenda. The film presents a variety of ordinary Joes and Janes (think Capra meets Hitchcock in this regard) each with their own inexperienced take on what to do. There are no predictable solutions (such as an end to evil by the death of an antagonist), nor is evil even easily recognizable.

"Lifeboat" progresses ominously from a simple scenario of the survival of the individual to a multi-faceted revelation of the threatened survival of society itself. Clever of Hitchcock indeed, but it is Tallullah that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, waiting for her next sharply insightful comment.

Unlike Katherine Hepburn, Tallulah never overplays her cards, and she carries this film effortlessly.  She may gradually be stripped of all the fine things she treasures (Hitchcock always strives to make his protagonists vulnerable), but Tallulah never loses her core values.

At the end, it is Tallulah's embodiment of the spirit of survival that the audience identifies with, and makes "Lifeboat" a complex and satisfying mature movie experience.
