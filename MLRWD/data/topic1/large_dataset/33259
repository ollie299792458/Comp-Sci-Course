"Antitrust" is the best cyber-flick I've seen in years. It's suspenseful, fast-pased, and just incredibly entertaining. Ryan Phillippe stars as Milo Hoffman, a young computer genius who gets the opportunity of a lifetime: working for the highest-ranked computer company in the world, N.U.R.V. His best friend (also a computer geek), gets the job position, too...but rejects it because he feels as though the company's owner, Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) will stop at nothing to stay at the top. So Milo takes his girlfriend, Alice (Claire Forlani), and they move out to the N.U.R.V. campus and he takes the job. It's only a few weeks in his new job position when he learns that his best friend was brutally murdered, and then he finds out that the murder may be linked to his new company! Now it's up to Milo to take all the knowledge he has to help bring down the N.U.R.V. company and stop Winston from destroying peoples' lives.
The acting is great from the entire cast...especially Ryan Phillippe, who is probably in one of his best roles yet. Rachael Leigh Cook plays Lisa, a smart girl who also works for the N.U.R.V. company and tries to help Milo. Tim Robbins, as always, is superb as the power-hungry company owner. The supporting cast is also excellent.
The DVD is really good, because it includes an Everclear music video, deleted scenes with director's commentary, and a featurette on computer crimes and such. The screenplay was well-written, and the film was engaging.
I recommend this for everybody who enjoys computer crime flicks!
