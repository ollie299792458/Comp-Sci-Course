I made a New Year's Resolution this year to watch a movie each from the four world regions I had never seen a movie from. One of them was the Middle East, so I chose "The Band's Visit," which was at the library where I go to college. I was expecting a low key, slow-paced film with a few chuckles, and that was just what I got. However, I also got more: the movie has some interesting thoughts about music, I really related to the main character, Tawfiq, and I enjoyed the music in the movie. It's unassuming and tells a very simple story, which is part of its appeal. The tone reminded me a little bit of the German film "Schultze gets the blues," in that both are about music, culture clash, and don't try to do anything except simply tell a story. The acting is very good in The Band's Visit, and there are touching moments as well as funny ones. It also captivated me because it showed me something new - everyone in the movie is Semitic, and it is my first Middle Eastern movie. Being a language major, I also found it interesting that the Egyptians spoke Arabic amongst themselves and the Israelis spoke Hebrew amongst themselves, but they spoke English to each other. In other words, it was interesting to hear my own language used so much in a film made in such a distant place. The Band's Visit also showed that Middle Eastern people have a lot of the same things that we have in America. I wasn't expecting a skating rink to be in rural Israel, but I can't say I've ever thought about it, either. If you like music and straightforward movies, and especially if you like both, I recommend The Band's Visit.
