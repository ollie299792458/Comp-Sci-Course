It is not often that a sequel is something that truly justifies being related to the original work. Bloodlust takes the mythology created in D and adds to it without spoiling any of the mystery. We still wonder as to D's true motivations. Is he really a hero? Or has his seemingly obvious hatred for vampires and their kin driven him to destroy those with whom his natural inclinations surely lay. D rarely uses the true power that is contained within him. It seems as if he haates even being able to tap into the vast power that is his birthright as Dracula's son. The characters and the world created in the D universe are truly amazing. While set in the same universe, Bloodlust is suffienciently differentiated from the original by a faster pacing and a more revealing storyline. As the characters journey through D's world the viewers learn much more about the complex world which has evolved in that dark future. The production values of the movie capture the original spirit of Vampire Hunter D and can only give rise to a greater appreciation of the moral struggle that must be taking place with D. How can a being like that not go through most of the day without feeling that he has no place in the world that he is helping to create. All in all I can highly recommend Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. I have tried to avoid plot details in this review so as not to spoil the viewing experience for anyone who has not seen this treasure yet.
