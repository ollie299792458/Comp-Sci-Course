Season 2 of Grey's Anatomy was just awsome. It was just one of those seasons where you just needed to watch next weeks episode and if you missed it you would regeat it untill the dvds came out or until TNT or repeats. Season 2 has just finished in New Zealand. The season has gone from Meridith and Izzy getting a dog to giving it to Addison and Derik. To Mark comming to vist them and to George sleeping with Meridith. Denny propsoing to Izzy.  The rest of the season was great and New Zealand is even playing season 1 right after season 2 ends.Will the Mesuem of Televison and Radio be on the dvd?
Grey's Anatomy is just a great show and hope it lasts for years to come.
Over the past two years a huge amount of unexpecited drama has poped onto our screen and its been great from. Derik has a wife to the Death of Denny.
From what we have sceen over the past two years season 3 will be a blast with new faces and old ones returning. Which way will Meridith go with Fin or Derik find out on the next Greys Anatomy: Time Has Come Today, airing 21 September, 2006. Enjoy!
