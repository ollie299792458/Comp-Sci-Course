Seeing Cleopatra in the theater in 1963 was an astounding event even then. To see it at a distance of nearly forty years is to experience great film making over again. Of all of Hollywood's various reincarnations of ancient Rome (up to, and including the recent "Gladiator") this film stands as probably the most completely satisfying, and artistically solid of all such efforts. There isn't a mis-cast role. The level of acting is excellent throughout. Visually, and in every other way technically stunning, one wishes for the wide screen perspective: the standard pan-scan presentation is horrid. Alex North's score is probably his best (considering that he previously wrote the music for 2001, A Space Odyssey before Kubrick killed it and decided to use music "in the public domain.") 
This is a very long film. Do not expect snappy, tight flip-flopping from one situation to another. The exposition of the material is extremely detailed and needs its expansive development. If you can't sit still and follow a complicated story, don't even start this film. If, on the other hand, you can deal with Shakespeare and ancient history sumptuously presented, then you are in for a marvelous treat.
In truth, this is real film making - not hot shot special effects wedded to toilet bowl morality, horrid acting and total emptiness. Forget the Burton/Taylor romance and all the other garbage associated with this movie. Most of the blood and guts in this film takes place in your mind - where it properly belongs. What you do see is all the more devastating for its implications.
A much maligned masterpiece, this.
