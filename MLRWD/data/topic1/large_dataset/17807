Ice Cube has been waiting for an opportunity to show his *softer* side.  I imagine when he got this script it was a no-brainer - THE PERFECT ROLE FOR HIM TO SHOW HIS BREADTH AS AN ACTOR.

Ice Cube has really turned his life around and I LOVE watching him play such a hilarious part in such a hilarious movie.  Some people seem to think this movie has no audience.  But, those people would only know that if they've seen it.  And, if they've seen it, then *they* are an audience!  This movie DOES have an audience, that's inevitable (hence the 5 stars).

I really love it when people keep using older, cliche' sayings like "are we there yet?" or "i don't do mornings" or "must be MONDAY!".  This movie is appropriately named, because it seems to be playing on a timeless type of humor similar to the sayings I listed above.

I have some silk screen shirts I made last summer with things like "are we there yet?" written on them.  I also made one that said "i *am* the big dog!".  Love it!  This movie really encapsulates that irresistable, sassy attitude.  Watch It!
