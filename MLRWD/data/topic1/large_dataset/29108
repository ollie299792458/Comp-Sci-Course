I am a huge fan of director Takashi Miike (Audition, Ichi the Killer), so I know to go into his films expecting the unexpected, but nothing could have prepared me for Gozu.  The movie starts off as a Yakuza (Japanese mafia) film in which an enforcer named Minami is assigned to kill his senior, Ozaki.  Ozaki is slowly going crazy--thinking that small dogs and grandmothers driving compact cars are out to kill him--and "the boss" wants him gone.  Instead, Minami finds the road to their destination washed out and must take a detour into a small town straight from The Twilight Zone.  When he looses Ozaki, Minami is led on an odyssey that resembles a crazed fever dream, complete with waiters who wear black bras beneath their white shirts, lactating inkeepers, and cow-headed demons!  The film's pace is s-l-o-w, but you find yourself unable to stop watching it.  You want to see where it is going, if there is any point to it at all.  The final scene, however, is the ultimate payoff.  Not for the squeamish!
