1)Smackdown Elimination Chamber 9/10
this one starts a little slow with big show and kozlov being 2 0f the 4 first entrants but after all the participants enter the ring it picks up quickly with best moments coming from the final 2 competitors solid chamber
2)Shane vs Orton 8/10
this one starts out as a fist fight, a brawl with weapons getting introduced about halfway through this one doesn't live up to some of Shane's other street fight/no dq encounters but there are some hard hits especially the monitor shot which looked like it busted orton open for real you get the usualy interference but it doesnt take away much
3)Finley vs Swagger ECW Title 5/10
this is where the even slows down I havnt seen much to sell me on swagger yet and finley hasnt had a good match in months this is the problem with ECW not enough talent to challenge for the title this match comes off slow and tedious where u just want it to end and move on nothing special here
4)JBL vs Michaels 6/10
It doesnt pick up much here either i expected alot of this match and it didnt come close JBL controls most of the match like always with shawn scoring a few blows this is another slow boring match with JBL even pushing shawn out of the ring to get him counted out yawn the spot with shawn's wife saved it in some aspects if nothing but entertainment value everyone knew who was gonna win no surprises
5)Raw Elimination Chamber 10/10
Here we have the match of the night i was fine with the switch and putting Edge in the match even though the wrong person won IMO as long as the title is kept off of Cena im happy this one picks up from the beginning and doesn't stop mysterio takes some sick shots into the chamber finishers being hit all over high impact moves throughout easily the best

No Way Out continues the roll the WWE has been on in the last few months with only a few detractions but nothing to keep you from purchasing this DVD today i would highly recommend it
