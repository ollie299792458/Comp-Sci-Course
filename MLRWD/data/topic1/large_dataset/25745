This Blu-ray edition of John Carpenter's 1982 classic is flawless. The picture quality is beyond compare, and the sound blows you out of your seat.

I saw this film when it was first released back in the summer of '82. Before seeing it, I remember watching several critics on television pan it. It didn't matter to me. The preview looked great and there was no way I was going to miss this one. I went to see it on a Saturday night, alone, and although I was only 13 years old at the time and the film Rated R, I was permitted into the theater no questions asked. There was hardly anyone else there! It was me and about five other people in this giant movie theater. When the movie began, the empty theater helped to enhance the aura of isolation that permeated from every frame of "The Thing."

My first impression at the time was that the movie was a classic. Those feelings, however, didn't permeate with critics or other movie-goers at the time. Throughout the years, with showings on premium cable services and releases on home video, the film gained in popularity and now is considered a cult classic.
