I really enjoyed this film.  As a Factory fan, I was hesitant to get this, perhaps due to the off-putting title.  But I'm glad I did.  The acting was great, especially the actor who played Warhol himself - dead on.  Also, Ms. Taylor was 100% believable as the unfortunate, demented, freaky Valarie Solanas.

I notice that a lot of negative reviews for this and other films consist of a rant about the film being the worst they ever saw, a waste of 2 hours, etc., but these folks never explain WHY they didn't like it.  This is true for some of the bad reviews here.

Additionally, I'm not sure that that filmmaker Harron not taking a blantant stance against the SCUM Manifesto constitutes and endorsment of it; rather the opposite.  It seems to me that Solanas' rants are so out there and crazy that it isn't necessary to say "Hey, this is wrong/bad/whatever."  Her insane writtings speak for themselves. Why do people need to be spoon fed the obvious?

While not a masterpiece (hence the 4 stars), this certainly is a good movie and a fascinating subject.  It is clearly not for everyone, as some of the reviews here illustrate.  If you are into Warhol, 60's radicalism, the art scene, or that varried social movement called feminism, you'll like this movie.  If not, this film is not for you.
