The Hidden Fortress is a masterpiece on 70mm b&w film.
The images alone in this movie will not leave your mind, not to mention the pacing, cinematography, & unsurpassed acting ability of these Toho-stock stars.
Mifune, as General (Makabe) Rokurota, is elemental yet droll as always; this man is a force of nature. The fact that he does all of his own stunts in this film, especially the strength & control he exhibits in his horseback riding (Takedo-"no-hands" school) style & his use of the spear in the "duel" w/ General Hoye (Fujita,Susumu) is remarkable, especially for an actor @ the age of 39.
The peasants, Tahei (Chiaki,Minoru) & Matashichi  (Fujiwara,Kamatari) act as perfect pitiful foils to Mifune & the rest of the cast. They are deliciously whiny & underhanded, but you've gotta love them.
Princess Uki (Uehara,Misa) is physically & emotionally stiking, possessing an undercurrent of sweetness which is disarming. She's a warrior princess with the heart of a lyrical hummingbird. 
Kurosawa's obvious tongue-in-cheek handling of the jidai-geki/chambara genre, along with the wonderful interweaving of the Noh play theme with extremely humorous undertones, makes this one unforgettable movie. It just crackles with electricity from start to finish. This is also one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen not to mention one of the best, & I would recommend it to all.
