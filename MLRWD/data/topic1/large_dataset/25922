This is such a wonderful movie.  This was the very first movie I saw in a theater as kid at age 9 and was allow to escort my younger cousin.  It was our first time alone in the theater and we felt so grown up.

This movie was so full of surprises and has always been my second most favorite movie (after the Wizard of Oz.)  Julie Andrews was the most perfect nanny ever.  I've always wonder why our babysitters never carried a magic bag.  I remember going home and trying to snap my fingers to clean up my room.  My shock that my toys and clothes didn't move on their own.  The music was wonderful and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was the biggest song hit in school (sung is just about every school's concert in our town.)

This movie was full of magic.  It allow us to dream that things were possible.  Even when the grownups didn't understand, you knew that there was magic all around.  I am so thrill for the 40th anniversary and will get this.  I am still bum that you can't clean your house with a simple snap of your fingers.
