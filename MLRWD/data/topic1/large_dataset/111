Even though the documentary has a feeling of amateur filmmaking to it, it doesn't really matter with an artist like Frazetta.  In a documentary about a character such as Frazetta, you're really taken in by the ENERGY and ATTITUDE this guy gives off, and you realize that, through his will alone, he would have succeeded in whatever he chose as a profession.

  Frazetta's life harkens back to a time when the art world was close and intimate.  He tells stories of just sauntering into Mad Magazine's studio, and being thrown a few pages to draw while he was there.  It varies greatly from today's world of secretaries and appointments and other formalities.  The nostalgia is there, as well as the age.  You see Frazetta in a point where the tiger has a little less bite in him.

  But overall, as an artist, and an aficionado, you can't help but really admire all the accomplishments this man has forged over the decades.  I will, no doubt, always strive to be a fraction as amazing as he is, and hopefully watching his accomplishments on this DVD will continue to inspire artists for years to come.
