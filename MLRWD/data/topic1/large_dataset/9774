YES!YES!YES!at first i was a little scared.It was rather pricy and i didnt no if anthony would have a good voice or not.those thoughts quickly vanished.I couldnt get over how alot of songs were alot better live.Every song has a different and largly improved solo(great job john),and some songs they add and change around to them.

 When i saw the listing, i reallized all exept for 4 were from by the way and californication, and 3 from bssm.So I just asumed havana affair was one of there old songs,but was wrong.havana affair is a remake of the ramones.never heard the origanal,but bassed on this version, this song is exelent.A highlight for sure.

 songs like dont forget me and throw away your telivision are only ok on the studio, but they really brigh it to life live.The piece that they add to throw away your television is great,making it one of the best on here.

 they did a really cool versions of scar tissue ,parrellel universe and the zepher song. All of them with just flat out amazing solos and there long to!

 The only ones that arnt that good live is by the way,right on time and universally speaking, but they arnt that great to begin with.

 There are alot of jams to.The best one is the californication intro with john and flea battling.They jam before the power of  equality and right on time.John does a really cool high pitch mini song early on and does a bit of singing before parellel univese.One other jam is fleas bass solo that leads into around the world.you watch that solo, then try telling me that hes not the best bass player ever.The guy is just so incredible.The really sweet guitar solos can be found in scar  tissue,zepher,californication,parallel univere,dont forget me,give it away,and a really cool riff on venic queen.

 So really good vocals, absalutly amazing solos by john and flea and i forgot to say about the kick ass drum solo before californication(which flea plays his saxamaphone with) equals the best live performace you will ever see(along with zepelin).

 Must buy for any fan and if your new to the peppers, this would be the best start.
