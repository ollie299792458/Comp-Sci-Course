Many people overlooked this movie due to the fact that it came out around the same time as the Sixth Sense, thus it suffered. However, this movie is not a rip-off in anyway shape or form. Stir of Echos is based on the novel of the same name which was on store shelves before Sixth Sense hit the big screen. So with the "who came first, and who's ripping off who" aside lets get to the movie itself. Stir of Echos is a creepy movie, it has excellent camera-work and a chilling soundtrack that sets the mood of the movie from the get go. This movie was perhaps, one of the best horror movies of the 90's, it has all the right elements in all the right places with enough special features to justify paying out your hard earned cash. I'm not going to go into the story-line, enough reviews have already done that, what I would like to mention is that Kevin Bacon puts of, in my opinion, his best performance to date! If your a fan of horror\thriller movies, then this movie is a must have as I feel it will one day be counted among the classic movies of this era.  Ya people will look back and see Sixth Sense as a great box office smash, which it was.  Sir of Echos however, will be considered a great horror movie.
