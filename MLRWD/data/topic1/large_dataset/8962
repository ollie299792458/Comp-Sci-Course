Hi all SATC fans! Like the the first two reviewers, I wondered what the difference between this collection, currently on sale for $109.99, and the "Collector's Edition" on sale for $196.99. But since all I really wanted was to have all the episodes on DVD I went ahead and ordered the cheaper set. When I received it today, I read the back and toward the end of the top paragraph it said:

"Celebrate the show that explores the day-to-day - and night-to-night, world of single women in this, the definitive collector's edition.

With that read, I wanted to see if I really got the "Collector's Edition" so I called my girlfriend who bought her "Collector's Edition" at the regular price of $300 back a few years ago to compare the difference. Good news! Sounds like they're the exact same thing! What I received in my $109.99 set is a pink velvet spiral binder with various color pictures of the ladies and scenes from the show and short summaries of each episode. The DVDs are nicely tucked away, by seasons, in pockets of thicker pages after the summaries. The pink velvet spiral binder comes in a plastic sleeve for protection from scratches, etc. There's no way, however, to see if this DVD set was made in 2007. Everywhere I looked said 2005. Oh well, I'll be happy if all the DVDs work!

If you want to peek at what this set looks like I suggest clicking on the "Collector's Edition" for $196.99 and looking at Picture 4 of 9. It's the picture with the binder (closed and open) with the DVDs nicely scattered in front of it. That is exactly what I received today.

Happy shopping and I hope this helps!
