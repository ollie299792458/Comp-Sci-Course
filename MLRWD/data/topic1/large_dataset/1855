This film from its onset is amazing from its attention to detail, the story itself from Johnny Cashes small beginnings to the legend he would become (& all that went with it) & of course the woman who was the love of his life an oscar winning performance by Reece Witherspoon.

However this film goes beyond its boundaries, the scenery, the heartache and the raw all inspring performance of Jauquin Phoenix who has come so far as an actor here makes this a stand alone film.

Excellent cast Dallas Roberts also gets his chance to shine the road to redemption through June for Cash and most of all the love between two people which made the last half hour of this film so moving.

Highly recommend and one of the finest and greatest films hollywood has made in years forget Brokeback Mountain and Crash this film has something else something that those two could give there back teeth for & though crually overlooked at the oscars.

This is one film worth going back to again and again and Jauquin Phoenix deserves an oscar just as much as Reese maybe someday!  Anyway terrific film on all counts and it perfectly summund up the era and the music.

It really is a jewal of a film & well worth buying the two disks for, to get the whole of the music!
