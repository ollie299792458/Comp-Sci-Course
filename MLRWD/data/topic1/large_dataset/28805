"The Longest Day" is an awesome and engrossing history lesson about arguably the most important day of World War II, the day the Allies stormed Normandy.  It should be watched IN COMBINATION with "Saving  Private Ryan".  Private Ryan is great for pointing out the horrors of  war but it falls a little short in the history department.  It does very  accurately depict the Omaha Beach landings, but then it drifts into a  fictional story (a good one nonetheless).  D-Day was about a LOT more than  just Omaha Beach, it was a huge, multi-pronged invasion. 
The Longest  Day, meanwhile, meticulously re-traces the events, conversations, decisions  and strategies used by the Germans, Americans, British, and French.  It  builds beautifully in its' tension leading up to H-hour.  Sure, it may not  show intestines and other internal organs hanging out of GI's bellies after  being ripped apart by German machine guns, but it doesn't NEED to.  It has  a different focus: namely, the STRATEGIES, the plans, the deceptions.  Basically, how it all came together.  
I LOVED Saving Private Ryan.  But  I ALSO loved The Longest Day.  See both.
