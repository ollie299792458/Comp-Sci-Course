The Goblet of Fire (the book) was much more difficult (and still is) to adapt into a film than its predecessors. For example, The Goblet of Fire (Goblet) is 300 pages longer than Prisoner of Azkaban (Prisoner), and even Prisoner could not have all its content included in the movie. Therefore, like the other films, it's best to judge Goblet as a film in its own right rather than as an adaptation of the book. After all, it's impossible to include everything. My personal rating for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is 5 out of 5 stars. The reasons: The film introduces the TriWizard Tournament, one of the highlights of the Harry Potter series. I love to read about and watch the 4 champions competing for the prize. It's always fun to guess the next task. The Yule Ball is nothing short of hilarious. Another reason is that the acting in this film has gotten even better with the passage of time. Additionally, the suspense has grown greater. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!

Voldemort comes back at the end of the film. A tragic death occurs. The year doesn't end happily for Harry like the other three years did. We are all left wondering what will happen next. This makes us very eager to watch the next film, Order of the Phoenix. The film certainly does a great job of setting up the events of the next films and is entertaining in its own right. There are many funny moments though. Examples are Rita Skeeter and Ron receiving his new dress robes (poor Ron!).

SPOILERS END NOW!!!!

In conclusion, I would rate Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire just as satisfying and great as the other films in the series. Thank you for reading my review.
