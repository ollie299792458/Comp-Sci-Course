Bonnie and Clyde was a brilliant film directed by Arthur Penn.  He presented the notorious Barrow gang in such a way that I wanted them to succeed.  The way Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway portrayed the characters drew me into their lives and into the movie.  I really enjoyed watching this film.  The violence in the film was so real, it looked as if it were happening right before my eyes.  The terror Bonnie and Clyde brought into the eyes of their victims made me feel the horror of the crimes.  During the fight scenes, I found myself jumping and sitting on the edge of my seat.  Every time the Barrow gang was on the run, I was wanting to yell at the television to tell them which way to go.  I thought the plot was suspenseful and inviting.  The love story thrown into all of the chaos was an incredible distraction.  From the beginning I wanted Bonnie and Clyde to be together.  Clyde kept pushing Bonnie away which made me want it even more.  The chemistry between Beatty and Dunaway was amazing and made the attraction real.  I wasn't sure if they would end up together, if they would fall in love.  At the end of the film, the look in the eyes of Bonnie and Clyde made me feel the emotions they must have been feeling.  I thought this film was surprisingly good.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes action and love story mixes.
