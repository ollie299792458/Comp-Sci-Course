Keitel never received the critical acclaim of his peers from the same era, partly because he was quite limited as an actor.  While Deniro and Pacino wer capable of playing a multitude of roles, Keitel was capable of playing a person who was at times masculine and at other times tender.
  Bad Lieutenant is no exception.  Set in the mean streets of New York, Keitel plays a cop(I use the term loosely), who for years has been getting high and accepting favors from local prostitutes.  After he is called to investigate the rape of a nun, he wants redemption.
  Keitel's performance is not oscar-worthy, but the agony he beings to the role of Lieutenant is worthy of praise.  Keitel does almost no real acting here, as he hardly has any conversations with anybody.  I think Ferrara wanted to emphasize Lt's isolation from his surroundings(this is further confirmed by the fact that the Lieutenant has no real identity in the credits).
  Shortly after viewing this film I read Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.  I have been able to draw several parallels between that book and Bad Lieutenant.  Both stories tell of a man who is aware of the ailments of the society in which he lives, and yet despite being aware of them, they constantly affect his life.  In Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, the narrators relationship with his son was strained
, yet he constantly talks about a lcak of quality in American life, be it in relationships, everyday labour, or whatnot.  Similarly in Bad Lieutenant, LT is commiti=ting crime of greater magnitude than the people he arrests!
  In my opinion, Bad Lieutenant is one of the only movies that really explores the downfalls of this society.  I've seen Training Day with Denzel, and I feel that that is much too glorified to be true.  Bad Lieuteant is realistic and much more bold than Training Day.
