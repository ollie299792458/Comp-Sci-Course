I won't reiterate the opinions of the previous one-star review, which was dead on in every sense.  I have a bit of venting of my own to add though.

I am a huge fan of Bruce Timm's work, and when I sat down to watch my advance copy of this DVD, I just assumed from the animation style that this was another of his works.  After about 10 minutes of listening to the horrible dialogue, I had to look at the cover in order to discover that it was instead the product of the writer of the garbage "The Batman" series.

Tim Daly's voice being back is the one saving grace of this film.  The animation is good, but nothing better than Superman:TAS when it was on (recent seasons of JLU have refined the animation techniques and been better).  Lance Henrickson and Powers Boothe are good voice actors, but don't fit for Brainiac and Luthor respectively (I kept wondering why Grodd's voice was coming out of Luthor's mouth).

These complaints wouldn't be that bad though if it wasn't for the horrible story (using the term "story" loosely), and horrendous dialogue.  The story doesn't even fit into the chronology of Superman: TAS - I guess it's supposed to take place in the early days of Superman's career, but it basically disregards previous interactions between the characters.

It is obvious that the writer did not ever bother to research the series when writing this garbage, nor did he properly investigate the personalities of the characters.  In this movie, Superman is ambivalent, Luthor is a retard and Brainiac is emotional!!  This entire thing seems like it was written by someone in kindergarten.

If you were even a casual fan of Superman: TAS, you will be very disappointed in this mess.  I just regret I will never get back the 75 minutes I wasted watching it.

Kudos to Clancy Brown and Corey Burton for staying away from this disaster.
