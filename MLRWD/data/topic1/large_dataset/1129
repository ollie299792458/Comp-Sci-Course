First of all, let it be known that I am a huge fan of horror movies in general, though Zombie movies tend to be my poison of choice.  I've never held much of an interest for slasher films, though, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre was no exception... until last Wednesday, when TCM was shown in my "The Art of the Horror Film" course.  As I said, I am a big fan of some particularly gruesome horror movies... and this film scared the living hell out of me.  "But," you're thinking, "all the reviews say its not THAT gory."  Well, its not.  Hooper's direction is amazing and that is what makes this movie so horrible (in a good way).  It's disorienting, which makes the scenario all the more scary.  Moreso, the gory scenes are so artfully done that your own imagination does most of the work for Hooper.  Check out the furniture in Leatherface's house and I promise you will have nightmares for days on end.  If you want creepy, this is it; take my word.  And don't forget grandpa upstairs.  I think he's hungry...
