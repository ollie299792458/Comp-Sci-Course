I bought this DVD about 9 months ago. When I started I was incredibly out of shape. I couldn't get through the whole thing the first couple of times, and even once I mastered that I was wiped out by the end. However, after about 2 months of doing this video 3-5 times a week, I lost 7 pounds and a dress size and felt so much more in shape without changing my diet much.

 I really enjoy this video and don't get bored with it. I like the fact that the other people in the video vary in fitness level and size. Billy can be cheesey at times, but his "nobody's perfect just keep at it" attitude really is motivating. The only thing I don't like is that he doesn't mirror you, and when you are just starting it can be confusing.

I should say though that now after making it the mainstay of my workout routine for the past 9 months, I think my fitness level has exceeded the level of this DVD, so I plan to get the Tae Bo Get Ripped Advanced as well as some other workouts. Regardless, I never worked out regularly before this video and now I do. Billy Blanks is my hero.
