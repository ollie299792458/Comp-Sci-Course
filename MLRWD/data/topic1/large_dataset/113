Great season with lots of new stuff happening to keep us on our toes and some great new faces: sorry, but as much as I admit Barbara Bel Geddes will  always be the ORIGINAL and best Miss Ellie, I LOVE DONNA REED PLAYING HER AS WELL! It is nice to get a totally different actress in the role - she does her own thing with it and she is more sophisticated, attractive and graceful. What is wrong with that? Jenilee Harrison as Jamie Ewing is also great; very likeable and looks hotter and hotter as the season goes by. She definitely holds her own among the other Ewings. And what else can I say about Victoria Principal? Just when you thought the most beautiful woman alive couldn't get any more beautiful? Well it happened in Season 8. With dazzling new clothes (courtesy of Travilla who does a fantastic job with all the women), hair and makeup, she looks more luscious than ever. And her acting (as if I ever really cared about what came out of her mouth) actually seems to mature somewhat this season - her scenes have more conviction and she is more relaxed.
P.S. Is it weird to be this into Dallas??
