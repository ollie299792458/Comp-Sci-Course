The DVD transfer on this Warner Bros. release is very good.  It's clear and looks good enough to represent the first screenings of this movie.

It's really hard to find a better film of this genre, even if you look to the more notable films of dark ilk like the "The Maltese Falcon" or "Chinatown".  Robert Mitchum is excellent as the still idealistic PI who is hired for his honesty to find a mobster's girl.  The mobster (Kirk Douglas) just wants the girl back, forget the 40 grand she took as she left.  It doesn't make a lot of sense until you see our drop-dead gorgeous femme fatale (Jane Greer).  Now you know why the mobster is willing to forget the money and hire someone outside his gangster buddies to find her.  From that point, we fall into a whirlpool of intrigue, lust, betrayal and....oh yes, murder.

Have I mentioned the perfect ending?  I won't tell.  Some reviewers waste space with extended plat synopsis.  I should have given you just enough information to bring you home.  Buy this DVD, either as a single or better yet, with the Warner Bros. Video box set, "Film Noir Classic Collection" (volume 1).  "Out of the Past" belongs on your top shelf and you can trust me on this one.

Highly Recommended to:  Film noir fans, non-noir people who need to be converted and to all movie fans, regardless of situation.
