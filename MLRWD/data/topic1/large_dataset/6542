One of my all time favorite movies is coming to blu-ray. I loved it when I saw it in the theater and although one of my friends said they didn't like it because there was no plot, I disagree. The story is about a man (former soldier) who leaves the trappings of civilization to experience and seek life in the mountain wilderness of the Rockie mountains. He runs into some real characters including one ol' grizzly of a mountain man (Will Geer) who takes Johnson under his wing and teaches him to trap and hunt "griz'". There are comic as well as heart-rending scenes(such as when he comes upon the slaughtered family with a mother who mostly lost her mind in grief and a son who lost his will to speak due to seeing his family killed), but then there are tender scenes as well when Jeremiah Johnson builds a log cabin for his squaw and the mute boy he reluctantly (at first) adopts. The music and the joy of the adopted family while undertaking a new life is probably my favorite scene in the movie. Friends and enemies and family come and go fairly quickly amongst the cold and lonely peaks of the mountains and in the end Jeremiah is alone again with the memories of his many adventures. Such was the life (I suppose) of many a mountain man and such were their legends. Lusciously photographed in Utah and fine performances by all it should be a great addition to any fan of westerns on the blu-ray.
 Now I'm looking forward to see The Mountain Men come out on blu-ray as the DVD did by no means do this movie justice what with the terrible picture quality that was on that release. Although not as good as Jeremiah Johnson it deserves better treatment than the fuzzy pan-scan version.
