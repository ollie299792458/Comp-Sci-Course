I missed this movie when it was a New Release, because the descriptive blurb on the box calls it a "comedy" and doesn't even mention Jane Austen. I am so glad I finally discovered this movie! I've watched it twice, and enjoyed it exceedingly! I have a B.A. in English literature, and have always been a fan of Jane Austen. I have not seen the other version of this movie.
When  motivated to read through the novel again after watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that the movie is BETTER than the novel, in the sense that it eliminates a lot of Austen's excessive verbiage about all the fine details of interpersonal relationships. In other words, while this movie has some great dialogue (and yes, many of the best lines are taken verbatim from the novel),  it  is not overwhelmed by dialogue. This is a visual film, not too intellectual.
The actors who play Emma and Mr. Knightly are wonderful, great chemistry tother. I think that the buxom woman who plays Harriet gives a believeably youthful &amp; bashful performance.  The hypochondriac father is not overdrawn, and Jane Fairfax is played by a dark-eyebrowed woman with a slight resemblance to Liz Taylor.
The photography in this movie is OUTSTANDING. Some of the scenes I had to rewind to watch over again because they were so exquisitely lovely to look at. The various scenes are expertly transitioned, sometimes humorously, and this fluid movement from scene to scene in many ways reminds me of the filmmaking in the hit movie _Titanic_.
I fervently disagree with those who dislike this movie. This is an *excellent film* for Jane Austen fans. The romantic scenes at the end were a little sappy and stererotypical, but I cried and cried. It drew such emotional response.  It is such a moment of enlightenment when Emma figures out that Mr. Knightly is her husband of choice.  He is so subtle and English, and they are a perfectly matched couple. Watch this movie!!!
