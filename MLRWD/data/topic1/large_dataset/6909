wow, i guess i forgot how awesome this really was. when i previously wrote a review for Spriggan i had forgotten what i loved about it and i only remembered what i didn't like. seriously, this is very underrated. the action is so intense you will find yourself sweating throughout the film. one thing that really keeps you so in to Spriggan is that the main charachter, Yu often is in near death experiances and sometimes you think he is just about to die, but then somehow he finds a way to defeat the enemy. this isn't one of those films in which the main character just blows down any threat without any difficulty.
if you are wandering why alot of people don't like this, it's mainly because most people(including myself a short time ago) were expecting another Akira since this movie was made by the same people. well, all i can say is that when i watched this again i tried just enjoying the movie rather than expecting a mind-blowing plot. i began to relize that the soundtrack was actually quit decent and both the animation and the action scenes were absolutely spectacular.
overall, this is a great anime and a must have for all action fans.
  9/10
