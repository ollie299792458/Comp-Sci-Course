This is a classic movie that is as much social commentary as car chase.  I remember watching this on a Saturday matinee on my local television station (long before the advent of cable television) and was mesmerized.
I recently purchased the VHS version and it was just as sweet twenty years later.
The premise isn't much: the main character, former member of society now riding on the fringe, has to get a car to San Francisco in 15 hours.  Load up on amphetamines and off we go.  The 'plot' is merely a vehicle for the ride.  
The car chase scenes are great and realistic (none of the special effects laden hocus pocus you see today) and the cinematography of the West is beautiful.  The characters, from the DJ who plays mystical guide to the helpers the driver meets in the desert, show life on the fringe.  I'm sure on some level this is a mystical, metaphorical journey of sorts but to me it is simply fun to watch.
The soundtrack is absolutely great.  It is kind of the O Brother Where Art Thou of the 70s -- the one that missed the radar.  It isn't music you hear on the radio and it certainly isn't mainstream in any fashion but it sure is good.  
I give this five stars quite simply because of the cinematography, the cast of characters and the music.  Well worth the visit.  They just don't make films like this anymore.
