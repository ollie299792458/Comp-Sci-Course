This is a passable account of the Titanic tragedy, however the overall visuals and editing are quite erratically done. George C. Scott and Catherine Zeta-Jones give fairly believable performances, but I didn't truly feel sadness when the ship and its passengers fell beneath the sea. The story focused on many people, of many classes, yet I still didn't connect with any of those portrayed. I don't know. Maybe it's me.
No matter which telling of the Titanic one watches, there is only one sincere, dignified way of portrayal that can be accepted as "the best"-the one which forces one to remember and honor those who lost their lives due to this horrible tragedy of an "unsinkable" ship. It may actually be this one, or it may be another. Whichever, hopefully the individual will be so engrossed in the story before them, that all of the technical aspects of the film will melt away, leaving nothing but the needless death of many innocent souls. This telling was not that particular one for me, but that doesn't matter. It is for someone, and for that reason, this film serves its purpose.
