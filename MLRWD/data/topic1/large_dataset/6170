Clearly his most personal film, this is a film that will be name checked, discussed, studied, and ultimatley be copied in the future. The dream sequence is pretty much in every single film made at this point, but no one dared to make an entire movie out of a dream sequence, or sequences as Kurosawa did. Cinema has always had its boundaries pushed forward, but more people need to think outside the box. If there are no rules of reality in making a film, then make the film acording to a reality that doesn't exist. That is what Kurosawa finally was able to do at 80 years of age, and more people will start using this movie as a reference tool to further go into their souls. As for the DVD itself, it is pretty bare-boned, but the low list-price makes it a very clear decision on what will become a classic masterpiece.
Best shot/sequence:
This was a tough one to pick out from the entire movie,
but the very last shot in the movie, the entire credit sequence where all you see is the stream flowing with the Moscow Symphony playing the music in the background is astonishing. Stay for the credits.
