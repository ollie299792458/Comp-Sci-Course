This flick originally hit the streets about the same time as Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines.  A local critic here in Minneapolis compared Race with Magnificent Men in a somewhat unfavorable vein.  One evening I found myself casting about for a movie to see and found nothing more interesting than The Great Race available; I went in with that review somewhat souring my attitude.  When I left the theatre almost 3 hours later my ribs literally ached from having laughed so hard and often.  All I can ask today is, "So who watches Those Magnificent Men . . . once or twice a month?" 
A few years back I got the VHS and introduced my then 5 year old daughter to The Great Leslie, Maggie DuBois, Professor Fate, and Max.  She laughed about as much I had the first time and the pie fight nearly finished her off.  Recently my 3-year-old son saw it for the first time and watched enraptured.  Now he understands "Push the button, Max."-Before this he'd always respond with "I'm not Max!"
One thing I don't think I've seen mentioned in any other reviews is the uncanny impression of Richard Nixon that Jack Lemon seems to be doing in his portrayal of Professor Fate--and this before we got to see [him] at his best during his presidential reign.
