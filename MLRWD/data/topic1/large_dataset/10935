GINO; "Godzilla In Name Only", that is.
But really?
Despite all the running down of this movie by us so called Godzilla fans, the movie is a Godzilla movie and always will be. I must admit I was somewhat less  than enthused when I saw it in the movie theater (twice) but I always did  leave the theater giggling. Probably because it was *so* weak; a comically  lame attempt. But maybe it was just my reaction to unfullfilled promise and  disappointed anticipation. Since getting the movie on video, however, it  has grown on me to an extent and while certainly not amongst the best  Godzilla movies ever made, it certainly isn't the worst. Far better than  say, Son of Godzilla or Godzilla vs. Megalon.
So, while it isn't all that  great, it isn't all that bad either. And one must remember that Toho  themselves have made some real stinkers staring the big Guy. Thus I place  it solidly in mid-pack.
Hopefully when D&amp;E do a sequel, they'll learn  from the success, both critical and rating, of the Fox cartoon series and  incorporate appropriate changes.
