I will admit that this seems highly priced, but the content is of such high quality I think it would be worth the price even if it was on one DVD or blue-ray disc (and it probably could be). It is hard to sell such a high price tag on one disc though, even if it is as educational and inspirational as this series.

Unlike most I discovered this recently thanks to netflix, I will likely purchase it soon as a result and I will gladly pay $100 (check out the used section to save a little). I was not yet born when it first came out (close though). I'm surprised I never saw any clips from school (we may have seen some brain neuron segments on second thought). Still though, even though the special effects on screen aren't that great, that perhaps aids in the imaginative components of the series.

Unfortunately many educational series nowadays are filled with more special effects and less content and imagination. It is fairly easy when you get an educated and passionate expert (who happens to be a good teacher, which is not very common) talking about their passion.
