I rented this foolish thing, & was sorely disappointed by the large percentile of inaccuracies, & re-vamps done.

Most folks don't care that a perfectly good storyline is corrupted & contaminated by the PC crowd. I ain't 1 of them.

Where to begin?

Hercules' mother is raped by someone POSSESSED by Zeus (how is this done? No back story).

The rapist fights a young Herc, bests him, & yet lets him live (despite the two-dimensional character of said villain: can you say 'script convenience', boys & girls?).

While I understand that showing all 12 of Herc's labors would make for an overly long film, giving only 3, & no nod to the others is simplification, pure & simple.

The blame for his madness is placed directly on his wife, instead of his step-mother, Hera. Plots hatch & thicken as if 1 is watching some primeval 'Days of our lives'.

It quickly devolves into a humanist retrofit of mythology, where Herc emotes on 'man not needing gods' (I doubt too many folks thought & spoke in that manner, in ancient Greece: maybe a few).

Indeed, outside of a few minor weirdnesses, we see no actual personification of any deity whatsoever. Which is the way people perceived & thought in that day & age (some people still do).

The CGI is okay, but middling.

After viewing this, I wanted my 190 minutes of my life back.

Don't waste your time on this drivel.
