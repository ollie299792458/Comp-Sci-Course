Poor Shrek... all he wants is to be left alone, sadly for shrek the evil king has other ideas. With an abhorrence for any fairy tale creature the evil king has banished them all to another region... this region just happens to be Shrek's backyard. On a mission to clear his swamp of the excess baggage Shrek encounters a talking donkey (masterfully played by Eddie Murphy) an over romantic princess (played well by Cameron Diaz, even if her accent does tend to dissapear and reappear at the strangest moments) and a huge manage of other delightful characters.
This movie is fabulous. The computer graphics are so real that they jump off the screen. The characters emotions, expressions and mannerisms are so real that you can't help but get involved and find them endearing and loveable. The cast it perfect, from Mike Myers to John Lithgow and the script is genius. This is a movie that you and your children will LOVE, your children will love the fairy tale characters and the animations and any adult will find the "grown up" humor to be hilarious. My only warning is that this isn't a movie (even though animated) for small children, they just won't get it. The dialogue is very adult and sometimes raunchy and even the animation won't make the story clear for small children. This movie had my family and I in stitches I guarantee it'll do the same for you, it is a total keeper and a great film for your collection.
