Reading the jacket for this film one might think it was a cute, somewhat titillating, European comedy about the randy but lovable Marquis and his uptight persecutors.  Uh, no.  The problem with this film is its subject.  I'd heard of De Sade but had no idea how depraved and degenerate his work really is.  The stories that the film would have you believe are breathlessly awaited by a titillated Paris are essentially well written but exceedingly graphic descriptions of the most vile and disgusting "sex" acts imaginable.  It is most definitely not erotica.
I am no prude, but I quickly lost any sympathy for this character, which meant I either had to root for his equally appalling persecutors or somehow identify with one of the supporting characters, such as the tormented and confused priest.  No thanks.  This movie is basically well-produced well-acted high-minded [stuff].  The message fails because in the end the "good" guy was just as bad, if not worse, than the "bad" guys.  The Marquis was not a misunderstood "artist" but rather an adolescent pervert who probably deserved to be locked away.  A truly distasteful film, all in all.
