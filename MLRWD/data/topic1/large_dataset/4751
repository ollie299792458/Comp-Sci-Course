I heard about this movie from a friend who RAVED up and down about how deep, hardcore, and heart wrenching this film was. I had always meant to pick it up but just ended up walking by it in blockbuster. I eventually decided to rent it and see what all the fuss was about. I had seen the preview and was quite intrigued, this looked fresh and unique!

Sadly, this film tried way too hard to be all the things my friend said it was. I feel that the only people who will really enjoy this movie are "indie" high school kids who think very highly of their intellect. When this movie started, all I could say to myself was "Are these high school kids??? Does this take place in high school....? I mean, they have lockers so it must...." Some reviewers have said that the dialogue of these kids was "edgey" in a word. You could barely understand the characters. I'm sorry, but when people sit down to watch a movie they don't want to have to pause it every 5 minutes to process what the characters just said. Because of the contrived and overly ambitious lingo of this film, its very hard to understand whats even going on half the time. I'm still not even really sure what the point of the whole story was at the end.

I'm giving it three stars because the acting was fabulous and the cinematography and camera work was probably what made me keep watching. But overall, this is a very pretentious peice of work. Its just trying to be something that it isn't...and it fails. It crashes and burns when it comes to being a noir detective thriller. The average American audience would not even be able to follow the story. And while I'm all for trying new and unique story lines and dialogue, sometimes you just have to realistic and realize that not everyone wants to get a headache trying to figure out the movie's plot.

And another thing....WHERE WERE THESE KID'S PARENTS????!!!!!
