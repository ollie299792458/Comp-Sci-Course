John Singleton's "Boyz N The Hood," released in 1991, was such a profound film that its impact is still felt today!  This timeless drama was released in ONLY 829 theaters nationwide, and still generated nearly $60 million in box office receipts; the demand for this film was evident.
"Boyz N The Hood" centers around the lives of three African American males, illustrating a realistic view of everyday life in the gang infested streets of South Central, L.A., where I was born and raised.  One of the things that makes "Boyz N The Hood" stand out from other films is the message behind it, which is one that's so powerful it's guaranteed to touch you in one way or another.  Singleton shows how important it is to have a FATHER present in the home; he also shows how easily a life can be taken in the hood, where random killings -- due to gang-violence -- are still occurring today.  
Cuba Gooding Jr., Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long, and Morris Chestnut do an outstanding job in their roles, but Ice Cube, who had no prior acting experience, steals the show in this powerful film.  
"Boyz N The Hood" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, and after seeing this film, you'll know why!
