I think it would be hard to make a crime thriller as gory as this one was and polish it up this good. Wheather you love Tarantino's hard hitting work or hate it theres no denying the fact he dose a pefact job at creating violents. The Script is very impressive for Tarantino's first time out, and all the acters do great jobs, and I think because the acting in Reservoir Dogs was very well recived Tarantino decided that he was going to make more of his well-crafted crime flicks with most of the same stars like Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth who give Reservoir Dogs there best.
Another thing about Reservoir Dogs is its very compelling. It starts of with the jewl thefs meeting in a restrant to go over there plains for the next take down, and its only befor their pointing guns at one another out fear. 
 The movie could have been a stage play as simple as Tarantino and the production desigen dude set it up. 
 .... .... .... Bottom Line: if you not easily grossed out by gore realisicly displayed then chack this out.
