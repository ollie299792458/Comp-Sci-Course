I love this movie.  It's one of the best animated movies in exsitance.  Those who give this movie few start and were strongly dissapointed are either very poor critics or didn't really pay attention to the film.  The story is very powerful.  A story about true equality in a world in which humans and animals are symbiotic with one another.  Mewtwo is one of the best tragic villians ever put on screen.  He is the Malcolm X of pokemon.  Malcolm was extreme in his nature because the place and time demanded that he was.  It's the same in this film for Mewtwo.  Any self respecting human being would react in the same manner.  The film takes kids, its target audience, through every emotional gamit possible.  It also gives kids questions to ponder, serious life changing questions.  In something so blatantly commercial as pokemon is, the filmmakers choose to point a very strong message admist all the advertisments.  A very nice change of pace.  Fans of pretty pictures in which stuff blows up without rhyme or reason should watch something else.  This film is only for those who like substance with their anime.  out  alanS.
