My (then future) wife and I got know each other whilst this move was playing. We had it on VHS via a 4:3 TV and basic Pro-Logic surround system but we enjoyed it all the same. Its blend of humour, adventure, action and nostalgia really did make it the INDIANA JONES IV movie that never was (but still may yet be - personally, I hope not. Best leave it at 3 good movies).

This disk is a good place to start for you if you are a bit new (as we are) to HD. It was, for years, a standard def test disk. The picture looks beautiful and sharp. The blue skies look crystal clear, the flames look hot, the gold looks warm and the reds don't bleed at all. Great DTS core sound too (its all we as yet - but we're working on it!) and a story that is a great old yarn that is creepy rather than scary.

There are some faults but they do lie fully on the limitation of film making technology at that period in time. On this disk, I do feel that the format does rather show up those limitations, it does make some blue/geen screen work seem even more obvious that it perhaps might be - a fault shared with THE MUMMY RETURNS, which we also have. It is hard to believe that what is regarded as cutting-edge can move so quickly.

That quibble aside, its a good film on a good disk.
