When I first heard of this movie I found myself saying, "Another Austin Powers movie, whoop-de-doo Basil."  I had always liked the other two, but I just couldn't see anything funnier being added to the Austin Powers frachise.  I was dead wrong.
Goldmember is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  I don't usually laugh out loud during movies, but I did so multiple times on this one.  It was just plain hillarious!  "Welcome to my underwater sub.  It's long, hard and full of seamen!"
"After saying that, I do have some suggestions."  Despite it's comedy, there is some flaws.  The main plot wasn't the best and wasn't consentrated on.  The deal with Austin's dad was very good, but the rest of the plot didn't get very much attention.  The first two had very good plots and funny parts, while Goldmember is full of funny and has some good plot parts.  Also, the ending wasn't quite satisfying.  There was something in the end that happened in the first two but not in Goldmember.  Oh well.
All in all Goldmember is an extremely funny movie and worth every minute.  The new cast members are good and worthy of the Austin Powers franchise.  I just thought that Foxxy and Austin should have had a closer relationship.  I mean they were supposed to have been going out earlier, they didn't have to go through all the flirting and slow movements again.  Oh well.  It's a great movie if you want a good laugh and I highly recommend it.
