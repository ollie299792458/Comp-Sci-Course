We're being tinkered with. Twisted and changed. A unknown force wants to make itself immortal and thinks it can find out by discovering what makes us tick and why we are the way we are.
So every night at midnight the world stops and a few people are shifted around. New memories given and old lives erased.
Their biggest mistake, however, was taking a man with a happy life and giving him memories to make him believe he's a murderer. The memories don't take, and he wakes up before things are finished.
And now they're after the one thing capable of disrupting everything they have been working for.

More original that my last attempt at dinner and a darn sight more tasty. This is freaky stuff but very cool and acted superbly.
It twists, it turns and you are, for better or worse, pulled along with it. The end is even more cool because its sad, but happy.
How? You ask?
Don't ask. Watch.

When i started my DVD collection this was a must. And it still sits proudly on my shelf, except of course when i'm watching it.
New and inventive, the film never fails to thrill and is a beautifully done piece of work.
Something you'll enjoy alot, but little known in the world of film. Why? We'll never really know. But its one that is hard not to enjoy.
