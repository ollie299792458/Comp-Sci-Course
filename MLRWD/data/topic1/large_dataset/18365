The Jurassic Park Adventure Pack is the ultimate collection of Jurassic Park movies in one beautifully designed box.The entire Jurassic Park trilogy is here on three separate dvd`s,it is a must have for any Jurassic park fan.The first Jurassic Park(1993) film is a very beautifull  and memorable film with astonishing special effects and a fascinating and great story and, also John williams beautifull and great Jurassic Park music.The second Jurassic Park film The Lost World(1997) is a boring safari adventure and a weak not interesting dinosaur movie.The third movie Jurassic Park 3(2001) is a spectacular dinosaur adventure movie filmed in a very beautifull ,lush tropical island setting with gorgeous photography and scenery and excellent sound and very realistic looking dinosaurs.Spinosaurus is a bigger and badder dinosaur than tyrannosaurus rex and their battle for supremacy and the velociraptors and the pteranadons hunting and trying to eat Dr. Alan Grant(Sam Neill) and his friends is exciting,scary and full of terror.I wish Jurassic Park 3 was a full 2hrs. long instead of 90 minutes.Jurassic Park 3 is a wonderfull and enchanting film.
