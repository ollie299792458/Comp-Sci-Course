The Finger of God was a wake-up presentation for me.  I have been a lifelong Christian and even had a 'Shekhinah' experience with the Holy Spirit back in 1985.  It was a wake up call for me because I came away from the documentary thinking that God doesn't change and the power that was wielded by the early Christians to heal, cast out demons, change lives and plug into the limitless power of God is still here.  I came away thinking one clear statement.  I came away from it saying to myself; 'We're not doing what we should be doing and what we can be doing'.

There are some parts of the DVD that I find just too weird to be true however, like people in church supposedly spontaneously receiving gold crowns on their teeth from out of the wild blue yonder.  But coming from my perspective of having actually had a shekhinah experience with God myself, the things that God is doing around the world, both outside of the United States as well as inside, are eye-opening.  The director of the documentary Darren Wilson did an interview online about the documentary itself that is a must watch if you buy it.

Generally speaking, the Finger of God chronicles miracles and the workings of God around the world that just do not make the evening news with Katie Couric.  I would encourage you to get it and let your family and friends view it as well as your youth group at church.
