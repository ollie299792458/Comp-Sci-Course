I can not give this season five stars and I won't simply give it five stars because its one of my favorite shows on television. This season earns four stars for two big reasons.

1) Shorten Season/Writer's Strike: We were given a rushed and often times confusing arc this season. Episodes sometimes felt hurried and uncomplete, leaving far more questions than answsers. The cohesiveness of this season is not as strong as seasons prior, say last season, which re-invigrorated my initial love for the show. However some weak story arcs and writing can't take away from the amazing acting this season. Tom and Michael show their acting muscles. I never thought that the writers would go that evil with Lex, but they finally went there and it was great. The introduction of Laura Vandervoort/Supergirl was an added treat. Her interactions with Clark made for some instant classics.
2) Despite a shortened season and a same old DVD special features, we are expected to a pay a regular season price for a this set. Absurb! Foul! Give us loyal fans a little more than that. Free comic booklet? Sneak Peek into next season? Making of Season 7 commentary? Candy?

However, the strengths of this seasons (i.e.: getting rid of Lana (thank god), Supergirl, the descent into Lex's evil, and the return and introduction of several DC heros and villians) make it impossible for me to say no to buying this season's box set. I hope season 8 blows us away.
