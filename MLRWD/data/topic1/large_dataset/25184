I think someone spiked my drink!  What is wrong with this movie?  Did I hallucinate the whole damned thing?

The film is entertaining, but not for the reasons the writers intended, or at least I hope not.  I don't remember there being talking (marginally obsessive) robots in the 80's, but maybe I wasn't paying attention.  And Apollo Creed... seriously guys, the character is simply unbelievable.  He persistently refers to Rocky as "Stallion" throughout the movie, yet we are supposed to believe that he's both straight, and married.  I think he's on the DL, and the studio endorsed massive gay-bashing, and I mean that literally.  Also, his little dance number with James Brown?  No thank you. No part of that was good.
Beyond that incredulity, the rest of the film was an endorsement of anabolic steroids with just a touch of hate-mongering aimed towards the Soviets thrown in, for flavor.
Granted this is the first Rocky film I've seen, but if it is an accurate reflection of the rest, I will avoid.  I suggest the same for you, unless in a state of extreme inebriation, in which case it might hold mild amusement.
