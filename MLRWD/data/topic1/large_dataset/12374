Before PT Anderson ever undertook the massive undertaking that is Magnolia, there was Boogie Nights.  Sustained by extremely controlled and talented acting, this film takes its viewer through a Valley where love,  loyalty, forgiveness and redemption run as rampant as PT Anderson's  imagination allows.
The dynamic between Moore and Reynolds is the best  performance as far as performance, but this isn't a film that relies on a  strong individual effort.  The real character is Anderson's script, where  everyone gets a classic Greek treatment: a rise to reknown, be it fast,  slow or otherwise; a sharp fall, so sharp in fact it appears all can be  lost; and a return to former glory with aknowledge of loss that makes said  character reflective and a little less ignorant.
At the risk of being  long-winded, I will strongly reccommend this DVD (commentary, deleted  scenes, and a ton of Phase 2 stuff) for any avid movie fan that wishes to  see one Valley boy's unifying, familial, redemptive masterpiece.  
Enjoy.
