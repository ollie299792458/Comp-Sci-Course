well, once again, my mail order company broke a street date, and my  'ELF' dvd arrived this past friday. i must tell you, in earnest, i totally laughed till i cried! will is great as the 6ft 3" elf. the role was made for him. the cinematography at santa's north pole, nyc during  the bustling holiday season, i could really go on and on here i even liked it more than shrek 2! this dvd will become a holiday classic brought back every season, and never wear out it's welcome! get it for your loved ones-get it for yourself, as i did-you will not regret it at all. the supporting cast, the swift direction, the ac-3 sound, the choice of either wide or full screen on 2 packed dvds all add up to  great laughs that will continue every time you view it. this and 'gone with the wind' the new 4 disc restored version, are my 2 very favorite and most cherished dvds of this rather sad war torn year! bravos and kudos to both dvd companies for warming not only mine, but i am sure many hearts this holiday season!
