This action/court drama film seems to climax near it's beginning, instead of near the end.
In the main opening scene (Which I prefer to focus on in this review), we see Samuel L. Jackson (Marine commander &amp; decorated war hero) and his troops surrounded by a bloodthirsty mob of machine-gun firing terrorist snipers, protected by the 'human sheild' of an even larger mob of stone &amp; firebomb throwing terrorists- many of them women &amp; children. (i.e., typical Arab behavior).
As someone who served 3 years in the Israeli army, I must point out that for myself, and thousands like me, this story is fact instead of fiction. In the real world, Israeli soldiers find themselves in this exact same situation almost every single day. To us this is life- Not just another movie. Unfortunately, in real life, Israeli soldiers wouldn't dare take such aggressive steps to quiet the bloodthirsty mobs in Ramallah, Kalkilya, and Gaza City- Because unlike Samuel L. Jackson, there would be no happy ending for the Israeli commander who would dare open fire into the terrorist crowd...
