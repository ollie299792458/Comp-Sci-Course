I had grown tired of the US Queer as Folk series. Sure when it came out it was interesting and fresh, and now I realize the reason why--it basically transplanted lines from the UK series during its first season. After the first season I could no longer stand whiny Michael and ridiculously pathetic Brian (I don't see why he's hot).

Upon watching the UK version however, I was so blown away...so this was what the series was supposed to come across as! Interesting characters, actual death and loss (the death of Phil was a sad but realistic plot point), and Nathan (Justin) actually has a friend in school (WOW!) whom he talks to regularly about his issues! Another thing I couldn't stand about the US version was the annoying Debbie...my God, what a clown! Hazel (UK Debbie) was far more realistic, more maternal 'fag hag' than over-the-top  crazy, radical-left mum. Yeah she parties, but at least she doesn't have crazy buttons on her shirt and act like a 12 year old kid in a 40 year old's body.

Vince was also a few notches above Michael as a character--slightly immature, yes, but also very realistic and adult-like (I could actually believe he was a store manager), unlike Michael who was just so pathetically whiny and immature that I felt like fast forwarding whenever he came on screen.

All in all, see the UK version that generated all the fanfare and controversy, you won't regret it!!
