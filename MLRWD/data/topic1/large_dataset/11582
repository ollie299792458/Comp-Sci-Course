I first watched this movie when it came into theatres, and I actually talked my friends into watching this instead of another movie, which was a hit thriller.

The main reason why I chose this over the other movie was not because of the cast members. Though i admit that I admire the beautiful Miss Hilary Duff and Mr Chad michael Murray as many teenagers do out there(hey! I'm only sixteen myself!), I watched the movie because I was attracted by the story.

Cinderella is one of my favourite fairytales since I was a kid, and I am really glad that it's made into a comedy telling the story of a girl. A Cinderella Story illustrates many aspects of lives of teenagers; family, school, friends, part-time job... and it's shouting out to every teenager out there: never give up. Cling onto your dreams. Eventually, everything will be alright.

Fairytales are like dreams of every person out there, no matter you are a kid or you are an adult. Many say that they are like perfections that don't exist. Well maybe they don't. But if you really look and you really try to see, they are there, waiting for you to explore.
