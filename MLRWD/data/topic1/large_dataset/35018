. . . and that's just as it should be.  I disagree with those who say the  plot is hard to follow. It's more that there is no plot, just a series of  events, some more understandably connected than others.  This film is close  to being an exercise in pure surrealism.  It's as if Argento threw up his  hands and said, "Screw it.  I usually have a hard time managing a  coherent storyline, so this time I'm not even going to worry about it.  I'm  just going to construct a vague framework and go nuts with the nightmare  imagery that is my forte and have a great time."  Which of course  would have been disastrous if it wasn't for the fact that Argento is a  brilliantly imaginative visual stylist.  To paraphrase Pauline Kael's  review of David Lynch's The Elephant Man, this is not the usual movie where  narrative is the glue that holds everything together; here, imagery is all.  Argento holds you rapt with one entrancing, eerie and dreamlike scene  after another.  There's also one inspired moment of black humor when a man  being attacked by rats--well, I don't want to give it away.  Suffice to say  it's a great joke that very wittily subverts your movie-watching  expectations and (it seems to me) makes a satirical comment about New York  at the same time.
