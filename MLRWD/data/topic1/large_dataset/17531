This movie, like a cockroach, is something you never want to see and if you were to catch a glimpse of it, you would try to smash it.

Terrible, terrible, terrible.

Acting: poor

Adam Sandler: terrible (x2)
Background Score: poor

This movie is a giant, moving product spot promotion for a number of companies, mostly terrible ones with large advertising budgets. It also features walk-ons from a number of actors, and marketing shills, like Subway's "Jarod".

I will never buy a movie with Adam Sandler in unless its ratings are favorable. This movie, I will remember. "Click" was funny and heart-wrenching. "Jack and Jill" is moronic. I will, also, never go to Radio Shack again, or trade with any of the other companies that "paid" for "advertising" in "Jack and Jill". Most of them are, in fact, companies I never had any interest in buying products from, but this movie clinched it. Hollywood, to allow this kind of tripe on the screen, must have a very low regard for the intelligence of movie-goers. The marketing geniuses that thought advertising in a movie-billboard should be horse-whipped and deported to a planet that lacks an atmosphere.

This movie narrowly escaped my "destroy the DVD" rating of movies where I actually crush horrible movie's DVDs. Its cleansing. Try it sometime. Start with "Jack and Jill".
