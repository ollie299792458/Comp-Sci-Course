I had never heard about Eli Stone until a friend raved about it, and so I went to Amazon to see the reviews. When I read other people raving about the series as well on Amazon, I had to buy the first season to see what everyone was talking about.

I watched the entire Season 1 in one weekend. It was that riveting, so much so that I could not pull myself away from Eli Stone.

It is hard to describe the series except to say it is about a lawyer who develops a brain aneurysm which causes him to have prohpetic visions. Yeah, I know, that doesn't sound all that unique, right?

But I am telling you that the writers of this show are so talented that they truly make this series refreshingly unique. Not only convinceable, but yes, there is that word "riveting" again.

The characters are so well-rounded and deep that you really grow to care about them. But what is best of all are the constant surprises that this show throws at you. I could never guess what was about to happen next. Eli Stone is exceptionally well done in all regards.

Quirky, sweet, funny, and so darn likeable, that is the show Eli Stone. I found myself laughing at parts and literarlly crying at other parts. Eli Stone brought out emotions in me that I didn't think I could feel for any mere television show. It is that good. No, let me rephrase: Eli Stone is awesome.

Do yourself a favor and buy Season 1 to find out what all the hulllabaloo is about when referring to Eli Stone. I have already bought Season 2 and I cannot wait for it to arrive in my mail.
