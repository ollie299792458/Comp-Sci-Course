The shame is that as soon as I mention the The Decalogue, Kieslowski and Art House Foreign Film or Not Made in America no one wants to watch it. Ergo then no body to discuss the contents with, nor the form of this masterpiece in its construction with. How to talk about such a subject, and not be judgmental is to say the least difficult. To illustrate the ten words in ten episodes where each character remains ignorant to the consequence of his actions in relation to the will appears to of been the objective. I am wading through each one slowly and so far have not seen them all so I reserve my opinion to the previous sentences account. If only American Soap Operas could plumb the depths of conscientiousness as Keislowski does then perhaps overnight the proud, the arrogant, the apostates would repent, for the words preceded all, law preceded the breaking of it, so now we know what sin is. Your research on the topic would likely begin with this link. [...] Another more personal review a commentary more than a critique may be found here. [...]
