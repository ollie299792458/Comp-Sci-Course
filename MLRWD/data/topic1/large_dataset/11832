If you love Kevin Spacey, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee you just have to watch this film. I caught the last hour of this movie on cable, and love Kevin Spacey so I had to buy the DVD to see the whole film, and I am glad I did buy it.  Beyond The Sea is a brief history of Bobby Darin and his love for Music, his Fans and Sandra Dee.

I was really surprised to know that Bobby Darin was married to Sandra Dee. And I grew up with both Bobby's music and Sandra's Summer Place.  I was a fan of both Stars however I had no idea that they were married, a great surprise for me.

Kevin Spacey as always delivers in what ever he does, and in this film he does not disapoint but instead goes one step further by actually doing one hell of a great job singing Bobby's songs. Kevin was "Bobby Darin" in this film.
I don't know what more to say except "Thank You Kevin for this film and your talent" which is next to none.  You always keep me entertained no matter what you do, and I just adore you. AND what a voice!

 Kevin Spacey is true talent, and is really just huge in his role as Bobby Darin.
I don't know what more to say except if you knew of Bobby Darin, Sandra Dee, and love Kevin Spacey this film is a must see.  Also John Goodman does his usual no disapointment in his role as Bobby's manager.  The whole cast is a  surprise and you won't be disapointed by this film, it is full of fun, music and huge talent. You won't want to miss Kevin Spacey in this one.
