GREAT GREAT set. Bought it back in 2007 and watched every episode.  Maybe there is something wrong with me, but it did not bother me if 2 or 3 of the episodes did not show the extra 2 min footage................ Like the Darlin' singing. I bought it because I enjoy the show and wanted the laughs. NOT that important. The price is good for what you get, which is every episode.  To be honest, if several people had not mentioned it, I would not have know a few episodes were missing a min. or two. I didn't loose any sleep over it. The Darlin's get on my nerves anyway, and they weren't that funny..... As for WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS... people get over it. I think some people buy a damn move or in this case a box set for the extras. The series ended in 1968. They were not concerned about telling the future of adding extras to DVD which of course didn't exist then. I hope no one expected them to hunt down the living cast for interviews.  I guess if your wanting  10 hours of extras and the lost Darling's song you will just have to do without.  I am picky, and I did not notice anything wrong with the picture quality or the packaging. To be honest - this is one fine set, and some people, well you can't please. If you want all the episodes it is here folks.
