Hitchcock's TORN CURTAIN may not necessariy be the disaster people sometimes make out to be...but when viewed alongside his best films, it sure seems like it!
It's easy to pinpoint the flaws here. The pacing here is sometimes painfully slow. There is almost zero rapport or chemistry between Newman and Andrews. Both seem ill at ease in their roles, ESPECIALLY Paul Newman. And poor Julie Andrews has to utter the terrible line "but...that's behind the Iron Curtain!" Andrews' role as written is shockingly dumb- the audience has figured out that somethings up with Newmans' supposed defection LONG before his own fiancee does!
Then...the scene where it Hitch reconnects- the murder of Gromek. Still not on a par with, say, his legendary windmill scene, or his cropdusting scene, Hitchcock is at least displaying some imagination, and supplying some tension to a film that, by this reel, desperately needs it. 
However, the film then unravels and can't quite get itself together. If the Academy gave awards for overacting, Lila Kedrova would have been a shoo-in, because she goes WAAAAAAY over the top as the Countess. 
I've been overall negative, because it should be admitted that TORN CURTAIN is still leaps and bounds ahead of many other films (hence my 3 star rating). However, if you do watch it, try not to catch in the same time period as viewing NORTH BY NORTHWEST, NOTORIOUS or STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. It will seem a much better film...
Not a trainwreck...but an overall disappointment...
