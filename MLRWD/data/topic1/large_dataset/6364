"Dinosaur" is a fine film from the folks at Disney.  Like "Hercules," the story isn't moving or too impressive, but the film is fun to watch and has some brilliant moments in it.  Many people have bashed the film for being too violent, but the PG rating does seem fair.  I agree that kids under the age of five shouldn't see this movie without some serious adult supervision, but at the same time, children do need to know about death...even if it's violent.  The Carnotaur sequences involve quite a bit of violence, but these are dinosaurs!  Dinosaurs ate each other in reality.  Don't knock this movie for that reason.  Here's a concept:  Watch the movie with your kids(you won't be bored) and then explain to them that death and violence was a very real part of daily life for dinosaurs.  It may take your children a little time to cope with this information, but sometimes the truth hurts.  If your child is under the age of five, you may want to skip certain sequences in the movie because of the violence.  My daughter watched this movie, but I always managed to skip through the violent parts for one reason:  she's two years old.  She loves this movie.  When she gets old enough to understand that things die, I'll let her see the violent sequences in this film.
For adults, I found this movie very entertaining.  As in other reviews, I agree that the visuals are stunning.  The film is brilliantly animated and does use some real scenery to blend in with the CGI graphics.  The differences in the two are almost seamless.  The lemurs provide both comic relief and solid wisdom in this flick.
If for no other reason, buy this movie for it's artistic value, but the story is a good one and the characters are very believable.  It's a good show, but I cannot help but reiterate the importance of watching this show with young kids in order to explain some of the things that occur in it.
