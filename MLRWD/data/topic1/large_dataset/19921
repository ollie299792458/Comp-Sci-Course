I saw this forever ago at a Drive-In -- Kids, that's an outdoor theater screen where you watched movies from inside your car.  I thought the movie was interesting, but didn't care for it as much as the show because the actors were there, but they were playing different characters.  I thought it was weird, but just ok.

I recently watched it again, though Instant Video and enjoyed it much.  I thought the storyline was pretty good (nothing ground-breaking) but I liked the actors and characters.  It was a Dark Shadows type story, but not a part of the  TV series.  If you are a DS fan, and you can get past familiar actors in unfamilar roles, I think you will like the movie.  The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of screaming -- there's quite a bit.

On a side note.  I recently watched the new Burton/Depp Dark Shadows movie.  Helena Bonham-Carter plays Julia Hoffman in the remake.  Grayson Hall played the character originally.  Bonham-Carter must have gotten her inspiration from this movie because she had Grayson Hall down perfectly.  The hair/look/mannerism -- she was awesome.
