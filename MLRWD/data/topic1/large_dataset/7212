With the final episode of the series leaving all of the fans a bit lacking, and the huge amount of campaigning that was done to bring the show back, this miniseries was an answer to all that.

And what an answer it was.

Wrapping up many of the questions left behind after 4 action packed seasons, and bringing back to TV the characters that so many people fell in love with, The Peacekeeper Wars keeps up with the tradition of excellence that fans of the series have grown accustomed to.  The plot line, though condensed considerably(this could have easily have been a Season 5 for the show) it still gives people a sense of closure to the series, but opens up new doors as well.  The writing is excellent and the direction is fantastic, better than anything seen on tv or even in movies in a long time.

As for the acting, everyone did a more than excellent job with their roles, Ben Browder and Claudia Black once again show everyone why they are and always will be the sexiest and funniest, if not actionable, couple ever to be seen on TV.  Wayne Pygram comes across better than ever as the dark anti-hero Scorpius, and also as the bumbling sidekick Harvey who still resides inside John Crichtons mind.  All of the friends that people have made over the past 4 seasons return, and none of them give us a bad performance.

With Peacekeeper Wars you'll laugh, you cry, and you'll cheer, and your heart will break.  It's the best mini-series I've ever seen, and I only hope that we see more of this wonderful show.

5 out of 5 stars.
