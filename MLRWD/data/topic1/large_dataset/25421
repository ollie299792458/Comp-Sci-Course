Cruel Intentions is a good movie! That's why I gave it 5 stars... If you want to watch a movie filled with deceit and twisted plots, this is the one for you. Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Kathryn, Sebastian's stepsister and love interest.  Sebastian derives pleasure out of others' misery.  Every girl that he comes in contact with is a conquest for him. He tries to get them in bed with him and will feed these girls any line needed to achieve his goal.
Kathryn is a "psycho-bulimic-head case" as described by her ex boyfriend.  Kathryn has a hard time dealing w/ rejection and wants to get back at anyone who does anything to her, nice or otherwise.  
Kathryn and Sebastian have their fun with flirting and foreplay until Sebastian wants a real challenge and finds out about Annette (played by Reese Witherspoon), a virgin from Kansas. Annette has recently written a manifesto on why she plans to wait..Sebastian doesn't like that and plans to prove her manifesto wrong.  
I'm not going to give away anything else about Katryn, Sebastain, Annette, or the others, such as Cecille and Ronald.  This movie is my favorite. Watch it, and you will find out why.
