Yes DVD has SOME of the footage from the 1973 concert at Madison Square Garden, but most of the footage is recreated after-the-event during a made-for-completing-the-film event, complete w/wigs and recreated stage and what not.  The absolute worst part is that the matching of the video to the audio is probably the WORST I've ever come across.  Hardly one lick from Page matches the video - it is matched singularly to Plant, and sometimes even misses that mark.  So, it is really hard to 'get into it' during a lick or solo when the timing is off.  IT IS JUST THAT BAD.

When I first saw this streaming, I thought it was a bootleg because it was so poorly edited.  Then a friend brought the disc over and we checked it out.  I can't believe that the original members of the band approved of this release.  Scenes are noticeably, drastically out of sync w/the soundtrack.  Moby Dick was completely hacked up, and at one point they show the end of Bonham's solo on a different track!  Splicing is so bad you can see close up shots of an artist doing something or nothing and the soundtrack doing the opposite - just bad work.  It is actually hard to watch.  Do yourself a favor and try to obtain the original movie or just keep to the soundtrack but don't buy this piece of junk.
