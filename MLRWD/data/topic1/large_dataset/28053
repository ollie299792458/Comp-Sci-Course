In general, I love the DC animated series and movies. I've always been a DC fan, and for most of my life have had to suffer through a largely inferior Marvel cast of heroes getting an undue share of the spotlight. The DC animated empire, starting in the 1990s with Batman TAS, has consistently delivered amazing and enduring quality; I work with kids and every once in a while, as a special treat, I am able to show them old episodes of Batman and Superman. And they eat that stuff up.

I'm consistently disappointed, though, that the movies aren't able to retain the stellar voice cast that, in large part, made the animated series so memorable. For instance, I almost can't watch a DCAU Batman film if it doesn't have Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight. And while I'm neutral with respect to the performances of Tim Daly and George Newbern as Superman, I think Clancy Brown's Lex Luthor is nearly as distinctive and irreplaceable as Conroy's Batman.

It's Brown's absence from this film that is striking to me. I realize that, at times, working actors aren't always available to reprise roles, especially voice actors. But it does sometimes make a difference to the audience, when they have come, over the course of several years, to develop expectations of a certain character's performance. It doesn't matter, in the end, the quality of the replacement: the best voice actor in the world couldn't fill in what's missing if an expected and familiar voice is missing.

Still, I wouldn't simply dismiss this film out-of-hand just because the voice cast is not to my liking. I may end up picking it up, and I may even end up liking it. But, at this time, I'm just sighing wistfully and shaking my head, silently wondering how good this movie could possibly be without Clancy Brown doing his nefarious best as Luthor.
