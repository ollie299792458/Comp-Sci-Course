Marley and Me is the story of John and Jenny Grogan (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston) who became proud dog parents of a little yellow furball named Marley, who grew up to be a giant barrel of energy.

The story begins as the newlywed Grogans settle down in the Palm beach area. Not yet ready for children, they buy a little yellow lab puppy they name Marley. As Marley grows up, they soon realize they've got a handful as Marley chews up everything in site and runs of on a leash at a moment's notice. The movie shows the Grogans trying to learn to control their dog. They take him to obedience school where is the worst student and after mauling the instructor (played by Kathleen Turner) is promptly expelled.

As the story progresses, the Grogans life blooms. They have children, their careers blossom and grow and take them to new places. Marley is right along with them. He's there chewing things up and providing the love only a dog can give.

Marley and me is a wonderful family film. You'll laugh, you'll cry and your heart will swell and you will love this movie.
