There is really no underlying agenda to interpret in this movie, which is no drawback by any means. This movie is a joyride in all regards, and the film really thrusts you from being a watcher to being a participant. The whole approach to the storytelling itself is presented in ways that deviate from standard filming that make the watcher, as I just said, feel like part of the movie and part of the adventure. Examples of my ranting are exemplified by the small intermissions in which the characters travel from one place to another, the camera work that sometimes captures the intoxication of said times, and the interaction between the characters that occurs before the normal run-of-the-mill scenes start.
The whole plot, or better yet chronology, of this film revolves around young Ronna, a girl working in a dead end job who is living from paycheck to paycheck. Its the holiday season, but Ronna is short on her rent money and needs to find ways to score some extra cash to keep her from being evicted. The movie weaves in and out from here, and follows several different storylines, each with their own dedicated, and for the most part uninterrupted, time periods.
The movie does an excellent job of weaving the different storylines and actually crossing them at various times, which provides great insight into events that happen earlier in the movie that you may not be able to grasp at first glance. These plots include Ronna's plans to sell ecstasy at a rave to cover her expenses, going behind the back of her normal dealer (and co-worker) Simon, who is out getting into mischief in Las Vegas with some of his friends, and then there is the curiously strange policeman who is using two soap opera stars as bait to catch a drug dealer in a deal...in this case it happens to be poor Ronna.
On the whole, there is too much to like about this movie with its unusual yet real life circumstances.
