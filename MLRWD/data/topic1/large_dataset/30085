I added this to an order of five other movies, more as an afterthought than anything, figured that at such a low price, it would be hard to go wrong. And wow, what a deal that turned out to be- I ended up watching it before any of the others, and I was impressed on all fronts.

Nick Cave's script is tight, well-paced, and lends plenty of depth and pathos to both of the two main characters, and in turn, Guy Pierce and Ray Winstone both ably rise to the challenge of making each a complex, fully-realized figure that the viewer wants to understand and doesn't really simply root for or against, which makes the movie all the more interesting to watch as the inevitable conclusion draws near.

Add very solid direction and just the right amount of (non-gratuitous) violence to the mix and you have the formula for an excellent "modern" western, one that any fan of the genre should enjoy and also one that might well be worth watching even for those that aren't as familiar with such movies as Unforgiven and the like.

The Blu-Ray transfer is surprising solid for such an affordable disc. First Look isn't necessarily known for the best transfers around, and though there are certainly plenty of shots that have unpleasant levels of softness, the vast majority show excellent levels of detail and are sharper, which lends well to showing the depth expected in the better hi-def transfers.

Overall, a very strong entry in the genre, a good effort on Blu-Ray, and a great price.
