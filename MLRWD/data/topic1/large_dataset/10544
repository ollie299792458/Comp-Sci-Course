I first saw this film over thirty years ago and fell in love with it.  Thirty years later I still do.  John Wayne's performance as an aging soldier was so out of character for him at the time, and yet he plays the part perfectly.  Even the make-up used to age him looks natural.  John Ford's use of Monument Valley for the location provided some breathtaking background while his direction is perfection itself.  Today the script seems a little cliched, but when I first saw the film it was fresh and brisk and still seems that way today.  And the supporting cast - what a dream!  Not one wrong note in the crowd, but as a real standout, Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree is one of my favorite characters in film.  His sense of loyalty first to his old Confederate comrades and now in defeat  his loyalty to his new commanders makes him a complex and yet simple man all at the same time.  Everything else about this film is world class; the music, the photography, the costumes, everything stands out here.  On a final note, the color in this film is better than anything I have ever seen, with the possible exception of The Adventures Of Robin Hood.  This film may be sixty years old this year, but it's still one of the greats.  Don't miss it!
