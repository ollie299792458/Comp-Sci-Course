I gave this movie five stars because I loved almost everything about it.  Now this movie has got mixed reviews and the reason is because it was several things before being put on the silver screen.  When you take something like a comic, cartoon and/or a videogame you can't put all that is great about it into the movie.  Many times because it is impossible for whatever reason.  Putting that aside the movie was great, and the effects were awesome.
James Marster and Chow Yun-Fat are two of the best actors because they can do just about any role.  They played their characters perfectly as did Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum.  This was the perfect coming of age story, about a teenager finding out who he is and deciding his destiny.  Is he only what he was born to be or can he be something greater--better.
The only issue I have with this movie was the romance between Goku and Chi Chi, because for me it seemed forced.  Not because the two actors did not have chemistry they did, I just thought it was a little rushed.  Like it was only put in there because they felt he needed to have a love interest.  I think that if people give this movie a chance and watch it for what it is supposes to be (entertainment) they will enjoy it.
