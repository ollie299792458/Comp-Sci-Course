Al Pacino sleepwalks through the role of a go-to crime fighter named Jack Gramm who races against the clock to stop a murder - his own.

The script (such that it is) is cliche-riddled with all the sloppiness of a drive-by shooting. The predictable culprit taunts our bored-looking protagonist - whom everyone in the picture can immediately identify - with a faux-Jigsaw computerized voice in a failed effort to replicate Dennis Hopper's "Pop quiz, hotshot!" from Speed: "Tick tock, doc!"

The cherry on top of it all is either a well-placed stegosaurus toy during an attempt by Al Pacino to deliver a serious, lengthy monologue or this dialogue exchange:

Jack: "Somebody hired Sara Pollard to be with me last night, then killed her. Took my semen, deposited it into Dale Morris."
Frank: "Do you have any idea how absurd that sounds?"
Jack: "No, it's not absurd!"

88 Minutes is over-the-top camp that just barely passes for fun if the audience can give in to its unintentional hilarity.
