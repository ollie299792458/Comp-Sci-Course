This classic was released in 1946, just after WW2. It is a straightforward yet emotionally and morally deep piece of work. Historically, the film is very interesting, since it tackles a highly relevant topic (for its time and right up until very recently) - the pursuit of nazi war criminals in hiding.

Story-wise, "The Stranger" owes much to Hitchcocks "Shadow of a doubt" (1943), as you will recognize if you have seen that one.

It could also be argued that the film suffers from the fact that it is designed to please the studio executives that Welles depended upon for income(it had been 4 years since his last movie and he had to prove that he still had it).

But if that is the case, it only goes to show that an Orson Welles working under economic and artistic limitations still managed to make a movie vastly more interesting than countless blockbusters before and after.

For its sheer tautness, honesty and energy, I like this movie  better than both "Citizen Kane" and The lady from Shanghai". In my opinion it is part of the sacred Welles Trinity ("A touch of evil" and, obviously, "The third man" being the other two), and one of the best films ever made.

Because you should really see this one and judge for yourselves, I am not going to give a detailed story synopsis. But i want to point out that it is VERY exciting in spite of the fact that you get to "know" the main storylines and what will be the inevitable outcome early on in the film (you dont know HOW it will happen...)

And of course, it is not just an accidental detail that Charles Rankin happens to be a teacher of world history- nor that he is about to marry the daughter of a US Supreme Court Judge. And that ending...Typical Welles-ian mischievousness.

Raw and concise like an early Muddy Waters recording.
