This movie is the story of Lee Strobel's journey to prove Christ to himself after his wife's slow conversion to Christianity. Eventually, he moves away from his Atheism to Christianity, and seeks to use this movie (based on his best-selling book of the same name) to explain his conversion and that factors that proved Jesus to him. Now, unlike some people in the reviews for both the book and this movie,I won't get on Strobel for not interviewing any skeptics; after all it's called the Case FOR Christ, the Case OF Christ. So again, if your looking for a beat down of this man for not interviewing skeptics and apologetics, you won't find it here. Anyways, on to the actual review of the movie, for the most part, Strobel does a decent job with this movie. It mostly follows his book note to note, so if you hated the book, you'll hate the movie; loved the book, you'll love the movie. I personally find it nice to see him have scholars of the science of Christianity and the NT and not just use circular logic like some Apologetics. My main complaint is that at times, you feel as though the story focuses more on his own conversion than on proving Jesus existed, which is the true purpose of both movie and book. Overall, for the most part, I thought the movie is very good production-wise, and decent content-wise. Although it did not "prove" Christ to me, it was more or less an add-on to what I already knew and believed. If your a christian person seeking to reaffirm your values, this will do the trick. If your an open skeptic, you may find something of note here. If nothing else it will be a good way for me to start conversations with some atheists I know regarding my beliefs,and I thank Mr. Strobel for making the film to help start down that road.
