I am not sure why these seem to be out of print.  I have seen these, and I have seen the CGI "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" movie, and the microseries by Genndy Tartakovsky is much better, in my opinion.  It has a true "Star Wars" feel to it, and it seems necessary, especially the second volume, to bridge the gap between "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith."  To those who have seen the latter but have not seen the microseries, I ask you, do you wonder why general Grievous was coughing at the beginning of "Revenge of the Sith?"  Well, if you watch the second volume of the microseries, you will know.  This microseries carries humor, action, and a serious look into not only Annakin's progression as a Jedi, but also the progression of his relationship with Obi-Wan into a more mature camaraderie.  If I had to pick exactly one item to supplement the main six films as part of the main canon, I would certainly pick this microseries.  In fact, that is what my collection will contain, the six films, and this microseries, and nothing else.
