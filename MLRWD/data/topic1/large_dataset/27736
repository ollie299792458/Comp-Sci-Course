This movie is not offensive- at least not in the way the producers want it to be.  Most of us have an "anything goes" attitude towards entertainment these days, and accordingly, broadcasting something as "OFFENSIVE!" has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a First Amendment champion.  Continued use of profanity and bathroom humor isn't all that funny if you're older than 13- it's initially kind of amusing, then puerile, then pathetic.  Comics tend to be attention-starved anyway, and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or I would care to see.  Case in point: The Aristocrats.

That aside, I wanted to like this movie.  I loved the premise, that telling a joke is like jazz, in that plenty of artists repeat the same material, but with their own interpretation.  It's the singer (comedian) that resonates, not the song (joke).  However, this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation.  I also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves; most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends, and the audience isn't really a part of the joke a lot of the time.

The film's novelties provide the most entertaining moments: Kevin Pollack's Christopher Walken imitation, Billy the Mime, Taylor Negron's gay rendition, and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick.  George Carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke.  On top of everything else, I found the jarring, MTV-style editing and quick camera switches made The Aristocrats even tougher to watch.

While we're on the subject, is there anyone worse than Bob Saget?  He can swear as much as he wants, and he's still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted America's Funniest Videos.  Impossibly, he's even less funny when profane.
