Some of my earliest tv memories include the once per year showing of The Sound of Music around Christmas time.  I might have been too young to really get into it but I remember it being so incredibly long and not all that interesting.  Many years later I watched it again and fell in love with this movie.

Depending on your point of view Julie Andrews is most popular for The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins.  Both are wonderful movies and seem to get better with age.

In The Sound of Music Julie Andrews plays a Nanny sent to watch over a former military man's large household with his many kids.  The house is run the only way the kid's father knows: militarily.  With the power of her smile and singing she wins over not only the kids but their father as well.  This story line has been done and redone since and before but The Sound of Music sticks out as a leader of the pack.

There are very few movies I would say to purchase immediately but this is one of them.
