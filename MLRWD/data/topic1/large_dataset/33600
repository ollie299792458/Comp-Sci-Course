This is a pretty good DVD that is very helpfull for learning new combinations and choreography. It was very helpfull to see both sides of a move at the same time and there were quite a few moves that i did not know, being a new belly dancer when i got this. I do agree with some of the reviewers that it is NOT a BEGINNER DVD, as it does seem to go over the steps rather quickly for a brand new belly dancer.
I also think that jillina was a little bland and stiff. You can tell she has had extensive dance training in the past, but she dosen't seem to come across as enjoying what she is doing.
As a beginner dancer, i learned a couple of different kinds of shimmys- none of which Jillina uses in this video. So for the longest time i thought she was a crappy shimmy-er, but now that i know there are lots of different shimmys i can tell she's good at the shimmy she uses. (So if you are a new dancer and she is different from your teacher, or other video, or if you just don't like her shimmy, there are other shimmys out there for you to learn! i know 5 now, and there are more out there.)
So over all, I will keep this DVD for learning and going over combinations and for exercise, but I was not all THAT impressed with Jillinas' over all style to by more of her tapes.
