I'm a fairly new fan; I just got into Dethklok last year and I thought I'd buy Season One after breaking my ribs laughing at a Metalocalypse video on Youtube.
 Truly the most life-changing desicion I've made in all of my 16 years on the planet ( and possibly the most metal, too )
 This show is very well-done; the animation is amazing and realistic, the characters and plot are astoundingly original and I thought the usage of real black metal band names in unusual places ( Behemoth Studios, Dimmu Burger anyone? Mordhaus ring a few bells??? )was awesome and as a fan of Cannibal Corpse to the death I was pleased to see ( um, hear anyway ) the appearance of George " Corpsegrinder " Fisher's voice in a few episodes. I loved this so much in fact that I watched the whole thing, not just one disc but both discs in one day.
 Now, what I mostly wanted to write this review for was because I understand a lot of people tend to consider this a show for a male audience, which is only correct to a certain degree ( I didn't laugh as hard at the farting as a guy would have... I may have chuckled, but I didn't laugh ) but DO NOT recommend skipping the purchase of this just because you're a girl. Instead consider what's important: If you like metal, if you like gore, if you like the kind of humor that makes you laugh REALLY HARD even though you know you absolutley should NOT be laughing, you would love this and you will not be disappointed, and I would know because I'm a girl too. Seriously, I can't give you a bananna sticker but I can guarantee you you'll love this even more than 100 bananna stickers!
