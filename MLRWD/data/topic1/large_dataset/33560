About the previous two collections of ATHF episodes I said the following:

Watching an episode (all under 12 min) of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is comparable to hours of meditation. There are few shows that will clear your mind and cheer you up this well. However the show is not well appreciated by those who attempt to understand it. Out of all the episodes I have seen over the years, I recall only one where the plot actually achieved resolution. Additionally, the program might not be enjoyed by some because a certain level of understanding and amusement for the eccentricities of Bridge and Tunnel Trash (residents of New Jersey) is required.

The relationships and interactions of the main characters and their neighbor provide a wonderful barometer against which to measure your own friendships.

All told its wonderful programing.

That is all still true, but the reviewers who hint at the waning quality of the episodes are correct...to some extent, the writers period of faltering is evident here, but the episodes that follow this collection show less of the 'faltering' exemplified here.
