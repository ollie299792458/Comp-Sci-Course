The Mary Tyler Moore Show is great.  I was sad when they stopped showing it on TV and was happy to discover that the episodes were put onto DVD.  I bought the four seasons that were available just about all at the same time.  Once I got to the final episode of the fourth season I was left wanting more.  I have been reading about the 5, 6 and 7th seasons just about non stop and can't wait for them to come out.

I have been trying to find out if the last three seasons will be compiled and sold soon, with no success.  I know that the DVD company that puts the seasons on the market look for successful sales.  I don't know how many have been sold and if they are thinking about continuing but I agree with several others who have posted their desire for the last three seasons to come out soon.  So if anyone out there from DVD companies reads these, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE act now!  I think that I am with many people out there in our desire for the magic of Mary to continue!

For those who haven't gotten to know Mary, Lou, Rhoda, Phyllis, Murray, Ted and the rest buy season 1-4 today as that will make the popularity of this series known!
