Do we live in a world controlled by the media ?

This is the question the movie 'Wag the Dog' (1997) is about. The director of the movie is Barry Levinson The movie with Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro playing the main players, is about a presidential election controlled by the media.

At the beginning of the movie the presidant has a sexual affair with a 15-year-old-girl and because there are only some days left to the presidential election, the president instructs Mr. Fix-It (Robert De Niro), a man who works for the president to do something against that. So he goes to a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) and tells him that he has to create an artificial war against Albania, by creating short video clips published on TV of a war againt Albania, to bring the sexual affair in the background.

This movie is a great movie in my opinion because it shows how politics can use the media to controll the public. Can we trust everything shown on TV or written in the newspaper ? Definitely not because there are always people who want to use something for their own advantage (for example money,peoples' agreements or even an election). So who can we believe ? The movie shows that everything can be a lie because even the president can use the media for his own advantage. I think the movie makes a lot of people think about the media. Maybe after seeing this movie the people think more about that what they see and do not believe everything anymore. Maybe they prove and difference things. And because of that I like this movie. It had a positive affect on me. You really have to see it.

But at the end one question:

Is it true that on 20th July 1969 an american spaceship landed on the moon ? Or is it only a fake to get the attention of the whole world ?

See the movie and ask yourself the question again!
