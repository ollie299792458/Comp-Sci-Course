Great Hitchcock film - it is a tad lighthearted compared to his other works and is more so comedic vs. suspensful - but nonetheless a classic and entertaining story with very well acted and written characters and quite charming in a way.

As far as the transfer, I will say there is some disappointment in paying 40 bucks for the Criterion DVD - the extras are a bit thin and even though they did a great job restoring the film, there are quite a few spots they missed that should have been taken out that aren't too difficult to do so either - there's a very obvious scratch early in the film, plus a few of the transitions have abrupt exposure changes that could've been edited out.  And the sound is not top notch - it's not terrible mind you, but it is on the low side - I had my volume cranked up and it was still somewhat low.

Not a bad purchase at all - great film for all ages, but you may want to think twice about shelling out 40 bucks for the CC - looking for alternative versions or renting first would be wise
