I don't own the DVD -yet- but I can tell you about the movie; I'm not that guy that reads a novel before seeing a movie. I never read A Clockwork Orange I know, I know it was sooo much better than the movie. Whatever. In this case however, I have to say that the movie fully failed the book. But how could it be any different? There was so much information in that book I could've never lived my life as a Punk and still could've claimed to. It was, even with the aforementioned fact excellent. Whatever way you can, see it. I'm not kidding you. There are so many movies about the Punk scene and none about Hardcore, which is truely ours. You can argue Punk all you want but Hardcore is fully homegrown. This movie makes you understand that. The footage, man I remember reading about the requests for footage the  thinking, they'll never find footage worth anything. They'll never get footage from bands like Negative Approach, SSD, TSOL, Millions of Dead Cops... at least nothing you haven't seen before -but they did- and it's beautiful. I felt like going out and rioting outside of the Ritz Theater (philly) after seeing some of that. Especially seeing Harley Flanagan explaining the build-up of Bad Brains "Take Over" and the power of the NYHC scene. I can't tell you about the flick too much, if you're anything like me, your eyes will be pinned from start to finish... especially with additional footage.
