The Lost Boys shows me something different every time I watch it.  Perhaps I was oblivipus my first time out, perhaps TNT cut portions, or perhaps it really is that myriad.
There is so much that can be said about detail in this film, tiny little cues that spin your perception of the story in wholly different directions than it has ever gone before.
The elated grin on Star's face as she presses against David in the race scene, the tiny scrap of Beauty Has Her Way as the black clad vampire leader watches her return to him, and even the Echo and the Bunnymen poster on Sam's wall (not to mentions millions of other tiny details) all aid in a new sense of scope as slowly you take them in.
What's more, there are the upper, superficial layers of the film to revel in.  Just sit back and relax while the abject sillyness of the Coreys makes your gut hurt with suppressed laughter, enjoy the (apparent) absolute mindlessness of the fight scene, and try not to be nauseated during the feeding(unrealistic? yes.  evocative of more gory images?  also yes.)
The last (I swear, the last) comment I absolutely must make follows:
The Lost Boys is an incredibly easy movie to feel.  Not that it is emotionally trying in any real way, bt in that there is something more than tangible, perhaps even more than visceral about the film.  The plot is believable, not in that I believe in the supernatural, but that in many (if not all:  note the Frog brothers) of the characters respond to stimuli presented in such an absolutely honest way that it worries one.  Are there vampires right down the block?  The howling motorcycles, the missing persons flyers, the predominance of odd people in my neighbourhood - am I living in an haven for the undead?  Even the most rational people could easily find themselves looking over their shoulders when walking the dog after dark.  Especially people who live as close to Greenwich Village as I do, pardon the phrasing but that place must be crawling with vamps!
