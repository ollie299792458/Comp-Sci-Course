This film does not work on any level.  The acting is, at best, adequate.  However, Fanny Ardant fails entirely to capture Callas' studied refinement and, when attempting to show Callas as carried away with the music, Ardant appears more drunk or stoned than concentrated.  And, this is to say nothing of her senseless and distracting accent.

Jeremy Iron's character of the impressario is a cliche of a homosexual.  And this is to say nothing of his senseless and distracting pony-tail.  Joan Plowright's character is just unnecessary to the film.

The musical sequences are the only somewhat redeeming aspects of this otherwise tedious two hour affair.  The rest of the film is just sloppy: the clothing is not in keeping with the 1977 setting; the Mercedes which chauffers Callas through town is a 1980's model; the operatic scenes are truncated, such as the end of Act II from Tosca, from which quite a few lines of music are eliminated; even the "Japan" concert to which the film refers many times was actually a London concert.

Zeffirelli claims the film to be in honor of his "friend" Callas.  Sadly, it operates as an insult to her dignity and artistry.
