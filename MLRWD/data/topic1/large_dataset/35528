I don't think there's any question as to whether this movie deserves a high star rating. After all, this is THE classic rendition of A Christmas Carol, featuring Alastair Sim as the definitive Scrooge. A perennially aired film in the holiday season, the only question is: Is it worth owning? While one can only answer that for oneself, I can say this: If your answer is yes, this is the edition worth owning.

A great dvd package begins with a great movie, then ads special features worth viewing, and then tops it off with smart packaging. This "ultimate collector's edition" does all three perfectly. First of all, this is a two-disc set, giving the viewer the option to view the film in any of a number of forms: restored 4x3, restored 16x9 for widescreen viewing, the colorized version, or the 1935 version of the tale ("Scrooge," starring Sir Seymour Hicks). The special features include commentary, a featurette on Dickens, and a before and after restoration comparison, to name a few.

The packaging is expertly done, as well, with a nice plastic case within a cardboard slip-cover, so you know the discs are well protected (unlike some multi-disc packages that feature overlapping disc-holders, which drive me batty).

The picture looks fantastic, and the sound is crisp and clear. The one thing I would fault this dvd for is the look of the subtitles. Perhaps it was only due to my dvd player, but, when testing them out, they were a strange red that came out fuzzy and hard to read (like when a television is getting bad reception), even given the black-and-white background. Overall, though, this is an outstanding restoration and repackaging of the classic film.
