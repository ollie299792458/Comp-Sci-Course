Like George Lucas's Star Wars this is the film that defines Milius as a director and goes a long way to explain his lack f success in Hollywood. After making this film Milius was submitted to the barrage of abuse not unlike the one directed at Don Siegel after Dirty Harry. Production values, archetypal approach to character and narrative (Shadow of Joseph Campbell's book Hero With a Thousand faces that was the basis for Star Wars as well as Schrader's Hardcore. Another source for this film was Mircea Eliade's The Forge and the Crucible : The Origins and Structures of Alchemy). This is a film that belongs to a different age of Hollywood. Also compare Schwarzenegger's inability to express anything but grunting and strain when he is not paired with a great director like Milius, Cameron or a Verhoeven.
The score by Basil Poledouris is one of the best ever written (Compare to same composer's score for Starship Troopers).
To end with a quote by Conan himself: Conan, what is the most important thing in life? Conan: Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, hear the lamentation of his women!
