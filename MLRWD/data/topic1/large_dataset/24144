I am in no way a big fan of romantic comedies, but I found myself buying this film anyway. I had heard plenty of good things about the film (that I was very skeptic about)and these are two actors who I've got quite a bit of respect for. Most movies don't really get me to laugh. We're lucky if you even get a smirk out of me. Yet I found myself sitting on my living room floor laughing harder than I have in a long time. Now as for why I like this film:

There's something to be said for acting without speaking and Ryan Reynolds has this down. His facial expressions can tell some real stories.

I'm a fan of "The Office" and seeing Oscar in this role was a real treat despite how awkward it  was at times. But awkward in a funny/good way.

Betty White is her usual adorable self. I can't think of anyone else to replace her.

Sandra bullock did an interesting job of making an evil boss lovable.

The location was interesting. How many of these movies are set in New York or the Bahamas? Not this one.

No sex scenes. As odd as it is for an 18 year old to say, "I hate sex scenes," I do. I want to watch a movie with my mom and not feel extremely awkward. Plus I find it really annoying when two people who hardly know each other are jumping into bed the first chance they get. I wouldn't really call that "Romantic". It just comes off as a cheap way to sell a movie. This movie had NONE of that.

And it isn't extremely predictable. I like to predict endings just from previews and I thought I had this one nailed, but 30 minutes in, I began to wonder if I bet on the right horse.

Now this isn't the kind of movie that's going to win awards for special effects or best musical number, but there's something about the simplicity that makes it all the more enjoyable. It really manages to stand on it's own.

Even my dad, "Hater of anything not made in the 70's," was laughing with us.

You'll see what I mean if you decide to see it, and I hope you do.
