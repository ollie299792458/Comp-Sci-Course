I found myself in the mood for both a classic "chick flick" and a visual introduction to the novels of Jane Austen; so I rented this movie to watch with my fiancee. She enjoyed it, but I think I liked it a lot more. I'm old enough now that I can enjoy movies like this, but I certainly would not have appreciated or enjoyed it 10 years ago when still in my late teens.

If you are a man looking for a reason to watch this movie, here's one. It stars 3 people who later became Harry Potter professors: Emma Thompson (amazing actress who played Professor Trelawny and also co-starred with Will Ferrell in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LXH0AE">Stranger Than Fiction</a>), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape who is famous for playing villains in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LOL0">Quigley Down Under</a> - it is weird seeing him in this unusal good guy role), and the woman who plays Professor Delores Umbridge, whom we all love to hate in the Harry Potter movies. Also there is a small role for Dr House before he was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009WPM1Q">House, M.D.: Season One</a>, cranky even then because his character was married to Delores Umbridge! And in case you are worried about watching this movie because you hate Hugh Grant from his typical clean-cut British loverboy roles like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAL">Nine Months</a>, don't worry about it. He still plays a clean-cut British loverboy in this movie, but he is actually sort of likeable here. It also stars Kate Winslet from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMJG">Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

I am not going to get into the plot of this movie because you can find that anywhere. Suffice it to say that I enjoyed this movie so much that now I want to read Jane Austen's books.
