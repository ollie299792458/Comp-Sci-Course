This is a superb album from Stills and Nash, with a little bit of Crosby thrown in for commercial reasons at the insistence of Atlantic boss Ahmet Ertegun.

It harks back to the first, pre-Young, album, where nobody was in any doubt that this supergroup was being led by the supremely talented Stills - who offers perhaps his best-ever tune here in the form of "Southern Cross". The haunting, sparsely arranged title track is another highlight, along with more uptempo tracks such as "Too Much Love To Hide' and "Since I Met You" (The cut featuring the obligatory for 1982 guest appearance by a TOTO member - Jeff Porcaro on drums, in this case).

Nash's contributions are comparatively lightweight, as usual, but they are still fine and rank amongst his very best. "Into The Darkness", in particular is full of fire and passion - I wish more of his songs were in this vein. Those who have labelled it 'filler' are surely unaware of it's subject matter. Crosby himself has said that he is grateful to Nash for "caring enough to write it".

This album was also a significant commercial success, landing in the top 10 and yielding two top 20 singles - "Southern Cross" and "Wasted on the Way". Highly recommended.
