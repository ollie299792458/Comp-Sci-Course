The late 70s and early 80s was such a fantastic time to be a kid at the movies - the experience of seeing of "Star Wars", "Close Encounters", "E.T." and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" on the big screen was exciting beyond words.  For me, though, one movie from that period stands a head and (broad) shoulders above the rest: Richard Donner's "Superman: The Movie".
Warner Brothers deserves applause for their TLC lavished on this previously-neglected classic.  Begone with the murky, faded pan &amp; scan abominations - we now have a pristine, colorful transfer that finally restores Geoffrey Unsworth's gorgeous widescreen cinematography.  And if that wasn't enough, we also have 9 extra minutes of (quality) footage, trailers, deleted scenes, screen tests (yeah!) and three new documentaries to boot.
And for Superman fans like me, the documentaries and screen tests are a treasure to behold.  Thank God for Richard Donner - it's scary to think what "Superman: The Movie" could've been without his reverent, loving vision of the comic-book legend.  The new interviews with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder are insightful and often hilarious...  Ms. Kidder, in particular, is a delight.  It's impossible to imagine anyone else as the Daily Planet's intrepid reporter.  Three cheers to Lynn Stalmaster for his dead-on casting!
Although it would've been nice to see a special edition of "Superman II" as a companion, I certainly won't complain.  I'm just happy that 20+ years later, "Superman: The Movie" is just as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it in theaters.  From the destruction of Krypton, to the famous helicopter rescue, to the earthquake-disaster climax, "Superman" is a marvelous piece of cinema (and American pop culture, for that matter).  I don't think I'll ever outgrow it.  Add "Superman: The Movie" to your DVD collection today!!
