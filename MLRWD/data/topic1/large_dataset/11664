The Road Warrior is a classic action film and the movie that first demonstrated what a star Mel Gibson would soon be.  Filmed in Australia by George Miller, this sequel to their original film, Mad Max, is a post-apocalyptic demolition derby.  It was created before the dawn of CGI, and all of it's stunts are for real, and breathtaking; particularly a stunt where one of the road predators is thrown end-over-end out of his crashed vehicle.

The Blu-ray version of the movie is brilliant, the film probably never looked as good in it's initial theatrical run.  There is no comparison between the Blu-ray and DVD images.  The colors and detail in this HD presentation are spectacular.  There are moments in the film where the focus is somewhat soft on the edges, but I suspect this is a flaw in the principal photography and not the new transfer.  The night time scenes in the middle of the film weren't a solid black, but had a little noise which I again attribute to the original negative, considering how good the rest of the film looks.

I definitely recomend this Blu-ray for any action movie fans and fans of this film series.
