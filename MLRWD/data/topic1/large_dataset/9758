Scotland, Pa is a modern view of Shakespeare's MacBeth.  In saying this, the watcher must understand that Scotland isn't exactly what Shakespeare had in mind, yet it is a sassy, imaginative, outstanding version of the classic work.
 Creatively portrayed, "Mac" (short for `McBeth', not `MacBeth') is a young man working at `Duncan's' fast food joint.  He feels underappreciated at his job, as most do, especially when he wife, Pat McBeth, is continuously reminding him of just how undervalued he is.
 James LeGros, director and star, draws fascinating parallels between the antique MacBeth and the new age Scotland.  In Scotland, Mac throws out a couple of obnoxious teens about to cause of food fight at Duncan's.  This is supposed to simulate MacBeth's heroic battle fight in the beginning of the book.  Another replication would be of the Weird Sisters.  In the book, there are three witches prophesying MacBeth's future.  LeGros' vision changes the witches into three pot smoking teenagers (one being Andy Dick).  The idea was very creative, I must say, and it really works.  Mac accidentally stumbles upon the high-as-a-kite kids at a mysterious carnival and upon entrance to a fortune telling booth, he receives stories of his future.
 The fabulous creation of Scotland is made possible by an all star cast.  The director casted himself as Joe "Mac" McBeth, and did a wonderful job.  He really was able to recreate MacBeth's emotions throughout the work.  ER's Maura Tierney portrayed "Pat McBeth", or Lady MacBeth.  Her charismatic performance enhanced the movie's carriage.  Tierney particularly shined during the scenes where she thought there were burn marks on her body, caused at the scene of Duncan's murder.  Crazed and pathetic, Tierney carries Ms. McBeth strongly until the end where she severs her own hand.
 Scotland begins to climax once Banquo realizes the mischief the McBeth's are creating.  Banquo begins to point the finger at Mac, Mac notices, and shoots Banquo.  After piecing evidence together very, very slowly, Lieutenant McDuff has a final showdown with Mac, where, as the book and movie coincide, Mac falls to his death.
 LeGros' fabulously done version of MacBeth is definitely worth watching.  I highly recommend it to all, regardless of any previous knowledge of MacBeth.  One could certainly go in, never having read MacBeth before, and completely understand what was going on.  For those who have read MacBeth before, it is a great way to further your understanding of the classic book, and to see a great twist in LeGros' vision.  Scotland, Pa is well worth the trip.
