Normally, I would have given this movie 2 stars.  The actors did a good job with the script they were given, which wasn't an overly good one.  But, hey, I've seen worse.  The plotline was weak and inconsistent, remarkably unsatisfying.  History was horribly mutilated in this film, however, I was expecting that.  This is, after all, a fantasy, not a documentary.  There still seemed to be some small feeling of wrongness to it, though.

The scene that made me hate this movie as much as I do is the one in which a man kicks a cute, helpless baby kitten into a fan where it is sliced up.  And then another man eats a part of it that landed on his face.  Okay, I know that no animals were harmed in the making of this movie, yada, yada, yada...but that was not just unfunny, it was cruel and disgusting.  I had been enjoying the movie a little bit before this, but could not bring myself to stop crying long enough to enjoy it at all after that.  I haven't been a child in 10 years, but this scene gave me nightmares.  I am an avid animal lover (especially cats--I have nine) and anyone who would script something this horrendous into a movie is depraved.  For this excessive and gratuitous feline cruelty, I would give this movie -10 stars if Amazon provided that option.

This movie is not for the sensitive at heart--or for cat lovers.  (Heck, I know a few dog lovers that hated this movie for that scene.)  If you like that sort of thing, this movie might be just up your ally--if you can stand the weak plotline, horribly written script, and the insane twisting of history.  (The real Wilhem and Jacob Grimm are spinning in their graves, I'm sure.)
