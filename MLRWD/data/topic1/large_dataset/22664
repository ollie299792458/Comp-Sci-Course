Unparalleled cinematography allows the viewer to soar with so many types of birds (primarily geese and ducks), many times at eye-level with the birds. You see, hear and feel the effort that goes into every stroke of their wings as the birds make their way from migratory start to finish. And there are spectacular  moments of serendipity, such as the decoy scene. All these elements equal outstanding filmmaking. The movie stirs the conscience and conscious, too, helping us realize we MUST care for our environment and the creatures with whom we share this planet, without beating us over the head with a zealous ecological message.
  The soundtrack at times lifts you with the birds, and at times is little more than repetetive Euro-pop trash; however, the images on-screen draw your attention more than the music. The narration is sparse and not overdrawn. The concluding song has a haunting beauty that makes me mist over even as I recall it.
  The specs and features listed promise an excellent DVD product. I could watch this film over and over again, and I look forward to owning it on an excellent medium. If you love our earth and the winged marvels with whom we share it, you will love this movie. Guaranteed. If it fails to win for best cinematography at the Oscars, I will be disgusted. It's arguably the best documentary of a season of many fine documentaries.
