I remember that I went to see this film with my buddy in early summer 1982 and we thought it was really scary.  The movie begins with a light-hearted, humorous tone but things get pretty tense rather quickly.  Who can forget that creepy tree right outside the house, the scary clown, the face-ripping scene, and that intense swimming pool scene in the climax.  The film is rated PG and the PG-13 rating did not come around till around 1984 or 1985.  I am sure if this movie was to be released today it would be rated PG-13.  Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams are great as the parents of some very likeable and believable kids.  Their family is so likeable that you really get emotionally involved in the action and their hopes of saving Carol Anne and the rest of the family.

There has been a lot of controversy over who actually directed the film.  Steven Spielberg was the producer while Tobe Hooper was the director.  The movie has Spielberg's fingerprints all over it.  Hooper may have directed the film but Spielberg obviously called the shots.
