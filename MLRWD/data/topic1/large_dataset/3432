I started watching this movie around 11 PM...two hours later, I finally started breathing. The movie was exhilarating. It was probably the most intense movie I've ever seen. The suspense was incredible, the camera work was great (with several Hitchcock-esque shots added in the mix), the plot was nicely twisted. It was a great movie! If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go check this movie out. It had my heart pumping at twice my optimal heart rate from the first minute of the movie. I can't really give any of the details of the movie away, because it would really ruin a lot of it. Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins were the perfect choice for both characters. I really wish I could say more about the movie, but this is the type of movie that would be ruined by knowing too much. Don't even read the cover of the movie
A few words of caution: this movie is not for the faint of heart. However, if you think you are partially faint hearted, just don't watch the first 5 minutes...which (at least for me), was the most disturbing part of the movie. There are several scenes of violence, and there is blood, but the violence isn't what makes this movie so intense..it is the suspense. The camera angles and the film score make the movie almost unbearable when it comes to suspense. I could have shared my seat with several other people because I *only* used the edge of it! There are many, many "jump scenes" (scenes that make you jump out of your seat), despite what Screenit.com says. The language isn't great, but it isn't horrible either. There are a few incidents of foul language, but it is fairly isolated.
I give this movie a thumb's up, but I can definitely think of better times/locations to watch it (I had to drive home at 1:15 AM after watching it...). I would prefer to watch this movie in broad daylight in my own house with a large blunt object in my hand.
