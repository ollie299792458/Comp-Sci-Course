This is a great colorful wonderful film, with a new translation that comes much closer to the Italian language original.  I have seen in many times in the theatre and own both the original VHS and the Laserdisc version.  When the newest (2002) dvd version was released I bought it immediately and was astounded at finally seeing it a fully restored and newly translated version.  There is a wonderful flow to this film, despite what sounds like an Italian dubbed soundtrack, many times the voices do not sync up with the visuals, but this is minor.  The color is sumptuous, the story intriguing and haunting, and the characters hysterical and very memorable of the swinging 60's.  If you find credibility stretched because Giuletta is shorter than her sisters and mother, go with the flow.  While the plot and denoument is not what would be called "profound", this is especially wonderful for the portrait of an old-fashioned Italian house-wife amidst a philandering husband.
For a fascinating comparison, see Michelangelo Antonioni's magnificent "The Red Desert" of the same year and essentially a similar concept of dislocated housewife amidst the debris of modern life.
