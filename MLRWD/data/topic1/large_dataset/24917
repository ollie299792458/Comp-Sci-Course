Robert Deniro fans certainly know this movie. Many others don't. I would say this is one of his best roles, as good as the character of Dwight that he plays in another unfamiliar classic, This Boys' Life. Deniro is cast as Rupert Pupkin, a pathetic celebrity wanna=be who finally unleashes a sinister plan to get his stand up comedy act on television after all legal attempts fail.Sandra Bernhardt is excellent as Pupkins' partner in crime and Jerry Lewis is at his best as Jerry Langford, a Johnny Carson style late night talk show host who has become weary of the trappings of the celebrity life he is forced to live. The viewer is reminded of past DeNiro characters such as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and even Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull because the explosive nature of the character threatens to be revealed at any moment. Pupkins'continuous hounding of Langford is funny and disturbing at the same time. Look for a cameo appearance by director Martin Scorcese. This is a film that will keep you guessing until the end
