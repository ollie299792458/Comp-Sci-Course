Ok, I've sit here and read all the reviews posted by the ladies so I thought I'd chime in with my 2 cents.  I saw this movie on a date last night and while it was not unwatchable, it was closer to putrid than good.  I'm generally a guy who doesn't mind a good chick flick but it at least has to make sense which is something that the Wedding Date did not do.  As a matter of fact I felt a bit patronized by the whole thing.  First off, am I supposed to believe that Debra Messing has to hire a date under any circumstances?  Not on this planet.  However if she were going to hire a date, it most certainly would be someone other than Dermot Mulroney.  I'm mean, give me a break, the guy played Dirty Steve in Young Guns and I think that role was more suited to him.  Secondly, she is pretty stand offish toward him one minute.  The next thing you know she comes home drunk and jumps his bones.  All of a sudden its true love.  Its almost like some vital scene got left on the cutting room floor.  There was no lead up to Debra falling in love, there wasn't even a single key scene where the audience was given any inclination as to why she suddenly falls in love with a gigilo.  The lone bright spot in the movie was the character TJ played by Sarah Parish.  She had some great lines and stole every scene she was in however her scenes were far and few between.

Ladies, if you are lucky enough to have a man who is gracious enough to watch a chick flick with you, have mercy on the guy and go rent something like Love Actually or even Little Black Book.  Of course, the next weekend, be nice and take him to see something blow up.  It keeps us sane.
