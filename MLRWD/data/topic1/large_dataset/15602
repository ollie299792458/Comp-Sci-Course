One of the greatest, and most accurate war films made, yet little known by most English-speaking viewers. An army reserve unit is mobilized to man the fortified Mannerhiem Line, in the early days of World War II. The characters express all the usual concerns about the coming ordeal...and then it happens. The Soviet Union launches a massive armored onslaught against Finland. Despite Finland's lack of manpower, equipment, and supplies, they devasted wave after wave of Russian assaults. Finland had better-trained soldiers, repelling hundreds of thousands of expendable communist conscripts. In the years before, wisely foreseeing the inevitable conflict with the communist power to the east, Finland had a series of fortifications built in advance, and the Finns utilized these to maximum effect! This film portrays the frontline combat very well, but the entire war had various fascinating perspectives that should also be portrayed on film some day. To get a greater idea of the conflict, read the book, "A Frozen Hell" (which I have also reviewed).
