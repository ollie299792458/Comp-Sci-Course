Obviously there's going to be nothing wrong with the animation quality when the product in question was produced by Madhouse, and I think the plot is described in enough detail. One thing of value to note, however, was that the English dubbing was not terrible. There are plenty of 'otaku' who will purchase this product only to play it on subtitle mode, but I'm saying DON'T! Though it took a little getting used to, I found the English cast every bit as competent handling their roles as a voice actor.

It's true; this anime fell into some usual dubbing pitfalls such as minor characters done better than the major ones, but Raki sounds like a wimp as he should, and Clare generally turns out just as well as the Japanese version. Though it may seem like characters seem a bit too old or just slightly out of place, they all seem much better at making the more emotional performances and luckily Claymore is the place for emotional performance. All in all, I found myself loving Claymore even more after experiencing the English dub, even though i usually prefer subtitles. Though you may not share this particular opinion, I think that only using the Japanese setting would be a shame, please enjoy!
