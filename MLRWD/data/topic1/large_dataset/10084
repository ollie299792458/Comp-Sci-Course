I wanted to see this movie based on the preview of it I saw before watching another movie. However, the preview of what the movie's about and what it's actually about are 2 different things. The basic premise is a social worker (Zellweger) gets cases of abused children and works with the families to bring them together or remove the children from the home. Then she gets an intriguing case of a little girl who's parents are very strange and almost threatening when she meets them.

She talks to the little girl who seems terrified and knows she has to get this little girl out of that house and away from her parents. One night the little girl calls her, she races over there, and something pretty horrific is taking place. Parents arrested, little girl now has nowhere to go. So Zellweger takes her in until she can be placed in a good home with a good family.

As the movie goes on, we see that the little innocent girl isn't so innocent at all. I won't say much more but the previews made this movie out to be a good paranormal type movie where a negative spirit is somehow attached to this little girl who follows her. It's not. There's definitely underlying factors and undertones but it's more of a creepy little girl we learn isn't as she seems.

It's a psychological thriller on a somewhat supernatural level and is still a decent movie. But if you want to buy it thinking you're going to see shadows, things moving on their own, strange voices, and the unseen scaring you more than what's seen.. this isn't it.
