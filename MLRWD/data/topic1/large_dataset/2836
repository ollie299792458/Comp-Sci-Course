Sean Bean is great as both the lead and main character. This movie is a must for any fan that is looking for a Sean Bean collection. The movie follows the book very closely, which makes for a very great entertainment. A must watch for the escape and evasion of Britain's finest military professionals alone. Gripping, exciting filled with real life type of situation. The actors display a grace under fire type of attitude even during capture that is for the military personnel to exemplify. Following the failure of just about everything, from poor intelligence to lack of communication this movie shows exactly how rough it was to serve in the military during the 1980's. An Grade A example of why the military spends so much money on equipment today. Which makes it a must for any historian or military "buff". The locations are very well scouted and whole military attitude is very accurate. Very well written both in book and movie. If only it could have a bigger budget to expand on some areas and added little touches. The gun fights are nothing to winch at but, lack the extreme effects and graphic (to date) to make you feel you are there.
