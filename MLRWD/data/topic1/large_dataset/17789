Look, I appreciate that this film (1979) is based on a stage play (1836) that is highly regarded by critics, but it's hard to tell why judging from this film alone (or even from reading the play, whose reputation is such that it's actually included in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393971430">The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces (Expanded Edition)  (One-Volume)</a>).  The original play was left substantially unfinished at the time of the author's death, so what you see here is Herzog's (controversial) sewing-together of various plot elements, not to mention his chronologication.

If you're unfamiliar with the material, you'll be beset by questions until nearly the end, and Herzog's direction careens from heavy-handed to indecisive throughout.

As for Kinski, I'm not sure if he actually had any ideas for the role other than staring bug-eyed at the camera.  He's far more compelling in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305972761">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ODHV">Fitzcarraldo</a>.
