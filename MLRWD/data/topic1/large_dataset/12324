Santa Rosa is a typical American town and the Newtons are a typical 1940s American family.  The father loves plotting elaborate imaginary murders with the quirky next door neighbor.  The mother is a housewife obsessed with egg whites and slipcovers.  The children are off-beat cherubs.  At the beginning of the film, the oldest, a young woman named Charlie played by Theresa Wright, looks forward to a visit from her favorite relative, her mother's brother - Uncle Charlie.

When he arrives, the happy reunion chills when Charlie suspects that her Uncle Charlie might be a serial killer known as "The Merry Widow Strangler".  Uncle Charlie is all the more menacing given his physical beauty and his trusted position in the family.  We prefer our monsters to be ugly, recognizable and locked outside our homes.  
As Charlie becomes more convinced of his guilt, her uncle plays on her love of her mother and fear of scandal to convince her to keep his secret.  The audience realizes that Uncle Charlie must kill his niece long before she does.  Hitchcock's picture of goofy familial normalcy and the audience's growing awareness of danger from within builds the tension to the very last scene.
This movie is one of Hitchcock's best psychological dramas.  The story is tight and fast paced.  The black and white cinematography enhances both the sense of post World War II ordinariness with bright, sunny scenes of family life and suspense heightened with bright lights and dark shadows.  Point of view is crucial to the telling of this piece.  For example, Hitchcock allows us inside Charlie's head the moment she realizes the truth.  The camera pulls back and up abruptly like a swift intake of breath.  The casting is superb with Theresa Wright, Joseph Cotton and Hume Cronyn.
