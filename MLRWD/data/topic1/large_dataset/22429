The ultimate edition dvd I just bought and promptly received has the Sly Stallone commentary thank you very much,one of the most underrated actors in movie history.Lefties love to wax cynical about him for political reasons.

Any actor who becomes his character inside-out and outside-in,who puts in all effort required before and during production,that kind of extreme method actor is the genuine article and rare.Especially back when most actors were wimps or egomaniacs--wait until you here what Sly reveals about Kirk Douglas,WOW!

No,Kirk Douglas didn't make it into the movie.THANK GOD!

Sly's feature length commentary was excellent,very insightful and humorous.Great anecdotes..He did engage in some ego-tripping for a moment ridiculing a supporting actor who only did what he was told.But then Sly went back to being more humble and appreciative.

I have to disagree also about this one brief scene that Sly apparently hated,which provide a stark contrast between what a Green Beret is vs the weekend warriors pursuing him.I didn't think this contrast was comical,I thought it was essential...Yes,as Sly put it,there was two different movies for a moment,by design.The director wanted to show what a farce this story could have been without a divinely inspired director who was definitely on Stallone's side all the way..This contrast made Stallone's character more real.

Feature length audio commentary!Accept no substitutes!..Thru the commentary you get to watch a favorite movie from someone else's perspective,which is almost like watching the movie for the first time.And you learn stuff that you would have never known without the commentary...This is what really distinguishes dvd from vhs.Feature length commentary from cast and crew should be mandatory on all dvds with great movies on them.
