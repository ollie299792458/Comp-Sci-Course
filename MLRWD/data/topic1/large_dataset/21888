as most of them are written by disgruntled buyers of the maligned Season Sets who don't actually own (or appreciate) the Dragon Box.

This Dragon Box release is what fans have been waiting for FOR YEARS. I never wasted a dime on the Ultimate Uncut Editions or Season Sets on the outside chance that Funimation might come around and redeem themselves with a product like this. So for me, at least, I'm excited to see my patience pay off. I am elated to finally revisit this part of the show and to finally see it uncut (and uncropped).

The picture is as clean as can be expected from a 20-year-old, hand-drawn anime. No loss of detail or over-saturated colors. The Japanese audio is rightfully the default sound setting. I had hoped that Funimation would record a newer, more faithful dub for this release-- but alas, the dub track is almost a word-for-word re-enactment of the same horribly-inaccurate script from the show's original syndicated run in the mid 90s. But if you prefer the Japanese audio anyway, the dub track is just a bonus. The loathsome dub music track, thankfully, is absent altogether (though some people take great offense to that, for whatever reason).

Overall, I can't stress enough what a quality release this is. If you've been holding out on buying the Season Sets like I did, don't hesitate to buy this. If you already own the Season Sets and are looking to upgrade, you should definitely consider buying this. If you already own the Season Sets and just choose to be bitter about the very notion of this release, well... my condolences.
