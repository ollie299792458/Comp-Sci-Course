One Magic Christmas  (1985)  Mary Steenburgen, Gary Basaraba, Harry Dean Stanton

Rated G.

Tagline: Miracles do happen.

It's not a very happy Christmas for a family who's bitter mom has lost her job. She's a cynic and has always disliked the Christmas holidays. The bills are piling up, their house is facing foreclosure, and she's falling into  depression, among other tragic things that are happening.
Whatever was left of her Christmas spirit has seemingly been lost for good.
But her six year old daughter, a very special young child, knows a little something about the true meaning of the holiday spirit and has an unshakable faith in the season.
Heaven notices and dispatches a guardian angel named Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton)  who is the damnedest looking angel I have ever seen.
That's when the magic begins.
This is an overlooked classic. It's not typically light Christmas fare yet it is a Disney film.
It has a dark charm that's all its own, however it's ultimately warm.
Warning: this film seems geared to older kids and adults for some reason and may be a little too serious for very young children to appreciate.
