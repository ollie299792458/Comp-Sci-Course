What TREMORS is to me is a superb equivalent to 1981's AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. Both are sharply written monster flicks, superbly written with plenty of shocks, surprises and tongue-in-cheek humor. The only difference is the rather graituitious use of graphic violence and gore in AWIL, while TREMORS is remarkably restrained on the violence.
Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are perfectly cast as two independent cusses who work in a small town in Nevada. When they hear of rather gruesome demises of three people nearby, they freak and try to get out of it, but the unknown foe has blocked the road with a huge boulder. Meanwhile, odd seismograph readings are showing lots of seismic activity to a visiting student.
The two return to town, where the foe has turned out to be four oversized worms with a voracious appetite for people who can feel the vibrations of the people above ground and snatch them up. The result is scary, suspenseful, and downright funny, including an episode with a trigger-happy couple (Michael Gross, Reba MacEntire "Reba") who refuse to retreat from the hungry worms, now termed "Graboids."
If you're looking for a hardcore sex-and-slash-'em-up gore flick, this is not for you. If you're looking for entertaining horror flicks with light violence and profanity, then this is definitely for you, but don't get the two sequels. They're campier as they can get.
Rated PG-13 for profanity and light violence.
