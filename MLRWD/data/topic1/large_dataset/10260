First off, the film is just OK and probably best enjoyed by people touched by a bit of nostalgia from seeing it in their younger days.  There are plenty of really cool (and sometimes hilariously cheap) special effects such as the psychedelic color shifting skies and the Landmaster vehicle, but other than that, the story falls very short and it all ends up feeling like a made-for-TV movie (especially the lame ending).
The Blu-Ray was really disappointing to me mainly due to the visible compression in the dark/blacks as well as in the orange sky transformation scenes after the bombs drop.  Normally Shout! Factory does a pretty good job on their releases, but this one just doesn't look good at all, and it's very disappointing to see a Blu-Ray with these digital artifacts.  It would be expected on DVD, but in the HD realm I don't expect to ever notice issues like this at all.  I was probably looking a little deeper into the video issues because I just simply didn't enjoy the film that much, but fans of this might not let the mild compression bother them at all since this is probably the best this film has ever looked on home video.  It's just a shame that this release couldn't have been authored better with some higher quality video.  The extras were pretty entertaining, especially the interview with the designer of the Landmaster vehicle.  So, if you're a fan of the film, get it!  If you're not sure, rent it first.
