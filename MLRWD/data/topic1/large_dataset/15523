What we've all got to realize, and this is something Greenwald's documentary doesn't really go into, is that Bill O'Relly, first and foremost, is an entertainer.  From his days at Inside Edition he's never been able to report any real news, only cookie cut snippets that he can put an ideological "holier than thou" slant on. While shoving his big fat Irish finger in people's faces, he condemns and demonizes most of his guests, which look on with confused wounded eyes and are caught unaware of O'Relly's unrestrained contempt.

But this seems to be Fox News's whole routine as well, might sells right.  Fox sells slanted news to right wingers who feast like flies, and condemn their own interviewees when they disagree with the ideology of the studio.  So why do we watch?

Because it's not only entertaining, and it is revealing.  Perhaps the scariest part of Fox is that it does accurately appeal to a certain section of officials and ideologues in this country that have been underground since the Clinton years and have surfaced like wounded animals flailing at every idea and person that contradicts their own barbaric, religious beliefs.

In one segment, a female reporter tells George Carlin, "Well, that isn't what the religion I was raised into says."  Okay.  A broadcast journalist actually injecting her own religious beliefs into an interview, and then condeming the interviewee for not agreeing.  How can the FCC tolerate this?  How can any democratic mind tolerate this?

Outfoxed is entertaining, and will prove as testament to the madness of the times.  I just wish it was a little longer and had better outtakes.
