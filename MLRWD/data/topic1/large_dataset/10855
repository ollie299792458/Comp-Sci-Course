This is one of those classic kids' horror movies that can also scare adults who are anxious for the safety of the young hero.  It can also mesmerize them in wonder by the elegant, effective, and highly creative way that the director handles what could have been a trite or hackneyed subject in others' hands.  Although this film was shot on a budget it is hard to find any scene that would have been better if more money had been available.  In comparison I found the Harry Potter series may have the latest fabulous effects but that this simple story forms a more entertaining and stronger connection between the audience and the hero.

My daughter likes this film much more than the other kids' thrillers that I've bought for her such as "Something Wicked This Way Comes," and "Witches."  Although those are also excellent films the Lady in White combines the haunting mystery of Gothic tales with the realities of having modern serial killers, while also providing moments of comic relief for both children and adults.
