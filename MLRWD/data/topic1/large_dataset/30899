This movie is what we all should be moved by. I watched this movie for the first time on 06-15-05. I was moved to a point that I have a completley different outlook as well as perspective on life. This documentary moves you into seeing the inner you. The footage that you see is really spectacular, but....

It's more than the waves, it's more than the beauty of Tahiti, more than the great lakes of Wisconsin, even more than the shipping channel of Texas. It's about a journey of life. This documentary on surfing is very touching. Thank you to Dana Brown for bringing such a magnificant video into our generation.

I am very impressed by the time and energy spent making this video. So much so that I have taken a back seat on the opinions I have about my future and life. There are some movies that you just watch, then there are movies that are life changing. This is that movie. You will be amazed....

I have never touched a board in my life. I know now that I will.
