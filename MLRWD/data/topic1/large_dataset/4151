This and the following shorts have to be one of the best set of characters to come out of Dream Works. The storyline is original yet familiar... A misfit boy who finds friendship in the most unlikely of places... Hiccup was a viking-- though not much of one, according to his tribe, and especially his father, Stoic. However, he was brilliant, and he learned to use his brains and his heart instead of his (non-existent)brawn, proving to everyone that the dragons were not their enemies-- but could be their best allies and friends. The voice actors on this did an amazing job--- and the animation was just brilliant, and the writing came across like a classic novel. I loved it, my kids loved it... we watch it over and over as a family together. Hiccup is Jay Baruchel (Dave of "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"), not Christian Slater, ha ha. I was CONVINCED until I saw the end credits that he was... but it's brilliant and hilarious-- and you have to check out the "Legend of the Bonenapper" and "Gift of the Night Fury"... I hope they make more!
