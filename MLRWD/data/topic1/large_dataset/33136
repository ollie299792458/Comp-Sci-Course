First of all I have to say I love Beverly Lewis.  I have read all her books and was so excited when I heard about this movie based on her book "The Shunning".  I loved the book so anxiously anticipated the movie.

The movie was good, but I would probably have liked it better had I not read the book first.  I thought the story line was a little off from the book which was a little disappointing to me.  As for the movie alone, I enjoyed it.  We watched it as a family which is always a wonderful thing.  Unfortunately there aren't many good clean movies out there so we have a hard time finding movies to watch.  This one fit all our parameters.

Katie, an amish girl, engaged to be married to the town Bishop and in love with her childhood sweetheart who she thinks drowned years back.  He tugged at her interests in the outside world, music, guitars, the Englisher way of life.  The Bishop, however, is a widow with children who need a mama.  In the midst of all this, an English woman comes looking for Katie's mama, who becomes afraid of past secrets being revealed.

This movie is full of twists and turns, suspense, love, and trouble.  The only thing this movie is missing is a sequel which I will be looking for.
