The 28th of December 2009 was the day I discovered "(500) Days Of Summer". A friend and I were trying to get tickets for "Avatar" but there were only sold out shows...so we ended up watching this little movie which I had heard nothing about...the movie began after the trailers and the "Fox Searchlight" logo played, and as anyone who has seen the film already knows "The Author's Note" appeared on screen...and it was from this point on that I knew I was about to experience a completely different type of movie...A story of girl meets boy...but not a love story. I have since seen the film 4 times and have grown to really appreciate the structure, entertainment value and the narrative, which is not linear and jumps around, but it holds a sense of dreamlike "reality" as the film is really just a collection of Tom Hanson's (the main character) recollection of a one sided relationship....and the non-linear approach of the film works wonderfully because in real life a person's memories of any event are not in chorological order but tend to jump around as we think about the events which happened. The film is filled with pop culture references to movies and music, such as "The Smiths" and "The Pixies" and a very small band called "Spearmint"...even Han Solo is part of a stand out moment in the film. As for the story itself...well any guy or girl who has been in a "relationship" where the other person does not feel as strongly and sees it rather as a "friendship with benefits" will completely relate to this film. The story is presented in an honest way and from the start and there is no overtly saccharin sweet promises like you would find in the majority of romantic comedies out there today...you can simply sum it up as "boy falls madly in love, girl does not...but wants a no strings attached relationship which she knows would go nowhere"...and it could be a vice versa story...it doesn't matter whether you're a girl or a guy I think the viewer can relate either way...this is the universal beauty of (500) Days, `coz it doesn't matter whether you're in China or India or some small place in the world, someone somewhere has experienced a story like this in their own lives. And if you appreciate film and cinema as an art form you will love some of the camera techniques and choice of shots the director used to tell this story...split screen works amazingly well as a pure cinematic narrative tool in this film.
Sure "(500) Days Of Summer" is a little independent film..but it's a very different and enjoyably refreshing take on an old subject...If you liked films like "Juno" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", give this one a chance and you may just be pleasantly surprised.
And I won't spoil it for anyone but the last 15 seconds of this film makes it worth the watch alone...
