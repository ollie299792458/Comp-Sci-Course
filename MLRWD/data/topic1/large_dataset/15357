This movie sure delivers! I have the DVD to this and I have to say it's tied with the best of the series along with "Goldfinger."
Roger Moore is no Sean Connery, he will never match up to Connery, IMHO, but he still puts on one of his better performances as 007 in this one.
And he seems to have found his female Russian equivalent, XXX. She has to be the best Bond girl I have ever seen; she was a REAL toughie. Hey Bond, you could re-marry!
And for once, Bond has a cool car which he DOESN'T total! The Lotus Esprit is one of the best Bond cars that ever was! It was awesome seeing it go underwater.
Even though I saw "Moonraker" before this one, I have to admit Jaws is a lot scarier in this Bond movie than the successor. He's up there with Oddjob as best Bond henchman. He sure can take a lot of punch!
Stromberg's underwater lair is probably one of the best headquarters in all of Bond!
Plus, there is a sense of continuity in this which is cool: XXX mentions to Bond his dead wife from "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." We also see another referrence in "For Your Eyes Only."
