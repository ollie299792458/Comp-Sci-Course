I really enjoyed this film.

Unfortunately, it was inhibited by its source material.

The film was very well done, as far as it goes.  Great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and the entire, sprawling cast.

What mitigated the film's power was the fact that it had to stick to its roots as a "true story."

In true life, as in the film, the Zodiac investigation(s) (there were many, all over CA and Washington, DC) were drawn-out, dropped altogether, grew cold and finally resuscitated again.  This fragmented, meandering timeline takes its toll on the film's pacing.

In addition, the "lead" character, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, was somewhat of a schlubby cartoonist.  Oh that damn "truth" again, rearing it's undramatic head.

And finally, after all of those years and lives shattered and man-hours expended on the notorious case, it was never actually resolved.  There was never an arrest in the case.  No justice served up - no satisfactory ending for all of the people involved.

Not exactly the stuff of great fiction.  But then again, unfortunately, the Zodiac killer wasn't someone's fiction.

But even working within these stringent parameters, the film was engrossing and worth your time.  Especially if you enjoy noir and crime drama.  Then I'd highly recommend it.
