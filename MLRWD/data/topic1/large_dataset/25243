I'm not a Brad Pitt fan.  His physical attributes don't astound and thrill me!  But, I've got to give it to him:  He was convincing in his dual roles as the coffee shop sweetie and Mr. Death.  Claire Forlani, whom I've never  seen in a film before was simply luminous.  She's the perfect Susan in this  parable of one man's last days on earth.  Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish  is remarkable, as always.  He truly makes you feel as though he's a man  with little time left and has to spend the rest of his alloted time  cleaning up his act, making amends with his loved ones, assuring his  daughters that he loves them and has always loved them.  Also, Marcia Gay  Hardin and Jeffrey Tambor are both extremely good as the number two  daughter (in her father's heart) and her slightly inept (business wise)  husband.  They're both touching.  I wasn't put off by the length of the  film.  I think we should take the time to savor some things in life.  Slow  down, relax and enjoy this beautiful offering from Martin Brest.  You did a  good job, Marty!
