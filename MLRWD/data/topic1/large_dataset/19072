This musical is my favorite musical of all. Even though I own the entire Andrew Lloyd Webber Spotlight Collection, I watch Cats more than any of the other three. Ever since I first saw this musical for the first time in person in Minnesota, I have remembered it ever since. If you like good performance or simply love great music and dancing, you should see this muiscal. I give it two big thumbs up. I applaude Andrew Lloyd Webber on this phenominal musical. Cats is an expereince you'll never forget. 
Here are the cats that stand out to me in the cast of characters: Rum Tum Tugger (John Partridge):a real styllish, lady cat's man, just look at and listen to him him sing and dance. Munkustrap (Michael Gruber): the leader of the clan and main story teller. Demeter (Aeva May): the most couragous, spirited of all the female cats. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees (Jacob Brent): a real dancer and magician, he brings out all the magic and power of Cats. Macavity (Bryn Walters): the original criminal mystery cat, with all the moves and fire. Bombalurina (Rosemarie Ford): the most leading of the female cats, who's always there in the most exciting of moments. Victoria (Phillida Crowley Smith): the most graceful, royal, exotic and lithe cat on the cast. Cassanrda (Rebecca Parker): the royal, worshiped cat of Egypt.
Oh, and just in case you read my review, Jo Gibb, I send you all my priase and attention.  Nice work.  You looked so great in your cat suit!
