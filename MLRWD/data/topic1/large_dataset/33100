A bona-fide spectacle. Director Anthony Mann, better known at the time for his well-regarded Westerns with James Stewart ('Winchester '73', 1950; 'The Naked Spur', 1952; 'Bend of the River', 1953; 'The Far Country', 1954), Henry Fonda ('The Tin Star', 1957) and Gary Cooper ('Man of the West', 1958), put his best foot forward in this 1961 telling of the unification of Spain in the XIth Century, with Charlton Heston (lost half of my audience right there) at his heroic best in the title role, with Sohia Loren as Ximene, at her most enticing. The factual elements may be glossed over - what historic movie doesn't? But, to paraphrase William Randolph Hearst: "...publish the legend," especially when it serves as good entertainment. Indeed not quite as masterful as director David Lean's two ('The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'), but Ridley Scott - whose 'Kingdom of Heaven' in the Director's edition merits consideration as a contender - and others can well aspire to a similar degree of accomplishment as this.
