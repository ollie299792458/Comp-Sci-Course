I just watched Final Fantasy and it seems to me the creators were, limited by the medium (duh!). We couldn't make the emotional connections because little was rendered; the creators seem relunctant or unable to push the emotions through the CGI faces.  Anyone who has seen traditional hand-drawn Japanese anime knows the lack of emotive expression is not a generic trait; they can shovel those at you in the spades. It looks like the creators (rightly or wrongly) set themselves a technical objective (i.e. realistic portrayal of humans), and then found they had to tone down the emotive range in order not to expose the CGI shortfalls. 
Square is to be applauded for pushing the frontier but it is clear that we are still some way short. Most of the time, it's the lip movements, wooden faces and overly smoothed gestures that gave the game away.  Like other reviewers before, I would to love see a FF sequel in a few years time, the same team given another chance to have a stab at it. 
P.S. The computers had an easier time with the guys (Dr Sid, the Council President modeled on Kofi Annan etc) with their stubbled faces and short hair, then with the women with their more delicate translucent skin and flowing tressess (having said that, Aki's hair looked absolutely fabulous! - she could be in the next shampoo commercial).  Is this a collory to real life where our women folk are generally more complex creatures?
