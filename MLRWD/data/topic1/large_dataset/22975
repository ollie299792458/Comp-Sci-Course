Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls" - While watching this movie I had mixed emotions but continue to be grateful to Tyler Perry for bringing this important work to film.  This film really touches all races of women in a variety of ways.

All Black women are not like and most have not experienced the tragic women portrayed in this work.  However, all of us know someone who is/has.  "Precious" was "exposed" with Black actresses and the Black community screamed at the audacity of showing Black women in those situations. I found "For Colored Girls" as illuminating as "Precious".  I learned something more about the nature of man, albeit horrific, and have a more compassionate understanding of certain personalities.

We are the most multifacted women on the face of this earth.  We, Black women, have experienced every emotional experience known to man and still "We Rise".

The movie industry has shown white (and other races) women in a variety of instances and we have laughed, cried and wondered why did they perform in that particular venue.  Well, now they are showing Black women in that same critical way.  In every movie I have ever seen I have either been simply entertained or I have learned something about human nature.

Enjoy lessons exposed - Thank You Tyler Perry.
