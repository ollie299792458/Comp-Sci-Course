I gave it four stars, this movie was not what I expecting, I didn't here really anything about this movie. From commercials or anything. I saw the MTV 2002 movie awards, and that's how I found out about this movie.
  This movie is about a divorced women, who got
preety much all her money from her husband, who buys this mansion. The mansion has it all, it's got an elevator, huge rooms and bathrooms in each room. Three stories high. And this house has a panic room. A room where you go in, and no one on the outside can get in there at all, unless you can cut throw 3 feet of steel. The women (Jodie Foster)
has a daughter, who has somthing wrong with her,
she can't have her temperature go low at all, or she goes into shock. And one night someone trys to break in there house, because there is money in that panic room. The women wakes up grabs her kid, and trys to hide and move around in the elevator. Until she goes into the panic room. The "break-in" people try and try to get in there... Want to find out more? Watch Panic Room.
  I gave this four stars, great movie, I was expecting either a real bad scary movie, or a real bad not at all scary movie. But this movie isn't really that scary, it's thrilling, but not so scary. I thought this was a  real great movie. The acting was average of 3.2 stars, Jodie Foster did great!
  I would recommend this to anybody who is living, overall I give it a final of 4 stars. Go see it!
