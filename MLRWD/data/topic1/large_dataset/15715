I've read the book and watched the movie I found that the movie was

pretty good, but the book easily puts the movie to shame. The book is

much more detailed and they're are a lot more boxing matches in it. I

loved the book but I still liked the movie, if you aren't big on

reading then you should at least check out the movie.

The movie is about a boy who goes to boarding school and get picked on,

they beat him and even piss on him. Eventually he is taken back to his

grandfather because his mother died. He meets a man named Doc who

teaches him about the world. Doc is a German who because of WWII is

taken to jail. Peekay his a unbiased eye, he is blind to the racism

around him. He visited Doc in jail where he mets Geel Piet a black

boxing coach who teaches him how to box. Peekay ultimate goal is to

become the Welterweight Champion of the World. But to the Black

population in South Africa he is their savior. This movie is about a

mans goal to become a champion boxer, but it is about about the equal

rights of men.
