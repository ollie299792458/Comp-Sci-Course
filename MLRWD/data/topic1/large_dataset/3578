Okay, seriously people. Get over the fact that this movie decided to do something different stylistically. I'm glad Renny Harlin took a different approach particularly since I'm really not that big a fan of the third. (Although to say that is something of herecy in the nigtmare community.)

 Yes, Tuesday is an awful actress, and watching her is painful. But hey, Patricia Arquette was busy and it makes it all the more pleasureable to watch her get burned alive. That's really the only downside to this movie. This is my favorite Nightmare film. Before you get all defensive Nightmare fans, let me explain!-

First of all, the whole scary thing just isn't going to work anymore. We know what Freddy looks like. It's not a shock to see him anymore. Harlin's use of making Freddy the hero and delivering comedy was perfect to add entertainment to the movie without going too far over the camp line.

Yeah, so a lot of people think this movie makes no sense. Ugh...are you serious people? As horror movie fans, are we really that limited in our ability to appreciate the abstract? I am so sick of people saying "I don't get it! Why does she get her friends powers? Why is it so weird?" Okay, I will admit the end with the mirror thing is pretty random, but Alice is the Dream Master. (Uh, thats why its titled that, people.) She's Freddy's opposite and its her job to protect the dreaming from Freddy, so she has this natural power to control her dreams and use the powers of her friends against him. Personally, I thought the change Alice undergoes was pretty cool.

Harlin also does a great job of giving us a dark trippy universe that is perfect for Freddy's Nightmares, and the transition of story line from the Elm Street kids to Alice is smoother than you would expect.

I love the death sequences in this film particularly the asthma girl, and Joey's death scene which is sweetly reminiscent of Depp's scene in the first Nightmare film. Give this movie a break people! (Please)
