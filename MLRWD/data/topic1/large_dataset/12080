First of all, I am seriously wondering if we are talking about the same movie here???  I have the 4-tape set, someone here has said that this is different; I don't know.

I have the Gospel of John, by the same producers, and I think it is FANTASTIC!  This is why I purchased this movie, and also all the positive reviews.  I know I am the only one to say this here, but I was VERY disappointed!

I found the narration (Matthew) was very dull by comparison and really not necessary; it was not 100% scripture as in the Gospel of John.  I lent it to a good Christian friend of mine (who also owns the Gospel of John) and she had difficulty sitting through 30-minutes of this movie, and finally shut it off.

Also, the Jesus in this movie, to me, was WAY too laid back.  I almost expected to see him pull out a joint and share it with the disciples.  Again, I am comparing it to the Gospel of John, which I saw first (maybe that's the problem); the person who played Jesus in that one was a perfect fit, I thought.  Not too serious yet not too laid back.

Sorry to pull this down, this is certainly not the worse Jesus film I have seen (by far), but I was VERY disappointed.
