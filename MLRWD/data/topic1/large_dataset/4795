The film succeeds with me because rarely do I go back for a second viewing (luckily, the rental was for five days). This time I did and better appreciated the twists, turns, and subtextual cues and clues. However, I'm really bothering to write now to sing the praises of the special features section. There is a 71 minute documentary of the pre-production, production, and post-production phases of the film. I'm not now nor ever have been a formal film student, but I can't help but think that the extra contents of this DVD would be invaluable to any neophype. It was fascinating to me and I have only a casual interest in what goes on behind the camera. The commentary by Director Ridley Scott in the voice-over rendition of the film is also informative and frankly rather entertaining. The man does know his craft and his concentration on whatever aspect of the process he is talking about is somewhat riveting. If you seek a near total orientation into the film-making process I highly recommend these sections of the special features.
