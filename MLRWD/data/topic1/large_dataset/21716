Don't let the other critics fool you, Species III is a pretty

entertaining entry into the species series, true it was

to direct to video, but with MGM backing up this installment

with Brad Turner taking the helm, you knew it be pretty good.

Natasha Henstridge briefly reprises her role as "Eve" to the

Species series and gives birth to another alien Sara,

who is the latest genetic alien.

This time around though we got an excellent sidestory about

the halfbreeds, half human, half alien freaks who dont

bother in either class and die out from disease.

Well a couple of more dangerous new half breeders come

out to seek Sara in hopes of using her eggs to breed

a new race.

The acting is pretty good, the movie has some impressive

effects and the movie like the other two sequels is

very scary and gory.

The Special Edition DVD comes with four great featurettes,

which includes interviews with the cast and crew including

the beautiful Natasha Henstridge, commentary and a look

back into why the Species series has been so successful.
