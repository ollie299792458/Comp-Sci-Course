I rented this 1974 recording. The video is VHS quality at best but that is a minor issue compared to the sound. The sound is beyond dreadful. I have been to many outdoor concerts where the wind whips up and the microphone distorts the sound. This recording suffers from way too much of that. I don't consider it a bonus like one reviewer. Perhaps complicated by the recording environment, the singers are recorded way too "hot" causing much distortion. It sounds like a poorly recorded 8 track mono tape in a bad car stereo in well . . . about 1974.

But in spite of all the technically awful aspects one might accept in a historical recording, the artistic part is 5 star great. The singing is wonderful except you have to turn down the home theater speakers to avoid distortion in anything beyond mezo-forte sections. But even at low volume mono, listening to Ms. Cabale sing Casta Diva is great. All the performers, chorus, orchestra, cinematography, were 5 star.

From reading other reviewiers, this may be the best we can get now. My wife and I enjoyed this Norma because the performance was so great. But we enjoyed it in spite of the  technical flaws.

Until amazon allows different types of ratings, the 5 star artistry is brought down to three stars total by the 1 star technical production (particularly audio). I could not recommend this to someone who expects home theater quality but could for a Bellini or bel canto fan who wanted a historical recording of Norma and will put up with bad audio. Not sure? Rent it and see for yourself.
