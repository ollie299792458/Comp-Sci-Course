I'm a veteran New Yorker saw this film when it came out with my older brother. Talk about changing my life. I lived it. Yes the gang scene in the late 70's was bad. People fighting over nickel and dime turf. It was a tuff and gritty time in NYC. This movie caught the magic of it. Now New York is a yuppy paradise with Mall stores all around no true character left. Which can be a good or bad thing. It was nice to see some of my friends grafitti coming off in the film. As the band Interpol says in the song NYC "the subway she's a porno" fits this movie. It amazes me how much its changed in 25yrs.

  The movie really shows how New York was. Minus the pantomines and kooky costumes. It wasnt until the late 80's that the Warriors graffiti piece in coney Island finally was covered.

 Now the actor who played Ajacks was on Sex in the city. The female cop who busted him was Mercedes Rhule. Its always good to see actors first low budget films.

 If you want to see a fun movie with great cinematography see this film. No gore,a little blood the way a film should be made unlike today with all this CGI graphics.

 Relive New York in its Mayor Beam days when it was a rotting decaying apple. Where affordable Manhattan living was available
