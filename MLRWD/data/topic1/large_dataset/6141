Just to throw in my two cents worth. This Doctor Who spin-off TV show story actually needed Doctor Who, not just Jack's references to the "Doctor." Yes, I kept thinking Doctor Who was going to have to show up and save the day (figure out what the heck was going on). It was well beyond Jack Harkness' abilities. This weird, nearly impossible tale of no one actually dying business must be some strange alien technology, say Dalek, Cyberman, or even Time Lord (the Master or even the Rani, remember her?). The effects of no death but endless health care of the human population on economics and materials was interesting.  But the cause is never fully explained other than that a few mafia or illuminati families are using it. Yes, I know Jack had some old history with them but it made little sense nor gives an explanation of how. Who or what placed a tunnel through the Earth. "Magic" blood, really. The "good guys" were loosing right up to the end, stressful to watch week after week.  Fearing the worst.  And this story was disturbing. "Death" camps and ovens in England!???  Surprised the BBC would allow it to be shown in the UK.  The solution was more like Nazi Germany, well beyond "1984" or "Brave New World". Other reviewers here explain well the problems with the writing, characters, and plot in general.  But some people liked "Miracle Day".  This less than par season might spell the end of Torchwood for good.  Though I hear there may be another season in the works.
