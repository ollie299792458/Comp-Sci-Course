King's literary magnum opus should probably never have been translated to the screen at all; the book was a peculiarly psychological masterpiece. Now that we have the gift of perspective, we can see that Kubrick's eerie "take" on the story was likely the best "shot" possible.

  This TV-adaptation is an enormous disaster. Aside from the wretched miscasting (on every level!), this "film" literally rapes the book without ever capturing the slightest hint of the book's brilliance. The performances are grippingly awful and contrived (by Weber, especially). The "special effects" (all of the hotel phantoms are painted like cheesy dimestore Halloween ghouls?) are a joke--one is prompted to LAUGH at these "touches."

  King may have crammed more elements of his actual "plot" into this film adaptation, but the method was sheer madness. What's the point? An awful film. Poorly acted. Horrendously scripted. Despicable cinematography, too! A bracingly BAD and desperate piece of miscalculation. Cheap. Unconvincing. Ludicrous.

  Quite fortunately, King's book remains a classic. This "vanity film" is mind-bogglingly dismal, and an insult to the book. Kubrick really came the closest possible...in his adaptation of the wrenching psycho-piece. What possessed Stephen King to put forth this hacked-out mess is beyond me. (Mr. King, don't mess with stuff if it even comes REMOTELY close to your admirable work).

  Honestly...read the book. Stay far, far, far away from this failure. King is one of our true American treasures as a storyteller, but he has consistently failed to find film-makers with the unique vision required to "screen" his stories. Of course, 'Carrie,' 'Misery' and 'Dolores Claiborne' are some exceptions from this prolific and much loved genius, as is the rather watchable 'Storm of the Century.' Everything else has been brutal. Good grief. This rendition of "The Shining" is the lowest, given the material at hand. Almost unspeakable.
