Okay, let's face it...Tarantino kicks as usual, Clooney takes a different turn by PUTTING them in the ER for a change,
Keitel got soft here, Lewis is OK, (but still not my dreamgirl),
Trejo is the man again, the dude with the "Assault on Precinct 13" t-shirt has come and gone, but the flick is still on the shelf in the "kick ..." section!!!!
 Must confess, the concept of the Gecco Brothers on the run is far more interesting than vampires, which have been reused and reabused for the last million years!!!!! Still loved it thanks to the double DVD including "Full Tilt Boogie" (aka "The making of From Dusk Till Dawn")  See this flick !!!
Just as much as I'd ... to see a prequel of Reservoir Dogs showing the fouled robbery, I'd ... to see a prequel of this one showing the Gecco Bros demented  killing and hostage spree.
Oh by the way, ramblers.. leave Dusk 2, 3, 4, and any other ... on the dusty shelf, right next to "Pay It Forward" and "Scream 2, 3", maybe even "1" !!!!!!!!
