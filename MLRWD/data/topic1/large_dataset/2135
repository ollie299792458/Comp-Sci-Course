I went to see this the second day of it's release. I was torn about going to see it because part of me felt Michael is being exploited but if I had been able to see his concert I would have so to me it was my own way of paying homage to a creative genius. It goes without saying I will purchase this DVD. It was really amazing to hear Michael sing live, and I hope at some point the soundtrack to the movie is made into a CD. To hear Michael singing live just added a totally different depth to him as an artist. I found myself finally coming to terms with his death while watching the movie and I realized we will never get to hear any new material from this man. That's what makes it bittersweet to me. Bitter because he is no more, and sweet because watching him preparing to grace the world with his performance was so mesmerizing. I always felt Michael was a sensitive human being, but after seeing and hearing him practicing, I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been if he had been able to complete this work. I know there will be tons of things released about and by Michael, and if you have been a true fan, you have all the great material anyway. At this point you will only be replacing things. Get this DVD though because this really is it...and just think..you had a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes to see a genius at work. RIP Michael, and we love you too.
