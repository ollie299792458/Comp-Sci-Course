The is the best pick for all Apocalypse Now fans, whether they be new ones, old ones, or are simply rediscovering this classic historical fictional account of the Vietnam War.  It's all here: the original 1979 version, the 2001 redux, commentary by Director Francis Ford Coppola, special features, scene selection, multi-languge subtitles, etc.

Interestingly, the best scene (in my opinion) was not included in the original version.  This is called the "French Plantation."  This scene is so good that I must have watched it a dozen times.  Apparently, it was edited out of the 1979 original version, for unclear reasons, but possibly just to limit the sheer length of this film.  It is indeed a long film, but every minute is well done and fascinating.  The French Plantation scene reappears in the 2001 redux version.  "The Complete Dossier" is a good buy just for this scene alone.  It explores many of the controversial issues surrounding whether or not the US should have been involved in the Vietnam War, the role of the Viet Cong,the Russians, the North Vietnamese, the South Vietnamese, and, most importantly, the Americans.

Great quotations from the movie: "charging murder here is like giving out speeding tickets at the Indianpolis 500."  "I love the smell of napalm in the morning: that gasoline smell...it smells like..........victory!"  "Horror and moral terror are our friends: if they aren't, they are certainly enemies to be feared."  "Charlie don't surf."  "There are two of you: one that loves, and one that kills."

At times horrifying. At times funny.  Always thought provoking and interesting.  One cannot understand the Vietnam War is one has not seen this movie.  Buy it.  Watch it -- more than once.  You won't be disappointed.
