This movie is worth watching for John Malkovich's part alone.  He plays a psycho --- but one with some depth and one that has a past that some would sympathize with.  He is an ex-CIA hit man who, by his own words, was changed irrevocably by his government work.  I love this one part of the movie where he tells Eastwood's character (I'm working from memory so this might be more of a paraphrase than a quote), "I don't even remember who I was before they [the U.S. government] sank their claws into me.  . . . But we can't have monsters running around in the fields, can we?" (This last part is a response to the CIA's attempt to kill him).  In short, there is complexity to the villain that makes the movie so much more interesting.

I am a big Eastwood fan, but even so, I'm not sure this was his best part (hence the 4 stars rather than 5 of my review).  I don't think his communications with Malkovich were all they it could have been.  I compare this to the movie FALLING DOWN w/ Robert Duvall & Michael Douglas, where Duvall is the good guy and Douglas is the "villain."  In that movie, despite the fact that Duvall is determined to get the guy, there are some parallels between him and the Douglas character that even he recognizes. In other words, the villain is portrayed in such complexity that there is some aspect of his character for Duvall to relate to.  The same should have happened in this movie, but Eastwood didn't work that angle, and it's a shame because doing so would have humanized his character even more.
