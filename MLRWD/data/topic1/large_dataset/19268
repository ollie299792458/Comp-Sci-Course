I agree with the reviewer who said that this movie will probably be more enjoyable to people who love war movies rather than people who love horse movies. While not overly gory, the movie pulls no punches about the conditions of war. It was hard to see horses mistreated (yes, we cried), but one of the saving graces of the movie was that there were characters who loved horses and tried to help them.

What I loved about this movie was that it was not the usual Hollywood crap that is passed off as a "family" movie. There is a lot of substance here--family bonds, the bond between an animal and a human, and history. My 10-year-old (the war lover) really enjoyed it, while my 12-year-old (the horse lover) did not. However, both had a lot of questions and a lot of opinions about the situations in the movie. In my book, the good "family" movie is not necessarily one that everyone enjoys and wants to see again, but one that is rich in plot and details and will stimulate family discussion afterwards. (Note: I wouldn't take kids younger than 9 to this movie, it is too violent.)

The scenery and cinematograpy were beautiful. Benedict Cumberbatch was also beautiful, but unfortunately he didn't stick around too long.
