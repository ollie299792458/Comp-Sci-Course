Carmen is an excellent example of what an Opera can be when major talent is assembled.  The acting is as good as the voices; the music is excellently played and beautifully incorporated into the choreography and direction.

It is the best Carmen I've seen - but here's the kicker:

The direction in this movie is some of the best.  Reds are prolific and really bring home the heat - the red clay - the passion.  Don't miss the change in color when Carmen dies - it is subtle, but suddenly things are not so red.  The life drains from the palette as it drains from Carmen.

Personal:  I was looking forward to seeing Domingo in this movie.  He is wonderful.  Carmen, however,  has always been a Maria Callas to me: black gypsy hair, mature, mysterious, sure of her power and faintly cruel in her use of it.  I was stunned to see Julia Migenes at her first entrance.  A freckled redheaded hoyden Carmen was my ideal by the end of that first scene.  What a difference the interpretation of Carmen makes to the entire story.
