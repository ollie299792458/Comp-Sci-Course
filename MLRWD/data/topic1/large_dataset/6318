So I had it on dvd, now I have it on blue-ray. Love the movie and still do. The main reason for this purchase was the picture, which is very crisp and comparable to the rest of my blue-ray library.

This product has quite a few extras: Some fun extras. Some tedious: the alternate film wake up Ron Burgundy... pedestrian. Some senseless, purposeless, and crass for the sake of crassness alone: the commentary sounds like Will and the director filling time talking about anything but the movie. I listened to the first 5 minutes, then skipped ahead a few chapters and each sample had less to do with movie than the last. I usually get a big kick out of commentaries. This commentary was no more than a ruse so they could print "commentary" on the cover of the box. People who like commentaries: hold no false hope for some behind the scenes insight into film making motivations, the creative process, or style of direction. Not included. It wasn't even funny... maybe that is the joke...

I would have happily given up most of the extras to save some clams. My main squeeze and I split the cost, otherwise I would not have paid more than $19. Knowing what I know now about the "quality" of the extras, I would have liked to have waited for the price to drop, or found a used copy.

Value: $12 for 1080p version. $17 for fluff.
