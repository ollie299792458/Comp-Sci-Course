Just to give you an FYI.  I got the 1st season of Dead Zone with the booklet that goes with it, but to my disapointment, it had 2nd season discs in the box set.  When I went to check the lineup for the 1st episode online for the 1st season, it should have the title "Wheel of Fortune", that's the one when Johnny wakes up from his coma, and not "Valley of the Shadow" (from 2nd season / 1st episode).  And the 1st season should have 4 discs in the box set not 6.  I don't know how a box set titled for first season got mixed up with second season discs in this set.  Who dropped the ball on this one when the box set was made?  I am making arrangements to return it because I have the second season box set (black box) that I ordered from another vendor via this website.  Heads up to the vendors:  double check your packages and your info before sending them out to your customers.  But be prepared to prep up refunds and returns.

Thank you,
