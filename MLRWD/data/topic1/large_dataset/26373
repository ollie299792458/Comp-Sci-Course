I agree with those who complain about the constant video cuts.  Constant.  You never get a shot of anything for more than 2 seconds.  God, how I hate music videos like this.  ACDC Thunderstruck was the same way.  I gave that title away after only browsing it for 10 minutes.  It sucked.  So does this.

Luckily I didn't purchase "Death on the Road," and I certainly won't be buying it having watched it.  Well, actually I didn't watch the whole thing.  It began to make me sick and I developed a headache.  After making sure the entire thing was the same tripe, I walked away.

Concerts ARE NOT like this.  The whole object of going to concerts IS TO SEE THE BAND.  To watch them perform onstage.  Iron Maiden is chock full of top-o-the-line musicians and performers.  And they got chopped to bits with the editing.  Iron Maiden doesn't need stupid editing.  They are the real thing.  Just let us watch the show, man.  Get out of the way.

This is no complaint against Iron Maiden's music.  I've been a fan for 25 years.  They should go back and redo this, all the footage is probably still whole.  Make a version for those of us not on Dilantin or PhenoBarb.

I still love Iron Maiden all the same - just thank God I was able to preview this without having to blow my hard earned cash.  I wouldn't keep it even if it was given to me.  I certainly wouldn't ever watch it again (not even partially).

I own tons of concert DVD's and VHS tapes.  Many of them fall into this same retarded trap.  Somebody get that fool out of the processing room!  Even if it is Steve Harris!
