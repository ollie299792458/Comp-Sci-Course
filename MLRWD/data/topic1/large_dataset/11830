I can uneq... Uniquiv... Unequivoc... I can Actually say that "This is the funniest movie EVER MADE in the history of movies about people without horses". That I can also say that, "they use coconuts and are searching for something" is a plus...

If there is something missing in your life, (or if you need to allude to that fact for legal matters),
This is the Movie For YOU!

I highly recommend that you get this Movie and watch how uncomfortable the "Stars" were in those big, metal hats...

It brought me much joy to learn that those snobby, English, semi-funny actors who relied on big metal costumes were actually NOT having fun all the time.

My ten dollars towards this movie was incredibly well spent. I knew this as soon as I learned that the making of this "Masterpiece" was not so much all "Fun and Games" as I had originally thought.

While watching the "out-takes", as they call them, I noticed that there was a moment that John Cleese was neither smiling, nor funny...
What a jackass he must be to not appreciate the "Charmed" life he is having at all times.

It is for this reason that I highly recommend the "Holy Grail, Special Edition"...

It is funnier than my recommendation.
