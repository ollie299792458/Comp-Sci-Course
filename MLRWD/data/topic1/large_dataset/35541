This is a great restoration of a 60's era WWII action thriller. I love the story  of how the restorers were able to fix the color timing, in at least one sequence in the film, and reinvigorate the dialogue from the beginning sequence memorably acted by Richard Harris. The only copy locatable for a long time was one in which British censors had replaced the use of the work "bloody" (apparently a terrible profanity in England) with the word "ruddy" about ten times in Harris' only scene in the film. The restoration was definitely worthwhile because this is an absorbing and exciting tale about bravery, duty, honor, redemption and forgiveness, as well as one in which lots of Nazis die violently.

For the most part I liked the ensemble cast, with the strongest performances given by Anthony Quinn, Irene Pappas, and Anthony  Quayle. These actors are able to convey lots of character and emotions with little dialogue and character development in the script. The rest of the cast gives good workmanlike performances, especially singer Darren as a Greek/American street tough. I  won't ruin the plot for viewers, but I was able to figure the rat in the piece very quickly, and this should have been engineered a bit more subtly, with suspicion cast on others before it became so obvious, so quickly  into the  sabateur's entrance to the film. Otherwise, this is a 60's era WWII action film well worth two hours of your time.
