This movie is so good, it's about a cop that was murdered by a gang and takes revenge on them after getting turned into ROBOCOP. The Criterion Collection has the Director's Cut which shows a few more violent bits, as when Murhphy's arm gets shot off and a few more shots of him getting blown away and the director's cut shows two different camera shots in two scenes ,1)The scene where Murphy shoots bobby in the leg, the camera is zoomed in and 2)The scene where Clarence gets stabbed in the neck, the camera is zoomed in to his face for a few seconds. The most violent bit is probably the scene where Kenny gets blown away by ED-209 in the beginning. The Criterion Collection also has two trailers, the theatrical trailer has "The Terminator" theme in the background for some odd reason and Robocop 2's theatrical trailer has the original Robocop theme in the background(Robocop 2 trailer is not on Criterion Collection). The Criterion Collection has 3 storyboards, one is a film-storyboard of Kenny getting blown away and the other two are unshot sequences(one is a cemetary scene and other is chase scene). It also features an illustrated essay on making of Robocop and great Audio Commentary by some of the makers of Robocop including the director. I'll give Robocop the director's cut a NC-17 rating but I'm 15 and it probably wouldn't qualify for an X rating. This movie is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made. It has a good plot and a violent theme about revenge which makes this movie so good and makes it even better than "The Terminator". The Criterion Collection of Robocop is a great DVD to buy if you're a Robocop fan or a Sci-Fi fan. 10 out of 10.
