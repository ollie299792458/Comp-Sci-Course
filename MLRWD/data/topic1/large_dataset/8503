This movie is a 'must watch' for anyone directly involved in the criminal justice system, or for that matter, any citizen that lives in our great country.  It will make you play closer attention to what happens in our courtrooms and prisons.  On May 6, 1993, three 8-year-old boys bodies are found murdered and mutilated.  There is panic in the little town of West Memphis, Arkansas, and the citizenry is wanting/demanding quick results and arrests of the culprits.  The search centers on three teenagers, Jason, Damien, and Jesse, who wear "dark clothing" and listen to hard rock music.  The follow-up investigations lead to questions about the blood work and the lab results, and there is 'a coerced confession' from Jesse in question, a borderline retarded boy.  Over the years, many questions have arisen, and the case needs to be re-examined by seasoned, objective detectives.  I suggest that everyone watch this movie, or others like it, so we never stop scrutinizing our criminal justice system.  Watch this one, or read the book, and you too will find yourselves working as amateur investigators and forming a definite opinion about the innocence of the accused...or not.
