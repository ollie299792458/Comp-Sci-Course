While the movie had some interesting plot twists the fate of the only sympathetic character,Sally, given that her parents and husband are twits, is left "undone". Not to give away the whole plot but long suffrering Sally needs a break and at the very end of the movie her mother, after promising to give her that much needed break to help free her from her otherwise very unsatisfying life, tells Sally that her clairvoyant said she shouldn't give her a break. Do we really care about the fate of the other main charachters, Sally's husband, mother and father? I didn't. And with Sally's fate left high and dry I didn't care about the movie, except that I had spent an hour and a half watching and expecting some kind of conclusion for the only character worth caring about. Perhap's Woody was leaving room for a sequel so our angst could be satisfied. Don't bet on it. I really think that movies that leave you wondering if some DVD authoring editor somehow forget to include the last five minutes of the movie should come with a warning: Please be advised that there is no conclusion to the fate of our protaganist in this movie. You will be left with a very unsatisfied feeling.
Woody, you can do better than that!
