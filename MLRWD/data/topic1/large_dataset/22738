As I write this review on the anniversary of the launch of that fateful mission, I am reminded of how I felt during this tragedy. I was a teenager with an eye towards the sky. I had watched every launch I could since Mercury. Landing on the moon seemed so easy after Armstrong and Aldrin. It was hard to find out even when they would land let alone find coverage. We were all distracted by Vietnam. Little did I know, nor did anyone, that this, not the landing on the moon, would become, as Gene Kranz, the flight director, said, "NASA's finest hour." This movie captures the mood of the time and the joy of that moment on April 17th when radio contact resumed after re-entry.

This is an excellent ride, as one of the astronauts once said.

Here's an interesting footnotes from Wikipedia:

Grumman, the maker of the LEM (lunar excursion module) sent a bill for towing to the North American company, the maker of the command module. North American, jokingly declined, by saying that their accountants priced out a towing fee for the LEM for past missions to the moon. The LEM was the crew's lifeboat after the accident that crippled the command module.

Ironically, stirring the O2 tanks may have prevented a worse tragedy. A level gauge failed early into the mission causing ground control to doubt a reading. So, the frequency of stirring the tanks was increased in the hope that the gauge would clear, i.e., function again, or that the cause of its failure could be determined. Increasing the frequency also upped the risk of failure of the heater. Based on normal stirring, the accident would have had a greater chance of failure later in the mission when there would have been less provisions to ration Â¯ sometimes luck throws some English your way.
