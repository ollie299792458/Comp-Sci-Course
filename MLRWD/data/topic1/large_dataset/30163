Let's just say I am glad I did not see this movie in theaters because I would have been embarrassed by the tears streaming down my face...and that is a VERY rare occurrence for me.  It was just a greatly crafted film, which I have not been able to say in a long time.

This movie gives a moving and eye-opening view of an event that I feel not too many people are aware of.  It also shows the evolution of group think how it can escalate into horrific acts.  It also shows that there are different types of strengths in the world: the strength to stand up for your rights, the strength to tell the truth, and the strength to raise awareness.  These are all hard things to deal with and yet we see women, who are seen as insignificant, showing their own strength in a trying time.

Besides the various messages I also felt the acting was superb.  It was not overblown and yet simple things as a smile or a hushed tone of voice could convey so many things about the character and give a look into the lives of these characters.  It did not need fancy effects or a multitude of fancy angles.  The few there were really did draw your eye to the actions that were going on and focused you on the emotions of the people during the stoning.

This movie covers so many themes and ideals that as someone in the education field I can see it being used in many different classes.  I know I am planning to get a copy and spread the word to my friends.
