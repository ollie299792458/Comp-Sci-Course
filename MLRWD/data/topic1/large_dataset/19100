It's hard to believe anyone could build a feature-length story on a song and come up with something this good. But writer Romeo Mueller and producers Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. did just that.

This story of misfits finding their rightful place in the world is just the Christmas tale solitary children the world over need to hear. Its beautiful and subversive message feels all the more heartfelt because we receive it through the delicately hand-wrought images of stop-motion animation. There's something especially touching in the craft behind the images: you can feel the resonance from the touch of each person who posed these figure, frame after frame.

A beautiful story, a wonderful early-60s design aesthetic and a talented group of voice actors make this feel as important today as it did when I first saw it in 1964.

This edition features a reconstructed broadcast version, including all the original scenes, plus additional material added a few years later. Most importantly, it restores the original "We're A Couple of Misfits" song to its proper place. It was replaced with a song considered more suitable (about seeking one's fortune rather than embracing one's true self), "Fame and Fortune," after the initial broadcast; that material appears in the DVD's extras.
