Whenever a movie takes itself seriously, and acts as though it is going to deal seriously with a scientific subject, then I expect them to have the basic science down. This movie was profoundly dissappointing.  I would give them a F minus for the extreme blunders in the science.

The movie begins with a high school boy with unaided eye in Virgina Beach, VA noticing a strange star that is actually the comet and asking his teacher about it.  What?????  Where are the world's professionals?  There are thousands of people world wide who search the skies with good telescopes for comets, hoping to find one so they can get it named after them.  And a boy at sea-level, looking up through the entire atmosphere, in a light polluted area, is the first to see it?

The astronomer freaks out when his computer shows a projected impact with earth, his ISp is down, so he and races in his vehicle down the mountain so fast that he has an accident?  What's the big rush?  It won't hit for over a year and a half.  He can simply telephone, or wait a bit for the ISP to come back up.

The USA gov't keeps it secret for over a year???  No leaks??  No one else in the world ever looks up???

A manned spacecraft with only a few nukes to destroy the comet?  Cheaper and better chance of success to send several smaller automated ships with lots of nukes.

There is a scene where an astronaut is on the comet's head and is jumping up and down on a stuck probe to free it.  But he should be in microgravity and will only weight as much as a feather.

And the stupidity continued in scene after scene.

Armeggedon was stupid too, but it didn't pretend to take itself seriously.  I viewed it as a kind of comedy so I don't come down so hard on it.
