This film is a more realistic, less mythical retelling of the legend of King Arthur, set at the end of the Roman occupation of Britain in the 400s AD. In this version, Arthur is a half-Roman commander; and his knights are men forced to fight for the Empire. They are on one last mission before the men will gain their freedom and Arthur will return to Rome. Guinevere is a young warrior woman fighting for her homeland whom they rescue during their mission. When the Romans plan to abandon Britain to the invading Saxons, Arthur must decide where his home really is, and if he will fight to defend Britain.

I can't really commend on the historical accuracy of this movie, because I am not that familiar with this era. However, it is an enjoyable action-adventure movie, and I imagine what innacuracies there are would not be noticed by most people. I never saw the original theatrical version, but I am guessing most of the added material was in the battle scenes. The additions made it more realistic (I'm assuming most of the gore was not in the theatrical version) but at the same time the battle scenes were a bit overly long. The story is very different from traditional version of the legend, with basically all the mystical elements removed, as well as the characters being quite different. I personally enjoyed the changes to Guinevere's character, since she is not always portrayed so favorably in many versions of the story. I liked seeing her as a strong warrior rather than a damsel in distress. Anyway, the film is pretty much an imagining of what could have really happened if the legends of King Arthur were based on real happenings. I'd recommend giving this film a try if you're looking for an action-adventure movie to pass a couple of hours. Overall, it's an enjoyable, although not spectacular, film.
