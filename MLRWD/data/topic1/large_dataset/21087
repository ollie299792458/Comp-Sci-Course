I did not see View from the Top in theatres because of the bad reviews. When I finally saw it on dvd I was very surprised.
It's a wonderful movie. I use to be a flight attendent, and  could identify with Gwyneth Paltrow's character  wanting to find a new direction in her life. With the exception of the more outrageous comedy moments in the film, I thought it was a pretty close to what flight attendents go through. Of course it not 100% accurate. It's a movie not a documentary. I think the reason this film did not do well at the box office was because it was pushed to look like another Airplane movie or Naked Gun. I watched this movie with a open mind and I thought it was great. The supporting cast was very good. Mike Myers is a hoot! Give this movie a try, and don't expect a screwball comedy. what you will find is a sweet warm uplifting film about someone who does not sit around on their rear feeling sorry for themselves, but someone who is scared, but still finds that inner power to get up and follow their dreams.
