A friend and I have recently over the summer decided to engage in a commentation marathon of every classic Disney film. One film a night for as long as it lasted. Alas, we have recently entered the horrible rut of less-than classics such as the over-acclaimed arabian adventure "Aladdin". So, we put together a little award show as the last step of these classic viewings.

For best movie we were tied at three classics:

-Sword in the Stone

-Aristocats

-Alice in Wonderland

When it came down to the decision: it was tough. I picked on consistant enjoyment. Although throughout the viewings "Alice" had captured my eye as #1, in the end it had too many dead parts and a view mediocre songs. Aristocats and Sword in the Stone was one of the toughest choices to date. Aristocats fell short only because of ONE incident of realitive deadness. The characters in Sword in the Stone are just lovely, and though the ending is very dissapointing, it prooves to be the #1 Disney Movie of All Time, in our humble opinions. Not a dead moment, a wonderful cast, timeless characters (especially Merlin and his sidekick of the late man who played Archimedes). Musical number enjoyment and overall timelessness awards this a true classic.
