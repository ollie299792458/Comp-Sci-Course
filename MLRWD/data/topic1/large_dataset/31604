I've actually agreed with a lot of what Leonard Maltin has said in his reviews, but I'm not sure how he came to the conclusion he did on Taxi Driver. And just who exactly are "we"?
But on to my review. For  those who haven't seen Taxi Driver yet, they must. Other than the different  fashion styles, Taxi Driver could easily have been filmed today. It's still  so fresh and new, it hasn't aged a bit. Everybody in the cast gives career  preformances, and though it's one of Marty's earliest work, his style is in  full effect.
The film lets Travis Bickle speak &amp; act for himself.  It's non-judgemental and non-exploitive, a fact that might make people  uneasy. Sure he's not right and sure he'll do it again, but that's the  point. There are many, many Travis Bickles out there. Travis flipped out,  and he will flip out again. And the reason why is answered by the newspaper  clipping towards film's end. The most disturbing thing, might be, in the  end, you love Travis. He has done wrong, very wrong things, but you love  him anyway, and actually agree with what he does to rescue Jodie Foster's  character.
An important, landmark film. And probably one of my all time 5  favorites. Great DVD to boot. Be sure you pick up the Special Edition,  though.
