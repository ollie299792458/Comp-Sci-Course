After starring in such great movies as The Protector, Ong Bak, and Dynamite Warrior, the very talented martial artist Tony Jaa is back for Ong Bak 2: The Beginning. Now, Ong Bak 2 was meant to be a prequel to Ong Bak, though I cannot see anything that connects the two films, save perhaps in a karmic sort of rebirth sense. Usually that would drive me nuts. Not in this case, though. That is to say that this film stands on its own, with wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, an great overall visual experience, an epic adventure, and a story of a tumultuous life caught between one's spirituality and youth and voilence and the man one has become due to circumstance (karma). The Protector and Ong Bak 1 were by far my favorite Tony Jaa films. Now I have to add Ong Bak 2 to that list, as it is a no-holds-barred fight fest, full of phenomenal stunts (Tony Jaa does his own stunts, like a young Jackie Chan...only better, much better!), and good cinematograpy. If you are into martial arts movies, epics, foreign film, etc, then you should probably give Ong Bak 2: The Beginning at go. And don't worry about watching part 1 first. It's not necessary. Definitely recommended, but not necessary.
