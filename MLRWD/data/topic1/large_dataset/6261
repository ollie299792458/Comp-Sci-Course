Being an avid horse lover and, more so, a big fan of Vig's, I was at the store the morning this DVD went on sale. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially the scenery shots. I think Viggo was very appropriately cast for the part of Frank Hopkins. It's refreshing the way he gets into this role, from the way he speaks Sioux to the way he handles the weapons (knives, guns, etc). His horsemanship really shines, and the scenes where it's just he and Hidalgo (TJ) are almost magical. Sure there are lots of "pushing the limits" parts, such as Hidalgo winning the race despite his injuries, but HEY... it's an adventure movie! Think of "Indiana Jones"... how many of those scenes were believable? I caught myself laughing out loud during the scene where Frank is about to be "de-gendered," which leads me to my next thought... I hope that Viggo takes on at least one light-hearted character in the future. Not necessarily a Chris Martin role, but a role where he can show off his genuine nature for having fun. Overall, I'm very happy with the outcome of this movie, despite what the critics said.
