The beauty of life is magnificently captured in legendary director Pedro Almod&oacute;var's latest international sensation, "Volver." Almod&oacute;var is known for his quirky, fascinating and extremely moving films that appeal to all people of all cultures. "Volver" is his best film to date, and it is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

I was truly touched by "Volver." The cast is absolutely amazing; for those of you who are not of Hispanic or Spanish origin, it's important for me to stress how much of an icon both Almod&oacute;var, Carmen Maura (Irene), Pen&eacute;lope Cruz (Raimunda) and Blanca Portillo (Augustina) are. This cast, and the director, are the best that Spain, and the international film scene, can offer.

The story is so moving, so adventurous, so captivating that, if I were to disclose even one small tid-bit of information about how the movie begins or how the plot develops, I would be revealing too much. You will have to trust me when I say that this is a powerful movie about the bonds that form between generations of women, women struggling with life's many trials and tribulations.

Seeing this movie released internationally has truly been an amazing experience for all people of Latin heritage, as the prowess of the Spanish film scene is finally being revealed.

If you ever had a doubt about watching "Volver," remove it from your mind, and watch "Volver" now!
