I bought this when it came out also. I'm a Metallica fan from the 80's. I'm a Slayer fan from the early 90's. Been an Anthrax fan since 1988 or so. Megadeth? I never got into them for some reason. But guess what? When I watched the DVD's (in chronological order), I was totally blown away by Megadeth and Mustaine in particular. Totally blown. I became an instant fan after this.

My quick review?

Anthrax: Solid show but nothing spectacular.

Megadeth: Reviewed above.

Slayer: Something was amiss here. The crowd seemed to have been sapped by Megadeth's performance. Or maybe it's because Araya can't head bang anymore due to his neck surgery. But still a solid show.

Metallica: Cheesy. Corny. I can't explain it. When I watch the DVD from Seattle (And Justice For All from Binge & Purge), I see two different bands. What gives with Lars' toy drum kit? It's Charlie Watts! Hammett impressed me big time. His playing has improved so much in the last decade or so. I miss Newsted, too. James? His voice is shot. He can't sing the old tunes the way they were sang years ago. But they put on a very good show. They just aren't the same band I once knew.

Overall, a very well put together set. I bought the deluxe edition with the CD's included back when it came out. Then, after getting a Blu Ray player and an HDTV, I sprung for the Blu Ray version of this.

`Nuff said.
