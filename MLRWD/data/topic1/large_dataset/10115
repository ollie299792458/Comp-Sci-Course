Ha ha.  I've read some of the reviews of this movie and laughed.  People who thought this was a romantic comedy and got disappointed, good!  I was just the opposite.  My wife turned this movie on while I was fielding some email, and I would peek up every now and then to see what she was watching.  My wife is a big "romantic comedy" and chick flick lover, so when I saw Ben Stiller, I zoned out thinking it was probably some crap like "Along Came Polly".  But then I saw that Stiller was playing the "annoyed guy" role and started watching more, then laughing, then launched IMDb and saw that it was a Farrelly Brothers film and started to get into it.  My wife went to bed halfway through it and I continued the movie in the bedroom and laughed my butt off!

Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Now just because it's a Farrelly Brothers movie, didn't guarantee that it would be a good or funny movie.  They've got some bombs in their catalog.  But "Heartbreak Kid" is definitely a 4 out of 5 stars.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say it's a 7.5.  Not great.  But entertaining as all hell!

I would suspect that people that got offended by this movie, are the types of people that get offended by films by Kevin Smith, Todd Philips, the Wayans and probably even Judd Apatow.  Those are the kind of people that I try to avoid in my daily life.  This movie definitely has some "raunchy" moments.  But nowhere near what these prudes complaining about it here would have you to believe.

Pick it up and laugh.  Let the naysayers go line the pockets of PJ Hogan and Chris Columbus.
