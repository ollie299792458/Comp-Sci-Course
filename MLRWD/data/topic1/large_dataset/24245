You ask the average person today on the street who was Preston Tucker, or even better what is a Tucker Torpedo they will look at you and say what the h*&% are you talking about.  This is an important part of history, people need to know how much are country has changed.  There was a time where the little guy could get ahead.  Someone in an earlier review said who cares about seat belts or shatterproof windshields.  You would if you were the one who was killed as a result of lack there of.  This is not a story of the rich get richer, what you do not realize is that Preston Tucker was actually very far in debt, he invested so much in his dreams, waiting for them to be realized he didn't have much till he made it.  Just because you guys have no desire to better your life does not mean that you need to bash a guy who had a dream and went for it.  I could not have picked a better cast, you talk about it being boring, and yet you criticize the casting of Jeff Bridges, ha I will admit it may have been a boring movie w/o Jeff Bridges. Over all this is a must see for all ages, and will give you the true meaning of what the American dream is all about.
