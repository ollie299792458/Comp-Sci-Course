We actually paid to view this movie in a hotel while on vacation and I am going to purchase it to own. We laughed so hard, I genuinely thought the neighbors in the rooms around us were going to complain.
The humor in this movie is more along the lines of slapstick. Yes it is silly (probably why one reviewer called it lame). It is not a realistic movie (it wasn't intended to be) and it is predictable in its plot:
  Two friends in business together, huge deal for the business on the line, conflict for the business because of the responsibilities of one partner, friendship (wins/looses). I won't give the predictable ending away.
That said, If I can predict that I will laugh as hard as I did, I will give it 5 stars. The entire purpose of this movie is to let go and laugh.

I think that if you liked Harry and the Hendersens and Wild Hogs, you will enjoy this movie with the same kind of laughable abandon.
Example of silly.. John Travolta and Robin William's medicines get mixed up in a hard to believe situation and each suffers the side effects the other has complained about. (They ARE old dogs after all) They use computer graphics to make John Travolta's smile rediculously large and Robin William's vision over the top goofy.

Don't think too hard about this one, just chill and let the laughter roll.
By the way, we were completely comfortable with our 10 and 13 year olds viewing this one.
