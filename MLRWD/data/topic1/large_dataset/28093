I purchased this for a report I had to do, and I could'nt find it anywhere except on amazon. They were polite and shiped it fast.

The original movie ,as you all know if you have seen it, is wonderful, but I can't say the same for the "sequel". The "sequel" is about this girl, Nikki Ferris (Carrie Kei Heim, who's mom,Sharon(Hayley Mills), want's to move because of her recent divorse.In the middle of packing,Nikki must go to summer school, where she ends up meeting her soon to be best friend,Mary Grant (Bridgette Andersen). Nikki,who does not want to move in the first place, conspires with Mary, who's mom recently died, to get their mom and dad together so Nikki wont have to move.The two girls must get Nikki's aunt Susan,(Hayley Mills), in on the deal to pull it off.This "sequel" is basicly the same as the original but has a different scenerio.

The reason I am puting sequel in quotations is because was already a sequel and another movie after that about Susan and Sharon meeting this dad of triplets and one of them ends up marrying him. In the movie after the sequel they are on their honeymoon in Hawaii, where the girls of course come along. These two movies are way better than the parent trap "sequel".

Bottem line if you like the original you should get this dvd. Besides you may just like the "sequel".
