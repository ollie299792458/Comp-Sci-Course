All I have to say is this is a great movie.Yes I am a Britney fan,but I would have loved it if she hadn't even been in it.I'm sure evryone knows about this movie because of all the trailers(which I must add are on the DVD.All 6 of them.)So I'm going to use my review to talk about the DVD extras.Britney's DVD Welcome-It's only a sec. long,just Britney saying she hopes you enjoy her first movie.Break Through Britney-It's commentary by Britney.2 Music Videos-You've seen them,you know.The Making of Crossroads:40 Days with Britney-It wasn't on there.If it is it's hard to find because well I couldn't find it.First in Line-This wasn't there either.7 Deleted Scenes-I'm guessing this isn't your first DVD,so I think you know how this goes.Sing Along With Britney-This was so cool,the words are at the bottom and light up when you should say the word."Not A Girl"doesn't have main vocals but "Overprotected"does.Edit Your Own Music Video-Not as fun as it sounds.Taryn's T-Shirts-Not there(If someone is reading this and has all the stuff I've said wasn't there,please tell,somehow that way I can find out why.)Crossroads Photo Gallery-You know what's here.Then all the trailers(with the MTV ones where each person hass thir own.)Well last thing I'm going to say is that the movie is awesome.I tell you even if you hate Britney,see it.If you like teen female movies then get it,rent it,something,just see it.
