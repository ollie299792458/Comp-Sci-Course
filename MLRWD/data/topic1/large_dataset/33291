It's just one darn tornado after another.  Never saw such a storm system before.

Twister is improbable.  Twister is maniacal.  It's a thrill ride that's guaranteed to hold your interest from beginning to end.  And how cool is it that Van Halen's Humans Being made it into the soundtrack?  It's a great tornado-chase song.

I love Twister.  I'm into the whole midwest vibe it so effectively creates.  I love Helen Hunt. If Twister was a bad movie, I think I'd still watch it just to see her.  I love the effects - they are extremely effective!

Some of the scripting is a bit cheesy, to be sure.

For instance, the campy melodrama behind the following scene is just so yeesh:

Joey: [Discussing at Meg's on the tornadoes they have seen so far] No, that was a good size twister. What was it, an F3?
Bill: Solid F2.
Melissa: See, now you have lost me again.
Bill: It's the Fujita scale. It measures a tornado's intensity by how much it eats.
Melissa: Eats?
Bill: Destroys.
Laurence: That one we encountered back there was a strong F2, possibly an F3.
Beltzer: Maybe we'll see some 4's.
Haynes: That would be sweet!
Bill: 4 is good. 4 will relocate your house very efficiently.
Melissa: Is there an F5?
[Everyone goes dead silent]
Melissa: What would that be like?
Jason 'Preacher' Rowe: The Finger of God.
Melissa: None of you has ever seen an F5?
Bill: ...Just one of us.
[Looks upstairs, indicating Jo]

And speaking of cheesy, I don't like Bill Paxton as the leading man in this.  There's something overly contrived about him, almost to the point of being plastic.  But the other characters are fairly interesting.

Especially, of course, Helen Hunt. :-)
