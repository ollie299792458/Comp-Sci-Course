OK I saw this movie again last night and while it isn't the best in movies it really isn't all that bad. The main cast of characters comprise of Richard Gere (Edward Sumner), Diane Lane (Constance 'Connie' Sumner) and Olivier Martinez (Paul Martel). This is your basic story about an out of it husband who works all of the time, a bored housewife and a good looking french guy to rescue her. Well maybe not the basic story. I enjoyed watching this movie. I actually saw it on HBO first and liked it enough to buy it so I have watched it about 5 or 6 times since then. Connie meets up with Olivier in SOHO where she is buying toys for her son's birthday. Its stormy, the wind ends up blowing her down and she skins her knee. This is where the french man comes in. Olivier has a sort of hot, geeky kind of look. He isn't hunky, but he draws you in with his mannerisms. He is the medium heighth, dark and handsome type. Connie is immediately attracted to Olivier, as was I, and so the story begins. If you love hot, steamy sex scenes that are made for the big screen this is the movie for you. Connie and Olivier have sex almost everywhere. This is the problem though, Connie is starting to act differently and her husband begins to notice. He hires a P.I. to follow her. Bingo she is cheating on him. Edward confronts Olivier only seconds after Olivier and Connie had sex outside of his apartment in the hallway. Anyway Edward ends up killing Olivier with one of those snowballs that Connie had given to Olivier that was actually one that Edward had given to Connie. Well this is where I lost interest in the movie. Olivier, the hot french man is out of the picture. The remainder of the film is about trying to figure out who killed Olivier. The first 3/4 of this movie are great. The end portion boring. I suggest renting this movie and finding out for yourself before purchasing it. It is a good movie, but honestly it is all downhill without Olivier.
