I reviewed the VHS of this movie a long time ago (see review in this section), but the versions in this 2-disc set are different still.  One version, the one I've always considered the definitive version, is the one on LaserDisc and also for rent on VHS in video stores.  Version 2 is the crappy-transfer copy in this DVD set.  It looks like the opening titles were time-compressed into the first scene, and the picture quality is shoddy at best.  Version 3 is the Director's Cut.  The picture is clear and beautiful, but some interesting dialog sequences were cut out.  And Version 3 has added a scene with Graham and his wife about 2/3 into the film that interrupts the tempo of the film.  Skip Version 2 except for the fact that it offers some alternate takes and alternate scenes.  The picture quality is so bad it is insulting.  Version 3 looks GREAT, but Version 1, the version long available on VHS and LaserDisc, is the best version narratively.  I'm glad I own the DVD set, but when I want to watch this movie again I will always view the splendid LaserDisc version instead of the DVD.
