I fail to understand how anyone who liked the 1st Predator, would NOT like this one.  Whats not to like?
This is a VERY different movie from the first.  It's set in the CITY, not the jungle, and you get to see the predator a whole lot more, with his sweet weapons and technology.  Kevin Peter Hall (the predator) is as imposing as he was in the first one.  The movie is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while using some humor here and there to cut the tension.  I cant stress how much I love this movie.
OK, one thing I understand can confuse people- Arny is NOT in this movie at all.  I thought Danny Glover did an excellent job of pulling the viewer in, and making you want to watch.  Don't get me wrong, I love Arnold, but I'm no Arny FanBoy like some of the posts around here.  I think having him in this movie, in a totally different environment from the first, would have seemed contrived and very "Arny was in the first, so we have to put him in this one."
Without ruining the end, I must say I loved it.  Now here's another point of confusion- alot of people I've heard just dont get the ending.  Without ruining it for you, without saying a word a predator leader tells Danny Glover  "We've been visiting your planet for a long time, and we'll be back."
