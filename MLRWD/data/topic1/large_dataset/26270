You might be used to watch Mr. McBride play grotesque, over the top and above all profane characters before, but never with the depth he plays the villain in this movie. If you're a fan of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FMWAOM">Eastbound & Down</a>you see hints of the prowess of Mr. MacBrides performance. And someone said that great villains make great heroes. In this case I will say the opposite. Mr. Jesse Eisenberg ([[ASIN:B0034G4P7Q The Social Network]) The premise of this movie is very straight forward, as exemplified on trailer and other marketing tidbits. A pizza delivery boy, gets drawn to a bank heist by means of a bomb attached to his chest and the treat of blowing him off if he doesn't do it. As the story unfolds the performances of the cast gets better. Now. Don't take me wrong, if you are not a fan of Danny McBride you might have a harder time not only enjoying, but understanding this brand of humor reminiscence of a Funny or Die video. This film doesn't deliver anything more beyond that. In all said. You won't be disappointed if you enjoy this type of humor Farrel and McBride itself, unless you are more fond of the New York clown like Seinfeld, Louis CK or even Chris Rock. I would give this movie 3 1/2 for performance and pacing. The director went straight to the point, with no filler in this 83 min movie.
