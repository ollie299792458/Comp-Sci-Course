Bud Abbot and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein, filmed in 1948, is a horror-comedy parody of classic monster movie clich&eacute;s and constructs. Directed by Charles Barton and released by Universal, it has the explicit use of popular "monsters", Dracula, the Frankenstein monster, and the Wolf Man. As its title dictates, the film stars Bud Abbot and Lou Costello, as well as  Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. as Dracula and the Wolf Man respectively.

 Chick Young (Bud Abbott) and Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello) are two baggage clerks that while tending to two packages, get caught up in the mess of Dracula and the Frankenstein monster. A Mr. McDougal, the owners of the packages and a "McDougal's House of Horrors museum", demands that Young and Grey both tend to the packages until his insurance man arrives. While they wait, both the monsters escape their cells and Dracula initiates a plan to transfer Grey's brain with that of the aggressive and uncontrollable Frankenstein.

 The film, shot in '48 and in black and white, makes impressive use of the visual effects available at the time. The Dracula and Wolf Man transformation in particular look great for a film over 50 years old. Dracula changes from a humanoid form to a large bat using a form of cell animation, while the Wolf Man transformation is handled with time lapse photography, both of which yield great results. Other aspects of the movie do not fair so well, however. The jungle scene in particular has low visibility and detail thanks to the night setting, the black and white footage, and the dense jungle set.

 The plot is far from magnificent, but it's not meant to win any awards, the film is a comedy first and foremost, and in that front, it succeeds. Situational comedy is plentiful, as is some slapstick humor, and combined with often outrageous scenarios, Bud Abbot and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein is highly recommended.
