There are some people who won't even give Cav a chance (the second opera on the dvd), but I watched it. Now I don't blame anyone for not watching it. Now I only watch the second part of the dvd with I Pagliacci, because it is PHENOMENAL. I wish the staging would have been a little better (more believable when they are at their camp) but that blanches in comparison to the acting. Domingo is a little past his prime here, but his voice does not suffer. He plays this character with a brutal realism that makes you fear him but pity him at the same time. Of course, the famous aria "Laugh, Clown" is absolutely heart-wrenching and beautifully sung. I found myself just going back to listen/watch the aria for the emotions on Domingo's face. It's always nice to find great opera singers also be amazing actors and actresses, and Domingo does not disappoint. Get this for the amazing Pagliacci (it's not even that long, so thoroughly enjoyable for opera fanatics and those who are just getting into it) and have a dvd that you will enjoy in your library for years and years.
