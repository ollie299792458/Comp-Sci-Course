It's rather unfair to lump this in the category "romantic comedy." While very quirky in a way similar to Being John Malkovich, this is an amazingly apt picture of love: a collection of treasured experiences between two people. The film is a collage of scenes which don't really make sense until the final moment. But when it all comes together, the impact is forceful. This film shows the simplicity of love and the subtle power of it which keeps drawing us back. This is an intelligent, brilliant, touching story.

 Just FYI: the title is a line from a poem by Alexandre Pope (Eloisa to Abelard) which starts:

 In these deep solitudes and awful cells,

 Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,

 And ever-musing melancholy reigns;

 Which is pretty much where the movie starts with the main character unhappy with her negative feelings about the relationship. So she chooses to wipe her entire memory of it from her mind. But this results not in moving on... just starting over.

 How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!

 The world forgetting, by the world forgot.

 Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!

 Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;
