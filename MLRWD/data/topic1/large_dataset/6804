I have been a casual Johnny Cash fan since I was a kid.  My main musical interest is classic and progressive rock. However, I have always really liked Johnny's music.  If you watch the extra's, you will see comments of love for Johnny by an odd array of artists including Kid Rock, Ozzy, Kris Kristofferson, Trent Rezner and others, proving Johnny trensended all muscial interests.  I also really like biographical movies such as The Aviator & A Beautiful mind and now I Walked the Line.  This is an outstanding movie, and like Johnny, it is very honest.  It was quite disturbing to learn of the depths of Johnny's drug, alcohol, relationship problems, and the pain of a youthful upbringing where his brother dies from an accident, and his Dad blames Johnny and emotionally tortures him throughout his life.  It is a story of a tortured individual who poured all of his life experiences into his songs.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutely amazing in their respective parts as Johnny Cash and June Carter.  They sing all of the songs themselves, and did an outstanding job.  The Extended Cut 2-DVD version has a 2nd disc that covers a lot of history about the making of the movie and the history of Johnny Cash.  Yes, it would have been awesome to see actual video of the Folsom Prison taping, but still contains an amazing amount of history and information.  The video quality is excellent, not sure it could be any better on Blu-Ray.  In summary, I would highly recommend this version of the movie due to the brutally honest and ultimately heart warming love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter, fantastic acting, great video quality, and lots of extra's, I love Johnny Cash and I loved this movie
