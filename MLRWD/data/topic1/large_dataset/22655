Who couldn't love the Bennett sisters in this comedy about manners? The A&E version (starring Colin Firth) was SSSOOO BORING that I fell asleep I think more than twice. If you're interested in seeing a version of the book, definetley see this one.
Greer Garson is simply enchanting as Elizabeth Bennett, the second oldest sister and great fun to watch. Maureen O'Sullivan,
plays Jane (the eldest sister) beautifully (except perhaps the scene where she has a cold and her attempt to sound stuffed up is terrible). But my favorite of the sisters are Ann Rutherford and Heather Angel, who play Lydia and Kitty (the youngest sisters). They're hilarious, and give great performances.
 Of course, there's also Laurence Olivier. He was 100% Darcy! When I saw Colin Firth, I wanted to scream out loud-he looked like a monster! Olivier was dashing in his part, and I loved every minute of his performance.
However, my favorite performance in the film was Frieda Inescort as Caroline Bingley. She was so cruel and evil, that I have to cheer every time her name appears in the credits.
Overall, the film is touching, surprising, and non-stop entertainment. The bottom line: SEE IT!
Of course, the other cast members are great too: Mary Boland (Mrs. Bennett), Marsha Hunt (Mary Bennett) and Edmund Gwenn (Mr. Bennett). Everyone seems married to Edna May Oliver's portrayal of Lady Catherine De Bourgh, which was an extremely minor role. She looked REALLY scary for one, and hardly appeared in the film at all! Why does everyone care?! Oh well, you should really really see this astoundingly funny film as it is. See ya!
