Starz' series Sparatcus Season 1 takes place before the events so famously portrayed by Kirk Douglas some 50 years ago in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005A8TY">Spartacus - Criterion Collection</a>. Season one takes place almost entirely in the ludus (Gladiator training school) where Spartacus was taken for his refusal to continue following a particularly argonant and incompetent roman general.  Amazingly, all of season 1 sets the background and builds the character for Spartacus.  Season 1 develops the motivation for the leader of the greatest slave revolt in antiquity.

Some have mentioned this series immediate ancestors: HBO's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028RXXFC">Rome: The Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF2WCC">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book and BD-Live)</a>.  This seems to be a fairly accurate reference point. Spartacus has plenty of the conniving Roman family politics (and sex) that we loved in HBO's Rome.  And Spartacus contains plenty of stylized blood that echoes from 300.  However, Spartacus stands well on its own.

The stylized blood lends itself well to arena combat.  And the writers and producers of Spartacus did their homework: just as Romans had innumerable combinations of Gladiatorial combat, so too does Season 1 show an incredible array of warriors fighting with weapons, teams, and solo.  The stylized bloodletting lends itself well to the "spectacle" of Roman gladiatorial games.

The actors are brilliant in this series.  Spartacus' characters in all their humanity and politicing, and fighting, makes the whole transcend both the blood and sex of the show.  The plot is tightly written, which makes the series fantastic to own on DVD/blu-ray.  Waiting from week to week at the end of each cliff-hanger episode would have been torture.

While Kirk Douglas' Spartacus was superb in its own right, Andy Whitfield's Spartacus seems so much more completely human.  Andy Whitfield plays a Spartacus who is tortured and torn while also displaying love wisdom and cunning when needed.

The real comparison will be when Spartacus Season 2 is released.  Whitfield will be reprising many of the events from Kubrick's film.

The Blu-ray edition also has MovieIQ which details the actors and some notes on scenes throughout each episode.
