This is sheer heaven -- tears of joy are dripping down on my keyboard as I write this! I've just finished watching the entire set -- the films as well as the shorts and added features -- and I simply cannot believe the quality of the DVD transfer of these fabulous films! Warners was working with the very best source materials -- most of the prints they used are stunning considering their age, with only the occasional age remnant (scatch or slight deterioration). Best of all, hidden among this embarassment of riches in the many special features is a eye-popping transfer of the 1934 WB short Good Morning Eve ... the very first short in the new three-color Technicolor process (four months before La Cucharacha).  The colors are as vivid and rich as they were 72 years ago!  Okay, so the modern "featurettes" are schlocky and add little value -- who cares when the films and the shorts are as good as these.

All of this forgives Warner Home Video for the absolutely dismal DVD transfers of the 1930s MGM classics Libeled Lady and Camille. I haven't a clue why it took so long to bring these old beauties to DVD but the drought is over and I'm prepared to praise Warners for this magnificent collection.
