This really is a fantastic movie. For general audiences, it holds all the appeal of a good Batman storyline. For true Batman fans, it holds up to our strict scrutiny. If you've read the comics and watched any of the animated series, you might expect that this storyline will hold few surprises. You would be wrong. The "Mask of the Phantasm" storyline was good, but not particularly surprising or original. "Return of the Joker" is both. It's so original, in fact, that I would suggest you go out of your way to avoid learning anything about it before watching. You won't be disappointed.
The DVD special features are excellent, as well. There's a short documentary about the production of the movie, an audio track recorded by the creators, and even an unanimated scene that was deleted from the final cut.
I recommend this movie for anyone. The storyline is both original and well-developed, and contains elements that will hold the interest of mature audiences while presenting them in a manner suitable for younger viewers. I'm glad to own this DVD, and offer my thanks to everyone who took part in its production for the wonderful result.
