Lion in Winter has it all--marvelous acting, great dialog, compelling characters, and a terrific story.  It deals with the family of Henry II of England (the aging "Lion") and his estranged wife (is "estranged" the right word? He's had her in prison for years) Eleanor of Aquitaine--two of English history's most intriguing characters.  Look for a young Anthony Hopkins as the future Richard I and Timothy Dalton as the even younger king of France.

The movie is set at a Christmas court at Chinon at which Henry, Eleanor, their surviving sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, and Richard's fiancee (who is Henry's mistress and the French king's sister) are all present as the family deals with their complicated interrelationships as well as the question of who will be king after the aging Henry dies and how they will respond to the French king's visit.  Historically, they did not gather at Chinon for a court that year, but the backstory, relationships, and agendas within this family are presented accurately.  This is a film to treasure.
