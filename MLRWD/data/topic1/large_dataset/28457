Chances are, if you're reading this amature review you've probably seen the original Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland but have never seen Return to Oz.  Return to Oz takes place where the original left off.  Except that  Dorothy is stuck in a mental hospital.  She escapes and one way or another  ends up back in Oz with her talking chicken. (Please don't judge the movie  prematurly just because it has a talking chicken.) When we see Oz we find  that the yellow brick road is smashed and destroyed, the Emerald City is in  shambles, and all of Dorothy's friends are turned to stone. That's as far  as I'll go, because that's all the premise you need to know before you  actually see the movie.  This movie is ingenious in so many ways.  It  revolutionized claymation, and special effects, the costumes are out of  this world, and the adventure that Dorothy is apart of is indescribable.  Return to Oz is deffinitly way more darker than the original.  Very gothic,  with a sense of tension that keeps building until the final climax.  Please, if you have respect for the movie genre, don't prejudge this  classic movie that has finally been re-released.  Because not only will it  entertain you, but if you happen to have a younger sibling who is singing  the yellow brick road song over and over, show em' Return to Oz and watch  their face turn white.  Enjoy.
