i first watched the movie version - and it really struck me. 
How fragile life is, and yet some people just snuff it out as easy as snuffing out a candle flame. 
Hilary Swank portrays Brandon very well - and it was a well deserved award she won. Brandon at least had the desire and courage to search for his niche in life, and to follow his dreams. How many people actually achieve that in this day and age? 
The roughnecks didnt understand him (which is understandable cos of the way their lifes were structured and their nurturing from young). 
This is exactly the kind of discrimination that goes on even in freedom proclaiming USA, what more other homophobic countries? 
Everyone artiste in this film had a vital part to play to keep the film moving, which is exactly what they did. 
Its not one of those 'brainless' movies you can just pop into your player and watch, but it still deserves a place in your video cabinet for the messages of hope and dreams it carries.
In some ways, its an inspirational movie.
