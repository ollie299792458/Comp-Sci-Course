After having seen many low-budget films dealing with native american indians I was, at first, hesitant to watch this DVD.  However, my curiosity got the better of me and I bought it and put it in he dvd-player, turned down the lights and began my three hour viewing adventure.  I was immediately aware that this was actually a well made movie.  The story centers around a native indian and his grandson.  The grandson who is beginning to take the wrong road, but is fortunate enough to spend time with his grandfather to spare him that journey.  The grandfather who is a story-teller takes his grandson on a day's journey and it is during this journey and during the stories that we see a plethora of tales of life as an indian, from 100 years ago to 400 years ago - tales of magic, triumph and good morals as well.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves native indian movies, is interested in their culture or is just into a good family movie.  Lots of good family-value stuff in this film - I'd rate it two-thumbs-up.
