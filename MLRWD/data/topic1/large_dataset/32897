I am a long time fan of this miniseries, having seen it on tv when it first aired, then owning it on VHS, then purchasing it on DVD.  I wasn't aware the DVD I had was so severely edited until I purchased this one.  I cannot believe the difference.  The edited version leaves several holes in the storyline that leave the viewer wondering what's going on.  Editing for time constraints is one thing, but to chop up a miniseries so that important scenes are deleted is ridiculous.  For example, John Geyser has a scene with John Brown before his hanging.  In the edited version, you never see the scene, but hear about it later.  Now the scene with John explaining that conversation to his cousins makes a lot of more sense...obviously.

Anyone who is a fan of this miniseries should definitely purchase this version instead of the other one.  If the other version can't even get their cover right (one photo says Colleen Dewhurst, but that's definitely not her in the picture), that indicates the production company didn't pay much attention to detail, and that carries over to the film itself.
