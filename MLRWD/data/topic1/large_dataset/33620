This is a simple, improbable story about a dog that is gotten from the pound to be a family guard dog; but he won't bark. There is the bumbling good natured father, the efficient mother and the children - a boy and girl. The family leaves the house on Christmas and Zeus the dog cannot go to grandma's; so he stays and the blundering 2 burglars break into the house and as the title says - the dog saves Christmas...gee sounds like a movie most have already hear of.
The DVD itself has audio commentary with the producer and the 2 stars Gary Valentine and  Elisa Donovan. It is definitely the worst director's commentary I have ever heard; there is so much laughter and talking over each other, most of the time none of my family could understand what they were saying - at least they were having a good time. There are English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired; also a short bit with Mario Lopez dubbing for the dog's voice. Sneak peaks of' All Roads Lead to Home' and the `Velveteen Rabbit' and Dolby surround 5.1 sound are also included.
If you liked Home Alone then you'll probably like this simple little movie which also includes bloopers at the ending.
