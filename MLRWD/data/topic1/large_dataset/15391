watching this movie it is almost unbelievable to think that it predates the whole x files/ufo conspiracy /alien interventionist/von daniken debates by around 30 years. the controversial theory that mankind's development may have been facilitated by extraterrestrials using genetic engineering and selective breeding is given a surprising supernatural twist, and if you can see past the rudimentary special effects you will be rewarded with an extremely engrossing and challenging sci-fi scenario.i first saw this film on a late night creature feature on t.v. in '79 and it really hooked me.in fact, i will go right out on a limb here and declare this film,in my opinion, one of the most important science fiction films of the 20th century,specifically because of the issues it addresses. many people, myself included, have often wondered whether it may have been likely that humans were given 'evolutionary nursemaids' in the formative years of our prehistoric past, possibly not always for completely altruistic purposes.....
