This movie is as sick as it is fun. Though "sick" might seem like the wrong way to describe this movie, I chose to use that word. The  only thing that's sick in the movie is Patrick Bateman.
I'm sure you've  read enough about this movie to know who and what Bateman is, so I won't  get in to specifics.
The movie is both a Horror-flick and a Comedy, all  meshed into one. You might not think that that's an easy thing to pull off,  but this movie does it just perfectly on all levels possible.
You're  never quite sure if Bateman really kills anyone. It might all be in his  head. There's no question about the fact that he's totally mental, but you  never really know about the murders. The murder-scenes aren't all that  gory. Sure, there's blood, but not extreme ammounts of it. As I also  mentioned, it's also a comedy. I laughed my ass of in some scenes, and so  will you, probably. You laugh at the fact that Bateman is so incredibly  sick and that he has such little connection to the "real  world".
Well, anyways, this is a very entertaining flick, and I  really recommend the Unrated version of it. HEY, PAUL!
