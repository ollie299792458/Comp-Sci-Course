I am not one to shop online, however at 25 years old, I remembered my favorite childhood video. My father recorded Alice in Wonderland on VHS off the TV, I watched over and over until the tape broke. I recently called around every place I could think of to try to buy a copy. The closest I came to finding it was on sold in two parts for nearly $30.00 each, Alice in Wonderland, and Alice through the Looking Glass, on VHS. Someone suggested I looked on AMAZON, and sure enough I found both parts on DVD for only $8.00! I left work early, went home and popped it right in the DVD player. I instantly got lost in wonderland. As a grown woman, watching movies since childhood, I finally got to appreciate this timeless classic. I know now who all these famous actors are, when they were once only chess pieces, flowers and catapillars to me. I dont even think I realized it was a musical as a child, however I remebered every song in full the first time I was reunited with Alice in Wonderland. I watched it again with my 6 year old girl and 1 year old boy... and 20 years later, Alice in Wonderland had them BOTH glued to the TV. This movie is full of fantasy, great to watch as a family. Every part of the movie is special!
