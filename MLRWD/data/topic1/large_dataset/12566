It is so nice to finally have this exceedingly well restored classic on DVD. The print is so clear and sound so good, it is almost like seeing it for the first time. Joan Crawford is excellent, dispelling the myth that she was a movie star, not an actress. The storyline is constantly surprising and the supporting case, from Eve Arden and Anne Blyth to Jack Carson are all excellent. But it is the extras on this DVD edition that really make it worth buying. First you get TMC's excellent hour and a half documentary, "Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Star", narrated by Angelica Houston and featuring commentary from many of Crawford's contemporaries, such as Anita Paige (!), Cliff Robertson, Diane Baker, Vincent Sherman, Betsy Palmer, biographer Bob Thomas, playwright Charles Busch and (unfortunately), Christina Crawford. The documentary goes a long way in turning Crawford back into a human after being brought down to the level of monster after the publishing of "Mommie Dearest". Also included on the disc are some really great trailers from all of Crawford's Warner Brothers movies, dating from 1945-1952, as well as The Women and Baby Jane. Let's home Turner continues putting out DVDs with such care and thoughtfulness toward fans. I (of course), would love to see other Crawford titles come out in the near future, as well. Definitely well worth the price!
