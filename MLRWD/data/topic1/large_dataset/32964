Wow.  Finally we are presented with the DVD version of this fantastic movie.  I was beginning to lose faith in the system... But it's not all good since even after all this time the people who are putting out this epic on DVD have failed by making the 5.1 version in English and the Stereo in Japanese which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to me! The first thing that comes to mind is: ARE THEY MENTAL? Of course I'll still buy it. I've been waiting for this for an excrutiatingly long time and a minor mistake (yeah right, who am I kidding) like this isn't going to detter me.  Still I am very disappointed.  Obviously the movie itself is of such enormous awesomeness I can't even describe it (esp. any better than the previous reviewers who did an excellent job).  All I can say is please buy this movie if you buy one movie in your entire existance and watch it many many times.  You will not regret it.  Definetely a tremendous landmark in the history of all animation and still the single best animation movie of all time (yes i do enjoy some of the older Disney movies but there is just no comparison).  If you have this movie and need a good anime fix, please also acquire Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke, Grave of the Fireflies, and Ninja Scroll (these are in order from best to not so best since all are amazing and of course this is only my opinion but I'm sure you'll agree after watching each one).
