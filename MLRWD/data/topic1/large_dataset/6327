I've seen this movie a million times. When I saw the movie this time, what struck me was how radical the movie is. Rather than a "feelgood movie", the movie is a passionate advocate of the kind of radical communitarian populism that fueled many progressives during the Depression era. Perhaps this radicalism, which was passe by 1946, was the reason the movie was unpopular when it was released.

Plot elements make this abundantly clear. Mr. Potter, a figure straight from Enron or the Jack Welch "lean and mean" school of capitalism, is the embodiment of monetary values. George Bailey, on the other hand, is the embodiment of communitarian values where personal profit takes a back seat to the welfare of every member of the community. Dystopic Pottersville is presented as the inevitable result of Potter's denial of communitarian values, a place where alienation and anomie reign supreme. Bedford Falls is a communitarian utopia where all walks of life unite for the good of all and for the least among them. Capitalism is transformed from Potteresque exploitation to innovative entrepreneurialism where a good idea (the plastics factory) both enriches its owners and contributes to the good of the community.

I think this political message was strong and intentional and contributed to the film's unpopularity when it came out. Not until it was recast as a "feelgood movie" did it become a beloved classic, with its message buried in a ton of schmaltzy misinterpretation. Don't let the film's sentimentality (which I love) or the unfortunate racial and sexual stereotypes of its era  blind you to the import of its true message -- a message that is even more germane now than it was in 1946.
