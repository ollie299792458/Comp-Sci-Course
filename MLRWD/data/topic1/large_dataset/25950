I don't normally review anything anywhere but I just returned home from the theater after seeing "The Master" and I just felt compelled to say a few words about this movie.

PS Hoffman is my favorite actor. Phoenix was brilliant in "Walk the Line". Both actors here give amazing heartfelt performances(especially Joaquin Phoenix who deserves an Oscar for this role). But I left the theater feeling so empty inside.  There is no substance to this story at all.  I don't believe it wanted to follow the historical "Scientology" view but PLEASE give us something as to what it is. I love to actually think and figure out where a movie is going, but to me this movie had no direction whatsoever.

"Magnolia" is one of my favorite PT Anderson films that I watch over and over. "Hard Eight" is just as good.  I didn't like "Punch Drunk Love" that much but only because I have no liking for Adam Sandler. AHHHHHHHHHH I don't know. To sum it up, I think I just expected a little more from The Master. Trust me you won't be bored during this movie but at the end of it, I just asked myself....what was it all for??
