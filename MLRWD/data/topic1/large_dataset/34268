Obviously anyone with more than a passing interest in Almodovar will want this set, which averages out to a pretty decent price considering what you get. Good news first: Matador and Law of Desire, the two new-to-DVD titles, look excellent (especially the latter), and are practically worth picking up the set for by themselves. (Too bad Sony couldn't have released 'em separately; oh well.) Bad Education, Flower of My Secret, Live Flesh and Talk to Her are identical to the previous releases. The back of the box touts new digital remastering for Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and All About My Mother, but both of those are botched pretty badly. Women frankly looks terrible, especially compared to the previous MGM release; it's severely overcropped on all four sides (good luck trying to read the credits) and way too bright, with artificial sharpness and serious desaturation on the colors. All About My Mother does look a bit cleaner and crisper than the previous release, but it's bare bones; hold on to the older Sony release for all the extra goodies. The box is very attractive and comes with postcard replicas of the theatrical posters -- a nice touch. The bonus disc features some decent featurettes with various actors talking about working with Pedro; unfortunately, only the trailer for Volver is included as an additional bonus.
