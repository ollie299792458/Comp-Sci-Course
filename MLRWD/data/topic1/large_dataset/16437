Miss Jean is surely a very contradictory character, dressing in full plumage in a sea of stodgy gray in the this Edinburgh Girls School. Strolling about head held high like a true peacock, she believes her unorthodox methods will bring out the creative juices and "love,beauty,wisdom" among her youthful protegees. Sometimes she is absolutely spellbinding in class, too much perhaps for her own good. And her fixation for a "cause" ,be it Fascism or Falangism, leads to her unravelling. Persued by two fellow teachers, the rogueish and married art teacher, and the pleasant but slightly dull music teacher, she flits about inspiring her students (at least she thinks so!), and snipping at the headmistress, a strict conservative from the old school, who would rather have Jean employed elsewhere, but Jean does have tenure. The portrait of ife in the girl's school seems perfect, including a hilarious tango dance between the two leading students in Jean's set. They do seem to have a nasty streak, in my view unwarrented, until the very tragic end when the shy and quiet one goes to the War in Spain. All the roles seem about perfect, including the quiet screwy secretary to the headmistress. I thought the movies was 100% 1930's, including the 78 old fashioned Record Player, the costumes, sewing machines, etc.The Scottish twang was a bit hard to follow , but on a second viewing everything fit together perfectly!
