The Three Caballeros can never be taken at face value today. I remember the "Three Caballeros" song from a Sing-Along video when I was a child, and though I loved that song then, the entire movie could not hold the attention span of young children. But it's still a decent, if experimental, movie with various interpretations. 
On one level, it's an artifact from the WWII Pan-American "Good Neighbor" period: Brazil and Mexico are presented as exotic and sensual paradises, the women are sex objects, and the cultures are obviously stereotyped. But that level of interpretation is certainly not an entertaining one. It is also, however, a kind of surreal music video in which samba and bossa-nova music are matched up with fluid animation. For those who remember the "Pink Elephants on Parade" sequence from Dumbo, picture an entire movie based on that clip. Donald Duck and his friends find themselves completely warped by the music: they multiply themselves, grow, shrink, turn into flowers, and much more. It's also a very sexual film, if one chooses to interpret it that way. Connotations and double meanings abound, and if you watch the movie, you will see what I mean. 
As far as DVD quality goes, Disney could have restored it better (you can actually see the dust on the screen) which would have made the energetic animation even better. But overall, it's not bad. It's not exactly fun for the kids, but adults may find it interesting in a fun, tacky, misplaced-within-its-own-time kind of way.
