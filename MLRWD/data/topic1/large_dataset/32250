This is a good movie.  Ricky brings his style of comedy to an oversaturated genre (romantic comedy) and leaves me wanting more.  He is hilarious.

Here we have Dr. Pincus (Gervais), a dentist who is not really a people person.  He stays to himself and prefers it that way.  He undergoes a routine surgery but something goes wrong and he dies for about seven minutes, give or take.  The result of this is he now has the ability to see and interact with ghosts who have unfinished business.  One ghost is that of Frank (Kinnear) who wants Pinucs' help getting his widow's new fiance away from her.  Ultimately, and predictably, Pincus falls in love with Gwen.

Now, the first part of the movie has the kind of humor we've come to love from Ricky.  He's inappropriate, insensitive and and makes no apologies for it.  This is all good fun for a time, but where the movie really starts to take off is when he gets together with Gwen and we really see how hilarious he can be when working off the dialouge and reactions of another character.  He's almost charming with his witty banter.  Two great scenes are where he's examining the mummy and when he has dinner with Gwen and her fiance in their apartment.

There is commentary, which I haven't listened to all of it just yet, but from what I've heard it sounds pretty standard.  There is also an outtakes feature which is well worth watching.  It's pretty much all Ricky improvising, laughing hysterically and pretty much just making a mess of things.

Worth a watch.
