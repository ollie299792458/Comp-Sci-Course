Maybe its just my obsession with the work of Stephen King, but I would argue that Linoge is just another incarnation of King's old villain Flagg. Read King's book Eyes of the Dragon and then watch Storm of the Century, tell me Linoge doesn't remind you of evil wizard Flagg from that story. If you're familiar with the Dark Tower series and have read Eyes of the Dragon then watch Storm of the Century you'll see a character that embodies the character of Flagg almost perfectly. Its as if King didn't want to make it too obvious but just enough to satisfy our curiosity and make us wonder. Note, in Eyes of the Dragon that the magician Flagg has stones exactly like the ones Linoge had in Storm of the Century. Note to how the power of Flagg comes from his ability to manipulate others and make them turn against each other to accomplish his own goals. Whether King meant these characters to be the same or not, its fun to make the connections and even more fun to watch the movie under the assumption its true. Although I admit there are a number of differences, in the end I guess its up to the fans to decide.
