I have watched this show from the pilot all the way thru to episode 11.  Each episode has been awesome and leaving me wondering what was going to happen next.  I do not watch a lot of TV but this is a show worth your time.  It is well written, and all the actors that play these characters have them portrayed dead-on perfect. I have to admit I love westerns and miss them being on TV but Justified is not a western.  Raylan Givens is an old-school lawman in modern day times and his way of law is "black & white" and Timothy Olyphant plays that character as if his birth certificate said "Raylan Givens". I am so glad FX picked up this show for a second season and I was hoping the fist season would come out on DVD.  This show deserves a bunch of awards and I hope to see it nominated.  You won't go wrong with this DVD.  I've seen the first 11 episodes and can't wait to see 12 & 13.  And I'm sure the finale' will be a huge cliff-hanger leaving us to wish March getting here soon so we can see what happens next.  Of all the junk that is on TV Timothy Olyphant and FX have given us true entertainment in Justified.  Don't miss out!
