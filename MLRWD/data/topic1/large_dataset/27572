After reading the reviews of the DVD, I'm actually glad, for once, that I have the VHS instead! I first saw "Destry Rides Again" on TV back in the 1990s, and fell for it hook line and sinker. It's one of my favorite films of all time. Every Western clich&eacute; is presented in a perfect balance of kitch and seriousness. Dietrich and Stewart *sizzle* on the screen together, truly -- the chemistry is undeniable. And there are so many, many classic scenes -- you've probably seen many of them parodied, but seeing them in context, for real, is just a priceless experience. Marlene plays the role she was born to -- it's so great to see her early films where she plays a refined woman, and then to watch this and have your jaw drop over the character she's playing -- she's so obviously having a ball. I had the pleasure of seeing this film in a theater as well, and the colleague I took was no fan of old movies, but not a quarter of the way in, she started sighing over how adorable Jimmy Stewart is.
