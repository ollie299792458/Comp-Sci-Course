I have to say that I had pretty low expectations for this film, having read a lot of negative critical reviews, and I have to say, having seen this film, I am really at a loss to words as to what they thought was so bad about it.... I really, really enjoyed it.It is brillianly acted and directed. Halle gives a flawless performance, her second best to that in Monster's Ball. She is absolutely superb in this movie. It is an unbelievably stylish, clever and satisfying horror flic, and undoubtedly the best I've seen in a long, long time, possibly since The Others, which I adored. Miss it at your peril. There are some fantastic special effects, great twists, and gorgeous cinematography. The atmosphere throughout the whole film is beautifully gothic. The supporting cast are very competent, particularly. Penelope Cruz whom I never really warmed to before,but was excellent here. At times the dialogue is dissappointing but otherwise, a brilliant film... I recommend it to any lover of good, fun horror, that is still intelligent.
