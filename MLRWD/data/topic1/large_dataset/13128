In this DVD, Pete Best puts forth an argument that basically he got the "royal shaft" by the Beatles by getting kicked out on the brink of their success. In essence, he makes his point and the Beatles are found guilty as charged and should be ashamed of themselves. At the least, they should have provided a cut of the profits as to reward Peter for his work and helping them succeed. This peevish act of the Beatles is a smear on a musical legacy.

One comment on some reviewers here who seem to think that Peter Best was holding up the success of the Beatles and that his sacking was neccessary. PUHLEEZEEEE!!! This is rock n roll folks not brain surgery.

As someone who has played drums, if their is some problem a studio guy can get everyone over the hump and eventually the regular drummer can work it out. Look at Hal Baline doing studio work for Dennis Wilson. Was Denny sacked because he wasn't some genius on the drum kit? No, because his brothers loved him and worked with him and he stayed in the band.

Pete Best never should have been sacked and it was a disgrace to have been involved with this mean spirited act. Pete should be given credit for carving out a life despite the negative actions of his former friends in the Beatles. Go Pete and may you find many more years of rewarding musical efforts.
