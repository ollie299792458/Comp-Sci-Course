Tomb Raider is another video game adoption. The plot does not really follow the game, but it does have our favorite hero, Lara Croft. In this film, Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is given a mission by her father, who died. The mission is to go find two parts of a triangle that were hidden in oppsoite ends of the world. A group of men are seeking for the two parts of this triangle to open a portal (or something) of time. This could only be done during the planetry alignment which occurs every 5,000 years. Lara Croft has the key which she found hidden in a clock. Of course it was stolen. Now Lara Croft must get the key and capture the two parts of the triangle to go back through time and visit her father to get back the time that was stolen from them.
Tomb Raider is an action-packed adventure. It had some great action scenes and amazing stunts. Angelina Jolie is wonderful in playing Lara Croft and in adding some comedy and humor to the film. The plot was well-written and easy to follow. You will get hooked on the film from the start and you will be taken on an adventure like none other you've been before. I recommand this superior film to anyone who's into action-adventure films and any fans of the video game should not be dissapointed. If your a fan of Angelina Jolie then you should check out this film because she is outstanding in this film. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too.
