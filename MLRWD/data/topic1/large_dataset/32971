This movie is moving and sweeping. It may be aimed at children

but it is excellent for adults. Especialy animal loving adults.

nice story, excellent filming, good acting and of course the Cheetah (Duma) is extremely well done.

Eamonn Walker as Ripkuan deserves a special mention.

Great job, and you do not know if he is be-friending

in the beginnign or not. I recognized him from OZ and

a couple of othe places. He brings a specia llayer of

complexity to the movie.

I have seen some comparisons to fly away home, and I personally

enjoyed Duma a great deal more.

It is a feel good movie, and somwhat predictable, BUT

in all of the good ways. A nice positive way to end the day

and maybe even reflect on some of the deeper issues if you want.

Grief, loss and friendship as well as otehrs are all here.

Enjoy the movie on whatever level you want/need at the time.

but enjoy it.
