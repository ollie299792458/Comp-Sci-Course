I rank the Rocky films this way, from best to worst:
Rocky
Rocky Balboa
Rocky II
Rocky III
Rocky IV
Rocky V (can we all just pretend that one never happened?)
Note that my top two are the ones in which Rocky lost the fight, but won something bigger. Those films were not just good boxing movies, but good movies, period.
Rocky IV is not exacly horrible, but it's certainly not good. Some of it is downright stupid; what idiot writer put in the robot that has artificial intelligence? (Rocky: "I'll get the call inside." Robot: "You can get it right here!"). The James Brown extravaganza, with Apollo dancing in a really, really silly outfit, was just plain weird. Then there's the fact that Drago's 1400 psi punch killed Apollo -- but later he doubled the power to 2800 psi, and despite jackhammering Rocky with that superhuman power over and over and over, Rocky just kept walking into more punches. And the worst part of all was Rocky's "can't we all just get along" speech to the Russian crowd, which switched its allegiance from Drago to Rocky because...because... well, I don't know why they cheered wildly for the guy who beat their national idol. Because the script called for it, I guess.
In the end, I think this movie is a classic "guilty pleasure". It's fun to watch the Rocky/Drago training montage (which could also be viewed as a metaphor for human will triumphing over machine perfection), and it's also fun to get a little Cold War nostalgia, so to speak, with the American ordinary guy loner beating the product of Soviet technology. Fun to watch? Yeah. Great movie? No.
