Awesome! Journey at their best - live!  What a wonderful year it has been for Journey fans! The Hollywood Walk of Fame with so many members attending including our beloved Steve Perry, "Don't Stop Believing" as a top 10 download, The new Journey Generations CD and tour, Steve Perry at the World Series and now to top it all off a wonderful DVD and CD to relive the Houston concert. Perfection! The video is crystal clear as Steve Perry's voice soars & Neal's guitar rocks! The solos of Jonathan, Neal, and Steve Smith are a tremendous reminder of the musical talents of this band. Ross's bass and wonderful voice are likewise a part of the musical tapestry that made and makes Journey the best band ever. The interviews are very nice and a special treat to Journey fans. I enjoy hearing about what inspires these talented guys and how they are able to create such classic songs which have proven to be timeless. Many Thanks to Steve Perry and all who worked so hard to produce this gem of a performance DVD and CD. Thanks too for making it a two disk set and not a combo disk. It is a tremendous gift to all Journey fans. Merry Christmas a little early!
