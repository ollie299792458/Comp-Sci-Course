Having adored Felicity in it's first season to the point of obsession and then abandoned her like so many fans when she cut her hair, I was always curious about how the series ultimately played itself out.  Fortunately through the miracle of DVD I now know, and in this final fourth season I felt a wrap up and conclusion that is rarely realized on TV - ever.

The fourth season was bit melodramatic for most of it's mid point as the whole Ben/Lauren subplot was probably my least favorite storyline in the series.  By some odd almost improbable means though the series ends incredibly strong and ironically it's because it was cancelled a bit earlier than usual, then suddenly ressurected for several more episodes.  What's amazing is that even though the "first" ending (episode 17) is emotional, I would never have felt as satisfied with the end of the series had the plot twist in episode 18 not played out so well with such a competent group of people to pull it off.  It makes me sad to catch up and see it end finally three years after it was cancelled, but fulfilled nonetheless at a great achievement in television production.
