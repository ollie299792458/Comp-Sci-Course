When I rented this I thought the concept sounded interesting, and I'm a "somewhat" Jim Carrey fan.  What I got I did not expect.  This is simply one of the most decent, engaging, and well-acted movies I've seen in years.  I just cannot get over the transformation Jim Carrey made to serious drama.  You won't find a frame of film where he exhibits the old Jim Carrey faces or mannerisms.  He is quite seriously a completely different person in this movie.
To describe it would give too much away.  But I can compare it, as others have, to a modern take on Frank Capra movies.  Jim's character experiences self-reflection as Jimmy Stewart did in "It's A Wonderful Life", and also the little-guy-against-the-estabilshment scenario from "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington."  All of this set against the historical backdrop of the McCarthy hearings.  But make no mistake -- this is not a movie that takes political sides or is full of typical Hollywood activism and rhetoric.  It was a refreshing change.
I've heard such unflattering descriptions as "corny" and "sappy" and must disagree completely.  Those descriptions are applied by people who cannot relate to the basic concepts of friends, family, community, honor, and freedom as portrayed in this movie.  These concepts remind some folks of their own weaknesses and regrets, and they react with contempt and disdain at their presentation.  If you are one of them, this movie is not for you.
I plan on buying this one.
