I love Threes company and was looking forward to getting this season, but I have to say that I was left a little disappointed.  The writters seem to have difficulty dividing the episodes between the characters.  Whereas before you would have had episodes focused on the Ropers, Larry, or one of the kids, this season is essentially Jack and Janet.  Furley is hardly seen after the first few episodes of this season!!!  And on the few occassions he does appear he says more or less the same thing "got a date with a hot chick tonight".  Larry is used a lot more but still does little more than "knock on their door" deliver a few lines, and leave (and don't get me started on Cindy!!!)

Also they seem to treading old ground.  Several episodes are very similar to those in earlier seasons, and actors reappear in different roles (for example, Angellinos daughter was Ropers niece in season one, Janets Svengali had been Chrissys Svengali in season three, the woman who wants to buy the building from RF was the woman who bought the building from Roper for Furleys Brother in season three, and Jeffrey Tanbur is back!!!)

No wonder they shook things up in season seven by openning Jack's Bistro.

Now for an uncomfortable truth........Terry can't act.  She mugs for the camera, but it all looks so un-natural.  And while she does become a central character in the series, this isn't a great start.

This is a season for completeists.  Far better would be to look for any of the three seasons featuring the Ropers (boy were they missed).
