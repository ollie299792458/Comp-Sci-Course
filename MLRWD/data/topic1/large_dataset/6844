I read Scott Heim's novel "Mysterious Skin" a number of years ago, and found it powerful and challenging.  When I learned that Gregg Araki was making a film based on the book, I was apprehensive.  "Msterious Skin" deals with the long lasting effects of child abuse.  The last thing one wants when approaching this subject from an artistic stand point, is to be in any way exploitive.  The good news is that Mr. Araki's has triumphed - his is a brilliant film.  The performances throughout are outstanding - especially that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an in-your-face gay teen who uses sex as a means to an end - whether hustling or simply giving it away.  Brady Corbet delivers in the quieter role of Brian, who has so effectively blocked the memory of his abuse that he has come to believe that he may have been a victim of alien abduction.

This is a tough little film, dealing with topics that most people shy away from - child sexual molestation, drug abuse, prostitution and homosexuality.  Araki doesn't flinch or shy away from any of them.  It is a testsment to his incredible talent that he has made a film from this material which is both palatable and compelling.
