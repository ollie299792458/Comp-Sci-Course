The move "Some Like it Hot" is about these two male musicians that witnessed a murder and goes undercover as a female musicians. The first guy, Joe a.k.a. Josephine falls in love with one of the other girls in the band called Sugar and pretends to be a millionaire that owns Shell gas company. The other guy, Gerald a.k.a. Daphne, gets hit on by this guy named Osgoode and they end up falling in love even after finding out that she was actually a man. The parts of the movie related to power theory in one way or another. For example; the people that murdered someone used a gun to seize power and committed multiple homicides. They also used the guns to maintain power but lost in the end due to hatred of a higher authority.  I think that some of the movies' themes  is to live life to its fullest and think before taking action. Overall this movie was pretty good. It had lots of comedy and romance mixed together. I never thought that I would take interest in this kind of movie, but in the end, my opinions changed. I thought it would be just another boring black & white movie, but I was proven wrong.
