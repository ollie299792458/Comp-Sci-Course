Tonemeister:

The difference between this and "Gimme Some Truth- The Making Of Imagine" is that "Gimme Some Truth" was a documentary made in 2000 about the actual making of the album, "Imagine."

This DVD, "Imagine" is the first run movie that was shown in theaters in 1988, just 8 years after John was murdered. It is the definitive (so far) biography of John's life and his music and is one of the best music biographies ever shown on the big screen.

I have this on laserdisc and have been waiting for the re-release on DVD for a long time. I also have "Gimme Some Truth- The Making Of Imagine" and every other official John Lennon DVD.

But this one is the first biographical film about just John (not The Beatles) that was released on the big screen. And it is great.

I hope this answers your question.

Now that I can put a link in my reviews, how about checking out my book of poetry...<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IEAEQY">S.O.S. Songs Of Sobriety</a>
