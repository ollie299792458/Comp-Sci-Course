Madden's _Shakespeare in Love_ was written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Stoppard wrote (and directed the film version of) _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_.  While that film appeals to a more intellectual or philosophical audiences (as it's based on a re-imagining of _Hamlet_, told from the perspective of two minor characters), this film plays the same "trick," but appeals more to the romance evoked by its subject matter of _Romeo and Juliet_.

It would definitely help to be familiar with both Romeo and Juliet and Shakespeare's subsequent play, Twelfth Night, as the plot of _Shakespeare in Love_ weaves in and out of the characters and themes of those two plays.  It's less of an intersection with those plays and more of a "behind-the-scenes" of the writing of those two plays.  It cleverly takes Romeo and Juliet's focus on a love restricted by circumstance and puts it into the context of the Bard's own life.

The film does make one wonder about the historical veracity of the events depicted, yet the DVD extras don't seem to delve into that kind of investigation; perhaps our general lack of knowledge of the Bard's life is the real reason for these unanswered questions, but it would be nice to receive some sense of the "reality" of the events depicted in the film, without having to engage in a scholarly enterprise.  Regardless of "truth," however, the film is wonderfully creative and intelligent.

Both in the theater and on DVD I felt this film lacked something, and one's love for Shakespeare does help during the times that the plot meanders about, but it doesn't affect it enough to make me drop it to four stars.  On the whole, this film is remarkably creative, intelligent, and romantic!
