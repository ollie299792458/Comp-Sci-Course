I can't help but harken back to Michael Douglas's terriffic portrayal as a stock market financier in Wall Street. His character in The Game is strikingly similar to Gordon Gecco, except the dissimilarity of the Game's Orton is that instead of truly enjoying the merits of massive money monkey malarchy, he seems only interested in attaining more of it at the cost of no personal life whatsoever.

Douglas is again, his usual thriller great self. We see him at the true zenith of perfection in his attempts to discover the secrets of the corporation that set forth this intriguing but upsetting game which seems to be much more than the simplicity originally implied.

Oh sure, we expect something special in his brother's gift, but we certainly dont expect to be so far on the edge of our seat that we are getting cramps in our butts just trying to stay there.

What I truly loved about this movie is my own lack of ability to come to a true answer as to what was really going on. So often, it is within my and other's nature to try and be smart and figure out the intended ending, only to be found right and then slightly disappointed that the writer and director didn't go past our expectations. Not so with The Game. Game takes you so deep into this man's downward spiral while "playing" this deceptive game, figuring out it's true intent becomes second nature. By the end, your nerves are so shatterred from the journey, you feel like you've been right there with Van Orton experiencing every nuance of the events in reality yourself. Plus, the finale is truly magnificent, which I cannot spoil here. This movie is a true must for anyone who is a fan of movies that not only make you think, but defy the typical Hollywood thriller model.
