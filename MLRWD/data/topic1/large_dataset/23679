I first saw this version of Sabrina several years ago, and thought it was just fine as a product of its time. Then more recently I saw the Ormond-Ford version and thought it would be a good idea to revisit the original.
What astonished me was how little emotional sense the original movie makes. People behave in ways that are unfathomable to us now, decades later. I suppose our infatuation with "a simpler time" makes us able to overlook little things like Linus' premeditated physical attack of his brother (how deep do you suppose a broken champagne glass will penetrate into someone's bum?), David's "lovable" addiction to women, and Sabrina's own somewhat neurotic behavior. (The newer version at least attempted to deal with these problems and nearly succeeded in giving us people we can relate to, especially Sabrina, who is shown finding herself and then working from that strength.)
It's quirky in that Billy Wilder way, but definitely lives in another time. I categorize this one with all the others where actors were consciously acting, and somehow the movie just would have seemed better in black and white.
