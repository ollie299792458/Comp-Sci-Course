The Special Edition in widescreen Panavision with color by De Luxe is gorgeous from landscapes to big action scenes. The camerawork, whether a tracking shot of the galloping Forty Thieves, or just a set piece looking up the long bordertown street to Boot Hill, is inspired.  The score by Elmer Bernstein in Dolby is well, magnificent!

The individual vignettes with Wallach, McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson are little classics. And yet, and yet ...

I first saw TM7 in a theater when it was first released and grew up watching the Marlboro Man on TV so I was looking forward to seeing TM7 again in its orginal glory. But as I watched, I found myself thinking: Had Horst Buchholz really been this annoying? Were the villagers always such wooden actors? Wasn't there more interaction among the Seven? Weren't there more gunfights in the original? In short, it is a very good movie, but it isn't THE Magnificent Seven - the one in my memory for 46 years.

But I'm rating it for what it is, not for how I remembered it, and not because it isn't in Japanese, and it still comes up 4 stars ... plus one more star for the interviews and commentary features on the Spec Ed.

If you wonder why a Russian and a German were cast as leads in an American Western, watch the documentary feature, "Guns For Hire." Or, if you wonder why the Mexican farmers speak perfect English (better than Brynner or Buchholz) and always wear sparkling clean white clothing (while the Americans are always sweaty and dirty), watch the feature. Which one of the Seven actually got married on the set during the village fiesta? Yep, it's in the feature.
