I have played guitar for well over forty years but only during the past five have I poured myself into learning jazz guitar.  Jody Fisher's method is an outstanding guide.

If you diligently work with through it's pages you will master an wealth of material.  A serious student will learn how chords are structured, a vast array of chords in many voicings, diatonic chord scales (which are a cornerstone of jazz theory) modal playing and improvisation.

The lessons are well organized so that a student who knows how to practice and works with passion and persistence can succeed in mastering this challenging but beautiful way of playing. The CD which accompanies the book is straight forward and helpful in giving you material you can play over so that you are playing the material in real time as you would with a teacher or another guitarist.  I can say that my playing and knowledge of theory has improved tremendously.

This is not a method for the faint of heart but if you are looking for a way to grow in you playing I would recommend this book whole heartedly. I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of the series.
