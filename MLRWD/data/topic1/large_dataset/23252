I had Scooby Doo cartoons as a child, the first time around that the series was aired. Loved my saturday mornings. The ONLY thing this movie has going for it is the first rate casting and performance of MATTHEW LILLARD as "SHAGGY". That dude is "SHAGGY" from every physical characteristic all way down to the voice! Of course, the computer animated SCOOBY DOO is first rate "actor" as well. The girl who plays "Thelma" gives credibility to her character, but, realistically, "Thelma" was more akin to the 'Professor' on Gilligan's Island than a lost in love puppy-eyed romantic. Sarah Michelle Gellar &amp; Freddie Prinze Jr. seem just as miscast, as their characters are misrepresented from the originals. Most of those classic shows should be left as they were in entertainment history...most "remakes" lack the passion and spirit of the originals and are so shamelessly camped up to total silliness. As with Casper, The Brady Bunch,etc. - PLEASE leave them as they were, maybe a series of full length cartoon movie features are best on the SCOOBY DOO issue. This is like all those songs the Carpenters, Karen &amp; Richard, rerecorded and made their own during their heyday...and to this day, NOBODY has dared to go near, remake or touch those masterpieces. Nobody recalled the originals and they became better known as Carpenters hits. You can't mess with perfection: IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE.
