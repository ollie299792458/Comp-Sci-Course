I keep on noticing identical reviews here saying this film is faithful to the book. It is not. Either they've never read it or they are lying. There are huge changes to the book, esp. in the second half of the film. This may not mean much if you haven't read it, but things like the Red Weed, Dead London and the Artilleryman's demented dreams of a brave new world, the chess game, digging the hole and all of the last two chapters of the book are completely thrown out. There are other big changes all the way through the film, like setting it in 1910s America, and lots of minor ones (the cousin becomes a woman the hero is leering at over dinner, the Ulla war cry has been changed, the man the Martians feed on has turned into a woman in suspenders! tacky!!!). The biggest change is that Wells' atheist take on events and the powerlessness of religion is completely perverted by the writer director.

So, establishing this isn't really the faithful version they claim should that matter? Not if the film were any good. But it's the worst film I've ever seen. It's not like a matter of taste - oh, I don't like Fellini/Lucas/Leone/Milius/old movies. It's bad as in really, really badly made. Bad acting, bad video cam work that shakes all the time, really bad effects. Not funny bad either, BOOORRRING bad!

Somebody said this was an insult to Wells, but it's also an insult to the audience. Not a faithful version, and not a good film. And no, I don't work for Paramount either, but even if I and everybody else here who hates it did, it would still be the worst film ever made from H.G. Wells. Next to this Val Kilmer's Island of Dr Moreau is Apocalypse Now!!! Big boos all round to the cheats who made this!
