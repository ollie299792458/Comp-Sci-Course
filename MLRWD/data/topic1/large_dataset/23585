I know a lot of people are saying that the original Spanish version (REC) is way better than this American remake. But I think that they did a pretty good job in translating the movie for us American viewers. Don't expect any grand special effects. This movie depends on tension and shock moments. Gore? Yes, there is gore but tastefully done.

The story follows reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) as they film their report about the night shift at a local LA fire station. It starts off slow, but we get to meet firemen Fletcher (Johnathan Schaech) and Jake (Jay Hernandez). Suddenly, the group is called off to what seems to be a routine call. When they arrive at the old apartment building, they meet up with officer Danny (Columbus Short). As events unfold, we realize that this is no order emergency call. Tension begins to grow as the building is placed under quarantine and people are prohibited from leaving the building. As all hell breaks loose, Angela, Scott, and Jake must learn to survive until the quarantine is lifted - if it ever does.

This movie creates a lot of tense and scary moments by being as realistic as possible. If you watch the special features - the entire movie is far from realistic. The apartment building, with its old architectural details and dark cavernous hallways, feels so claustrophobic - making it an excellent setting. The explanation at the end might piss off some people, particularly those that have to have movies have a defined conclusion. But I believe it leaves it open for discussion.
