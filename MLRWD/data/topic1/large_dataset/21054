This was a great documentary that demonstrates many of the great things about education in the world.  As a teacher, I was very pleased to see the outstanding results that came from incorporating many different subjects when studying one topic, letting students have some control and run with an idea, and getting students learn by having a personal investment in a topic.  By watching this movie, you are taken along the journey of a rural Tennessee's attempt to understand the Holocaust after a student wondered how many 6 million really was.  This question prompted the students to attempt to collect 6 million paperclips representing the Jews killed by the Nazis.  A school project gained national attention, but more importantly helped a school and a community learn something lasting about the Holocaust and the bigger picture of intolerance, hatred, and how words have the power to inspire attitudes and actions.  My only complaint about the documentary was that I would liked to have heard more of the thoughts from students and seen less of the logistical side, although a handful of students did offer some testimony.  Overall, it was a fabulous demonstration of the power school can have and the lasting lessons that can be taught.
