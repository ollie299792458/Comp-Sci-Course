This is one of the funniest movies that came out in 2001 in the theatres.  Kevin Smith made this movie not for the general audience but for THE FANS!!  The references and inside jokes from Kevin Smith's other movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma) make up a lot of this movie.  If you have not seen these movies you will not get some of the jokes.  You don'tneed to see the other movies to enjoy the movie but it is highly reccommended.  If you are planning on buying this DVD I highly recommend picking up, at least, Clerks and Chasing Amy as well as these two get quite a few references in the movie.  Plus they are the two best movies in the View Askew series.  The special features on this two-disc set are like the other View Askew discs......AWESOME!!!!!  The deleted scenes, outtakes and many other features are worth every second you waste watching it.  And Smith is always known to hide some interesting easter eggs in his discs and this one is no different.  Even the film commentary is entertaining.  Ever since Bill and Ted's Execellent Adventure, every movie studio has tried time and time again to come up with their own version of Bill and Ted and everytime they have failed.  I don't think Kevin Smith was trying to come up with the best comedic duo since Bill and Ted but Jay and Silent Bob are a comedic pair like no other.  The best since Bill and Ted!!  In my mind even better since there is intelligence hidden in the deepest and darkest of toilet humor.  So stop wasting time listening to me go on and on about how great this movie is and BUY THE DVD NOW!!!!!
