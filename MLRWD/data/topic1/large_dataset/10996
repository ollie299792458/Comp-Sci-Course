This is by far one of the better from both director John Woo and Jean-Claude Van Damme. With a good music score from Graeme Revell and interesting story as Yancy Butler seeks her Father who was missing in cohorts with a group of mercenaries who excel at game hunting on the streets. It's filmed in New Orleans, therefore features some great shots of the city and later in the film of the jungle settings. Enter Van Damme as sailor Chance Boudreaux, who she seeks help from, sensing he has an uncanny ability of self-defense.
Van Damme actually delivers a pretty good performance this time around with his usual cheesy one-liners. Particularly where after taken in custody when investigating a crime scene is subdued by cops and taken to the station. A receptionist scolds him about trespassing being a criminal offense. Van Damme points to his bruised forehead with "Yes, that Officer was nice enough to mention that." A very good supporting cast includes Lance Henriksen as sadistic mercenary (he can play this kind of role in his sleep by now) Emil Fouchon and Arnold Vosloo as his sidekick Van Cleef. Add them with a crack team of hitman and that can only spell big trouble in game hunting. Wilford Brimley is a particular welcoming standout as Uncle Douvee.
RECOMMENDED TO ANY JOHN WOO OR MARTIAL ARTS FAN!
