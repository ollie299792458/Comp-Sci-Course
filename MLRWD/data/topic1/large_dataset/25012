The TV ads for this movie gave me low expectations and I enjoyed it much more than I expected. I thought it would be one long series of gags about the uptight career woman and the white trash surrogate.  There were plenty of such moments but the movie had a lot more to offer.

The cast was put together well.  I knew Tina Fey (Kate) and Amy Poehler (Angie) work well together from watching SNL.  But they can do the more subtle scenes as well as over-the-top comedy sketches.  And the supporting cast had some great characters:  Steve Martin as Kate's boss, the New Age-y head of a Whole Foods-type grocery chain, and Sigourney Weaver, as the inexplicably fertile and smug head of the surrogacy center, play their parts perfectly. The ending was fairly prediactable but that didn't take away from my enjoyment.

The DVD has both wide-screen and full-screen formats on a 2-sided disk.  The bonus features include an alternate ending (not as good as the one they chose), deleted scenes, and a couple sections on how the movie came together, as well as the usual commentary.  Given the comedy improv background of so many of the actors, a bloopers or outtakes section would have made a good additional bonus feature.

If you were put off by the TV ads for this movie, give it a chance.  It's better than one would expect from the ads.
