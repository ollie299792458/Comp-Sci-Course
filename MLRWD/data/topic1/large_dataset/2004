Peter Jackson has been re-creating a lost scene from the original 1933 King Kong while working on his $292 million remake.

The result - a six-minute scene in which a dinosaur chases men on to a log, then Kong throws them into a pit where they are attacked by giant spiders and crabs - will appear in a restored version of the 1933 film to be released on DVD in three weeks.

The scene was filmed in 1933, but cut because director Merian Cooper thought it slowed the film's pace.

Other than two pre-production sketches and one photograph, no remnant of the legendary "missing spider pit sequence" has ever been found.

Jackson, who cites the original film as the reason he became a film-maker, decided to reshoot the missing sequence.

He hired Hollywood director and screenwriter Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) - and veteran make-up and special-effects whiz Rick Baker, who played Kong in the 1976 remake, to help. Jackson directed and edited the six minutes and it has been inserted into the original film with careful weaving of music, visual effects and the right black-and-white film grain, so it appears as it was shot in 1933.

Though Jackson's King Kong relies on state-of-the-art visual effects to create the giant ape, he deliberately used the same techniques film-makers used in the early 1930s for visual effects. The work included stop-motion cameras, miniature environments, rear screen projection and glass matte paintings.

Jackson has emulated old black-and- white film techniques before. Some people were fooled into believing silent film footage for his mockumentary Forgotten Silver was real when it aired on television in 1995.
