A poor script with great actors just will not make it work. SLOW! We see the dad come downstairs, one step at a time. Step down and every body looks at everybody else, another step and every body looks at everybody else, another step and every body looks at everybody else, another step, all have 'meaningful' looks by now...

Also too many things that make you separate from the story. The bad guy takes an old 500 lb safe to be dumped into this sinkhole. Incidentally, he is running from exposure at this point. It is all he (being an older dude) and this big burly guy at the sinkhole can do to turn it end over end and finally - huffing and puffing - get it into the sinkhole - oh, hmmm, how did old baddie get it UP the steps from his basement, through the house, down the front steps and UP into the station wagon bed all by himself? Especially on the run?

When he 'falls' over the edge of the parking lot...? How many sheer cliffs have you see where cars can pull right up to the edge? There was only a 4" concrete beam on the edge of this very dangerous cliff... there should have been a big, stout railing but then he couldn't have 'slipped' and fallen over it.

Too many things like that - and the story - which all the readers say is terrific - falls flat in this film...

I dunno how it got any of the 5 star votes...

Note:  I DID read the book later - as it had gotten so many good reviews - and it was truly wonderful!!
