I thought this was a really good dvd. My only concern really, was the fact that the picture quality as people have said is a bit grainy, but on the positive side, I find this movie with the grainy picture adds some character. Most of the old movies looked this way, and adds a bit of creepiness to the movie.

But onto easter eggs. They're kind of cheesy, but are entertaining. If you're on I think the special features page, and I think the sound page? if you keep clicking the curser around in all directions it will jump up to a little square that is up above the words that says things like Trailers or whatever. If you keep clicking this same little box it plays a few different short interviews. Even after you watched the short interview, click the same link again, and it'll play a different interview. Not sure how many there are in total.

It's kinda cheesy though because it's just a still picture of whoever they're interviewing, and the sound is rolling. So it's mainly an audio interview, but with still pictures thrown in. They interview James Cameron I think, as well as Michael Biehn, and a few of the effects guys.
It's really cool. I mean it's not much as far as extras, but at least it's something, so I can't really complain. So anyone who has this dvd, and hasn't found the Easter Eggs, definitely fidget around with it, and you will find em.
