This is my actual first review that I've done, so I'll try and keep this brief. But I must say, without really going into the detail of the film(I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet), this film is, without a doubt, the best Jet Li film since his movies have hit the big screen in North America, alongside Kiss of the Dragon and Hero. It brings his true style of martial arts to life in this epic. I saw it twice at the theatre, but I'm sure I'll lose count when I have my own copy of it on dvd. Both Jet Li and overall martial arts fans will enjoy this story from start to finish. It's truly inspiring, and to see a diverse side of Jet Li's acting ability in this film, is awesome! Even if this is Jet's last martials arts film or not, Fearless will leave the viewer of it, in contentment, just based on the moral plot of the story; and Li's character overall.  In my opinion, Jet Li has proved enough over the years, with both, his martial arts and acting career. He is the best of this era, but in time someone else will come along to take the torch and run with it. We'll see. So if he's moving in another direction, then we as spectators, or critics, should put our own thoughts aside and just be happy for him; and thankful to have been able to witness another martial arts legend in action and very much still in his prime. Fearless is one of the best movies of the year, hands down. So wonder no longer if you haven't seen this film. Buy it today and see what all of the reviews are truly trying to say! God bless!
