After hearing so much about "The Wicker Man" I assumed that when I finally watched it I'd be let down. Happy to say that my assumption was wrong. Sure it is very hokey in some scenes, extremely campy and dated in the early 70s. In fact, at the beginning of some of the musicals numbers I started cringing at how corny it was. However, by the time the song ended I was enchanted by the bizarreness of it all. In the grand scheme of things these quirky aspects only added to the otherworldly charm of Summerisle.
After "The Wicker Man" ended I sat there going "Hmmm. Pretty good, but not all that impressive." A few hours later, I was still thinking about the film. Hours became days and I finally realized how much this movie stuck in my subconscious. Upon rewatching it, I was pleasantly amazed how good of a film "The Wicker Man" is. How the filmmakers presented a pagan society in modern times was particularly interesting. Though certain historical elements were twisted to fit the film, it was reassuring to see that "The Wicker Man" was fairly well researched. What makes the film so effective is it's ambiguity. Who is actually "good" and who is "evil?" The pagans or the christians? Sergeant Howie or Lord Summerisle? Is the idea of religion in general at fault? Lots of interesting questions. Unique idea. Great ending. A fun performance by Christopher Lee. All add up to a really good film. Modern pagans will get a huge kick out of this one.
