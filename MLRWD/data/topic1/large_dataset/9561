EvilSpeak, what can I say, I feel like this film was made specifically for me.  It takes place in the 80's.  Its about an out of shape, nerdy, military school cadet who gets picked on mercilessly.  With the help of a cheesy old Apple computer and an ancient demonic tome, he exacts gruesome, bloody revenge on his tormentors.  Wow, this film should be the bible for all nerds who have ever been bullied.  I, myself, was brutally harrassed in school during the early 80's and would have loved to have seen this movie for inspiration.  Unfortunately, it was never available in the video stores near me.  What a treat for it to be finally out on DVD, restored and uncut, with commentary by the great Mr. CLINT HOWARD!!!  Clint Howard is a brilliant and talented actor who is sadly underrated.  His scenes of vengeance are perfect.  I mean twisted spinal columns, flesh-eating pigs, projectiles to the head, decapitations, disembowlings and nekkid women!!  This is the perfect movie for dorks like me to cuddle up to on a Friday night, with an endless supply of soda and snacks.  So for all you hopeless nerds like me, get this DVD, call all your comic book and action figure collecting friends and spend an unlonely weekend for once watching this movie and discussing it over popcorn, potato chips, beef jerky, ice cream and pizza.  By the way, Clint Howard mentions in the commentary that he would be interested in making a sequel to EvilSpeak.  We should write the studios and demand that a sequel be made.  This movie is crying out for a second installment!!!
