Check this out...this is what I told my friend on Yahoo Messenger and maybe you all can see for yourself the strangest thing I had ever discovered on a dvd before. Here is what I told my friend, take it from there:

Me: I found the weirdest thing on the Simpsons Movie DVD
Me: Or things I should say
Chuckie: Whats that?
Me: First if you go back to main menu to change the audio from either commentary back to reg the movie will play from the start instead of going back to where you left off
Me: Second on track 17 while you have the commentary on when Hommer is floating on the iceberg the image will freeze and turn from color to B &W and  the comm. will continue for 10mins 40 seconds and then you will hear them go continue the picture and the image will go color again and the the image will unfreeze.
Chuckie: I wonder why it does that
Me: Something new I guess I thought my dvd was defected I had to take off the comm. and check the scene out without it and it didn't do a thing
Chuckie: Oh Ok
