Consider that Orson Welles carefully studied Stagecoach, then hired its cinematographer (Gregg Toland) for Citizen Kane.

Consider, too, that both John Ford and his financial backers spared no expense in hiring a first-rate troupe of actors and behind-the-camera talent.

And finally, consider that Stagecoach helped legitimize the Western as an art form, when previously it was largely seen as simply a reliable cash cow for studios with too many B-level actors on the payroll.

John Ford knew well what was needed and what he was up against in the battle for theater screens in 1939. He needed a film that exhibitors could profitably show in a year when Gone With The Wind was just one of a dozen top-flight attractions in a nation mired deep in the Great Depression.

He delivered, and Stagecoach is still as entertaining today as it was some 60 years ago. For those who don't like Westerns, Stagecoach is still a lesson in how to craft a classic film. The short story Last Stage to Lordsburg was expanded to fill the 35mm frame, but the original plot was not gutted. Ford knew enough not to ruin a perfectly good tale, so he matched his actors to the characters.

As a result, the cast of pros delivers. Abetted by terrific stuntmen and top-flight technicians and film crew (you'll be hard-pressed to notice any technical flaws), Ford produced a Western that that helped define the popular conception of the American West, for better or for worse.

In a later film, one of Ford's characters says "...this is the West; when the legend becomes fact, print the legend."

That's what Ford does in Stagecoach, in aces.
