The vicious world of Hollywood deal makers may be ripe for satire, but Swimming With Sharks does the job in such an obvious, implausible way that I never bought into the situation.  Kevin Spacey as the acid-spewing Buddy Ackerman is fun to watch, as always, but the choices that Guy (played by Frank Whaley), the main character, makes don't ring true once; credit Whaley's skin deep portrayal of the character for half of the film's problems. Ironically, for a movie whose underlying subject matter deals with screenplay pitching and approval, the other major failing is the film's script.  There are some funny, cutting lines, but after awhile it becomes monotonous to see Guy continue to allow himself to be abused.  The viewer is given little in the sense of an emotional progression from the earnest, capitulative character we see at the beginning of the film to the point where Guy snaps, and his ultimate decision is neither darkly funny nor affecting, just merely unbelievable in light of everything that has come before.  Swimming With Sharks had potential that might have blossomed with a couple more re-writes, but as it stands it hovers on the rather irritating underside of mediocrity.
