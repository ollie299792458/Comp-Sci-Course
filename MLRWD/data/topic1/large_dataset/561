Star Trek IV picks up where Star Trek III left off. The crew of the Enterprise(which was intentionally self destructed to trick the Klingons in Trek III)return (in one of the greatest if not the greatest Trek films ever created)to face the crimes for which they were accused of in Trek III. On their way to Earth to face the charges they are sent a message from Starfleet Command warning them to stay away because the transmissions from a probe are destroying the earth. When Kirk and crew learn about this and discover the transmissions themselves Spock picks up on the idea that the transmissions may be meant for a lifeform other than humans. Turns out hes right. The sounds from the probe are the songs of humpback whales. Only one problem: The last of the humpback whales existed back in the late 1980s. So Kirk and crew travel back in time in their beat up Klingon vessel to 1986 San Fransisco where they try to integrate themselves into their society and pick up two humpback whales named George and Gracie and return them to future earth hoping they can talk to this probe and send it on its way. So if youre a Trek fan this one is highly recommended by me but you dont have to be a Trek fan to enjoy this movie!!
