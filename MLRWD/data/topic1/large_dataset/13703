I've watched this DVD numerous times since I purchased it and I'm astounded each and every time at the grandness of this production.  The costuming, the stage design, the sets, lighting, sound design... it is all absolutely top-notch.  Above all, however, I'm continually amazed at the acting talents, particularly those of Ramin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, and Hadley Fraser.  Karimloo's Phantom characterization is pure genius, as he recreated a character who I used to believe was nothing more than an controlling psychopath who didn't deserve the love he so desperately sought.  And while the controlling psychopath part of the Phantom is still intact, for the first time ever, I truly found myself rooting for Karimloo's Phantom, if only because he gave the character a level of humanity that I think has been sorely lacking in the other productions that I've seen on film or live on Broadway.  There are moments where Karimloo's Phantom shows his vulnerability in new and refreshing ways that made me appreciate the show all the more, thanks to his brilliant performance.  I fully understand why so many Phantom phans (ha!) regard Karimloo as one of the best; I'm just sad that it took me so long to appreciate it.

Overall, this production should be considered the standard for how to properly celebrate a historical show like POTO.  The final 20 or so minutes with Sarah Brightman and the four incredible Phantom actors (I'm partial to Colm Wilkinson myself) is a fitting tribute to the history of the show.
