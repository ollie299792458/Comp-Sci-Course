Are you tired of all the "Sleepless in Seattles", and all the lame teenie bopper romantic comedies out there that have as much depth as a piece of cardboard. Then check the Graduate out. It's offbeat, out there and hilarious. It's quite a genre buster, comedy, tragedy, revolution, tons of stuff. Every thing just ties into everything else. It breaks bunches of taboos, especially considering that it was made in the 1960's, right before the anti-war movement, and counter-culture explosion. Ben Braddock is just out of college, an award winning scholar and a track star. But underneath all this Ben is disturbed, all  his life he's know what to do, but now he's caught at a crossroads in his life, just what is he going to do. Though his future is also offered to him ("One word....Plastics"), he wants it to be something else.....different. Plenty of things are different about this movie, with great acting and a kickin' soundtrack. You owe it to yourself to at least see it once
