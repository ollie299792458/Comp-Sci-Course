The cast in this film performed to expectations working with a plot that hardly was impressive. A female army captain deserved the medal of honor and wound up getting it. But the main story was that one of her subordinates rather than the enemy shot her in a firefight in Iraq , in a mini-mutiny. There was no cover up by the Army, although Lt. Col. Serling (Denzel Washington) made it seem so to his commanding general who wanted the case wrapped up quickly only because of high level pressure to make the first Medal of Honor award to a female soldier. It made no sense to me. Sure, if the Army had tried to prevent the right outcome, there would have been a plot but the only thing Col. Serling was chasing and uncovered was cowardly performance by one of the troopers in Captain Walden's crew. The only cover up was by two of the troopers, the one who shot Walden and the medic (Matt Damon).

The parallel plot of the Lt. Colonel Sterling's own friendly fire accident as a tank commander seemed almost extraneous and connected only faintly in my mind to the main theme.

The movie could have been more provocative but far less politically correct if Captain Walden had been found ultimately unworthy of the Medal and that the Army had been trying to make the award to please a P.C. administration.  It's as if something of this nature was in the writer's mind but he knew it wouldn't fly so he twisted the plot around to make it more acceptable and unhappily, nonsensical.
