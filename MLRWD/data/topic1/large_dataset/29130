Long Day's Journey into Night combines a classic play with a talented cast of actors to create a striking cinematic version of Eugene O'Neill's drama and life.  The movie depictions of provide an effective, dark look at the flawed characters O'Neill created from his own life many years age.  Katherine Hepburn's Mary is more intense on screen than the printed work could convey.  She produces a scary visual of the personal and and family damage done by addiction.  Director Sidney Lumet reinforces the edgy, frayed tension, doubt and despair with his invdividual shots and with his ability to capture the character interactions in this troubled family.  I appreciate the depth of O'Neill's work and how wrenching it must be to lay his life and soul open for all to see.  Whether you know the play or not, the movie is a riveting look at a family the reader and viewer know is in a crisis, through the eyes of an author, a member of that family, who came to realize the crisis himself.  Art will never reflect life any better than this.
