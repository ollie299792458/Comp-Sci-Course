Very enjoyable music concert DVD. (Also available in CD.) I especially enjoyed the great guitar playing of Jeff Beck (one of the very best) and the wonderful singing and voice of Imelda May.  Imelda May's band is also excellent. Some great songs too.

Rock and Roll, blues, rockabilly and jazz.  Great performances. Recorded Live at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York City in 2010. The sound recording is also great.  Sounds like you are in the concert venue.

The DVD also has bonus features.  An interesting interview with Jeff Beck.  A very cool "At home with Jeff Beck and his guitars"  where he explains where he got some of his collection of guitars that is fun and footage of Jeff Beck with Les Paul in concert. There is some behind the scenes footage. I do not like the part where a fan says that he saw Jeff Beck at Madison Square Garden and he thought Jeff blew Eric Clapton away. I don't think either one blows the other away. I don't think Eric would have someone on his dvd say that he blew another guitarist away. You could get fans that think Jeff is better and fans that think Eric is better. They are both great.

This is an awesome album.  The CD was nominated for a best rock album grammy and I think it should have won.  I think that it should have been nominated for album of the year grammy along with Eric Clapton and Wynton Marsalis Play The Blues Live at Lincoln Center.  Excellent.
