Billy Jack is the cornerstone of our modern day "One Man against the World" film genre.  Yet this film goes a little further in it's portrayl of a man with a tendency toward violence living in a world of pacifists.  As a testimonial of the times, when the equal rights movement, hippies and spiritualists were in full swing, this film shows us a glimpse of how much things have changed (and yet remain the same).  Before the term 'Hate Crime' ever existed, Billy Jack had captured the essence of what it was and how it started - ignorence and small mindedness.  
While the DVD does not offer much in the range of extras, the film itself is worthwhile.  The commentary could have been better, and I would have liked more supplimental material.  The film itself is as wonderful as I remembered it from my youth, and the message of tolerance speaks true to today's society.
I love this movie for what it represents and what it tries to accomplish and when I was a very small boy I was awestruck by it and the man it portrays.  So much in fact, that I once asked a total stranger on the street, a man wearing a black hat, if he was Billy Jack.  He looked down on me, smiled and said, "I think we all have a little of him in each of us."
