I thoroughly enjoyed "Why did I get married?" despite being dragged to the theatre to see it. I was in a relationship at the time and was told I was similar to the one of the characters.

So when the sequel arrived, I was excited to see what had 'become' of them? Had Angela and Marcus finally worked their issues out? Would all the characters be happier as it seemed they were at the end of the first movie?

**Spoilers**

The movie opens and you get the backdrop that the couples are going on their annual retreat but this time to the Bahamas. A lot has changed. Children have been introduced and strains have been added to other marriages.

What I had enjoyed about the first flick was the 'bond' between the couples as well as their bonds as girlfriends and guy friends.

In the second film, each character seemed to have changed and left a different feel to the film. The same actors were used but you could sense that they all were somehow not the same.

It's a movie I would watch again to see if I missed something in the theatre.. but I'm not sure I'd own this sequel.
