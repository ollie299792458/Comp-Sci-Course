The Sound of Music is such a enchanting film.  I was engrossed from the moment I heard Marias' voice on the hilltops to the conclusion of the story. The slight mischevious nature of Maria and her lively zest pervade  the somber Von Trap family.  Every song is excellent, and the voices that  sing them are equally excellent.  The film overwhelmed me with its magical  and moving progression and I was sad to see it end!  The characters of  Maria, Captain, and the children are wonderful and likable.  Of course  there is a need for some kind of villian, and the baroness plays that part.  I am pleased to say that this movie is the best film ever created because  it truly touches the hearts of viewers more than any other film I have  seen.  The combination of the beautiful voices, exciting songs, likable  characters, and magnificent plot line and scenery makes this movie close to  perfection.  I am enthralled by the story each time I see it, and no other  movie has captured my attention and admiration to that extent.  It is so  magical that I must recommend this film for everyone, children and adults  alike.
