Sleek, stylish and bathed in rich hues, the movie based on the popular TV series far surpasses it's predecessor.  Helmed by Brian DePalm, whose resume is a monument of inconsistentcy ranging from the great (Blow Out) to  the not-so-great, he's the definative hit-or-miss director.  And this one  he knocks out of the park.  Tom Cruise takes on the leading role of Ethan  Hunt (adding to his credibility as more than a pretty face) and does a  convincing job with a role that in less suitable hands could be viewed as  one dimensional.  Things get rolling early and often as the team of C.I.A.  agents prepare an elaporate sting of a computer pirate looking to cash in  by selling a list of undercover agents to the highest bidder.  Before long  the plan falls apart and Ethan finds himself the only surviving member of  his team and in turn is suspected of killing the others.  Though the plot  is more intricate than it seems, don't be fooled (after all this is a  popcorn movie).  All in all it's a rip-roaring adventure with assets that  far outweigh it's faults.
