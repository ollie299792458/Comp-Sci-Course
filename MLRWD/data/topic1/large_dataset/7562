For anyone who enjoys historical movies and action movies, this one is for you.  The movie is well made highlighting a legendary event (that probably never occurred) of the massacre of the 9th legion in 118 AD.

That event and the lead up is only the beginning of the story, however.  The main story is the attempt of 7 soldiers to escape the Picts after this massacre and return safely to Roman Britain and their trials and tribulations on the way.

Their travels take them through Scotland and the scenery is breathtaking.  The mountains, the snow, the cliffs, etc. and all of this was filmed right there in nature.

The battle scenes are violent and bloody.  The director and his staff leave nothing to your imagination as people's heads are chopped off; people are impaled on spears (either through the body or face); etc.  At times, I found myself having to turn away from the screen because of the violence (especially during the massacre scene of the 9th legion).

The fight scenes, however, you can tell are well choreographed, especially the fight at the end in the fort. Some reviews claim that you can't really care about the people in the story, but at the end, I found myself hoping that they would survive, especially the Centurion, played by Michael Fassbender (who I thought did an excellent job acting).

All in all, this is a very realistic and well made film depicting life in that brutal time.  This is highly recommended for anyone interested in Roman history.
