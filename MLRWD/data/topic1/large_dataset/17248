I'm likely giving an extra half-star due to bias, but really, this double-CD is a lot of fun. The bonus disc's full of songs that are easily as good as the main album and actually bring more of the band's personality into light. They take from many influences: one minute they sound like the Kinks (or the obvious Talking Heads tint), the next I'm hearing the Jewish folk song, "Hava Nagila"!

Yet what I find these guys do especially well is create an atmosphere. There's dark, flirtatious humor in Alex Kapranos's voice, and his writing is rather witty. They also know how to make each and every song catchy, and at once just far enough from the mainstream edge to be considered by music lovers of all kinds. So while this album isn't technically a masterpiece, I find it another in a line of those which respects music for what it is: an art form that represents the musician. You may not dig their sound, but at least it's authentic.

Highlights: The Dark of the Matinee, Come On Home, This Fffire.
