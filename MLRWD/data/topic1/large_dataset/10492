I first watched this film while coming up off four tabs of acid, and it was the greatest thing I've ever experienced. Amazing visuals set to jungle-icious music with non-stop action flying at you for the best part of an hour, a fantastic variety of cool and warped characters and a plot that parodies anime stereotypes and pushes them to the limit. Mutants, insane weaponry, criminals, cyborgs, genetic experiments, it's all here!

Now a lot of people may think that the storyline is a little patchy and confusing, but this is an intentional parody of often over-complicated anime plots. Anyway, the focus is on the beautiful, beautiful stylised animation that owes as much to American animation from the last 20 years as it does to Japanese.

I can't stress how good this film is, but it's more for the kind of person who watches manga films for the violence, comedy and vibrant animation than people who like intense plotlines, dark and moody drawing and the like.

Chances are that users of controlled substances are more likely to relate to this than others ;-)
