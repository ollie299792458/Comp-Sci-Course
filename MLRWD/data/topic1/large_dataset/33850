I am a big fan of horror movies and very rarely get scared by them, but of all of the ones that I have seen, Jeepers Creepers is deffinatly one of the scariest. Surprisingly, the movie succeeds in being very scary and creepy just from suspence and the idea of The Creeper. Don't get me wrong, it is gory and gruesome in parts, as the Creeper stalks people and steals parts of their body) but its doesnt need the gory to be scary, it is a scary movie on it's own, the gory bits are juast an added bonus!

Brother and sister college students, Darry (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are driving home from college to visit their parents for spring break when a mysterious stranger in a big rusty truck with a registration plate BEATINGU leads them on a harrowing car chase and tries to drive them off the road. Soon after this, Darry discovers and terifying chamber of horrors underground and the siblings are thrown into a game of cat-and-mouse with The Creeper, a demon who feeds on fear and seeks out people body parts e.g. eyes, tongue, which it eats to improve itself.

Jeepers Creepers is scary, suspenceful and gory and the charactors are unique and likeable. I would highly recomend this movie to fans of the horror genre.
