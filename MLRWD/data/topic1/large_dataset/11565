The story, very basically, is that a girl meets up with a spirit or goddess, not sure which, but that she will have wealth, but she will never know love, and that any man she does love will leave or die. Enter the handsome bad guy in the movie, and the good looking hero. There's several story lines going on. There's a captain who falls in love with her (lust more like), the servant who actually saved her in the first place who truly loves her, and the good looking bad guy who wants to possess her as a trophy. The servant type hero character is actually the last of a village the handsome bad guy wiped out, and so, he finds out that he has special abilities too.

There are parts of this movie that movie a bit slowly, but the sets, the dialogue, the story itself and the beautiful costuming come together to make this a movie worth seeing. Good luck finding it at rental stores, but if you like Asian Fantasy movies with vivid colours, moving storylines, action, adventure and richly made costumes, then you should make the effort to see this one.
