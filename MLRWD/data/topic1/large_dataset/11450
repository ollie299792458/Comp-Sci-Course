The pleasure of your company is requested at the Captain's table for dinner, dancing, loopy 1970's hijinks...and Love!

This series is like going straight to dessert.  There's no meat and potatoes here, just delectable, frothy sweets.  For some, it's a guilty pleasure.  But I have no guilt about it; sometimes I just want a cupcake.

Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Cruise Director Julie (Lauren Tewes), Ship's Doctor Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), Bartender Isaac (Ted Lange) and Purser Gopher (Fred Gandy) are your regulars and the anchors of the show, if you'll pardon the pun.  They're a family of sorts and the audience becomes involved in their lives and many loves.

One of the great things about this show is that it is like a Who's Who of 1970's/80's T.V. and film.  Part of the fun is to see who will show up next.  Each show provides several vignettes and offers up stars galore.  It was also a great venue for older film stars.  In season one (1977), volume one, you'll find:  Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, John Ritter, Jaclyn Smith, Robert Reed, Milton Berle, Charo, Michelle Lee, Diahann Carroll, Ray Bolger, Harriet Nelson, Steve Allen, Loni Anderson, Eva Gabor, Donna Mills, John Gavin, Polly Bergen, Phil Silvers and many more.

There are 12, one-hour episodes on good quality DVD's.  The shows look great.  The stories consist of people going on a cruise, often falling in love or dealing with their relationship problems.  But even when there's a problem, Gopher is always there to crack a joke, Isaac mixes a drink and Julie gets them out on the dance floor.  Frankly, it makes me want to go on vacation...in the 70's!

Life can get exhausting sometimes; we can't always go on vacation, but thankfully, we have this show...and cupcakes.  Set sail!
