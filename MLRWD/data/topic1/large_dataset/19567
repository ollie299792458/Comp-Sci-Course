This movie deserved the three Academy Awards that it won back in 1974, especially the Best Special Effects award - the fires were one of the key elements that made THE TOWERING INFERNO into what I think is the best disaster movie ever made.
  A dedication ceremony is being held at the Glass Tower, a newly finished building that stretches a hundred and thirty-five floors upward, with a lot of important people (the mayor, his wife, the senator, his wife, etc.). However, despite the building's architect's warnings, a night of celebration turns into a fiery nightmare when a fire caused by "fluky wiring" breaks out and begins spreading rapidly up through the floors, towards where the celebration is being held.
  In every disaster movie that I've seen, there are always the same types of characters. There's the hero who predicts what's going to happen, but nobody listens to him (architect Doug Roberts -  Paul Newman), the hero's beautiful girlfriend
(Susan - Faye Dunaway), the hardcore veteran of past bad happenings (Chief O'Hallorhan - Steve McQueen), a guy who ignores what the hero says for his own benefit (Jim Duncan - I can't remember who the heck plays him), a guy who's the bad guy of the movie right along with whatever nature is dishing out (Richard Chamberlain, who played an excellant bad guy - I was so glad when he got his near the end), and thousands of desperate people.
  In spite of these similiarities to other disaster movies, THE TOWERING INFERNO does a good job of giving the audience a look at the relationships of different people and how their lives
intersect with others' as the disaster takes place. If you're a fan of disaster movies, this is the movie to have in your VHS or DVD collection.
