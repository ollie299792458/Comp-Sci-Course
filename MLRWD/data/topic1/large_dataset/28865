Anyone who buys the Mayberry image of Southern small town life will be greatly shocked after watching this movie.  Anarene is definitely no Puritan utopia.  The town's residents include adulterers, sex-obsessed teenagers, and even a pedophile, who happens to be the minister's son.  This film just goes to show that you cannot always believe what's on the surface.  Few films expose small town hypocrisy better than this one, while at the same time treating the characters with respect.  This difference is what sets this film about from the typical teenage sex comedies, which are not worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence as this cinematic classic.

The performances are all outstanding, but the performances of Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman are especially noteworthy.  It is not difficult to figure out why both won Oscars for their roles.  No one but Ben Johnson could have played Sam the Lion.  Even John Wayne couldn't have pulled it off.  Cloris Leachman's dramatic scenes made you forget that she was a regular on the Mary Tyler Moore show.
