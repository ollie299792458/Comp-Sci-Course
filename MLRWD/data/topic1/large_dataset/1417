This is a quirky little French film that I, personally, found pretty enjoyable.  Admittedly, I was drawn to it by the starring presence of Italian bombshell Monica Bellucci, and if you are a Bellucci fan this flik delivers!  Bellucci plays an 'escort' girl who is hired by a sort of nerdy guy, who claims to have won the lottery, to be his full-time, live-in 'wife' - until the money runs out. She accepts his offer but, unfortunately, she already has a 'boyfriend' who is a  gangster type and the plot thickens.  While this premise sounds like it might lead to some heavy situations, the movie is actually (surprisingly) light hearted throughout and almost surreal at times - both Euroflik qualities that I enjoy, as they differ from the typical Hollywood treatments. If you're looking for, or expecting, some meaningful arthouse noir-ish action this movie may not satisfy - it is somewhat enigmatic and goofy. If you're looking for a nice dose of Monica Bellucci then you won't be disappointed - this flik showcases her charms & beauty quite nicely and includes several nude & sex scenes that make you wish that YOU had won the lottery and could hire her to be your mate! While the total filmic experience was a little uneven - at the end of the watch I found myself with a smile on my face... so I guess I'd recommend it!
