This is probably the fourth or fifth time I have seen "Synecdoche, New York."  I've not felt such emotion as I had this time, crying towards the end.  The first viewing, yes, it seemed a bit confusing, albeit very comical and disarming with emotion.  The second viewing, I wanted to pay close attention to understand the story.  This time, I payed very close attention to each and every character and their names (used several times on other characters as well).  I am no expert in drama or theatre, but this whole movie feels like a big metaphor.  Nothing is real, but only meant to symbolize something else; the burning house, a play about a man's life while he's living it, the city within a warehouse, lines like "can i have a nickel if i doesn't play with my pee pee" remarked by Caden's second daughter, infectious disease in cattle?  I mean, it all seems like an absurdist tragicomedy and yet it all makes perfect, beautiful, wonderful sense and hits you like nothing else I have ever witnessed.  Maybe that is what Mr. Kaufman was trying to "say", in a way to present life as an ongoing work of our own art, that the absurd is more real to us than the real, that theatre gives us a way to play out our own emotions, every single one of them, every situation, every person, every character.  In short, I do not know, I am not an expert.  I just know that this film has touched me every single time.  The music, the dark, gray cinematography.  I have to admit, I was not a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman before this movie, but this is one of the best and most tragic performances I have ever seen.  He is perfection from beginning to end with a wonderful cast of supporting ladies.  Same with Samantha Morton.  Beautiful, beautiful, somewhat ironically endlessly watchable film.
