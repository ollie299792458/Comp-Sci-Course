This movie was a truly fascinating sequal, made to be a "reenactment of actual events" which followed the release of the first movie.  Shot as an typical movie, with the handheld camera footage integrated in, the movie presents an interesting contrast with the original.  Where the first movie focuses on events that happened to the characters, this one focused more on what the characters themselves did, and spotlighted what is, in my opinion, the Blair Witch's greatest power; the ability to control and manipulate others.  This was hinted at in the first movie with the Rustin Parr murders, and shown in greater detail in the comic book (the Robin Weaver story).  I was also impressed by the presentation of this story as a factual event, a plot device began in the first movie and carried out beautifully in everything else that's followed.  If you're a fan of the Blair Witch mythology, this movie will provide some answers, some more questions, and be very entertaining.  If not, you still might enjoy it, but it probably won't be nearly as engrossing.
