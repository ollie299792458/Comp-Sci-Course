When I saw "Dawn of the Dead" at it's premiere in early 2004, my initial reaction was to criticize the movie for failing on so many levels. In fact, it took me more than a week to understand the intention of this movie.

Although it does a great job of offering "shock-value," much of that dissipates quickly. And, perhaps more importantly, shock value is not to be confused with fright. Anytime a creature jumps from behind a corner, the audience is shocked, but very rarely does that shock transcend into legitimate fear.

At any rate, this movie does over several moments of intense fear, coupled with shock, and offered with generous laughs. What really makes this movie a hit, however, is the appearance of screen veteran Ving Rhames, a genius of the screen. His role as an unrelenting cop who attempts to whip the fleeing inhabitants of a mall into shape and make them submissive to him is an amazing one.

As I said before, watch this movie with the intention of thinking about it over the next week, and you will find that it is very rewarding.

My only complaint: A horrible ending. Beware!
