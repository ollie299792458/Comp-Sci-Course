John Hughes hit the nail on the head with this dynamic and thoughtful presentation about teen angst.  The Brat Pack does an excellent job of reminding us of all the cliques in high school and why we hated them so much, including our own.
The movie is set, for the most part, in the high school library where our protagonists are all held together on a Saturday detention.  Over the course of nine long hours of killing time, the brain, the jock, the princess, the troublemaker and the recluse all discover that, deep down, they really are not all that different from each other: they all want to be popular, athletic, smart, rebellious and also to be left alone.
The antoganist, they discover, is not each other, but the high school principal, and his myopic view that kids would all be little angels if they just wrote an essay on who they really are.
"The Breakfast Club" is a treat for any age group from pre-teen to adult.  You will see yourself in this film, no matter when you went to high-school.  The language is coarse, the teen personalities are vulgar and the high school principal is the person we all hated but grew up to be anyway.
The DVD quality of this film is very good.  Although the film was shot in the early 80's and the library and furniture will look very dated, the dialogue and the angst the teens face is not bound in time.  The extras on the DVD are fairly good, and the sound quality is excellent.
This film will survive the test of time.  So get it for your quintessential DVD collection.  History will hold that this will become a classic.
