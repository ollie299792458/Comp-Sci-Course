Released around the same time as the movie, "Tombstone", this movie is unfairly compared and it is true that the sequences surrounding the gunfight at OK Corral are more enjoyable to watch in "Tombstone" (where we got to know the villians better and therefore got to hate them more, neccesary in a good action movie)

But "Wyatt Erp" is not an action movie. It is an epic, concentrating on a character study of what made this man the legend he became.  Costner does a superb job. (better, and with more depth than Kurt Russell, although Russell was also good, so this is a compliment to Costner, not a complaint about Russell) Dennis Quiad is as good as Val Kilmar in his portrayal of Doc Holiday but he is not featured as much as Kilmar was and does not have all the good lines Kilmar had, such as "I have two guns, one for each of you."

I liked it. If I had not seen "Tombstone" first, I would have loved it and that is not fair to the producers so I am giving it a top rating.
