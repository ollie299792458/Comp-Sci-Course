So, I was looking at several 3d blu rays today in Best Buy, and asked an associate between a few of my ideas which one I should get, and he absolutely recommended this to me over the others, even though i said I wasn't sure I'd like it and that I don't like movies with bad plots and fighting like the movie 300, to which he re-assured me that this movie is entertaining.  As soon as I get home, I rottentomatoes this, along with my other choices, only to see that this has an AWFUL rottentomatoes rating, worse than the others.  Then I go to amazon, and see so many people arguing about it, many claiming it to be the WORST 3d in the world while many of you tried to convince me that it isnt THAT bad, just a typical B-movie with good effects.  Let me tell you, I have never fallen asleep 3 or 4 times across 4 hours and had to wake up and rewind back to what I remembered watching for any movie like this, only to still get about 1 hour in, not know what was going on, and not want to ever watch any more of this piece of garbage film that never should have been made.  And as for the 3d, where is it?  You can take the glasses off for most scenes and only notice a few blurry little areas on occasion, because thats generally the degree of 3d to this film.  3d only serves to make it look a bit clearer with a bit of depth, but has NO real stand-out 3d, at all.  Please, save your money for something better, like pillows and blankets so you can take a better nap than the one youd be taking if you tried to sit through this film.
