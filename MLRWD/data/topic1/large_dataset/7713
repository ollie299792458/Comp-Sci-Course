Although the premise is a tried and true formula, some elements were stretched too thin and others omitted.  As is often the case, it seems as if the final resolution is left until the end when, all of a sudden, the good guy is invincible and quickly dispatches the bad guy. (don't axe, don't tell)  There were many things that were either cut out or developed and dropped.  The incoming executive who smelled something foul - there was a developing storyline there and then it disappears..  Why waste so much time on taking tape from the monitor?

My largest disappointment was no epilogue.  I did not leave the movie with any real feeling of fulfillment, more like "left hanging"- I would have liked to see the secretary get the job back and a new car (another teaser?), the woman at the airport get promoted, and the family settle down after the traumatic experience with Jack developing new procedures so that wouldn't happen again.  After the lengthy battle, the police aren't even there yet.  Did the producers run out of money?
