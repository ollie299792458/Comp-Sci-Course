Night of the Hunter is one of those happy accidents which transcends both its creators' intentions and their limitations. Given its many flaws, this is far from a perfect film. Yet the same lapses in its cinematic technique: choppy editing, a strange blend  of acting styles, and uneveness in the film's cinematography and continiuity, all of which mitigate against the viewer's suspension of disbelief, lend to The Night of the Hunter the quality of a fever dream and elevate it to the level of fine art.

Everyone involved, with the notable exception of Charles Laughton, for whom this film represents his only directorial work, has, perhaps, displayed their craft at a higher level elsewhere, but the sum of this film's parts far exceeds the individual contributions of the players involved.

Approach it with an open soul and you will be touched in many ways. This is one of the relatively rare products of the Hollywood assembly line that warrants repeated viewings.

My only caveat about the current DVD release is that I suspect quite strongly that the film was originally shot and presented in a wider aspect ratio. I hope that a negative of its likely 1.85:1

original format exists and will be restored and released. To the previous reviewer who commented that it was shot on 35mm film and that therefore the 4:3 aspect ratio of the current release is  correct, I can only say: get a clue. Aspect ratio is a function of the shape of aperture of the camera used, not the size of the film stock. Given the number of reviews of the film here at Amazon and its increasingly positive reputation in the critical community, I'd suggest that there is enough interest in The Night of the Hunter to warrant a proper release.
