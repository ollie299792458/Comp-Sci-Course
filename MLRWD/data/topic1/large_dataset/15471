Hello ALL,

I wrote a review on this movie when it came to DVD for the first time.  Here is the review:

Forget about Siskel and Eggbert or Leonard Malted's ridiculous reviews about this movie. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!!

As you can tell, yet another person loves this movie :-) I saw this movie when it was released into movie theaters way back when. Years later it came out on VHS which I purchased as soon as I saw it for sale. I have watched this movie many times over the years (on VHS and on Cable TV) and enjoyed it each and every time. One thing, which most people who did not see the movie in theaters missed out on, is the scope of the movie. This movie has a very wide aspect ratio and a lot of what the director wanted you to see is cut off when viewed on Cable TV or VHS tape (PAN and SCAN). This is no doubt a great movie for DVD because of that fact. I am very happy they finally decided to release this movie on DVD. People who did not see it in a theater who love this movie, but did see it on regular TV (PAN and SCAN), will go wild over it when they see the WIDE SCREEN version which will include all the action they missed out on with the PAN and SCAN version.

Get ready to see this movie for the first time all over again when it released on DVD. ENJOY EVERYBODY!

END REVIEW.

Now, I WILL definitely buy this movie again on Blu-Ray because I played the DVD so much, the hole in the center of the DVD wore out. :-)

I HOPE EVERYONE ENJOY'S THIS GREAT, CLASSIC MOVIE!!!
