Interesting type art from norm as well as presentation. Sound track is very good as well as art and visuals. I like traditional old Japanese style art and architecture and this anime has a lot of the style. Slow paced, almost thoughtful with weird twists in plots. Each episode is more or less standalone with central character and different manifestations of Mushi being common thread. About 1/3 of the way into the series you learn how he got to be a Mushi master and why his hair is silver and why he has only one green eye (other is glass). I really liked it. No fan service or T&A and big eyed girls and guys. Takes place in the country side of mid 1800's Japan from what I can tell. Main character wears western style clothes why every one else is in traditional garb. Plots are a little dark as Mushi are creatures of the world we don't see, but that interact with us, usually in a negative or benign way.  The Mushi master is like an exorcist being able to see them while normal people cannot, and get rid of them or treat the maladies they cause.
