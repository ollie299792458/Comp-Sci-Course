This is an amazing animated feature.  The animation was so incredible, great story, interesting villian, some great songs-- awesome action scenes.  I was blown away by the movie.  BUT, I must say that the villian is pretty scary, so I'd highly recommend pre-viewing this film before showing your children because you will be the best judge if they can handle it or not, but believe me, you watching it alone will be worth the price because chances are, with or without your kids, you'll love it.

Things that stick out... I love the characters, the way they look, and the reluctant love story that blossoms-- great chemistry for animated characters!  The animation is unforgettable.  The three major action sequences were great, especially the train wreck-- wow.

I don't know when my kids will be old enough to view this (maybe around 8?), but after warning them that the spooky guy is only part of a cartoon, I hope they like this movie.  Oh, and my favorite song is the one the scary guy does-- very fun.

Enjoy!
