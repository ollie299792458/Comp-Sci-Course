This has got to be one of the best and worst movies of all time.

Best because it's so entertaining and full of dizzying plot twists. Worst because it's ridiculous and full of silly plot twists.

Alistair MacLean was something of a genius at keeping riveting suspense going -- never mind it doesn't all make sense.

Parachute drops -- allied commandos behind enemy lines -- masquerading as German officers, infiltrating an impregnable castle via spy and on top of a cablecar.

Battling the Germans throughout the castle -- jumping from the cablecar, tricky rigged explosives set off by a passing bus.

That was a cute trick. Some of the reviewers forgot that Burton and Eastwood prepared for the escape by rigging explosives all along the roadway. Unlike some modern movies, this one shows them doing it.

Then you have Burton with that incredible voice and Eastwood playing off him rather hilariously. I have never forgotten Burton's "Broadsword calling Danny Boy."

The dialogue is actually pretty witty, if you pay attention:

Major Smith:  "Lieutenant, in the next 15 minutes we have to create enough confusion to get out of here alive."

Lieutenant Schaffer: "Major, right now you got me about as confused as I ever hope to be."
