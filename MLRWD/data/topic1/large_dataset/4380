In response to the person who felt this was the kind of "bad" entertaining movie that Ed Wood used to make I can only say that they must have missed the point of Wood's life. He was by all accounts a  "man-child" of the first order. That is to say he pursued his  goal of making movies in much the same way that a childish (not a  child-like) person does- in spite of an obvious lack of talent.
The fact  that Wood is praised for this seems tragic in light of his sad, sad life.  There's nothing funny about the lonely, alchoholic person that Wood  eventually became. In short he should have concentrated more on his  personhood. 
But the fictional child in this character actually goes  through the process of maturation- death to the old self and rebirth into  the new. Something Wood was never able to accomplish in his life.
While  The Reflecting Skin may offer a dim reflection but at least it meets the  process of growing up head-on. Ed Wood's innocense was dissipated slowly  and torturously, his movies are only a reminder of that.
