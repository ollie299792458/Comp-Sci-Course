Double Jeopardy is a uniqe film as to story and plot line combined.  This is an action movie and a story teller too with much to offer and much to  see.  Imagine that you've been convicted of murdering someone, now imagine  that your sentence has been cleared and your free from that hole known as  prison.  Going by the real laws of Double Jeopardy, you cannot be brought  back to court for the same crime you've commited.  Well, that's good, but  the person your accused of murdering is still alive, what to do?  Hahaa,  I'll leave you to find out.  More times than not, this movie had me  suprised, with so many twists and turns and an awesome cast to follow it,  you'll be on the edge of your seat or log, what ever you prefer to sit on.  Quite a nice change from the bang-bang your dead type movies and a nice  pace change from the hack movies of yore.  Great at times, baffaling at  others, this movie has it all and it has so much more.  Knowing that the  movie is already ruin because of the all too much reavealing on the preview  screens, you must rent the movie first, to see if you'll like it.  More or  less, you will.
