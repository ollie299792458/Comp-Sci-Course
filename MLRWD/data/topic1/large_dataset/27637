Spiderman was great.  Daredevil was passable.  But the Hulk is something else entirely.  I'm sure Ang Lee was trying to make this film seem thoughtful and deep, but he came a lot closer to mere incoherence.
We start out with lots of images of fancy lab equipment and mysterious experiments, then add in a bunch of mysterious, incomplete character images.  If it weren't so damn boring, it might have pigued my interest.  We all know that the Hulk's coming, but how do the pieces fit together?  At least thayt's what I might have thought if there had been anything to make me care. Instead, I just wished they'd get on with it.  And when they finally do get the big green guy on the screen, there was nothing good enough to redeem the lost time.  In fact, even the Hulk sceens got pretty monotonous after a while.
Oh yeah--  The split screen thing to give it a comic book look was a nice idea, but it didn't work at all.  It's just gives me another reason to want to turn it off.
There's a whole disc full of special features, but by the time I'd finished the movie, I really didn't care to watch them.  
Maybe hard core Hulk fans would like this movie, or maybe they'd be disgusted with the blown opportunities.  I don't know.  But I'm pretty sure that most everyone else would be much happier watching something else.  Even something with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.
