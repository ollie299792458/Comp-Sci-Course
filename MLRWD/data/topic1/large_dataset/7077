This series is an excellent resource for married couples and those singles who are planning to be wed in the near future.

Pastor Gungor gives a lot of information, using his wit, humor, and personal experiences as both a pastor and a husband, which may be just what someone needs to rekindle their spark in their relationship, or to obtain a better understanding of what a marriage is.

This series could also be used in a group setting where a segment is viewed, and the couples are asked to respond to a question that relates to the material viewed, and discuss their answers with their spouse in private. Here, it is most exciting to watch how those who attend, change throughout the viewing. At first they will be sitting apart, but together at the beginning, but there is a point during the program when you will see the couples begin snuggling up to their spouse, or holding hands.

It is well worth the money for the complete series. As it can be viewed over and over again, and you learn more with each viewing.
