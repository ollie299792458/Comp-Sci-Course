I purchased the Criterion version as soon as it was released. The Kansas raid has added footage this time, some of it important really to the story. This version includes a previously omitted scene near the beginning at the woman's farmhouse who feeds them that includes her son hiding in the barn, injured fighting for the Confederates. It clearly conveys the disdain the Confederate soldiers had for the bushwackers. When George Clyde and company take the Ruffalo character and three Union soldiers hostage, and they receive no answer to their demand to release some Southern men, Pitt, Clyde and their leader take revenge on the three remaining hostages--omitted from the earlier film.  At the beginning of the film, when Jake and the bushwackers destroy the roadside store which serves Union soldiers, Jake--in the original film--writes Jack Bull's mother. That scene is omitted from this version entirely.  Music is also changed, unfortunately; most notably, the music is omitted in the Criterion version when Dutchie reads the Union letter from a mother to all of the men after Pitt challenges him to do so. Due to omitted music in this version in two or three places, I did later purchase the shorter, original version of this film. Both versions have their plusses and minuses.  And if you want to know from Ang Lee why Dutchie does NOT shoot Pitt at the end, you won't learn it here. Lee leaves that deliberately open to the viewer to decide (although I think his screenwriter DOES give his opinion in the commentary). If you love the film, this version IS worth purchasing.
