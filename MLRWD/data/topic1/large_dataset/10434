Tarantino was on board for this one, so if you are not a fan of Tarantino, skip the movie.

This film is a combination of Western/Eastern themes. The title combining the name of a Japanese food and a spaghetti western, Django.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS!

The opening sequence stars Tarantino and he is ostensibly setting the scene for the film that follows. Once his intro is over, we segue to the typical western intro: man w/no name riding into a desolate town. Upon his arrival, the main character is confronted by two warring gangs, each trying to find the town's hidden treasure. (I'll be honest, I am NOT a Tarantino fan, so I always skip his intro, for me, it adds nothing to the film.)

I thought the next scene was pure gold: shot well, acted well, and interesting from a cinematic pov. Note that the actors are Asian but all seem to speak very good English. I felt as if I were watching a simple western.

The Eastern element is added to the film by the presence of an older women who acts as a sort of guide for the man with no name. I felt as if she was there to frame the story and make sense of the bigger ideas that were meant to exist (battles, choosing sides, what it means to be honorable).

But, I will be frank, I am still not sure I understood what the movie was trying to convey. I enjoyed watching it (much as I enjoy watching Leone's spaghetti westerns), but I don't know if my search for deeper meaning was a stupid one...maybe there really wasn't a point to this film?

So, to buy or not to buy? I bought my copy, mainly b/c the box cover was cool and I was intrigued, but I would suggest that you catch this on cable, rent it from Netflix, or watch some scenes on youtube. Only buy it if you think it really is YOUR thing.
