If you are looking for the best Hellsing anime, this is the one. Though some may complain how it doesn't follow the manga all the way through its run when it does seperate it does it well. The animation isn't as flashy as its newer Ultimates counterpart, but it is done well, fits the theme and is consistant, something the newer one would benefit from.

The characters are fleshed out fairly well in this version of the series and the mood, atmosphere, soundtrack, storytelling, are all very well done. You have a tendency to get into the characters of this version than in the newer one which relies more on action to drive it, this is especailly true of Integra and Seras, though Sera could do to be less timid. The english Dub is also very good, and as a whole elevates the series, given its location and subject matter.

I have never read the manga, my first exposure to Hellsing was this series, I have seen the first three volumes of the new one and without a doubt this version is the superior overall series so far, even if it does not follow the manga religiously.

I highly recommend this series.
