Firstly, this is a scintillatingly irresistible document of Caballe in the full rush of her glorious & triumphant success. But even more than that, this is what opera is all about...unpredictable and unexpected elements coming together in a production that result in the essential meaning of a work taking off in full inspirational flight.

For me it's especially the confluence of this beautiful outdoor venue and old Roman ruin, Theatre Antique d'Orange in Aix En Provence in the south of France, an unruly Mistral wind making life difficult for recording engineers and performers alike, and this Bellinian wonder that make this audiovisual record so memorable.

Caballe IS a goddess! At the very end of 'Casta Diva' when she breaks from her incredible concentration to cast a glance at an audience going mad with appreciation, the camera catches a glint in her eye...well it has to be seen to be seen...it's the most subtle and brief of moments but imprints strongly.

The other mains are brilliant too. Vickers is Vickers and doesn't disappoint...Veasey as Adalgisa is very affecting in the role.

The last word might go to the camera work that's at once idiosyncratic, original and really clever in a very artistic and rarely seen offbeat way!

Don't be put off by criticisms of not so ideal recording conditions...this is a transcendental document of what must have been nirvana for members of the audience...scratch that..IS NIRVANA for us now!!
