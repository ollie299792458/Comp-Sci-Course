...and The Quick and the Dead is at the top of the list.  Yes, the script is rotten, storyline implausible, acting basically one-dimensional, camera angles distracting, and gunshot effects ridiculous - who cares?  The same  descriptions could be used to describe most of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti  westerns.  Whether intentional or (my suspicion) unintentional; this movie  is a delicious parody of those westerns.  And you can't help getting  wrapped up in the story and rooting for the good guy (girl).  Don't expect  "The Unforgiven", but if you're a fan of spaghettis, watch this  movie and have a good time.  The music is dead-on-perfect.  Confession:  The primary reason I watched this movie twice in one day the first time I  rented it was 'that guy who played Cort'.  I'd never heard of him, but he  was gorgeous!  When Russell Crowe picks up his Oscar next March for The  Insider, I will cheer a deserved recognition for his incredible acting  ability - not particularly noticable in the Quick and the Dead, by the way  - but the thought of the extra fifty pounds and thin grey hair he was  decked out in still makes me wince.
