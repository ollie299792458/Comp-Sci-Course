I thought X2 was one of the best movies I've seen. Well, I might be slightly biased. I love the X-Men comics, I loved the first movie and I love Hugh Jackman. Anyway, I thought that this was the perfect sequel to the first movie. The first one was basically an introduction of concepts and characters. Setting the stage, so to speak. I am so glad they didn't reiterate issues in the second one to familiarize the audience with information covered in the first movie. It's definitely not a sequel that can be seen without seeing its predecessor. I loved everything about this movie. The special effects were awesome-especially Nightcrawler's "bamf" smoke. I loved the developement of Mystique's character- I always thought she was certainly Magneto's best ally- Sabretooth was a massive screwup who couldn't be trusted with the most simple of tasks. I don't think there's a single thing in the first movie that he did right. Anyway, Mystique got the job done time and again. Another character that I think was developed excellently in X2 was Jean Grey. In the first movie I sensed the depth to her character, her lack of self-esteem and frustration with Scott's overprotectiveness, but in X2 you could really see where her character was going. I can't wait to see her Phoenix persona in X3. Oh, and I thought Bruce Davison did a great job acting as Mystique acting as Senator Kelly. I loved the cameos by Colossus and Siren. Hope to see more of them in X3. Anyway, I think I've rambled on enough. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this movie. Highly.
