"The 1981 original boasted Ray Harryhausen's legendary stop-motion technique of animating various mythological creatures--it was his final feature project--and given the cornball approach of the movie in general, that was the main draw." This is the opening quote from the Amazon.com review and description of this Hi-Tech Turkey.  All the computer generated effects cannot make this film, and most of the other modern technological "masterpieces" of the past decade, worth watching.  I feel as if I'm watching a video game with additional, irrelevant dialogue when I view movies these days.  The script, the acting, and yes, the special effects in this new 2010 "Clash" are ridiculous.  Ray Harryhausen was a genius and his classic films, though definitely dated, still hold up well as much as seventy years later. I don't think that anyone will say the same about "Clash 2010",the Transformer movies,or their ilk ten years from now. I agree that the original 1981 Harry Hamlin film was a bit cornball, but it is "Gone with the Wind" compaired to this state-of-the-art mess! If movie studios are to continue to re-make the studio big shot's childhood favorites, please resurrect stop-motion and write a decent script aside from the special effects, or a at least have a guy in a dinosaur suit next time.
