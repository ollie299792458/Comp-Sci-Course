Do the right thing concerns racial conflicts that take place every day on a block in Brooklyn.  Throughout the entire movie it is tension filled and has an ending that smashes the blocks final racial breaking point.  Every character in the movie is somewhat racist, even though there are glimpses of different races helping each other there is another scene right after to contradict the previous scene.  There are no main characters in the movie; there is Mookie, the black pizza delivery boy, Sal the white Italian owner of the pizza shop, Radio Raheem, a giant black "protestor", and many more that inflict racial slurs against each other.  There is only one character that shows that she is all good and that is jade, she is the small piece of hope that tries to keep all the races together, but she is in very few scenes which also confirms the lack of understanding between the races.  The ending scenes of the movie can also be seen as the climax of this film, this is when Radio Raheem and Sal start to fight and Radio Raheem is killed by the police.  This sends the whole block into an outrage and they end up burning down the Sal's pizzeria.  After this incident I think that all the respect is lost on every race in the community, they have done the damage to each other and the communication is lost.
