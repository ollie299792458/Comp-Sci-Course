Charlie Wilson's War has a lot of things going for it:  Mike Nichols behind the camera, Aaron Sorkin writing the screenplay, a great cast spearheaded by Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and a true story as its inspiration.  So why does it all feel so unengaging and dull?  I was expecting a tightly paced, funny, smart and above all, passionate movie about one man who played a major role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Hanks stars as the title character, a Texas congressman who raises funds and provides weapons for the Afghanastans in their battle with the Soviets in the 80's.  He can't raise the money through the appropriations cmmittee he serves on, so he sets about covertly funding the Afghan's war via a pact with Israel and Pakistan, the fundraising of a right wing aristocrat (Julia Roberts) and the insights of a jaded CIA operative (Hoffman).

There's lots of talking and walking (Sorkin trademarks), but you never feel involved in the political wheelings and dealings.  You're relegated to the role of an observer.  The movie never conveys the sense of urgency and the need to do something that Wilson apparently felt after visiting an Afghan refugee camp.  The only times that the movie comes to life is when Hoffman is on camera.  His cynical yet canny operative is tough, funny and smart and he happily joins Wilson's efforts.

I'm not sure how much fudging of history the movie did, but it really doesn't matter because you never feel any sense of purpose or accomplishment from Wilson, and likewise you don't really feel his frustration when he realizes that the endgame gets completely messed up.  Surely a movie delaing with events of this magnitude could have stirred up some sort of reaction.  Not so much, as it turns out.
