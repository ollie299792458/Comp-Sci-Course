I loved Clerks 2! After leaving the theater, I felt like I had just gone back in time ten years. It was amazing to watch something that was able to actually take me to another time. Dante and Randall looed older, of course, but other than that it was as if the first movie just kept going and evolved into another story. It was deeper than the first movie, but that's the way life is, anyways. It's more complicated at 30 than it was at 20.

I could have done without some of the gross parts (like the donkey) but I loved the movie! I also thought the soundtrack was great! I have always been a Kevin Smith fan (with a couple exceptions like Jersey Girl and Dogma), and this one is right up there with the best! I have always thought he was talented and his movies were fun, but with Clerks 2 I actually left the theater with a huge appreciation of his talents and his ability to recreate a place and time. I can't wait until the box set comes out so I can spend a day having a "Clerks Mini-Marathon".
