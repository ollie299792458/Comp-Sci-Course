Robert Conrad was in his finest form. My brother and I would never miss a chance to see what Jim and Artie were going to save the United States from this week.  What would be the nifty gadgets they would use, or the disguises we see Artie in.  The best days of my youth were spent pretending to partner up with West and Gordon to solve the toughest crimes and catch the worst bad guys. Dr Loveless, as a bad guy, had no equal, but his good guy match in James West always showed that if the good guy was clever enough, he would always win.  And get the girl.  Go to work and kiss pretty girls. No finer work...if you can get it.
Now for the rest:
I found the packaging to be imaginative and easy to use.  The seasons are color coded and well marked.  I did not need any further packaging such as individual sleeve wraps. The commentary by Robert Conrad was interesting and informative.  The backstage look at Ross Martin and Michael Dunn gave more than a few laughs and some groaners. I never knew Ross was an artist and a concert violinist.  You'll just have to get the set and find out for yourself. I can't give it all away.
Wild Wild West is one of the best sets I have ever viewed. If you are a true James West fan, you won't be disappointed.
