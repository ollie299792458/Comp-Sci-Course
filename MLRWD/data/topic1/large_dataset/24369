I saw this digusting, wonderful, terrifying, and hilarious movie in it's first run way back in 1979 when I was 20. It was opening night for the film at the moore theater in The Seattle Film Festival. I remember going berserk along with the rest of the crowd - it was like a party! Well, here it is, 2012, and I'm 53 (sigh) - I just bought the boxed edition of this and friends, after 33 years this film still KICKS ASS! Get past some of the Disco Clothes and Hair, and you're in for the ride of your life! The film works on so many levels that I don't think thar the word GENIUS is overused here at all. It's got Gore, laughs, satire, a terriffic score, great acting, and is stuffed throughout with little goodies like the actual military, bikers riding through a shopping mall, some of the goriest special effects you'll ever see, but most of all, a great script, story, and acting. It's a solid film from the inside out and does not depend upon the effects to make it work. It also gives you 4 likeable characters that you want to survive, you care about them from the beginning. I'm turned off by most horror because they seem to be about and aimed at a teenage perspective. Not this one. I can't imagine how hard and delicate it must be to mix horror and humor and not undercut either one. This movie manages to do it better than anything else I've ever seen. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!
