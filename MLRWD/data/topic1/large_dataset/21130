We started potty-training our daughter at 22 months, so Potty Power was just one part of the training.  It's equally annoying as anything on PBS kids.  The songs are infectious, but they help us to connect with our daughter when it's time to "wipe your bottom", for example.  She's still in her nudist phase so we sing "proud to wear your underwear" to remind her not to be naked.  It's a short video, but direct, and the princess tale seems like it's just telling the parents to get rid of the diapers and be patient.  However, there is no way we could stand this more than 3 times a day, even with tolerance built up from PBS, so we also got the Elmo's potty time, which runs 45 minutes.  We can ask her if she needs to "go #1 in the potty like Elmo?".
Overall, it seems to have an influence on our daughter, and she likes the videos even though she wanders away from them to play.  We used the methods from www.thepottytrainer.com to train ourselves to be vigilant. I can honestly say after one week (with a vacation over the long weekend to set her back) we only have accidents in the high-chair (because she can't climb out), or when she's really tired.  I should also mention our potty-training coincides with our carpet-cleaning.
