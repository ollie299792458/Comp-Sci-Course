One of the main reason I purchased this video is because of Dr. Oz's suggestion.  I really liked that he had all levels of the exercise covered.  His mom and another lady were behind him doing the routine at different levels for us to follow according to our own physical ability.  Joel actually carried out the program at a higher cardio level that I could not do but go for it if you can.  I have to admit I was sore the next day.  I  worked up a sweat also.  I usually only do Yoga stretch and the pool at the YMCA therefore I do not work up a sweat.  I need to get Joel's workout in my weekly program at least once a week and work up to twice a week for my cardio.  You can keep your level at a march and not jog which I must not do!

I really liked the fact the Joel was very informative about each move.  He explained the physical benefit.  I was also thankful that every move he explained how he was very sensitive to protecting our back!!!!  I have 2 cervical fusion,  a lumbar fusion, arthritis, and degenerative disks so my back is already in trouble.  I am very thankful to Joel that he is very sensitive to this.  I have been very angry at workouts that do not pay attention to this and many many people are injured because of this.

 The short little blurps of information are okay however very basic.

Thank you Joel and Dr. oz
