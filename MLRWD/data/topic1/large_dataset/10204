Despite the fact that this movie seems to embody the classic sports-underdog formula, and plenty of the main characters are sixth grade children, this is not a kid's movie or a family movie.  This is a dark comedy that will strike you as hilarious if you enjoyed Bad Santa or other dark, cynical comedies.  Billy Bob is a master as the foul-mouthed, alcoholic, has-been baseball coach of the worst team in the local league.  His comic genius is actually matched by the outstanding cast of rag-tag baseball players, who banter back with their coach and one another.  Each member of the Bears is an absolute stand-out as a character.

[...], this movie sneaks in a great message about proper sportsmanship and ethics in the final game against the Bears' arch-rivals.  The movie succeeds at doing the right thing without violating its credo and turning smarmy and cookie-cutter.

This is a remake that stands on its own, completely separate from the original version of the tale.  Watch this with an open mind, be willing to laugh at foulness, and it will be a fun ride.
