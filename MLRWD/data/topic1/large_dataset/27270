Okay, I'm pretty sure that some of you guys who have reviewed this have already taken your SAT's and probably didn't think it was as bad as the movie made it seem. Oh well, I haven't actually taken my SAT's yet (hello, I'm only 12, so unless I'm some genius it's impossible) but I think the movie was funny, I have older siblings who have both stressed over the SAT's, my older sister who just graduated this year saw the preview for this movie and she dragged me with her to the theater along with my best guy friend and her boyfriend. The movie was so funny! She saw it because she was worried about her SAT's and so was her boyfriend, they had already taken the PSAT's and gotten good scores but were still worried about the actual SAT's. Anyway, the movie had such hiliarious acting in it. Scarlett Johansen (who played Francesca) was like 10 times better in this than she was in Lost in Translation, I hate her as a blonde and that movie sucked, Erica Christensen did a really good job as Anna. I didn't mind Chris Evan's in Not Another Teen Movie but he did a much better job in this one. Leonardo Nam as Roy was hysterical! Bryan Greenberg did a great job as Matty and Darius Miles made a great Desmond. And of course I can't forget my absolute favorite actor, Matthew Lillard who was perfect for the role of Larry, Kyle (Chris Evan)'s college dropout brother who lived above their garage. I think this is a great teen flick, as soon as it came out I went to the store and bought it. It is such a good movie!
