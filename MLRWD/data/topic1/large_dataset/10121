Miss Pettigrew is one of my favorite books...and this film, alas, except for a superficial similarity in plot, has nothing to do with the book. It was so disappointing. Instead of a charming, light hearted romp full of funny misunderstandings and Miss Pettigrew discovering her fun side, you get a lot of Hollywood slop. You know, the standard formula: Delysia is a girl torn between money and love, Miss Pettigrew is torn between helping her or doing wrong to win her piece of bread...in the end Delysia is whisked off by the man of her dreams who doesn't have a penny, Miss Pettigrew gets engaged to a millionaire and lives happily ever after...The book did have a happy ending, but there was none of this formulaic and moralizing Hollywood tripe in it. Quite the opposite. Oh, and to top it off, the director saw fit to "lighten" the mood by putting German air raids in the background. Awful. I'm so glad I rented this instead of buying it.

On the positive side, if you've never read the book and have no taste for subtle British humor, you might like it. The casting is great, the acting superb and the period sets make for lovely eye candy. What a shame that the director completely changed the story.
