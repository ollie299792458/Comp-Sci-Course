As a huge fan of anthing faery and especially Brian Froud, I was very excited to find this one of a kind dvd about the exisitense of faeries. However I was quite dissapointed with the content or should i say lack of content. The people interviewed convinced me of nothing more than their need for a visit to a shrink! Not one of the people (with the exception of Brian Froud), revealled any convincing accounts of their contact with the faeries. One bit in particular caused both my partner and I to laugh out loud! A man who was taught by his shamin Grandmother to speak to the faeries, leads the camera crew to a beautiful stream and points behind a tree and says there is a faery behind it. He proceeds to make contact with this faery and says he is too shy to come out. The camera then focuses on this tree and nothing happens. Meanwhile the guy makes some weird hand gestures (supposedly communicating with the faeries) and makes the announcement that more have come out to find out what is going on. Further through the film we are taken to Canada where two teenage boys who appear to be very slow or under the influence of drugs, swear they saw a little man standing on a cliff whilst at the beach. I bet they did!

But really, It was a very dissapointing film. If I didn't already beleive in faeries from reading numerouse texts on folklore and celtic mythology, this film would certainly cause me to remain a skeptic.
