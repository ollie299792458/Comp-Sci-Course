When "Primary Colors" first came out I initially had no intention of seeing it, despite my
interest in the subject  because I had classified John Travolta as a non-actor.  But a friend
who had seen the film and was disturbed by it, asked if I thought the film reflected reali-
ties.  The question disturbed me because I could not imagine why he asked it.  So I went
to the film,  expecting a turkey.  I thought the casting director must have been a very close
friend of the actors chosen.

Well, not too many seconds after the film began, my pulse began to flutter.  This was just  not
a film like any others I had ever seen.  The film made real for me all sorts of facts that had simply
been abstractions  when I encountered them in textbooks or was exposed to them in
the media.  I was watching reality  like a voyeur looking through a keyhole.  I felt some embarrassment,
but I continued watching.  I was hypnotized.

Now, how then  did I react to John Travolta?  Well, I was aghast with astonishment!  What an extraordinary
performance!  I honestly cannot imagine how anyone could have played the part better.

  I haven't made a list lately of my all-time favorite films lately, but when I do "Primary Colors"
will among those at the  very near the top.
