Usually, I love what Kenneth Branagh does to Shakespeare. I even loved the fact that he turned one of Shakespeare's more romantic comedies into a big 30s musical. (Stop reading now if this goes against your "Shakespeare must be performed in codpieces and puffy sleeves" moral code.)

 I love Branagh in any role he performs (with the exception of Dr. Frankenstein.) I loved the women who played the Queen's attendants. I loved Nathan Lane. Unfortunately, the movie just doesn't gel.

 Casting Alicia Silverstone was a misled attempt to capture a youthful audience and her delivery of iambic pentameter is clunky and paintful. She should stick to defacing Jane Austen novels.  Matthew Lillard brings a lot of energy to his role, if only he could sing or dance or deliver a line that doesn't make me want to shake my TV.

 Only one musical number is tolerable. ("Let's face the music and dance") And that makes this movie worth watching.

 If you want to watch a Shakespeare movie, try Branagh's "Much Ado About Nothing" or Elizabeth Taylor's version of "Taming of the Shrew." Both classics.
