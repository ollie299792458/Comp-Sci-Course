A band that brims with excitement and delivers their musical repertoire with great energy and passion. I'm leaving off a star only because I believe it is on their current tour (2005) that they have truly mastered the stage. They are absolutely electrifying to see live. The X & Y album has proven that more guitars and rocking' songs are a step in the right direction. The ballads are beautiful, but no one wants to spend two hours watching Chris Martin swaying at the piano. What we are treated to now is a spectacular live ROCK show that is infused with total commitment, musical expertise and keen showmanship (captured brilliantly on the video screens, as well as the stage). Noboody is slacking in the band. They come out with a spirit of perfection and keep it going for the entire show.

The ballads now coalesce smoothly with the epic rock sounds. The band seems more confident in their tight delivery and the powerful effect it is having on massive audiences throughout the world. They are constantly pushing themselves to become better and better; and the results are certainly paying off. I see about 30, or forty, great concerts a year and Coldplay has proven to be one of the top five experiences.
