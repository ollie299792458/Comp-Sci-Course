Well Kino's journey is unquic series if there ever was one. the series is about a girl, presumably, traveling about on her talking motocylce going from country to another. And that's pretty much it.

If I had to pick one word to chose to describe Kino's Journey it would be somber. Rarely are there really happy moments though there are quiet a few of sad moments but threw out the series retains a somber mood of a detached onlooker just like the characters.

Another thing though serialized out side of two episodes none of the episodes have any conection other then Kino and Hermiese being in each one, which is rather rare for anime. One of the most unquic things about the series is Kino's attitude, she's not out to save the world, she's just wondering about learning about the countries she wonders threw, shes an observer and rarely medals with other people's affairs. There is no judgement just cause and effect leading to a rather believeable and reallalistic veiw of human nature.

The animation is well done outside of the majority of side characters being plan and cut and paste to each story. The music is intransing. the voice acting is also well done. The Philosophy which is the main focus of the series is interesting. The really nothing bad about the series except the lack of time spent on most of the side characters and the lack of any meaning or grander purpase. In the end the series ends just as it begins with Kino wondering about.

In all I'd say buy this one if you want a different anime or one that's more about philosophy then anything. It's pleasent series just lacking a purpase that would have made it a perfect series.
