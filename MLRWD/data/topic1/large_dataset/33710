I really don't understand how anyone could love this film. Yes, it has big stars in it, which surprised me.  But, they're in a film which has terrible writing, the star, Stanley, is a foul, disgusting, irritating human being.  I mean, he gets the opportunity of a lifetime for a job, which he desperately needs, and shows up in a disgusting t-shirt ("Young, Dumb & full of come") to his first day of work!!! Then, in another scene, he's eating a sandwich and talking at the same time, and blows chunks of it onto the boss's wife's back.  Kirstin's character tells him not to touch her!  Is this humor?  In another scene the boss's wife falls in a hallway, and although this ass suddenly develops ethics and decency, Kirsten again tells him to leave her, and he steps over her.  Again, is this supposed to be funny?  It isn't.  He should have been fired, slapped or killed so many times, I lost count.

It's a completely misleading title because he doesn't have any friends to lose, only the audience. His personality & behavior are completely reprehensible, totally offensive & inappropriate. We didn't laugh at all, and felt nothing but contempt for him, and no connection with any of the other characters, either.  I expected it might be shallow because of the nature of Hollywood, but I like that world at the same time, and hoped to like this film.  We finally turned it off just before he did who knows what to the starlet's dog in the name of "humor".  The "no animals were injured or hurt in this movie" rule doesn't sit well with me if I see something appear to be hurting an animal. Based on Simon's vile nature, and the rest of the film, I know we made the right decision.

Be like audiences and AVOID this movie.
