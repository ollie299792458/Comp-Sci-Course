Bogart and Hepburn are at their best in this movie about two symbiotic characters (Charlie and Rosy) who, despite being from opposite ends of the social spectrum, link up to achieve a common goal--to sink a German gunboat lurking in Lake Tanganyika during WW1. To me, the film is an egalitarian love story.  During the voyage to reach the German ship 1) Charlie and Rosie fall in love with each other; 2) the audience falls in love with both of them; and 3) everyone except the Germans fall in love with the lovable Tub That Could, the African Queen. Under Huston's masterful direction we experience metamorphic character developments: The scampish Charlie becomes domesticated and the prissy Rosy becomes a "regular" gal. At the same time, we enjoy watching them both become British heroes as they instill in each other the courage and determination needed to fulfill their objective: Rosy persuades Charlie to rig up the African Queen as a home-made torpedo boat and, after overcoming many hardships, they finally meet up and clash with the German warship. (That Bogie sounds as British as my uncle Louie from Brooklyn is forgiven in this saga--he won an Oscar for his performance, anyway--Bogie, that is, not my Uncle Louie. I believe Hepburn was also nominated but did not win--too bad.)

With its minimal cast the movie is fast-paced and riveting. The photography is superb. The screenplay and music are wonderful. The acting is top drawer.

I can watch movies (and actors) of this calibre again-and-again and find something new with every viewing. This is wonderful entertainment for all ages.
