Although it would be difficult to go wrong with Charles Dickens, this series offers more than just a wonderful story brought to moving picture life! To describe it with adjectives, I would use words like beautiful, stunning, intriguing, engrossing, artistic, breathtaking, mysterious, strong, and perfect. This is a visual, sonic masterpiece closely depicting an enduring literary classic. The screen writing, direction, casting, acting, cinematography, costume and set design, music, dialogue, character development, and story line deserve stellar ratings!

As a professional photographer, I found nearly every scene to be gorgeously and artistically composed, and very inspiring for my own work.

The first time I viewed this version of Bleak House, I watched it through from start to finish in two days--I was completely hooked. I loved it so much I began watching it again right away, and I have since purchased a copy for myself!

If you enjoy intelligent period films, beautiful performances, and classic stories, you will not be disappointed with Bleak House, directed by Justin Chadwick and Susanna White.
