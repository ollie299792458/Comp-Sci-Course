As a longtime fan of the GITS canon, I was eagerly awaiting the US release of Innocence... I wasn't disappointed in the film, it's one of the best anime I've ever seen and a worthy addition to the Ghost in the Shell universe. However, I have to say that the DVD is a huge let-down. First off is the cover art... Absolute crap. I found a link to the artists' original cover art, before he sent it off to Dreamworks, and it looks ten times better. Next up is the DVD insert. Wait, there's no insert. Strike two. Finally, how on Earth does Dreamworks think they can get away with publishing such a fantastically popular film in the States without a dubbed track, and with the only English subtitle track constantly spewing crap like,

"{rain falling}" ... "{gun shot}" ??

Ridiculous. If you're going ton include a hearing-impaired subtitle track, fine, just don't make it the -only- English subtitle track! I can only hope that a "Special Edition" is in the works, to fix what should have been in the first pressing.

Film: ***** DVD: *
