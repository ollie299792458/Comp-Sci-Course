For such a successful musical with a score by Richard Rodgers (music) and Lorenz Hart (lyrics), it's a bit surprising that it took seventeen years before Columbia Pictures brought it to the screen. But the wait was worthwhile. Our eponymous hero, if we can call him that, was played by Frank Sinatra (Gene Kelly in the 1940 Broadway show). He is a shallow, down-and-out, womanizing hoofer but, for all that, radiates charm and wit. In the movie, he has to choose between two gorgeous ladies - Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Tough choice! Novak is a timid girl from the chorus line while Hayworth is a former stripper who has pretentions of being a society lady.
The film score has many tunes that have become popular standards: `Bewitched', `My funny valentine', `I didn't know what time it was', `I could write a book', `There's a small hotel', and `The lady is a tramp', superbly delivered by Sinatra to Hayworth. Not all of these songs originated in the stage show of Pal Joey but they all slotted in perfectly into the movie.  This is 105 minutes of delightful entertainment.
