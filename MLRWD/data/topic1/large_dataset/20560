The theatrical release and the Special Extended Edition are two very different movies.

The theatrical release leaves many questions unanswered, such as what happened to the original soldiers of Fort Sedgewick, how did Stands With A Fist's husband die, etc.  The Special Extended Edition answers all these and more.

The SE Edition also shows some aspects of character development that are necessary to fully understand who the characters are.  And in some cases, the actual meaning of a scene or message is completely changed in the SE Edition, such as when Dunbar decides not to sleep in the Sioux camp the night before the big buffalo hunt.  In the theatrical release, you believe that he is embarrased about what the white hunters did to the valley of buffalo - in the SE Edition, the order of scenes is different and it is because he is feeling conflicted after seeing his Siuox friends catch and execute the white hunters.

The theatrical release left me with the message that the unfeeling white man had brutally invaded the native's world and destroyed it - the SE Edition leaves me with the message that we're all the same regardless of what color we are and where we come from, some good, some bad, but all just trying to survive.

I liked the theatrical release, but I loved the SE Edition.  I never did buy a copy of the theatrical version, but I did record over the one I taped. I would recommend to anyone interested in this genre, the west, people, or just a great movie to get the SE Edition (and forget about the theatrical release).
