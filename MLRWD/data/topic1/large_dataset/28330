I liked this movie, but if you're looking for something to redeem all the sorry romantic comedies currently out there (like I was), you'll be disappointed.
Reese Witherspoon's character, Melanie, is by turns selfish and likable and I wish they had been more consistent with her.  I ended up liking her in the end, but her snobbiness in the beginning made that more difficult than it should have been.
As for the men. . .Josh Lucas' character is both easy on the eyes :-) and a nice guy, as is Melanie's fiance.  And that's part of the problem too: it feels like the writers didn't want to make anyone the bad guy, so they wrote themselves into a corner.  No wonder Melanie can't make a decision.
It's really not a bad movie, though.  It's light, enjoyable, and though you wish that Melanie (and the writers) had made some different decisions, it will make for a nice afternoon.
By the way, the special features are nothing spectacular.  It's mostly just scenes and, in one case, an entire subplot, that hit the cutting room floor.  But take my advice on this one--DO NOT watch the alternate ending.  It was terrible and it has haunted my later viewings of the movie.
