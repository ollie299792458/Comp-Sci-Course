WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:

PLOT - it's all in the description above. Anymore might spoil it.

SPIELBERG - Yeah, he's only listed as a producer BUT this show has Spielberg all over it.

LENGTH - 5 DVDs tanking in at 15 hours plus a bonus DVD of extras.

SPIELBERG - Did I mention that Spielberg was clearly all over this thing like a cheap suit and if you didn't know any better you'd say it was directed by him?

SUITABILITY - May not be appropriate for younger viewers.

HEALTH CONCERNS - Classic Spielberg tension-building throughout. Parts of it will have you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding.

SPIELBERG - Did I mention that this is classic Steven Spielberg?

SLEEP DEPRIVATION WARNING - Be careful when you start watching this. You may end up into the wee, wee hours. At first, I watched a DVD a night (3 hours +/-). Then, on the third night, I watched the remaining three (9 hours +/-). Couldn't stop.

BOTTOM LINE - This is a grand, sprawling Steven Spielberg epic on alien abduction. 15 riveting hours of the master at work. It simply doesn't get any better than this.

RATING - 10 stars. A classic of science fiction cinema.
