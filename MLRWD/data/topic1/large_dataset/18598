I really thought this was some sort of sci-fi channel nonsense before reading any reviews or watching it.  I glanced at the four out of five stars rating and the total of forty-four user reviews and thought "okay, what is this?"  After reading a few reviews I decided I'd give it a shot, especially since it has actors from three shows I enjoyed: Dexter, 24, and Prison Break.  I did enjoy this movie, the team behind it did an excellent job casting.  These actors helped create a good aura of suspense throughout the film and it's refreshing when that happens in a horror/sci-fi movie.  I wouldn't classify this as a 100% sci-fi film or horror either so it's somewhere in the middle.  If you're into this kind of stuff and don't mind much a back story then this is a good movie to check out.  It's worth the three bucks for sure.

It's not without it's failings though.  The characters are rather one dimensional, not really even switching tone throughout the film or exposing any other side of themselves.  Also, although I personally don't mind the back story missing, some might and understandably so.  You won't find out what happened before all this mayhem breaks out and the opening is very ambiguous.  This isn't a problem I suppose, but it does add to the feeling of not really knowing what's going on throughout the majority of the film.  But, maybe that's the point.  We may be supposed to left to wonder what has happened to cause all of this, perhaps there is a sequel in store.

In the end, everything works out pretty well, the cast does their part, and we end up with a good little hour and a half entertainer that is better than a lot of sci-fi/horror junk out there.  It's great, just don't expect high productions values or some sort of story that will blow your mind.
