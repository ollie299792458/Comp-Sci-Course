I anticipated the release of the latest in the Indiana Jones series with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I felt that those expectations were only partly met.
  I didn't expect that this fourth installment would be able to top number three; after all Sean Connary and Harrison Ford in the same movie is a pretty tough act to follow.  However, I didn't expect a movie that couldn't even equal the quality of the second.
  Just as with "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", I felt that parts of the overall storyline had been skipped or skimped on to the point of hurting the flow of the movie.  Too often, the makers of movies get trapped in the prescribed formulaic methods they are told are required for audience enjoyment.  In doing so, the skips and skimps become overused.
  I am convinced that is what weakened this latest movie.  Trying to fit an elaborate story into a specific time frame isn't a necessity!  Adding a few minutes to each key scene to help flesh out the storyline can make it a vastly improved work.  The "Lord of the Rings" trilogy proved that audience members can take it!
  On a brighter note, I think these movies are still on the upper half of the ratings scale I use to judge the quality of my movies.  On a scale of 1 (meaning STINK-O, RUN AWAY!) and 10 (meaning WATCH FIVE TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT MOVING) I'd give "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" a 6.  Definately worth watching once, but not worth purchasing unless you are a collector.
  Thanks for reading!
