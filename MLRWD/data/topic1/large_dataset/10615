Peter Pan is one of the most entertaining and charming Disney movies ever made.  It follows the adventures of Wendy, John, and Michael Darling, and of course the boy who never grew up, Peter Pan.  Captain Hook is one of the funniest and evil villains ever created and his first mate, Smee, is absolutely hilarious.

  I have to admit that this movie doesn't follow the book very much, but is better.  The characters are so much more lovable in Disney's tale.  Now why couldn't Barrie be this imaginative?

  A new, live version of Peter Pan recenyly came out. and when I saw it I couldn't help but be disappointed.  I missed all of those timeless songs, charming characters, and humor.  Peter was dressed as if he came straight from the jungle, and unfortunately it followed the book.  I know you may think that sounds odd of me to say that I didn't like it because it was an accurate adaption, but it's true.

  So if you want to watch an exciting and classic movie buy this DVD.
