The ending TOTALLY rips off another very popular Bond movie. It was almost as bad as the ending of LIVE AND LET DIE.
The entire movie was excellent until the ending. Do something new. Don't do something we've seen before. Even with a horrid ending, DIE ANOTHER DAY is still one of the best Bond movies in recent memory. It has everything! Two villians that are some of the best in the Bond saga, two hot women (Jinx and Miranda Pike in her sports bra thingie) swordfighting, an extremely cool invisible car, one of the coolest title sequences in all of the Bond films, a very cool car chase in Iceland, one of the best songs in the Bond series and of course MR. BLONDE (Michael Madsen from RESERVOIR DOGS) is in it!
The fact that the ending ripped off another Bond movie made it my 2nd fave in the series (1st is the very underrated and unappreciated FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.) DIE ANOTHER DAY is Pierce Brosnan's best Bond. DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the key elements that made the series so popular in the 60's and 70's. Definitely don't pass this one up.
