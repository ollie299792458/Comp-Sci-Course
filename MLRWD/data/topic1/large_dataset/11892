Maybe I went into this moving with the wrong expectation.  From the previews, it made it look like a war hero goes missing and his left behind wife falls in love with his brother.  When he returns and everyone discovers that he is not dead, the fight for the wife begins because her heart now belongs to another.  This was TOTALLY not the storyline at all!!

The acting was excellent which is why I gave the movie two stars.  Other than that, it was a poor storyline and a waste of good talent.  The love between the husband and wife was not developed enough before Toby's character gets shipped off to war and is presumed dead.  When his brother, an ex-con, steps in to look after his brother's presumed widow the viewer feels more of a connection between the two because they share more screen time and had more of a character development.  Toby returns home from the war a little on the psychotic side with random violent acts of rage that pretty much carry on until the end of the movie.  The film finally ends with no resolve to his issues nor indication of what is next, what happened to him, or where he has been.  I was highly disappointed.
