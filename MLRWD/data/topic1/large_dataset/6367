I'm not going to summarize the film.  I'm not going to whine about how the end just didn't tie it all in together. I'm not going to complain about the MTV-esque version of "Wise Up" in the middle of the film.  I'm  going to say that every one of these things made me the movie more amazing  for me.
I went to go see this on a date.  There was my first mistake.  All through the movie I was either smiling hopefully, holding back tears,  or staring stonefaced at something that hit me in the core.  Afterwards, I  couldn't manage to talk, make jokes, comment on the cinematography...
The  whole movie just bunched together at the end, and hit me like an atomic  thrust to the heart, made me think about myself and others in a whole new  light.  It was enlightening and depressing all at the same time, and I'd  see it a hundred more times if I had the money to buy that many  tickets.
I recommend this movie to anyone preoccupied with living,  breathing, "sucking the marrow out of life."  Although the film  concentrates on the lonely, destitute, confused people, it really hits the  ones that take love and affection for granted.  It really touches those of  us who never thought that all we have can be taken away at any  second....
With the line of a song, the drop of a frog from the sky...
