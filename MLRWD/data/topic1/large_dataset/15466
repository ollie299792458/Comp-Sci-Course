THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday, then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again.

Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind, the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life. My own wondrous "journey into the future" via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s, and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions.

This is a film that truly delivers.  The special effects are outstanding...the acting superb...the drama riveting!

Rod Taylor, as the inventor of the time machine, is relentlessly -- believably! -- heroic in the role of H. G. Wells; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena; Alan Young's sensitive portrayal of David Filby (the only one of Wells' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells' "outlandish" theories) makes a lasting impression on the viewer.

And one of the major, not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia, which I'm listening to now as I write this review. The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama, while the "London" theme tugs gently at the heartstrings. (There's one gorgeous passage here that's straight out of Debussy.  Has anyone made note of it?)

Don't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world, and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago.
