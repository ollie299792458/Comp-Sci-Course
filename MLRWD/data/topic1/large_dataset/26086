I was expecting to like this film.  It had been recommended by many people.  After watching and loving "Mostly Martha" I was discussing that movie with a friend.  She recommended Babette's Feast.  The only thing they have in common are some great cooking scenes.  "Mostly Martha" is a much better movie as far as I am concerned.

I guess I don't understand the puritan point of view and I was waiting for the villagers to change.  But it never happened.  Yes, they enjoyed a good dinner and went home happy, but I believe it will be back to normal the next day while they wait to die and then everything will be lovely.  And Babette.  Why has she also given up on this life?  There were people in the village who seemed interesting and potential friends.

Perhaps the feast in the movie does represent the last supper.  Then who is Jesus?  Babette?  Why?  And are the choices and lives that the people have led supposed to mean something special at the end of the movie? What was gained by choosing the lives they did?  All this sacrifice so that maybe in heaven one sister will get to sing and Babette will get to be a chef and the angels will appreciate them.  I don't get it at all.
