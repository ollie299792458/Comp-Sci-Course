This movie is captivating as it tells the tale of 2 young people who are strangers and outcasts in their own world.  Sheen and Spacek very adequately and eerily portray a couple on the run from the law.

The story follows the real life people and most horrific events that took place with Charlie Starkweather and Carol Fugate.  They are much like Bonnie and Clyde, only they are not necessarily on a quest for money.  Mostly, their main goal starts out to be to mainly get away to a better place where they can freely do what they want.  In order to do this though, Kit has to leave no witnesses, no matter who it is.

Kit (Sheen) kills once and then it just becomes easier after that.  Holly ( Spacek)is very devoted and stays with him throughout all the killings.  She is regretful that her dad is killed, but even at that, shows little emotion.

Sheen has eyes that seem to be wild and focused only on who the next victim will be.

He claims he loves Holly his girlfriend, when actually he only uses her for a partner in crime and for sex.

Spacek even though she witnesses everything, she doesn't run away.

I 've watched the real bio. about Starkweather and Fugate.  I also watched a more true-to-life version featuring Tim Roth.  I like the Tim Roth version best, perhaps because they portray the characters and events very closely as to how it really happened.

The cinematography is great in Badlands.  Overall, it's truly a good show, though chilling.
