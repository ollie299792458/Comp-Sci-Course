I saw this in Best Buy for $60, but I knew I could get it from here for cheaper. I got it from her for about $40. I love this collection. Comes with character photo cards, a comic, a signed drawing, all four movies and a sweet TMNT beanie hat which is very comfy. I love the first two movies. The voice actors in those two are my favorite. I didn't like the ones in the 3rd movie, but the scenery in that is worth buying it alone. The blu-ray really brings out the green in the Japanese forests. Not to mention Donatello was voiced by Corey Feldman which I didn't know. And I surprisingly like the 4th one even though it's computer animated. I think it's another great one to have on blu-ray BECAUSE it's computer animated. And also Raph's voice in this one was better than in the 3rd and it also did more justice to the characters than the 3rd one did. I've been a Turtle fan since I was a kid. My mom actually hand sewed my brother and I turtle costumes for Halloween one year. I was Michelangelo and my brother was Raphael.
