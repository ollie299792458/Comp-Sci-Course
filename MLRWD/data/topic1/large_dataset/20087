The sophisticated comedy of manners, which saw its heyday in cinema with the films of Ernst Lubitsch and Howard Hawks, went out of style so long ago that it sometimes seems like a lost art.  As one who appreciates this particular kind of comedy, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Up in the Air is, in many respects, a comedy of manners in the Howard Hawks vein.

Sure-footed and seasoned professional George Clooney engages in love-duel with his intellectual equal, Hawksian woman Vera Farmiga, while tutoring the equally competent but less experienced Anna Kendrick.  It's all done in rapid-fire banter of the type that was Hawks' comedic trademark.  It makes me wonder if director Jason Reitman was thinking of Hawks when he made this film.

Of course, this film is about unemployment and the Great Recession, so the comedy has to be tinged with a shot of realism, and the story does take a few detours to highlight the superficiality of the main character's lifestyle, but for me Up in the Air was a welcome reminder that Hollywood still appreciates urbane humor.  If you do too, then I think you'll like Up in the Air.
