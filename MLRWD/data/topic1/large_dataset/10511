While Shanghai Knights perhaps isn't as great as its predecessor, it still benefits from the magical combination of Jackie Chan's amazing stunts and Owen Wilson's unerring comedic timing and charisma.  The anachronistic use of music actually adds much to the style of the film.  While many of the jokes make Englishmen everywhere groan, Americans can't help but smile at Roy's sum-up of the American Revolution ("beat 'em like a drum").  Aidan Gillen is an appropriately creepy bad guy, Tom Fisher's "Artie" is goofy fun, and while Fann Wang's character is rather 2-dimesional, she does add color, action and beauty to the film. All in all, the film offers entertainment in the form of comedy and kick-butt action.  This tongue-in-check adventure is for those who are willing to get caught up in the insane antics of the lovable Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon.  Just be sure to not take it too seriously, they certainly don't!
As far as the DVD version of the film, it offers limited extras: the deleted scenes are somewhat repetative (although they do explain what happened to Roy (and Chon's) wife Falling Leaves.) The "Fight Manual" with Jackie Chan is passibly interesting.  In the end its the movie that counts!
