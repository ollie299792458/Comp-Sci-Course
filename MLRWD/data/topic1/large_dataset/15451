I am truly dumbfounded by the 5 star reviews and I have to ask myself, "Did we see the same movie?"  Like most other reviewers, I saw the first one and loved it.  I was anticipating the sequel but half way through the movie, I was anticipating the ending.

I don't think the writers gave Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly (great actors if you ask me) anything to work with.  If there was a plot in that movie it was beyond me. It just had too many twists and turns and once you finally grasped where the story was going, it changed. I was disappointed how the characters completely changed from the original.  The beginning of the movie was her wedding day, but Elizabeth, now a sword wielding tomboy is  interested in Jack Sparrow, while her "love" is risking his life to save her? Are you kidding me? And this is the same women who then sits in the sand and pouts.  There is no consistency there.  Then, Jack Sparrow, a lovable, quirky pirate in the first movie is now a man that has no qualms about betraying everyone. He became less likable in this movie, and everything that was so charming and lovable about his character before were now missing. I believe they tried to make up for the lack of plot with over the top action scenes, special effects and disgusting characters, but nothing helped.  In so many scenes, you couldn't even understand everything they were saying.  I'm sure that didn't help any.

In my opinion, a movie (even a sequel) should be able to stand on it's own, but if you did not see the first one, you will be totally lost.  Then again, you probably will anyway. The ending bothered me the most.  It was a cliff hanger.  It did exacly what the producers wanted it to.  Now I have to pay even more money to see the third just to find out what happened. I have a feeling they were laughing all the way to the bank.

Two things are critical in a good movie, character and plot and unfortunately it was missing both.
