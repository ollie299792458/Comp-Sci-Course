At the sound of the title ringing in my ears when I rented it, I didn't think I would like it.  But I did, and boy, did I like it.  I watched it  twice before it had to go back to the video store.  And why is it so good?  I'll tell you why.
Before I saw this movie, the only John Woo film I'd  seen was Face/Off, but I'd seen plenty of Samantha Mathis, John Travolta,  and Christian Slater movies.  All three of the actors listed above gave  awesome performances, and this isn't just a film done for action, as it  seems to be.  It has drama, action, romance, all the genres in one!  Deakins (Travolta) and Hale (Slater) play military co-officers at good  terms at each other, sparring in the boxing ring as the movie opens, but as  the film progresses, Deakins betrays his friends trust by trying to steal  two nuclear warheads for his own personal benefit.  Even a park ranger  named Terry Carmichael (Mathis) comes in the play to add a little flavor.  But the problem always remains: will Hale do what he has to to take the  warheads back into his possession, even if it means going against Deakins,  or will he not, and fail his mission and his obligation to Terry?
Being  one of my fave movies, I'd have to say this movie has only a few minor  flaws.
