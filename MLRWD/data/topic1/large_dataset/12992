My own walk with God has been....unsteady and unfruitful.  I didn't go to the lengths of killing the one I hated, as the character did in this story, but, I know that feeling of hopelessness, of doing the same thing over and over, even after mercy.

It really stirred me up, knowing that this happens in real life, that little girls are raped and molested, and their mothers don't protect them.  Makes your blood boil.  I loved the vinettes each of the characters gave, which helped me get the story from their perspective. So, when the mother gave hers, I felt so much emotion of disgust.  Yet, she reasoned it like this:  "I didn't deny it all for either of them, but for me.  It was a selfish thing, cause I don't want to be alone."  That's still really rotton, but the truth.

Anyway, this is one of the better movies of redemption/christian faith I have seen.  So much better than that corny "Lilies of the Field" I saw recently.  It's worth being in your Christian DVD collection.
