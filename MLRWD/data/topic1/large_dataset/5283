Fact is, there are many people out there who will use whatever it takes to make money off of the Star Wars name, which is why I insist on only buy what I really want. A lot of people will buy this boxset, which I can understand, but the question is... Is it really worth it?

My review for the movies:

Episode 1 - On top of the terrible CGI and the cardboard characters, the movie is about as slow as paint drying and takes forever to get to the action. People liked it when it first came out just to see a lightsaber battle, but since then, people have woken up. Jar Jar Binks may very well be the worst character in the series. 2.5/5 Stars

Episode 2 - Yet another movie that works about as slow as a turtle. While the epic battle at the end was worth the wait, the movie as a whole doesn't work. The romance subplot doesn't give in due to lame script writing, and several sub-plots wern't interesting at all. The only good thing is that the CGI has improved since Episode 1. 2/5 Stars

Episode 3 - Finaly we have a movie worthy of the name Star Wars. While this movie DOES rely on tons of eye candy and special effects, at least we have a movie that moves on to the action quicker and leaves the pointless sub-plots aside. The movie also provided some decent character development even though the script was (again) lacking. 3.5/5 Stars

So to sum up the entire Prequel trilogy, I'd have to say that only 2 of the movies are worth your time, but only 1 is worth watching more than once. What does that really say about the trilogy?

To make a long story short, stick to the original trilogy (which is Epsiode 4, 5, and 6 in case you didn't know). Don't let the prequels waste away your time.
