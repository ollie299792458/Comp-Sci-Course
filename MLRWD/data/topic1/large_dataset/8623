Critics often cite Exorcist II as the worst sequel ever made.  They apparently missed this one - and I envy them.  While the original film wasn't perfect, it was enjoyable, magical, and, most importantly, MADE SENSE!  It also intentionally didn't try to explain the origin of the Immortals.  This film's nonsensical screenplay attempts a ridiculous, sci-fi explanation of where these immortal beings came from - another planet, called Zeist . . . oh, who cares.  It's as if the creators showed the original film to a six-year-old and asked him to make up a story about where the Immortals got their powers.
Making matters worse is a subplot about the ozone layer that goes nowhere. Oh, and Sean Connery's slain character reappears for no apparent reason; why didn't they dump the "aliens" story and spend some time explaining Ramirez's resurrection?
This film has a much bigger budget for special effects, which for me just makes it worse.  It's unbelievable that anyone would waste so much money on a film without once glancing at the screenplay.
I was so disgusted by this film that I never saw the other two sequels.  From reports I've heard, I didn't miss much.  I did see the TV show, which wisely ignored this film in its storyline.
