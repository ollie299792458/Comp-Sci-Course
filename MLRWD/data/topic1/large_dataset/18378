People, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!!!!  I just got back from seeing Poseidon, and it was awesome.  You couldn't ask for more action in a film than this.  Every second is filled with action, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.

As for people complaining about bad acting, bad plot, etc, I'm just wondering if they saw this same movie I did or just making crap up. The acting was top notch in here.  Overall, the entire cast gave excellent performances, but  with the 2 main standouts being Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas.  They were perfect for the roles they played in this type of movie.  Whoever did the casting, I give you credit.  You really know how to pick your people.  Oh, and Richard Dreyfuss is getting really old yes, but he shows he can still do some heavy action stuff. And as for the plot,  yes, there is one.  A big giant wave crashes into a big ship,  people are hurt and killed, and a few try to find a way to escape, and they do.  There you go.  And what did you want, another Titanic, which runs about 3 hours long.  Heck no, I would think not.  This movie runs a good short 98 minutes, so you can't really complain about that.  The movie does not drag on, and gets to the action right away.

So all in all, I highly recommend this action masterpiece to everyone who enjoys an awesome action movie filled with stunning visual effects and scenery.  You can really tell that the 140 million budget for this film was used all the way and was not a waste.  Great acting, great visual effects, great cast, great plot, overall GREAT!  Go see.  You will not be disappointed!! :)
