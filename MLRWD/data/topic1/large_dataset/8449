There seems to be a deep hatred for this fun movie among the pretentious. I too have every completed film by Welles in my collection and I've studied his work. I too have studied Serling and have collectected his works. I've seen all of the previous Ape films and the TV program and read the novel. To the reviewer who questioned the 20 somethings who had just viewed this film and did not recieve much of a response: you wouldn't have recieved one from me either. I too would have smiled politely and said "Um...yeah...okay" and gotten the hell out of there! Why should I battle at the cinema with the pretentious who fail to understand that it's okay to enjoy a fun movie and each individual reacts differently to different films? I greatly enjoyed this film. I enjoyed the joy, laughter and wonder of the children at the cinema while watching this. I loved Heston's work. Tim Roth was fantastic and other's in the cast did very well too. There's a lot to love about this movie. It touched a place in me where the kid in me still plays and has a deep love for many of the previous Ape films and comics. It put me in touch with my childhood daydreams about those damned dirty apes. That's a special brand of magic that I can appreciate.
Remakes suck? Stay away form the Maltese Falcon then. That was the third time they filmed that one and I loved it too.
