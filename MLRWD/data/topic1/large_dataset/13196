This movie missed the mark in many ways.  Tedious jokes were repeated ad-nauseaum--we get it that a 500 page report means a lot of writing, must we be reminded of it 15 times during the film?  The call-center gag was overused too.  On the other hand, this movie missed exploiting some comic possibilities.  US government incompetence for one.  They have to fly coach to India, are not met at the airport (Brooks' outrage at having to take a taxi to his hotel is somewhat puzzling) the US gov't flubs getting their VISAs for Pakistan as well.  With more subtle handling and development of this theme, the movie could have been funnier.  The most entertaining scenes are those in which Brooks interacts with Indians.  There could have been more of these and less of Brooks' whining.  Also, the notion that an international incident between India and Pakistan is sparked because of Brooks is somewhat demeaning to the governments of both those countries.  Are we supposed to believe that their military intelligence is that incompetent?  Not every country has the CIA.
