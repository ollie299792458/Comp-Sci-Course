The best part of Grease is the romance part. The reason it's the best part is because every time Danny and Sandy break up with each other they either sing or cry back to each other. To me it's a sad part. When Danny tried to kiss Sandy in the drive-in

movie, Sandy got out of the car and ran off. Danny ran after her but he couldn't find her. So he started singing a song called "Sandy", singing that he was lonely.

Another interesting part in Grease is the prom night. On the prom night Danny and Sandy were dance partners. When Sonny and Rita came to the prom. Sonny grabbed Sandy when she was dancing with Danny. Danny kept dancing and went to grab Sandy. Rita grabbed Danny and started dancing with him. Sandy left the party. Danny and Rita won the trophy, but Danny was hurt because after they won the trophy, they had to slow dance together. Danny wanted to win with Sandy.

The last part of Grease I'm going to tell you about is when the teenagers went out on their dates. Danny and Sandy were dating while Kenichie and Betty were on their date. While Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty were dancing, Danny and Sandy had snuck in. They sat at a table and put the menus up so no one would come over. The waitress came over to take their order. Danny ordered a bunch of food. Sandy ordered the same. Danny asked her if she was going to eat all of that. Doody came over there, then Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty came and crowded Danny and Sandy. Danny was disappointed because he wanted to be alone on their date. Kenichie and Betty got into an argument with Kenichie because he put his arm around Frenchy. Betty got mad and threw strawberry milkshake in Kenickie's face.
