It was the dawn of the third age of man, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon project was a dream given form, it's goal.. to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call, a home away from home for diplomats, entrepeneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two thousand five hundred tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but its our last, best hope for peace. The year is 2268 the name of the place: Babylon 5.

I had seen a video of the Gathering in a rental store, but not having heard anything about it I didn't rent it. Later in the year, channel four began announcing the arrival of a new sci-fi show. I recognised the title from the video store, liked the look of the trailers and waited eagerly for it to come out. I watched Midnight on the Firing Line with the rest of my family and was sucked in B5's universe.

The look of the ships, the backstory, the aliens, the feuds, the sense that something big had begun flowed over us. We watched and chuckled at Londo's first appearance.

"Alright we made a mistake so slit my wrists!"

"Centauri don't have major arteries in their wrists!"

"Of course we don't, what do you think I am, stupid?"

It was different, edgy yet with characters that we could love and love it we did. In hindsight, this is the weakest season, there are far too many filler episodes and the arc is barely apparent, the terrible acting of Michael O'Hare but that doesn't take anything away from the series. The hints of the future are there, the story is there and JMS created a classic with this one. It's not the best series in the group but it's the one that started it all.. great stuff!
