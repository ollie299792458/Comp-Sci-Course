I have been a fan of Stephen Chow for more than ten years and I have to give him props. If you think he is funny in this movie you'll be surprised at how much more hiliarious he usually is because this is considered one of his more dramatic roles! Fans should check out "God of cookery" which can easily translate to western audiences. "Royal Tramp" and the sequel are classics and my personal favorites although I would recommend those for adventurous viewers.

There absolutely is a plot to this movie for the reviewer that said there is not.

Spoiler ~

The conflict between Sing choosing the gang or helping the people. Finding out that when he was young he tried to be good and was humiliated which is why he so desperately wants to join the gang because he thinks that good people don't get anywhere.

An example of the heart in this movie is the scene where Sing finally sees the girl in front of the candy store and instead of the usual Hollywood, run into each others arms and make out scene, the camera pans around them in a circular motion and by the time the circle is complete they have reverted back into children and walk hand in hand into the store.

Props also to Yeun Wo Ping for the choreography, the acting is really good and the soundtrack is well put together. This movie has a very stylish look with vivid colors and surprisingly good CGI. The subtitles are also very well translated.

I am happy that Stephen Chow is finally getting the recognition that he deserves because he is truly a comedic genius. And now a great director, writer and producer as well.

Keep up the good work Stephen!
