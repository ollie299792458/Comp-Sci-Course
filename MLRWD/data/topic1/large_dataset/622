The movie was OK, but us local residents were dissapointed. I am from Rochester, NY the birthplace of the Lady in White Legend.  While I am unsure of the exact legend, I believe it goes something like this: A woman awoke one night to find her daughter missing, so she put on her robe and went searching for the daughter. Apparently, the daughter had sleepwalked and fell off a cliff overlooking Lake Ontario. Other versions state that two farmers raped and murdered the girl. After discovering the daughters body, the mother went crazy and went out every night in search of her "lost" daughter. Eventually, she commited suicide by throwing herself down into the waters. Her spirit continues to wander between her old home and the cliff. I don't know how much is urban legend. I know the movie was inspired by reported sightings of the ghostly image.Down in Durand-Eastman park there is the foundation of an old cottage, known around here as White Lady's Castle. While it may have been her home, I don't recall there being any cliffs over-looking the lake down there. My friends and I went down to the location one night expecting a creepy time, and instead we found a bunch of teenagers hanging out smoking dope and drinking. No wonder they saw ghosts.
