Steve Murray's Reiki books are well worth purchasing, whether you are a beginner wishing to learn, or an intermediate student looking for reference material. His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.

The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.

I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.

I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism.
