This video changed my whole outlook on exercise!  I am one of those people that knows I need it, but getting started and staying with it is, well, impossible.  This one grabbed me from the start, and I've stuck with it. . . . even moved on to the Intermediate workout.
The amazing thing about the Beginning workout is that it starts slow, gives you modified options, is a very short workout, but you SEE RESULTS within a couple of weeks!!  It is true - you feel better, look better and start to have a new outlook in a short period of time.
Advice - - -  master this one before moving on.  When you start to get a little bored with the Beginning workout, and are doing all of Ana's version of the moves, you are ready for the Intermediate.  But be warned!  The Intermediate workout is very different. . . .  you WILL sweat and you WILL be sore.  But in the most satisfying way!!!
One other thing; if you know nothing about the Pilates method, just remember to squeeze whatever muscles you're using in each move.  And keep that tummy tight!  That's the secret.
I LOVE PILATES; I LOVE ANA; PLEASE DO AN ADVANCED WORKOUT VIDEO!!!
