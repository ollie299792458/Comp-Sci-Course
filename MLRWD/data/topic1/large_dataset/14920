This is the first single non combo Blu Ray I ever bought and I have to agree with commentary that nobody truly does campy as well as the classic Batman.  Other that Jack Nicholson in 1989 Batman this movie has my favorite version of The Joker and for sure my favorite version of The Penquin. The way Blu ray sets up the special features differently from regular DVDs still takes some getting use to for me but I like both versions of commentary giving insight on the films and all the other extras on the batmobile and stuff.

The story in simple as Joker, Penquin, Riddler and Catwoman team up for their greatest crime evil. Like an episode of the original Star Trek series where aliens dehydrated the Enterprise crew into crystals the criminals dehydrate the world leaders of a fictional version of United Nations into different colored power dust to hold ransom. The movie puts all the bat vechiles in the movie such as the bat copter, bat boat, bat cycle.  Between their headquarters above a bar at the docks and Penquin's submarine base the crooks seem to remain one step ahead of the dynamic duo till the very end of the film and come closer to destroying the cape crusaders than they ever did in the TV series.

  The only think that would make this movie perfect would of been if it came along late enough to of had Yvonne Craig star as her Batgirl character in it. She was the only person I missed watching the film.
