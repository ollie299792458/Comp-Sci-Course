I remembered that the original "Stepford Wives" movie had been a great and fairly scary picture, so I bought the newer version on DVD a few years ago -- and was very disappointed. The newer version just didn't capture the mood or tone of the original. That DVD went went into a cardboard box filled with other of my "lesser" DVDs.
A few weeks ago, I was going through that box to determine which DVDs I would keep and which ones I would give or trade away.
When I came across my copy of the newer "Stepford Wives." I put into my discard box. Then, for some reason, I decided to keep it -- and order a DVD of my beloved original "The Stepford Wives" and some other DVDs.
When my order was delivered I watched the original for the first time in many years. It was just as I remembered, It was still the great movie even if it didn't seem as scary as I remembered. The acting, lighting and mood was wonderful, especially since it was in black and white It was thrilling -- and without the gore every few minutes that seem to be required by
so many modern movies to create thrills and chills.
A few days later I decided to watch the newer "Stepford Wives." As I watched the DVD I realized I was watching the same movie and, while the mood was so different from the original, it was a delightful movie. The colors added the tone of the movie and I realized I was watching an almost-satire of the original. It was an inspired version of the original without a fault, especially with the casting. The light touch was perfect.
Now, instead of loving just one movie, I have two versions of the same and two favorite movies to watch to my heart's content.
