Season 3 gets a bum wrap. Season 3 is the whole reason I started watching B&B. I had not been a regular watcher of the show and my Mom had watched the previous seasons occasionally... but when Season 3 started... I decided to watch with Mom. The previous season recap along with my occasional watching of previous seasons put enough together for me to jump in the show. I loved the season opener... Though Lovers be Lost is one of the most tragic stories ever told... and so gut wrenching! As a die hard romantic... I couldn't help but be moved with the plight of Vincent and the search for his child. Gabriel was a brillant villain. So creepy and twisted... and even though this was full of dark stories... Diana and Vincent proved to be the light battling the immense forces of evil. It was great how Catherine's previous loves basicly unite in helping Vincent honor her. The care that was taken in dealing with her death and her memory... made me want to go back and rewatch the previous seasons... which I did once it made it onto cable. Having seen them all... I have to say as a whole... Season 3 was an exciting and well written mystery... gaining the clues as to how to find Gabriel. Diana became Vincent's protector as he was once Catherine's... an interesting shift.
