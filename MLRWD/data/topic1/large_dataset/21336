Having seen Happy Feet 2, I can save you a lot of time in summing it up.  It's not a good children's film if you've got parent issues.  That does not make it a bad movie.

A lot of folks here have trashed it because it opens up kids to the fact that the world is not a safe and wholesome place.  There are people in it who are too selfish, too afraid or too busy to care, even if the debts they owe others are enormous.  There are people in the world we esteem who are not always what we believe them to be.  These are not nice things for kids to learn.

Hence the PG rating.  You will have to explain some of it to the kids.  If you don't like telling your kid about some of the world's realities, don't take them to this movie.

That said, it has an excellent message: That when people put aside their differences, don't let others interfere and work together, they can move mountains.  In this case, literally.

That is a good thing for kids to learn.

The music is on par with the previous movie, with many memorable tracks.  The characters are pretty much the same, with the notable exception of the Krills, Will and Bill.  The message of their journey echoes that of the movie: That although one can be a catalyst for action, it takes the cooperation of many to act in a big way.

If you're looking for mindless fluff your kids can giggle at, keep looking.  If you're looking for a good way to start talking to your kids about what the world is like, this may be a good entree into that conversation.  If you're unsure, watch it with an open mind and without your kids.  Then decide.

I enjoyed it more than average.
