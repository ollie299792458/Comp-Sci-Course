MAN I GETTING PISSED WIT YOU DAMN CENA HATERS ALWAYS COMPLAINING.'HE AINT HURTING RAW OR HIS FANS ..SHHEZ.

SO WHAT IF HE  HOLDS THE TITLE TILL JANUARY,

\LIVE WIT IT. CENA IS STILL FUNNY AND HIS RAPPING GIMICK ISNT EVEN WORKING WELL. IF YOU SAW THAT PROMO ON RAW. THAT WAS A GREAT ONE.

IF BATISTA  DID ONE OF THOSE HE WOULD LOOK STUPID.

NUFF SAID.  YAH DONT CARE IF BATISTA  KEEPS HIS TITLE LONGER.''BUT YAH BEEN WANTED CENA TO LOSE THE TITLE EVER SINCE VENGEANCE .

COME ON..  .  YOU ACT LIKE HE IS ANOTHER JBL.

JBL HAD IT FOR 10 DAMN MONTHS. AND I DIDNT HEAR ANY COMPLAINS.

ITS NOT CENA'S FAULT HE DONT WANNA LOSE DA TITLE VINCE WONT LET HIM.]]

  IF HE HELDS THE TITLE. SO WHAT. WATCH SD! I THOUGHT SD! WAS BETTER THAN  RAW. AND GO THERE AND WATCH BATISTA  ' ALL DA TIME.

BUT HOW CAN yu idiot fans hate raw;s champ.

jeez. that is why wwe is dying because you fans  destroy it.

jeff hardy, y2j,clb,jerret.raven.ryno ect.

let to tna. and they have become bigger stars.

it cena';s  time to shine.

because the champ is here.

but really vince you should think about  cena and  his luck he might getted booed  bad.  do it before its too. ;late. and dont  try to kill

the moment by letting cena  become a non challenger .because he had it long,

2 months title riegns are long enough.

i hope cena loses by survivor series/\\

new years revolution should not have cena as champ. intercontinetal., alright but champ  um  no
