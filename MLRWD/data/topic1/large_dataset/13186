I saw this film in the theatre when it was first out, so my review is of the film and not the format (DVD, etc...)  If you ever get a chance to see this on a theatre screen, definitely go!

I had no real idea what I was in for with this film, but it is probably the most visually stunning film I've ever seen.  If you like art you will love this film just for the gorgeous art references.  It's unbelievably beautiful at times and darkly frightening at others.

The story is truly heartbreaking, but worth the journey.  All in all a cathartic experience (and isn't that one of the great outcomes of a fine film?) I don't know if I will ever watch this a second time, especially on a small screen (you know how everyone else loves your sunset photos but you can't bear to look at them because the real thing was so much more amazing and you don't want to ruin your memories?), but it's stayed with me all these years and I'm so glad I've seen it.

Although it is absolutely nothing like this in storyline, another film that feels similar to me in it's reality twisting creativity is The Time Bandits.  If you like The Time Bandits, or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (huh, another Robin Williams film), you might want to give this a try.
