You see a lot of reviews saying how little kids will love this movie, well, I'm 43 and I don't have any kids, and I thought this was one of the best Disney videos I've seen in years.

Full of color and light and fun, an uplifting message, gorgeous animation, and a wonderfully imaginative take on the fairies' world, I enjoyed this movie so much I went to work the next day and told everyone about it.

If you want to recapture that feeling of innocence, joy, and imagination that you used to have as a kid watching the Wonderful World of Disney or seeing the Disney cartoon movies for the first time, this is the way to go. A sweet, charming, cheerful movie, with great characters that I'll be happy to see again. And I'll get to, since there are apparently a couple of sequels coming out. I sincerely hope they hold up to this standard.

By the way, I watched my copy in 3D with a pair of TV Eyes 3-D glasses I found online. This movie looks fantastic in 3D, almost like it was made for it! That may be responsible for part of my enthusiasm. I definitely suggest watching it in 3D if you have the chance. It's amazing.

I've noticed Disney has finally started to go back to it's roots, making more imaginative, wonderful, and heartwarming stories again (instead of just refilming old movies) if this video is an example of the way they're headed, then I'm back on the train for the ride. This may be about an old character, but it's a fresh new movie in it's own right. If I'd never heard of Tinker Bell I'd still think it was excellent entertainment.
