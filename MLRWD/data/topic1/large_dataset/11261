This is a wonderful live 2 DVD set recorded in Hyde Park, London during the Hard Rock Calling Festival on 28 June 2009 in HD by "The Boss" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band in support of the then new release "Working On A Dream" album. The 163 min recording encompasses songs from his massive  repertoire including favourites "No Surrender" & "Hard Times (Come Again No More)" among others (the usual suspects). Rarities in this 2 DVD set include "Trapped" (Jimmy Cliff)," Good Lovin'" (The Young Rascals) & "London Calling" (The Clash). As usual with "The Boss" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band,the performance is impressive (but not spectacular, as compared to shows like 'Live in Barcelona', released in 2003) but visuals are rather breathtaking (as recorded in HD). The set has however only two tracks from "Working On A Dream" : "Outlaw Pete" & "Working On A Dream". One would have expected more tracks from the new album as promo! Bonus material includes the song "The River" recorded a day before (27 June 2009) in Glastonbury & "Wrecking Ball" recorded in Giants Stadium in New Jersey.
