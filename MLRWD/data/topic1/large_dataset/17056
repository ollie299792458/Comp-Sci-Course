The first 2/3s of the movie:
Ex-drunk fisherman named Syracuse with what seems like the worst boat in town, an ex that is still drunk all the tine, and a daughter that needs a kidney and is in a wheelchair catches a drop-dead gorgeous girl in his net. Alicja Bachleda plays the girl and she truly is a beauty. Syracuse and his daughter suspect she is a Selkie (Irish version of a mermaid). This would seem to make sense, seeing as normal humans are pretty much dead after a few minutes underwater AND she can sing to attract fish. Syracuse suddenly can catch more than 2 or 3 fish per trip and some tasty looking lobsters too. For some reason Ondine, as she calls herself, has an Eastern European accent. Syracuse doesn't seem at all interested in this or why Selkies wouldn't be speaking some Gaelic or perhaps a seal language. Actually, considering how pretty she is and her penchant for changing clothes a lot and swimming in a dress without underwear in cold water, he is pretty slow on the uptake with human-Selkie romance too. The girl asks Ondine to cure her illness, thinking she might have a power to grant wishes.
At this point I have to say this movie is NOT a little kid movie either. PG-13 is about right.

The last Selkie movie I saw then had the other fisherman get jealous of the Selkie-aided fisherman's success.
I'll try and not be too much of a spoiler, but the last 1/3 of the movie mutates into a heroin smuggling crime movie. There is a confusing scene that implies the girl is cured in an improbable-at-best way. This is a jarring transition and the scene that shows where Ondine came from does NOT make a lot of sense as something a human could do and also makes no sense as something a Selkie would do. Confusion and a lot of WTF for the last 1/3.
