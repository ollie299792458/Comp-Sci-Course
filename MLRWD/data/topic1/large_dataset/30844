If you want to understand how things work in this world, Darwin's Nightmare along with Food Inc. are required viewing. Food Inc. takes you behind the scenes of food production to show you the dirty little secrets the food corporations don't want you to see. You'll see fist hand how they cut corners to produce "cheap" food (in both senses, price & quality). On a positive note, this film will teach you how to make healthier food choices in the grocery store.

Darwin's Nightmare takes place in a fishing village overlooking Lake Victoria, the second largest lake in the world and shows you the misery unrestrained capitalism can cause as told to you directly from the struggling fishermen who scrape a living from  it, low paid Ukrainian pilots who fly rickety old cargo airplanes dangerously loaded down with 55 ton loads of Nile Perch fish, women forced to serve them as prostitutes because of poverty and destitute street children who get by, by getting high and fighting over food scraps. Watching the film and seeing Tanzanian factory workers cut, freeze blast and shrink wrap thousands of fish fillets while learning that most Tanzanians can't afford to buy the fish caught in their own lake comes across as a huge injustice. A report at the time of filming indicating that there were 2 million Tanzanians starving and needing food aid from the UN World Food Program drives home the point further. Darwin's Nightmare gives us rare access to these people whose stories never seem to get told by the major media outlets. We must thank Hubert Sauper for allowing his camera to keep rolling as the people of this Tanzanian fishing village tell their stories intimately. This one's not to be missed if you want to know how the other half of the world lives.
