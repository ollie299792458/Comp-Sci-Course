Spielberg does a masterful job of the 60's, even the lead-in is from that era!  The sets and language is authentic to the period, and the acting is right on and groovy to that time as well.  What can one say about DeCapria and Hanks in this?  They each are outstanding.  Hanks is so versatile, and here is another character for him, the serious, intent no funny biz type.  He pulls it off just remarkable!
Captivated, riveted to the end, as others have spoken, I was.  The plot seems so unbelievable, but yet the length and end to which gov-FBI et al go to get this guy is magnet.  
Overall, the strong urge of Frank to sense his need and ability to get his mom and dad back is almost universal characteristic of divorced children (see excellent book "Children of Divorce" by Debbie Barr).  This culminates in escape from plane john to his mother's new home, where looking through window at her in new life, is final straw for Frank, Jr.  Heart-breaking scene which explained his strong drive to do all this remarkable stuff, and then FBI's wise rehab and usage of this for soceity's good.
Excellent, one of best to have seen lately.
