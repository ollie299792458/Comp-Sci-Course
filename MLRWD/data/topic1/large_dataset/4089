I saw this film for the first time three weeks ago, and it is my second favorite film, behind only Schindler's List. This film contains every element a person could want in a film: great acting, great music, excellent directing, and a fantastic and moving story.

The biggest thing i have against this movie is what people say about it, it is not a chick flick, nor a "Tear-Jerker" Yes it is very emotional, but the story is not about the love between the two main characters, it is about the redemption of Nick Nolte's character. This film is in my opinion the best film of Streisand's for any man to watch. It has managed to discuss something that most men have a hard time discussing; Their emotions!!

I played this for my father, who is forty-six, and it is his favorite film. Anyone who is beyond sterotypes and can respect the story, and the man's situation, and not afraid of a little love and emotion, should love this film.

This is Nick Nolte's best film, and he has not done anything after this that even comes close. That goes for Streisand, Krabb, and George Carlin. They are well casted, and their performances make this film a very memorable one.

This film is not for anyone who thinks women are the only ones who watch love stories, and guys are the only ones who enjoy the Terminator.
