First, let me state I have not seen the film.
However, let me state that I AM from Mexico, have worked in Latin America, and know of this film and many like it. My review may, therefore, be of necessity both of limited value but perhaps helpful. To wit: latin american artistes are well aware of the cross currents in their political and social culture, which are very strong. MUCH stronger than their cross cultrual counterparts in more soporific cultures like the US of A. As a result, the only way to really rationalize them--unite those currents, if you will--is through a bent for surrealism. Seems that Latinos LOVE to view their culture as in some very way surreal. I refer you to, for example, the author Gabriel Garcia Marquez' creation of "Macondo", which is, of course, Colombia and Cartagena specifically. So, view this movie not only with an appreciation for whatever qualities it may possess ipso facto, but for the cultural constraints which define, in an ever more pedestrian and predcatable manner, its development. Sadly, until that lovely hemisphere springs free of its own cultural self-obsessions will we see simple things--like everone being able to buy bread--a reality. In the meantim, the artistic elite sips chardonnay and caiparinhas and eats lotuses.
