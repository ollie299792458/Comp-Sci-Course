"To the Manor Born" is my all-time favorite series.  The tension and wry comments between Penelope Keith's and Peter Bowles' characters (Audrey and Richard) is so entertaining.  Audrey is imperious and a firm believer in noblesse oblige, in spite of losing the family pile.  Richard, the nouveau riche owner of a grocery empire, as well as recent purchaser of Audrey's estate, is seldom without a twinkle in his eye, and he gives as good as he gets. The other characters are interesting too.  Mrs. Poo is a force to be reckoned with in her determination to get Audrey and Richard married.  Brabinger, Audrey's butler, is devoted, canny and a master of understated humor.  The vicar is entertainingly unhelpful.  Marjorie, Audrey's spinster sidekick, is naive, yet delightfully acerbic when called for.  Ned, the gardener, is endlessly inventive in his zeal to avoid work.  The English country village setting is charming, as are the scrupulously observed English rituals - like tea, which Audrey would never countenance being served in anything except a silver tea service.
