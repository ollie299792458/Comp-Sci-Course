I really loved saw part 6.I watched all of the saw movies and liked them but the last two were getting bad but this 6 installment was really good and creepy. the fine actor who plays jigsaw is really great! He plays the character creepy but smart and logical too.I also  loved the actress shawnee smith as his evil assistant. I always loved shawnee smith ! shawnee can be scary and sexy at the same time.I always loved watching her !I also liked the man and the lady named jill helping jigsaw carry out his evil deeds !I wont give away the ending and ruin it for you if you havent already seen it already... but the  movie was  about a company called "umbrella health" insurance company who continues to deny people their health insurance when they really need it. good symbolism in the movie having a piranha fish tank in the "umbrella health company" office. ..because their alot like the fish themselves ! I love it!jigsaw gets back at these people  of "umbrella health" in devilishly evil ways, like an evil carnival carousel, and other evil things. all in all this six  installment of saw brought the series back for me. I only hope the next ones are as good.
