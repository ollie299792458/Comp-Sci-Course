This was a great movie.  I had heard Kelly talk about it on Regis and Kelly many times and kept ignoring it.  I figured that at my age it was a little young, but i rented it and thought it was great and immediately became addicted!  I had seen Zac Efron on Summerland and never saw what was so great about him, but he is really great in this role and he can sing really well!  As far as people stating that he is too short to be a basketball star, he is in high school and the average height and weight varies.  I went to school with a very short person on our varsity team as a freshman because he was just really good, so it isnt impossible.  i didnt find it too hard to believe except that he wasnt very built.  In the second one though he looks more the basketball star.  The rest of the cast does and great job and Vanessa has an amazing job.  Look past what happened recently in her personal life leaking to the public, and think of it as just that something in a teenagers life that wasnt suppose to be said to everyone in the world.  She is still a role model and a great singer.
