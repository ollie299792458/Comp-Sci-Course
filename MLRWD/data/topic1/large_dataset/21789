This is probably one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films ever produced.The reason- because it is so realistic.The acting by Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller is world class.The story and theme of the film relates so perfectly to a typical real life situation- where the son in law desperately wants the father in laws acceptance.Yes, Greg Fokker(Ben Stiller) is portrayed as your typical loser,worst of all he has got to try and impress a really heavy handed and uncompromising retired CIA official of a future father in law Jack Byrnes(Robert De Niro) who immediately takes a disliking to poor old Greg.As if he is already up against it he finds he has to live up to the standards of the other son in law-a doctor whose parents can easily relate to Jack.Jack becomes a real horror for Greg who finds his fiancee Pam's whole family in an uncompromising mood towards Greg.So, how does Greg try and win in this situation?Well,I can guarantee you one thing,whatever he does ends up being really hillarious.It is thoroughly worth watching,a type of movie that keeps you interested from start to finish,quite remarkable.It really deserves its 5 star rating.First class entertainment.Watch it.
