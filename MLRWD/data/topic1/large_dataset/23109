In one of his newest DVDs, Dr. Yang and his students give a great introduction to Shuai Jiao, or Chinese wrestling.  Of the four main categories of traditional Chinese martial arts, shuai jiao is probably one of  the most practiced in Chinese schools, yet most poorly explored and understood in the western hemisphere.  Kung Fu practitioners who are not versed in some throwing techniques are missing a key component of their art as shuai jiao techniques were developed as a response to strikes. Here Dr. Yang gives a brief historical introduction of the art, as well as demonstrations of over two dozen effective throwing techniques including common mistakes.

As another reviewer mentioned, this DVD provides just an overview of shuai jiao and demonstration of many of possibly hundreds of techniques.  It is not an in-depth analysis of the fine details required to make the viewer an "expert" in the techniques presented.  However, any practitioner of other throwing arts such as judo may gain some insight and deeper understanding of the techniques presented or find some analogy to techniques already in their repertoire.

Viewers who enjoy this DVD should also enjoy other YMAA publications:  Chinese Fast Wrestling by Liang, Shou-Yu, Taiji Wrestling by Yang, Jwing-Ming, and Advanced Practical Chin-Na In Depth, by Yang, Jwing-Ming.
