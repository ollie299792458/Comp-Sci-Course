After waiting forever for this movie to tivo...I give up.  I must buy my own copy.  I have never watched most movies more than once.  I think the matrix was the last one.  I'LL WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER.  People are angry over this film.  Let us remember it is a MOVIE not a documentary.  The imagination of this film is fantastic.  I have NEVER liked any kung fu movies.  NEVER subtitles.  This is moving, flowing art.  I can't wait to see it again.  I can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to see it (7).  She's in TKD but she will enjoy this no matter what kind of "battle"  is going on.  It is an intense film and the colors are amazing.  I only wish there were more like it to see.  The way the color is used in this movie creates emotion that matches what is going on and gives depth to the storyline. Almost like 3D, but in a different way. I hope this makes sense to anyone reading it.  I don't write reviews on movies but this is too good to pass up!  EVEN IF IT IS NOT "YOU'RE THING"!  RELAX AND LET YOUR MIND GO.  THINGS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SENSE!
