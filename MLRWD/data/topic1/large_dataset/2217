If season 1 didnt get you going, season 2 certainly will.

The first few episodes carry on in great fashion from the finale of the 1st season and the relationshp between summer and seth is incredibly gripping.

Watching these episodes over and over again you pick up small things that the directors have cleverly inputted, like duplicate lines being used from the 1st season to produce wit to those who notice it.

Seth's (adam brody) humour is hilarious and seth's mission to go 'stealth' one night had me in tears.

This season though, is all about its ending. The final episode hits you hard and all of the previous episodes gel together once you watch ep 24. Things that shouldnt happen do, and the kitchen scene with kirsten, seth, sandy, hayley and ryan will make you feel weak at the knees.

As for the final scene, for a supposed 'teenie flick ' it becomes more of a high class drama movie and the acting of all the characters shows us what a great programme The O.C has become.

I am a big big fan, and if you give it a chance, behold the addiction. Enjoy.
