I loved this movie although I know its a bit too sweet and too cute at times.  It's an excellent candidate for a "family movie" but actually its just a good, solid movie all around.  Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek turn in delightful performances as Brendan Fraser's parents - wholesome and quirky.  This movie does have its hints of the darker side of the middle class 60's type environment in which Adam (played by Brendan Fraser) was raised - such as Spacek's closet alcoholism as well as hints of the way our society has changed - from the so-called innocence of America during the Kennedy era with its Cold War paranoia to a modern-day America with its acceptance of a diversity of lifestyles that the 60's hadn't accepted just yet and also its societal problems that just didn't seem to be a part of the early 60's consciousness even though they existed then as now. Brendan Fraser turns in a wonderful performance, effectively portraying Adam's innocence and sense of wonder at everything he sees with humor and even pathos. Alicia Silverstone does a passable job although I felt the flaws in her character were not her fault so much as it was the fault of her character being underwritten and the director being confused as to what to do with her character. David Foley is wonderful as always.  The movie is also peppered with wonderful character actors who actually make up some of the movie's funniest moments. Although the screenwriting is not as tight as it could be - especially with regard to the latter half of the movie when Fraser wanders around the modern world - Fraser carries the movie with ease and charm.  This movie is well worth watching.  Good movie if you're in the mood for something light, not too serious but not bubble gum either, funny, and with wonderful comedic acting by Walken, Spacek, and Fraser. The type of movie you can watch again and again and still enjoy because its just fun and cute and well done.
