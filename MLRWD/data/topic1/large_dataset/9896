The Blu-Ray of "Ramona and Beezus" is the same great film about Ramona Quimby and her big sister Beezus and their parents in their home in Portland, OR (with Vancouver as a stand-in for Portland), with Joey King in the same superb performance as before, but this edition has some new features that are included exclusively on the Blu-Ray (the features from the original DVD edition are also included):

--Deleted scenes: The original DVD edition had four deleted scenes; the Blu-Ray has three more deletions, for a total of 7.

--A Day in the Life of Joey King: This 5-min. feature is an insider's view of what a normal day was like for Joey King, star of "Ramona and Beezus," who went by "Pickle" on the walkie-talkie. It shows her at makeup, in one of her homeschooling sessions (she was focused on fractions in this one), and in the process of shooting the playground rings scene with Jason Spevack (who played her friend Howie Kemp); the school scenes were shot at an actual school. One thing that I was surprised to learn about her is that she has cat allergies WRT shooting the scenes w/Picky-Picky.

--Selena and Joey Audition Footage: Two scenes of Selena Gomez and Joey King in rehearsal. One is when Beezus wanted to die after Ramona embarrassed her at the lemonade stand; the other is when Ramona is opening up her lemonade stand. These were the rough cuts of the actual scenes. It should be noted that Joey was not in the hairstyle that she would have in the film as Ramona.

--Fox Movie Channel Presents Life After Film School: Director Elizabeth Allen is questioned by three film students in a 22-min. interview.

The other features that were carried over from the DVD edition include:
--a 3-min. gag reel;

--"My Ramona with Author Beverly Cleary," in which the author talks about how Ramona came to be popular and some of the stars of the film talk about what the books meant to them (4 min.+);

--"Show and Tell Film School" (7 min.), where director Elizabeth Allen and star Joey King present tips on how to make your own film, with a bit of an insider's view of how they made "Ramona";

--and the original theatrical trailer.

In addition to the features, the film is presented in HD on this Blu-Ray edition, and has English and French audio, and English and Spanish subtitles (the same languages as on the DVD edition). The Blu-Ray comes in a 3-pack with a copy of the original DVD edition and a digital copy for portable devices. The artwork for the Blu-Ray disc is the same as the original DVD edition, with the included DVD having somewhat different artwork (this one had Selena and Joey in a field of flowers, apparently); the digital copy shows Ramona hanging upside down from the "Z" and "S" in the title. The three discs are in a clear blue rounded square case, with the Blu-Ray and DVD on a hinged flipper, and the digital copy on its own on the right-hand inside of the case.

The menu for the BD is essentially the same as for the DVD, but the options are on tiny scraps of paper.

In short, whether you get this combo Blu-Ray/DVD/digital copy, or you get the original DVD edition by itself, I think that you'll be treating yourself to what I believe is one of the best films I've ever seen, with one of the greatest performances ever from a juvenile actress by the name of Joey King.
