While this film is not based on the original "Jaws" film, and even tough it might borrow a few dramatic excerpts from it, the thought of enhancing a shark's intelligence to gain materials which will advance the  cause of modern medicine does present us with a new perspective.  While the  movies "Jaws" and "Orca" created their drama using the  involvment of the male and female relationship between these species, and  did so with quite good effect, it seems that the idea of a society of  sharks with superior intellect takes this one step further.  In the movie  "Jaws" and in the movie "Orca" the conflict was very  viable as we came to see the shark and Orca personified.  In "Deep  Blue Sea" the story turns into one of survival of the best of the  species.  And, what most seperates this film from the films of  "Jaws" and "Orca" is that these sharks have an agenda,  an intelligent agenda.  This film starts out and grabs you, takes you in,  and doesn't give you much time to think before it moves into some excellent  action scenes.  The soundtrack is excellent, the acting balanced, and the  direction is well done.  This may never be a classic, but it certainly  hinted of more things than the film makers brought out in their final  presentation.  But, for that, and the possibilities left behind.  I would  have to give it four stars for almost getting there.
