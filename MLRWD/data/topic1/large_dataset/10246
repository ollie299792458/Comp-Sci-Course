I watched this in the theater with my guy friends; we went into this movie not knowing everything about it. Spoiler alert:

J. Edgar is a flaming homosexual. It shows him in dresses & courting a man. Many times. Talk about awkward when sitting next to your guy friends!

Also, the MPAA is horrible. Not only are they extraditing a UK student (Richard O'Dwyer) to the United States for linking to copyrighted material (something that's not a crime in the UK), but they're stark raving mad control freaks. Ultraviolet copies that expire? Just another way to pull in more cash and leave you with nothing to show for it, no doubt. BluRay is made by Sony, a notorious supporter of SOPA/PIPA/DRM that tried to jail George Hotz. Research that story for yourself sometime. It's sickening.

When you buy these movies, you support....THEM. And their causes. And their stupid, counter-intuitive DRM that only serves to punish & inconvenience the people that buy things legally.

We can't give these inbreds the jailtime they deserve, but please, at least don't give them your money. At the VERY least, don't buy this incredibly awkward movie.
