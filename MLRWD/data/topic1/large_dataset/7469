Super hero movies seem to be almost as trendy as reality TV thse days, so Fox and Marvel had a sure-fire winner when they put together the sequel to X-Men, one of the earliest super-hero movies to arise as the trend began. X2: X-Men United picks up exactly where the first movie left off. Wolverine is still searching for his identity, Rogue is still trying to fit in, and Magneto is still locked in a high-security plastic prison. However, some new characters have been added. Nightcrawler (played flawlessly by Allan Cumming) has been added to the story, and Pyro has bocome a major character, as opposed to his appearance in the first movie, which was more or less a cameo. Other interesting characters that were added include Lady Deathstrike (although mentioning her name is agruably a spoiler), Colossus, and Kitty Pryde. William Stryker is a non-mutant character who has been added, and is the main villain of the film. Jubilee also appeared, but only in a deleted scene which is included in the bonus features of the DVD. The story is the stuff of ideal sequels, and leaves the audience craving the third movie, which is on the way. What is most impressive is the fact that the entire cast has returned, with the exception of a recasting of Pyro, who was probably played by an extra in the original movie, anyway. The entire DVD is of the highest quality, and the menus are very cleverly designed, with each submenu being themed after a mutant power in the film. The only thing missing is a blooper reel, which I was hoping for. But anyway, this 2-Disc set is certainly worth your money!
