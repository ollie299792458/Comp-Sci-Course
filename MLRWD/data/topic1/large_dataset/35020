I don't get these people who are complaining that this movie is not for kids.  It's almost like they forget that the movie is rated "PG" - not "G."  It gets the PG rating for a reason - as stated in the other reviews.  This is not the light fluffy Benji from your childhood, it's an updated version that addresses puppy mills.  Not exactly a "G" movie topic.

Was the movie great?  Well, the script was lacking, the characters were VERY broadly portrayed, and there were a couple scenes not for young sensitive children (read: kids under five years old).  So for all intents and purposes, no, the movie wasn't great.

But I loved it anyway.  For all its flaws, it had me at hello and I loved it.  So did my daughter, who asked to watch it again as soon as the closing credits began to play.

To those who claim it's not a family movie - they are wrong.  This is an EXCELLENT movie for families to watch together and gives the opportunity to parents explain to children why puppy mills are bad and why ASPCA is beneficial for your local community.  It's an excellent tool to educate children about those issues.
