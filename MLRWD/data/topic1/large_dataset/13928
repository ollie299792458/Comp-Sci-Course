For many, the FX and story will seem so out of date.  But, you've got to approach this with the mind and eyes of the beginning of the computer age in 1982.  Put into that context, the audacity of TRON is just amazing.  No one had ever seen a movie about "users", "programs", "bits", and the "MCP".  Few were even aquainted with the terms.  Add the that the absolutely fantastic use of back-lit animation, and you have a completely unique film.  So many of the ideas in TRON came into everyday usage with the power of personnal computing.  And the thought of a "Master Control Program" taking over has become the fodder for many stories.  The blu-ray contains new special features as well as the original "making of ... " documentary.  It still amazing to think that TRON is considered such a major step into computer animation, when most of it was done by hand rather than in a computer.  It's also amazing to understand that TRON was the real beginning of Disney computer animation that is used so much today, and was also the impetus for Pixar.  If you enjoy the original STAR WARS, in it's 1977 state-of-the-art FX, then you'll love TRON.  Head back to 1982 and the beginnings of the computer age.
