It had been a rough day so I thought I'd take in a late night movie. Sadly, the choices were very limited and I wasn't sure what to see so I read the blurb about each show outside the theater. Pathetically, that failed to describe this horrible excuse of a movie in enough detail - I've always been interested in ancient American history and thought that a movie about a Mayan pyramid might be interesting. How wrong I was! Without question, "the Ruins" is the worst, and I mean that literally, movie I have ever seen. Why I didn't walk out, I don't know. In addition to the horrible amount of blood and gore (enough blood was lost to have filled the world's blood banks for the next decade), the script can best be described as asinine. At least Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was intended to be a spoof - in comparison, this hideous film looks like an attempt to turn Killer Tomatoes into an art film.

Update: Even though I just posted this review, I've just discovered that all of the local theaters have yanked this from their offerings - at least others won't be subjected to it now.
