Shooting for observational humor and pain on a shoestring budget, Oscar-nominated writer ("Gilbert Grape","About a Boy") and first-time director Peter Hedges almost misses as much as he hits. That said, "Pieces of April" is definitely worth 81 minutes of your time.
Consider yourself warned: This baby pulls no punches. Whether it's cancer, family cruelty, life in New York City slums, or even roadside restrooms, Hedges keeps things stark. This ain't your mother's Lifetime Network Thanksgiving movie. But if you've ever had terminal illness touch the holidays, felt rejected by the ones you feel should love you most, or put up with the last straw from a self-destructive relative, you'll find truth, commiseration, and knowing laughter here.
Hedges wrote this while grieving his mother's death at the hands of cancer. The immediacy and indignity of the illness are vivid and are handled with honesty and skill. Keeping April's mother sympathetic without losing her cynicism and insensitivity requires deft acting chops, and Patricia Clarkson not only rises to the challenge but owns it.
The atmospheric and semi-documentary style of the movie is often spoiled by forced jokes and contrived situations that remind you you're watching a movie. This feeling is further aggravated by all the name actors in the cast. It's hard to see Holmes, Platt, Clarkson, Luke, and Hayes in this $200K film without thinking, "Boy, did they take a pay cut to do this one." Holmes' angelic face peeking out from under the Goth make-up and Hayes' overly-mannered "I'm Not Just Jack" performance have a similar effect. This requires taking suspension of disbelief to a third level. But it's doable.
Some will find it pretentious, others inspiring. Just like the holidays!
