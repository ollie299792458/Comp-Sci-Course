15 years' imprisonment, followed by five days of vengeance. But there's a twist: Oh Dae-su has not escaped from prison, he was released. The reason is the film's mystery, and as he attempts to solve it, it becomes clearer that someone is one step ahead of him.

Something of a spoiler follows, so stop now if you want to avoid it. It's not easy for me to figure out why I felt this film was a letdown. A lot of it I think has to do with the resolution. The tragedy seems neither justified in light of the characters and their actions nor adequately prepared in view of the what's on screen leading up to it. For three-quarters of the film we have something the look (apart from rough dentistry) and pace of which might fit Jason Statham (and I don't mean that as an insult). Then the last 20 minutes are supposed to hit us with the force of Greek tragedy -- all engineered, moreover, by the bad guy, and implausibly so. On the whole it is unconvincing.

Not something I regret seeing, because it's different from what's made available at the multiplex. But it won't be going on any list of favorites either.
