This movie was very close to being as good as the first crow. And honestly, I didn't want to see it after the disaster the second Crow was. But I rented it anyway and I have to tell you, I really liked it.
They could have lengthened the movie a bit to develop the characters a tad more, but the acting was really good, the plot was really good, I liked how they decided to go with making the face look the way it did because of what happened to him, and not because he painted it that way. It was kind of cool to see them head a different route with a different "Crow". I liked the flair this movie had.
Although I still loved the first crow best, this really comes close. you definately have to get the DVD. I bought it and it has a lot of great stuff like the training of the birds, behind the scenes footage, and a behind the makeup look. Its a good movie. I highly suggest it for Crow fans, and for those (Like me) who never heard of the crow before the first movie. I'm more of a "Disney" girl myself, but this crow and the first one, I really liked.
