Wow !!!!

What a flawless performance of material that in some cases was decades old.

Most, if not all of the members of Fleetwood Mac were over 50 at the time of this performance.

That makes it even more amazing than it was because the heart of their work occured over 20 years before and was so emotionally charged, yet it did not seem the slightest bit "staged" all this time later.

The band was flawless in this virtuoso performance on almost every song but especially "Dreams", "I'm So Afraid.....amazing showstopper" and others like "Gypsy" and "Go Your Own Way".

Really I feel like I am being dismissive of the other performances, because they were literally ALL great.

This was a chance for a special, once in a lifetime band to flex their creative muscles and they did it with brute strength and tremendous confidence.

A TRIUMPHANT occasion for Fleetwood Mac.

10 STARS !!!!!!!!!

I watch it as much now as I did almost a decade ago when it came out.

I think I will watch it forever.

Otherwise, I would be short changing myself.

It is pure bliss every time.

Timeless, Classic, Essential.......AWE INSPIRING !!!!!!!!!!

I have run out of superlatives.
