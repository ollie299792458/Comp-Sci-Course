Return to me is one of my favorite movies. It is both a drama and a romantic comedy.I alternately cry and laugh throughout the whole film.  The story takes place in Chicago and is about a man named Bob (played by hot David Duchovny) who is madly in love with his wife of 15 years.  She unexpectedly dies one evening in a car crash, which of course leaves him devasted and convinced he will never fall in love again.  About a year later he meets a young woman named Grace (played beautifully by Minnie Driver)who works as a waitress in her grandfather's restaurant. She has lived a very sheltered life due to her parents early death and her health problems.  She and Bob fall in love almost immediately when he comes into her restaurant one day while on a terrible blind date.  Grace and Bob date for several months.  Grace keeps a secret from him- she is too afraid of telling him she had a heart transplant for fear he will not be attracted to her once he sees her large scar.  She almost tells him one evening at his house but doesn't when she discovers his wife died on the day she received a new heart. I won't tell anymore about the rest of the film.  I don't want to spoil the ending.  This movie has no sex or violence which I appreciate.  It has beautiful scenery and beautiful background music, mainly old jazz from Frank Sinatra and other greats.  I have a hard time believing anyone could dislike Return to Me.
