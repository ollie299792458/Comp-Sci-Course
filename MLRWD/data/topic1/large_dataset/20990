I had no interest in seeing THE LAST SAMURAI when it was in theaters.  Then recently I caught a portion of the movie on a cable channel and knew immediately I had to have the DVD.  Since I got it, I have watched it 3 or 4 times.  I am totally in awe of the acting performances in THE LAST SAMURAI.  While I have never been a Tom Cruise fan (the publicity about him does not sway me one way or the other), this movie has given me a great appreciation of his talent.  It made me also realize what a tremendous amount of preparation work and physical training it takes for an actor to develop the skills for his roll.  Other performances in the movie were exceptional, especially that of Ken Watanabe.  If you have never seen THE LAST SAMURAI, don't have a clue what it is all about, or don't think its subject matter would interest you, take a chance.  If you don't want to buy it (the price is right), rent it.  After you have seen it, you will want to own it.  Don't like Tom Cruise?  Don't let that stop you.  My husband doesn't like him, yet he loved this movie.  His remark:  "Tom Cruise must be a really good actor, because I don't like him, and yet I really liked the person he played."  Don't miss this one!
