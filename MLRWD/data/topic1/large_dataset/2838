~SPOILER~
Season 7 of "House" is definitely different than any of the previous seasons, and I believe it is arguably one of the best. Although these episodes are quite different from the ones we're used to, I think the show is going in a direction that is both creative and intriguing. In his relationship with Cuddy, we are able to see House in a way that we've never seen him before. He shows us that after everything he's been through, he's still capable of loving someone. Some of the best scenes can be seen in Season 7, especially the scene where House jumps from his hotel balcony. This is one of the most intense scenes I've seen throughout the entire series. While it's only a couple minutes long, it is able to give the viewer a ton of information and creates so many different emotional reactions. If there was any inclination that House had changed for the better after rehab and his relationship with Cuddy, those feelings are completely gone after this scene. House is even more destructive and unpredictable than he was in the previous seasons. As strange as it seems, this is the House character that fans have grown to love. I'm interested to see how the story will pick up in Season 8.
