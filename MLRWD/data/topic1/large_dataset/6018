To begin, Tobe Hooper is one of my all-time favourite horror movie directors. From his raw debut shocker THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE to the Spielberg-friendly spookfest POLTERGEIST, Hooper has always managed to raise a fanboy warmth in my heart when one of his new movies is released. THE FUNHOUSE is a minor work in his canon, which benefits from great make-up effects from Craig Reardon/Rick Baker and Hoopers' own strong visual directorial style. The actual script is pretty lame, with four teenagers sneaking into a funhouse for an aftershow scare. They are quickly dispatched by a deformed creature in the most routinest of fashions. 
The scares are handled well and the excellently spooky cinematography benefits the look and feel of the production. The movie itself echoes an older style of horror film that at that time (the early to mid 80s) seemed to be unfashionable as movie theatres were littered with the likes of FRIDAY THE 13th and the next splatter epic that could outdo the last (I'm not saying that was a bad thing in itself, as Hooper himself returned to gory horror with his own underrated TEXAS CHAINSAW sequel). The cast provide the usual teen-kill fodder, and the main villain (a strange but interesting make-up creation) is always good to look at in this atmospheric chiller that falls short of Hoopers' other work but in itself is an entertaining horror flick that delivers the spooky goods even if a chainsaw isn't involved . . .
