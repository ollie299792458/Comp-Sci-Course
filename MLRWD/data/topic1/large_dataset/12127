This dvd set includes 4 movies, Childs Play 2, Childs play 3, Bride of Chucky, and Seed of Chucky. If you have never seen any of the chucky movies then you are in for a real treat. The chucky series involves an evil doll that is posessed by the lake shore strangler Charles Lee Ray. In the childs play movies Chucky is trying to capture Andy so he can swap his soul into his body since Andy knows his secret and chucky has to kill any one who gets in his way. The Bride and The Seed of Chucky is about him and his demented doll wife tiffany and eventually his sunken eyed creepy son Glen which involve the same vodoo killings and crude hummor. The Childs play movies are rated R for their violence and language and the Bride and Seed of Chucky are rated R for Violence, Adult situations, and crude humor so parents should be warned if they let their children watch these movies. Over all the movies are very entertaining and some what gory. Chucky became a horror icon just like Michael Myers, Jason, and Freddy Crugger. A must have for any chucky fan.
