A decidedly large departure from the special effects, car chase, bullet riddled scenes the majority of todays films seem compelled to include. This film sticks to the basics: While telling a story, let the actors breathe life into the characters to such a degree the audience enjoys the experience. The ACTORS must do it because its only them and the story's "plot".

The plot? It's about an aging, out of work actor that takes an interest in and helps out a young girl cashier as she struggles to get a better job and a better life. Ho-hum. But that's where the actor's abilities count. Turn something "Ho-hum" into an unexpected pleasure.

As I watched the movie, I began to feel Morgan Freeman (playing the aging actor) was quite enjoying the whole thing, not just playing a part. At the end of the movie you get to see what goes on at "non-working" times. You might be interested to see him learning the "proper" way to sell cleaning supplies (with a free mop!) all the while getting prompts, reminders, and corrections from the woman working at the store visited in the movie.
