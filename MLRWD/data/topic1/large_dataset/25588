"The Car" has got to be the best 'bad' movie ever made. The acting is bad, the plot is really unbelievable, there are all sorts of typical movie situations (the drunk who beats up his wife but is lovably  comical that straightens up to save everybody), the single parent father  with two adorable and over behaved children, his pretty girlfreind with  whom he's head over heels in love with (guess what happens to HER??), etc.  But the real star in this movie is The Car itself. It is the NEATEST most  awesomely ugly car I have ever seen. No door handles, windows tinted to the  point of not being able to see in, and a great exhaust sound make this Car  the actor to watch in this movie. Supposedly (information is sketchy on  this Car)the Car was built by George Barris of Hollywood (confirmed) out of  a 1971 Lincoln Town Car, and driven by Mario Andretti (cant confirm this).  There was one actual 'Car' made (for driving scenes) and two fiberglass  copies made for still shots and motionless scenes. The director obviously  knew he had a great looking car as it is 'introduced' in a marching band  scene and when it's on screen, it steals the show. The scenes with the Car  are tantalizingly short and you never really get a good 360 degree view of  the Car. But the Car steals the movie!!!
