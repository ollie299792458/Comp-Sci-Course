We have all heard of the horrors of concentration camps and seen some documentaries and feature films. But none of them could have the same impact as this film. That is because this movie looks at the Holocaust from the perspective of two children, one within the camp and one outside. Both are caught up in a chain of events dictated by circumstances beyond their control.
Even wars cannot stop children from becoming friends. Children have no enemies. Even as the Nazi propaganda machine denigrates Jews, Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a senior SS Officer forms a friendship with an eight-year-old boy in the concentration camp located just beyond their house. Both of them have little idea of what is going on. Genocide is a concept they know nothing about.
This movie evokes memories of the Italian movie Life is Beautiful, because they both focus on children caught up in war. But the message that emanates from The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is even more powerful. Life is not only beautiful, it is precious. How could a man with a family send so many innocents to their deaths? That is a pivotal point in the film. When Bruno's father realizes the futility of his actions, it is too late.
This is one of the best movies centered on World War II. There's not a gunshot in sight, but the smoke from the chimneys is all that is needed to show the depths to which man could sink in times of war. It will appeal to children and adults alike - this movie is a good teaching aid as well if you want to tell your children about the Holocaust. Shot on location in Hungary, the period costumes, cars and houses in the film look authentic. This a must-see for all.
