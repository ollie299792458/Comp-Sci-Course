I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out and i was not very impressed, but because i am a will ferrell fan i bought it on dvd when it came out. I enjoyed it so much more when i watched it on dvd alone, instead of in the theaters. The movie put me back into the holiday spirit, even though the holidays were over about a month ago and what arrive again for a long time. It is a classic Will Ferrell comedy, because they give him so many chances to improvise. The movie has a great story about a misfit Elf in the big city, reminded me a lot of 'Jungle 2 Jungle' with Tim Allen. The Infinifilm features are amazing. You can watch the movie, and then little popups on the bottom will give you the choice to "see how Will Ferrell shot this scene" or "See Will's Double shooting this scene", etc. I learned many things about camera movements and special features such as how Buddy seems so BIG in the workshop while all the elves are making toys, and then how the elves seem so small when Buddy is at his home with papa elf. Pretty amazing stuff on a lot of different camera perspectives. The movie is great for the whole family, and the DVD features are great. highly recommended!
