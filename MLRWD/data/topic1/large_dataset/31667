PLOT: Duane has a problem. Everywhere he goes he carries around a basket with him. Why? What is in this Basket? Oh just he deformed brother that was seperated from him at birth. Duane and his brother Buliea didn't want to be seperated at birth and they are getting revenge on the doctors who preformed the surgery. Buliea just wants to kill but Duane wants a normal life. And when these brother fight more bodys fly including there own.
STRAIGHT TALK: I was impressed big time here. You don't see what is in the basket for awhile and it keeps you wondering. The picture and sound are not very good but would probably be just fine on DVD. As for Bulilea (I don't know if that's spelled right) he looks cheezy,but his face is cool cuz it looks exactly like Duane's. He kills people by ripping their faces which was different. All together a great and original flick.
CAST: The people who live in the hotel provide interesting characters for the film. Duane is an intersing one,who acts like there is nothing in the basket. Good cast.
KILLS: Bulilea ripping people's faces to shreds. Lots o blood.
CONCLUSION: Like I said I was impressed. I like to see it on DVD. Don't pass this one by at the movie rental place. But do watch out for the sequels. ...
