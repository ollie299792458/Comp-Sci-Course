This is simply the BEST romantic movie I have ever seen. I have watched it THREE times consecutively & NEVER got board!!. Every time I was watching it as if it's the first time!. After watching it, I spent four hours or something thinking about it like I'm London (Shane West).

Generally, I'm not into these kinds of movies, but once I have seen the first half part over a TV & didn't complete it, as I was busy with something.

However, something in that movie has touched me that I could not explain it!. Thus, I decided to rent it firstly to figure out what this movie is all about?!, & I was SO touched, impressed & turned upside down!. Then, I had to purchase it...

Well, I don't believe that there is a girl in the world like Jamie's character (Mandy Moore) in her simplicity, passion & softness. Because, if there's such a character most of the guys will do MORE than London (Shane West) does to Jamie (Mandy Moore) in that movie.

Actually & without an embarrassment or shame, I'm one of the guys who would do the impossible for her, would die for her seriously if I had too, lock her in my heart forever & ........!!.

Anyway, this movie is excellent, brilliant & fascinating if you want to travel with your imagination to a fantasy world of TRUE love which does not exist in reality!.

Watch it & you WON'T regret, but remember, you have to get back to the real world when the movie ends!.
