This version of "Carousel" received critical acclaim but failed at the box office when it was first released in 1956.  After watching it again on this wonderful DVD I understand the mixed reactions.  This is a beautiful story, beautifully told with beautiful music but it is dark.  Boy is it ever dark!  American movie audiences weren't ready for this sort of thing in the `50s but that was their loss.

Despite the movie's Bowdlerization of the story --  Billy Bigelow dies accidentally rather than by his own hand, as the original Broadway show had it - it's still wonderful.  It's easy to forget what great voices both Shirley Jones (Julie Jordan) and Gordon McRae (Billy Bigelow) had.  McRae's rendering of Soliloquy was both beautiful and deeply movie, and Jones' combination of youth, beauty, and singing talent couldn't have been more appealing.

Equally appealing is the ballet, featuring Susan Luckey as young Louise Bigelow and Jacques D'Amboise as her carnival dancing partner.  The choreography was based on the great Agnes De Mille's choreography for the original Broadway procuction.

The film's original 2.55:1 formatting and multi-channel soundtrack have been retained.  The whole thing looks and sounds pristine.

Highly recommended!
