In the third slasher installment to the SCREAM trilogy, a new murderous killer in a ghost mask is on the loose, stalking the cast and crew of the new "STAB 3" film.  Now DEWEY (David Arquette) and GALE (Courtney Cox Arquette) return to get the story behind these killings, and to protect SYDNEY (Neve Campbell).  Yet, killing this one might be harder than they think, considering he is supposed to be "superhuman" and more gruesome.  Leaving behind pictures of Maurie Prescott, SID knows that it's time to end it with the third and final Stab of the Woodsborough Murders.
MY REVIEW:
"This shockingly fun thriller really knows how to end the trilogy, but it's nothing more than I expected.  The end is satisfying, some of the twists were fun, but some of the acting was just too outdone.  The one problem I had with the end, is that the killer always comes back for one more scare.  THAT IS TOO EXPECTED!  They do that in all horror movies!  Especially the SCREAM movies, they really point it out!  Wouldn't WES CRAVEN figure out that we've gotten passed that????  Who knows.  Yet I was satisfied with NEVE CAMPBELL, DAVID ARQUETTE, and COUTNEY COX ARQUETTE's performances.  
The film was overall, chilling- but not scary.  There were some laughs, but a lot of the humor was just dumb.  The ending was a fine way to really END it.  The trilogy idea was great and original.  The main performances were pretty good.  Yet the film was rather expected and typical- until the end- it was still a fun film to see and try to guess who the killer is.  SCREAM III is just a fun, super-charged thrill-fest!"- MJV &amp; the Movies.
