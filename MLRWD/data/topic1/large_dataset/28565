I own several concert DVD's / Blu-rays and SACD's

- Bruce Springsteen - Seager Sessions
- Dido
- James Taylor: Live at the Beacon Theater
- Allison Kraus and Union Station
- Eric Clapton
- John Mayer
- David Grey
- Diana Krall
- Blue Man Group
etc

Before owning this Blu-Ray, James Taylor: Live at the Beacon was my favorite DVD.  The 5.1 soundtrack on that concert was the best I had heard.  There was nothing distracting about it - the different channels blended seemlessly for an excellent and very relaxing experience.  I'm always on the look out for recording's like that.  I hate getting a DVD and being frustrated by poor mixing - usually in the surround channels; sometimes in the levels of the different instruments - Diana Krall in Paris is one example - something about it just didn't sit right with me.  The piano just seemed out of place in the soundtrack - not bad, just didn't fit together like I hoped it would.  Bruce Springsteen's Blu-ray is better but at times it can be difficult to set the surround speakers to the right level so that they don't become distracting.  The Dave Matthews Blu-ray is the best recording I've heard.  I listen to it over some highend speakers using the TrueHD soundtrack and it transports you into the concert hall for one of the best concert experiences you can get without actually being at the concert.  Its just two guitars and an occasional piano.  When Tim Reynold strums his guitar you hear every vibration and it is mixed about as perfectly as it can be with absolutely no distractions from the surround speakers (like too much ambience, etc).  I highly recomend this blu-ray to anyone looking for an incredibly well mixed soundtrack and songs that just about anyone can enjoy even if they don't know any Dave Matthews songs.  My second recomendation would still be JT (the original JT): Live at the Beacon
