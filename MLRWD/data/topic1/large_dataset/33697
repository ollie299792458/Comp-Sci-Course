Daniel Craig was one of the producers of this film, part of which I caught on Showtime, then bought on Blu-Ray in early May (not sure why Amazon isn't selling this until 5/25/10).  The film is book-ended by Daniel Craig as an adult movie star, a bit faded and past his prime, wallowing in beautiful women and drugs (yeah, I know. But it isn't fulfilling)

He reflects back on his teen years growing up in a seaside Australian community.  His first love is somewhat interrupted by the attentions of an older woman, who cannot resist his charms.  What's a horny young guy to do? But least this sound like a teen comedy, it's not. It's a serious coming-of-age story with a touching and convincing performance by Harry Eden.  There are consequences to his involvement with an older woman. And the director/writer of this tale handles it well.

Though it won't make the same kind of money, this film was way better than "The Invasion," a big-budget flick that Mr. Craig did with Nicole Kidman.  He obviously wanted to give this film and the director a push and graciously lends his name and talent to the project, allowing the lion's share of the film to be carried by Mr. Eden. But his scenes with his housekeeper and a stereotyped Hollywood agent and more stereotyped young turk director are nuanced and reveal his character's inner torment.

Kudos to everyone involved in this project.  It's the kind of cool smaller film that used to be made all the time.
