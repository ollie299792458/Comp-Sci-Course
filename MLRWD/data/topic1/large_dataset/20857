I've loved Oscar Wilde for as long as i can remember.  I wrote my senior thesis on him and have seen every version of every Wilde play I can manage.  One thing that has bothered me about every Oscar Wilde play put to film so far is how dry and flat they portray his work.  His plays are light hearted and fun, not serious and boring.  I was hoping this film with its impressive cast would finally get it right.  Nope.  I will say it is better than most but Rupert Everrett comes off as creepy (my 7 year old niece ran from the room) and mumbles most of his lines.  This movie does attempt some of the goofy spirit of the play but it often comes off as dark.  It has all sorts of weird accents like hot air balloons or tattoos that I like but may bother some people.  It definitely is not period accurate if you care about such things.  The movie does get better as it goes and picks up the pace.  If you like Oscar Wilde or movies with Colin Firth then you might love this movie.  If you do not like such things you may be hopelessly lost and confused by this movie.  It's ok but could easily be better and by all rights should be better with such a cast.  Maybe my hopes were too high and I am likely being too harsh. It is the best Oscar Wild movie out there I believe and the characters that are portrayed well are very watchable.  This movie has grown on my over time but I cannot say it is better than average.
