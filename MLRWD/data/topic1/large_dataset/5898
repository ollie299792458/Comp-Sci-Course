I had read that this was a really good movie, so when it came out today, I went to the local Blockbuster to rent it before I spend the money to buy it.  Once I finish this review, I'll be ordering it from Amazon.
Some of the other reviews have done a good job summarizing the plot, so I won't repeat.  All I can really say is what a wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, well constructed movie this is.  So many independent movies tend to be anywhere from alright to God awful.  It's nice when one comes along that is so good.  I have enjoyed many of Matthew Montgomery's movies before, and this is definitely one of his best.  Have never seen a movie with Brendan Bradley before, but his performance was great (and he's really cute, like Matthew).  Another great aspect of the movie was the cinematography- the area it was shot in is so beautiful anyway, but the D.O.P. really did a wonderful job shooting the movie- it reminded me in some ways of look of 'Brokeback Mountain' -kudos to him.
The story was very heartfelt.  It could have come off as really cheesy or typical, but writer David Lewis has taken the story to a new level of emotional depth.  It also helps with the great acting.  As the story progressed, I tried to predict what the outcome would be- I was wrong.  But I think it was the logical conclusion to such a story.
I highly recommend this movie.  A must in any DVD library.
