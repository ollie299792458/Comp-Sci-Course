This movie comes from a pastiche by Meyer. The idea is that Sherlock has taken so much cocaine that his friends worry and force him to consult Sigmund Freud. The methods of the two are compared as they join forces to solve a case. It is very subtle and in prime, you get slight pastiches of the famous movies of the time (like Lawrence of Arabia).
It is an extraordinary production with the best actors you can find. Nicol Williamson as Sherlock is poweful, excentric and borderline crazy. Robert Duvall is an outstanding Dr Watson, Laurence Olivier plays Moriarty, it is one of his last films. In addition, Alan Arkin plays a remarkable Sigmind Freud and Vanessa Redgrave the beautiful woman. There is wonderful song by the French singer Regine. Even the dog plays well in that movie. The decors are splendid. The music is from John Addison (you remember him from Murder she wrote).
It would certainly go in my list of the ten best perfect films ever produced.
Of course Jude Law is admirable as Watson in the last Sherlocks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K3JFUQ">Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</a>. You can enjoy the contrast between the two productions, all the art of the first vs all the technical tricks of the second. And I enjoy the idea that Sherlock and Watson were very intimate in the past. It is funny, but it is less memorable.
My choice # 3 is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015HVN8">Without a Clue</a>. The idea is that Watson is the smart one and hires an idiot (played by Michael Caine) to play Sherlock, who does not exist.
With these 3 movies, you can have hours of conversation.
