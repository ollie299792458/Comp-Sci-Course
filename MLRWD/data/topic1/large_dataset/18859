This is a seventy or so minute film, not a story arc that spanned FOUR different superman monthlies, like the original material. There is no way to condense the doomsday/post death/reign of the supermen storylines in one 75 minute movie. Sorry. "This movie isnt the comic" is not a valid critique. If you want the comic story line, read the comic. Simple as that. This is "inspired by". It doesnt even claim to be a adaptation. Get over it. Judge the film against it's own merits. This also isnt Superman TAS, or Justice League of JLU cartoons, so "The voices weren't the same as(insert show here)" isnt a valid critique either. Ths isn't part of that continuity, and was never intended to be. I read the original material, and enjoyed it for the most part. Superman has lines on his face in some interpretations, so this didnt really bug me. it did look odd sometimes, but it wasnt too bad. The character designs arent TOO different from past shows, but i think its good that they didn't rehash them. The writing was so-so, and superman trying to cure cancer was ridiculous, but its superman, and superman was always a slightly ridiculous comic. The violence isnt too over the top, and considering in the comic superman at his death was covered in blood and bruises, Id say this was cleaned up a tad. The fights were fun,I thought,the voices were ok. lois lane's was so so, and toyman's voice sounded a little weak, but overall they were fine. The animation isn't amazing, but it isnt awful like people say. If anyone has seen Timm and Co's work on the justice leagye cartoon, they shouldnt see too big a difference. The animation isnt much better or worse than any JL episode, honestly. The extras are good, and provide a good look at the INSPIRATION for the film, if you want that story, watch this extra, and pick that up. Not amazing, but not as terrible as all these comic elitists make it out. Its a fun ride, and had some good fights.
