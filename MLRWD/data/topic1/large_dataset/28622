This is going to make me look like a snob, but I don't care.

I noticed this thing playing on TV about a month and a half ago, and decided to give it a whirl for the fun of it. What I saw was cheesy animation depicting bad performances of gutted versions of the repertoire's master works, defiling and trivialising the names of Bach, Bart&oacute;k, and others. "Fantasia" was bad enough, featuring horrendous, out-of-sequence, appallingly abbreviated performances of everything from Stravinsky to Tchaikovsky, but this really takes the cake.

If you twisted my arm, and if you paid me a huge wad of money, and if you threatened me with my life, I MIGHT use this as an introduction to the arts, and nothing more.

Avoid this. Also avoid, as a rule, any album starting with "Baby Needs" or "Baby's First"; by buying them, you are only attempting to teach your children things you don't know anything about yourself.

I'm sorry if that's not helpful, but that's just how I feel.
