An incredible post-modern achievement, South Park - Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut manages to seamlessly blend social criticism, fart jokes, Broadway quality musical numbers, and animation both crude and stunning into the  best movie of the past year. Guaranteed to offend almost everyone who is  easily offended, but those are the kind of people who deserve it anyway  aren't they?  For the rest of us, this movie constitutes the best  anti-censorship argument that we've seen and should be required viewing for  all members of Congress, MPAA members, and anyone who wants to blame  "The Media" (or Canada) for all of our children's problems.  
If you have not seen this before, I guarantee you will be hysterically  laughing all through it.  And you will not be able to get the songs out of  your head for weeks afterwards.  I still find myself breaking into  "What Would Brian Boitano Do" at odd moments.  Repeated viewings  are rewarded because there are a large number of background jokes which are  easy to miss the first time around.  
After having seen this in the  theater, the VHS tape version suffers slightly from the limitations of pan  &amp; scan (who would have thought South Park would need widescreen).  But  this has not cut into my enjoyment of the tape.
