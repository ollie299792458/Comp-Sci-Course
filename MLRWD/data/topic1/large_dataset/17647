After seeing some raw violence and sex scenes in movies and cutting edge shows, this series is not as shocking as it once was.  What is truly shocking is the twisted motives of some characters.  Some characters like Arayan leader Schillenger are motivated by power.  He needs his slaves to prove his authoritarian position.  Many of the prisoners plot to control the drug trade, gain power, or just survive the onslaught of predators.  The narrator scenes take us outside the drama and reminds us that this is just a show.  However man's worst desires are shown and we know that such people exist.  We get to know the characters and care what happens to them.  This is not just about life and death, but about redemption and morality.  A few struggle to keep their morals yet must break them in order to survive.  If we know that they are doing acts that are repulsive to them, can we judge them and say that you can never harm others in order to save yourself.  The show is compelling and worth a look.
