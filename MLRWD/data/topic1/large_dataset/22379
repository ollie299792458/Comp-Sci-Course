Overall I enjoyed this movie.  The performances were very good. A couple of criticisms, though.  The depiction of how Yuri gets into the arms business was weak:  he sees someone get shot at and decides that's his career in life?  Just like that?  Where does he get the money to start? His brother Vitaly.  I disagree with previous commenters that the brother goes into drugs because of what his brother does for a living.  He was boozing it up before Yuri got into the business.  I guess he's supposed to be the conscience for his brother and suffers for it, but his character just strikes me as shallow, before and after.  It's a political film that slams the US as a moral cretin for permitting people like Yuri to sell illegal arms (despite the heroic efforts of one particular Interpol Agent) to ruthless and cold blooded dictators, but if not the US and Yuri, then another country and its Yuri.  Of course, these same dictators are given a pass because, well, people don't kill people, guns kill people.
