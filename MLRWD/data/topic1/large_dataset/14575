I'll second pretty much everything the Sept. 3 '09 reviewer said about the BD transfer in his excellent review - except for the audio.  Watching the BD version, I thought the TrueHD audio stood out even more than the upgrade in visual clarity. After reading his review, I went back and tried an A/B comparison - I played the BD version in my PS3 and the superbit DTS version in my upconverting DVD player, pausing one when playing the other through the same receiver. Both sounded fantastic, but to my subjective ears, the BD track was slightly better. The French horns sounded more like how French horns sound live.  For the DTS version, I had to dial my subwoofer down a bit; maybe the DTS accentuation of the bass is what led the other reviewer to think the TrueHD version had a flatter feel. For the BD version, if it feels a bit flat, crank the bass up some.

My 4-star rating is for the movie itself.  Although one of my favorite movies, the plot holes keep it from being the movie I would like it to be.  Kasdan admits to the problem with Rosanna Arquette's storyline in the "making of" featurette, but there is also the unexplained motivation of the Jeff Goldblum character as well as some other minor issues.  It gives the appearance that the editing was rushed.  I was hoping for a Director's Cut with the BD version that would fill these gaps, but no luck; there is less in the BD package than there was in the superbit gift set.  I am disappointed Kasdan didn't care enough for this movie to make it whole.

Best performances in the movie go to Brian Dennehy (perfect in his part), Linda Hunt (great facial expressions), and Kevin Costner (should have brought some of this character to later roles).  The other three main characters were also very good, as was John Cleese in his small part.
