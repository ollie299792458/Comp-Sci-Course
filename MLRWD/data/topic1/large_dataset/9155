Overall this was a decent little flick for a first time writer/director, and Jeff Daniels proved again his skill level in showing multiple personalities in the same film.

The story follows a world famous reclusive (single) author that no one can recognize, as he strives to get rid of his book collection and fix his ailing back while living in Philly. Coincidentally (this film has just a few too many of those) a single chiropractor and a broke book store owner happen to cross his path, both in turn looking to fill their respective voids. Romance, dysfunction and life learning happens in a bout of small doses.

The Blu clarity shines through for Philly in a variety of locations, but there was an incessant artifact throughout that catches the eye repeatedly. The DTS gets used maybe twice (the kitchen scene where the B&W movie he is not watching filters through the left channels and one other scene) but sounds clear otherwise. The supplements are standard and include:

* 10:14 minute Characters of Answer Man. A plug piece that is film clip heavy.
* 9:57 Concept to Creation. More talking heads that cover some minimal background.
* 4:33 HDNet clip. The standard ad promo as shown on the network.
* BD Live. Stated "check later for updates".
* Bookmarks option.
* Cast/Crew commentary. More of a conversation piece, best plug I got out of it was hearing the director stating this first film was like a "learning cliff".

Was not exactly pleased with the type of closure they give, but it is a light film that will keep the fans of any of the five leads a decent showing. 3.5 for the movie and Blu, .5 for the supplements.
