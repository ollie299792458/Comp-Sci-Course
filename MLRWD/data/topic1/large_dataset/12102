This was one of the first movies I can remember watching, and it still haunts me. The book is one I return to year after year, and the movie does what is seldom done in adaptations and remains faithful to the text it was based on. 
The animation itself is wonderful, whimsical, and the characters linger in the mind long after the more mainstream looking characters of other movies blur in the mind. Almost twenty years later, the Red Bull still scares me. Schmedrick the magician is a loveable character, a failure as a magician who still keeps trying, and strikes a familiar chord in us all. I think any woman can relate to Molly Grue, still waiting for her unicorn. Even King Haggard is a sympathetic character if only in his selfishness.
This is a definite must have to anyone who loves fantasy and unicorns. Though it might be a little too much for young children (it scared the pants off me the first time I watched it) it is something every child will appreciate. Heck, its something grownups will appreciate too, since I still love to read the book and watch the movie.
