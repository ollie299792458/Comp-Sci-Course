A disturbing film based on a true story about a young innocent girl becoming entangled in the wrath of an over-protective, delusional mother. Great cinematography especially at the beginning of the film. It feels very foreboding; you sense something horrible is coming, but you don't know exactly what it is or what form it will take. Later on, it brings the movie's pain and malevolence right into your face. The carousel scenes in the beginning and the end are haunting.

As I'd hoped, Ellen Page sheds her typical quirky indie girl role and assumes one much more difficult to master: that of a young, shy yet happy girl who is forced to face and endure the darkest and most evil aspects of the uptight early 1960's American household. This is easily Page and Catherine Keener's best performance to date, especially Keener, who I've always seen play a more cheerful character in previous films.

On the negative side, this probably isn't a film you'll want to watch again, as it is virtually devoid of happiness and hope. Watch An American Crime once and you'll feel disturbed, angry, and sad all at once. Definitely not a movie for those late night chill sessions with buddies, but a powerful and fascinating movie nonetheless.
