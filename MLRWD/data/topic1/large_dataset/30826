The first time I saw this video was when my dad had bought it, and I watched it. I WAS AMAZED! The light and laser show was terrific, and of chorse...so was the music! They opened up the the powerful 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' which had an AWSOME opening to it! After that, they did the cool 'Learning To Fly', which had a VERY cool laser segment in the middle of it. Afterwards, they did a few cool songs from 'The Division Bell'. Then 'Sorrow', more 'Division Bell' stuff. They closed the first half with 'Another Brick In The Wall-Pt.2', then finished with the awsome instrumental 'One Of These Days'! First half of the show...COOL! Now, the second half....COOLER! The second half was a FULL live performance of 'Dark Side Of The Moon'!!! THE WHOLE THING! Floyd then finished the show with a powerful '3' encore finale! You heard right...'3' encores! The 3 finales were, 'Wish You Were Here'(performed outstandingly!),'Comfortably Numb'(the best version i have heard and seen...especaily David Gilmour's long guitar solo at the end!), and then finally 'Run Like Hell'(AWSOME!!!)! The show ended with a "Big Bang" (you'll see what I mean) Pink Floyd DEFINATELY blew the 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' show OUT OF THE WATER! DSOT was still good, though. BUY THIS VIDEO IF YOU DO NOT OWN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I now have MY OWN copy of this video! IT'S WORTH IT!!!
