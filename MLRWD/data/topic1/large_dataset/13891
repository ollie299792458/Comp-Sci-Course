Star Trek III is definitely one of my favorite of the films. Thus, why the director's edition earned at least 2 stars with me.
Why DIDN'T it earn a good 4 or 5 stars? Simple. I felt ripped off slightly because I expected Paramount and Mr. Nimoy to give us something other than the same old thing. I felt almost the same way about Star Trek: TMP Director's Edition. It, however, had more content than this. I went and shelled another (...) to Paramount to witness these things??? :
NO improvement in the sound
NO deleted scenes
NO Special Effects enhancement or sound enhancements
Add to that same old movie I ALREADY OWNED on DVD and give me a couple of ridiculously unsatisfying features including a commentary which lasted about 25 minutes, and you have the gist of my disappointment. I could have done without the small "making of" segment, which was extremely inadequate, and the other window dressing segments that accompanied it. "How to speak Klingon." PUHHH LEASE!!! Does Paramount think that all Star Trek fans are children??
The Disappointment and the let down really drove this possible 4 or 5 down to a 2. Wake up, Paramount. Give us MORE for the hard earned money we shell out to you!
