I wasn't very keen on seeing "Little Black Book" since it has suffered very bad reviews. Finally, I rented it and it wasn't a disappointment at all. The story is quite basic: Stacy (played by Brittany Murphy) is a TV producer for a well-known talk-show. Things are going great for her, and she doesn't mind that her boyfriend never discusses his old relationships - well, until her new co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) suggests she should do some research. It's not long before Stacy stumbles upon her boyfriend's little black book, a.k.a. his palm pilot.

First of all, "Little Black Book" is NOT a regular comedy. Sure, there is plenty of dialogue to keep you smiling and a few laugh-out-loud moments, but the whole concept is just not of the comedic type. At least not in the script, but Murphy's amazing comedic talent (also shown in "Just Married") is evident here and it breathes life into the story.

Second, "Little Black Book" is NOT a ROMANTIC film. It starts off like that, but it crosses the finish line as a coming-of-age story. The publicity for this film didn't do it justice - the trailers showed a hilarious romantic comedy, spoiling all the jokes and sending a wrong impression. This is not, by any means, a perfect movie. However, Brittany Murphy, Holly Hunter and the considerable talents of Josie Maran and Julianne Nicholson make sure it's not mediocre, either.
