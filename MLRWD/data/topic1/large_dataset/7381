Death Proof all but killed the whole "Grindhouse" experiment last year. So much so that the Weinsteins were going to split the two movies to try and recover from box office disaster. Rodriguez got it soooo right with "Planet Terror" and set up QT beautifully, only to strike out. I'm a fan of Quentin T's but he really blew it big time in this one. Even Kurt Russell (his usual goodness here) couldn't save it. I can understand what QT was trying to do with all the boring girlie banter, that just went on, and on, and on, and on. zzzzz. We stayed though and were treated for the most part, finally, to some great raw car/stunt action but it wasn't enough to save this stinker. And now it's an EXTENDED RELEASE, omg don't watch this with any sharp objects nearby. Mercy for the dvd fast forward I suppose, it could save lives here. Every time Rosario Dawson or Tracie Thoms open their mouths hit that ffwd button for a bout 3 minutes and you'll be good to go.

I'm very glad they split up the dvd releases, skip this one and go straight to Planet Terror.
