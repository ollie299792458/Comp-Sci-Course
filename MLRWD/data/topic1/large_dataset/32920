While the events in this movie are based on actual events, the movie does not pretend to be historically accurate in all things.  The movie is as much about the legend of El Cid as it is about the real El Cid.

This is one of the epic movies that Hollywood is famous for making many years ago.  It is long, but it is still 40 minutes shorter than Ben Hur.  Because of its length, the movie itself is on two DVDs.  The last chapter on the first DVD is actually the intermission.  I fast-forwarded through the intermission to get back to the movie only to find out that I had to put the other DVD in.  It would have been good to either delete the intermission or to give some warning that there is no movie after the intermission.

The casting in this movie is great.  Sophia Loren is a pefect contrast to Charlton Heston.  She brings a lot of passion to her role which is what was needed of her.  Charlton Heston does a great job in a role that he was born to do.

The only actor that threw me was Herbert Lom as the leader of the invading Muslim army.  He only has about 5 minutes in the movie, but I had trouble seeing him as a dangerous fundamentalist.  All I could think of when I saw him was his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther Movies.  I realize that El Cid came out before these movies, but the association is very strong in my mind.

The visual quality of the movies is great in this new format.  I saw this years ago on VHS and the inprovement is amazing.  The audio is less than perfect.  The music is louder than the dialog in a lot of parts.

I give this DVD set 5 stars even while acknowledging some negatives because this is such a great movie.  It is a great movie to have in your collection.
