If you have not seen the original, then you are missing the essence of rollerball.  The re-make is a total waste of time.  The original movie was created from a short story in esquire magazine.

James Cann is the rollerballer who has been around forevever and is told to retire.  The line in the movie that was supposed to capture the essence was "This not a game that man is not supposed to win" so of course he was told to retire and refused.  It is a world where we are under corporations who have become our government.  James Cann's journey to find out why he was told to retire is the key to the movie, because the journey becomes self discovery.

My take on his triumph is not about his victory over the corporation but rather the power of the individual over governments or corporations.  Most of us do not allow ourselves to fight "city hall" and often we feel powerless.  This movie says we are not and that it is our responsiblity to fight for what we believe in.

The remake is flash but empty.  I will almost guarantee that after you see the first rollerball, The remake will seem more like a cartoon than a serious movie.
