This is one movie that will always remain close to my heart. I remember my mother taking me to see it when I was very small. I think it taught many of us the value of friendship and love no matter how different we all may be. Even after all these years this masterpiece still magages to get me all choked up.

  I recieved this gift set for Christmas a few years ago, and I love it!  Not only does it include a great print of the original version, but it includes the 2002 version, the soundtrack, a behind the scenes dvd, and a book. I watched the 2002 version out of curiousity, and thought it wasn't anything too special. Its the original 1982 version of the film that I fell in love with as a child, and its my preferred version. Props to Steven Spielberg for giving us the chance to get the original with the updated film! If only George Lucas could have done the same with the original "Star Wars" trilogy...*sigh*

Sadly, this gift set is no longer in production, but I'm sure you can find it in some stores yet.

  Anyways, its great to have this film in my personal library to enjoy over and over again. When she's a bit older, I look forward to introducing my daughter to this magic film that captivated me as a child.
