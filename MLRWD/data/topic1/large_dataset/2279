If you're a major Star Wars fan, you've undoubtedly attached this title to the Star Wars mythos, reasonably so. George Lucas claims that this is the movie that inspired Star Wars, most noteably the characters of RD-D2 and C3PO, and a certain feisty princess. In a short interview that accompanies this DVD, Lucas explains the origins and connections and his own experiences as a Kurosawa fan. Lucas is quick to note however that this is not his favorite Kurosawa flick.
Of all the Kurosawa flicks I own, this is probably my least favorite. Now, my least favorite Kurosawa flick equates to one of the best movies I've seen this year, but it's definitely not his best when compared to movies like "The Seven Samurai", "Yojimbo", "Rashomon" and "Ran" (I'm particular to the samurai flicks as you can tell). Toshiro Mifune does a masterful job as always, and the movie is well deserved of it's status as a classic, but it lacks a lot of the power of the aforementioned movies. 
What it does have in common with those films is the strong visual element that Kurosawa is known for. Kurosawa was well ahead of his time, able to look at a film as a moving tapestry or painting as well as a story. He took great strides to ensure that every element of a film worked to improve the whole whether it be photography, music or plot. It's that incredible attention to detail, a true artists eye, that elevates this film above the story being told (it's not a bad story, just not "great").
If you're just getting started on your collection, do yourself a favor and start with the other movies I've mentioned first. This is a great flcik, but this is not Kurosawa's best. If you're only interest in this movie is it's connection to Star Wars, don't stop there, give Kurosawa and yourself a chance and check out his other movies (especially Seven Samurai). Kurosawa is, to me, one of the two greatest directors who ever lived and well deserving of your time.
