I think it's good just to own a movie named 'House Of Bamboo.'  It's a great title and looks quite exotic on the shelf.  Beyond that, whadda ya got?  Well, it's maverick director, Samuel Fuller, turned loose in Japan with a good-sized studio budget and early Technicolor equipment, teaming up with one of the most effortlessly macho actors Hollywood ever produced; Robert Ryan.  The fact that Robert Stack is Ryan's nemesis just goes to show you that nothing's perfect.  (No, wait, if you want something perfect starring Robert Ryan, there's always 'Bad Day At Black Rock.')

The commentary track tells us that 'House Of Bamboo' is a remake of an earlier Fox noir film called 'The Street With No Name, starring Richard Widmark.  Now, in that one, Widmark's nemesis is Mark Stevens.  This gets us back to the earlier observation that nothing (or at least not much) is perfect.  Had they taken Widmark from 'Street' and put him up against Ryan in 'House', you'd really have something.  Trouble is, they each play the same character in their respective films, so there'd probably be a fight about who had to play the undercover lawman, a role which is beneath both of them.  Having seen both films, I prefer 'House Of Bamboo' to the original (heretical though it may be to say so) and, to get my Robert Ryan fix, I'll just have to be content to watch this, 'Bad Day At Black Rock,' Ryan's great role in 'The Iceman Cometh' (on Kino Video) and a few others until somebody gets around to putting out 'Naked Spur,' where you get Robert Ryan going toe to toe with a semi-psycho James Stewart.  Now yer talkin'!
