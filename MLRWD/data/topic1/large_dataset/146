The movie is long and the story is slow, be prepared.
The story is about three Russians from a raucous Russian community (in the US, of course) playing Russian roulette. They learned the trade the hard way from no one other then the (former) Mother Soviet's (former) client North Vietnam Communist (VC for short,) in a tumultuous tour of duty sponsored by no one other then the (former) War Department of the US.
They learned well and two of them went on to become Roulette Masters (RM) only because the third man disqualified himself when he fell from a rescue chopper and bolted to a wheelchair for life.
One RM returned to the US in full glory, molted into a pacifist and began educating his reckless townsfolk by pulling triggers, roulette style, on them. Meanwhile the other RM remained behind (in Vietnam) and prospered against the odds of the Russian roulette, then a popular mind-blowing game North and South. For a long time he sent his winnings to his handicapped comrade who dicided to stay in the VA madhouse (I mean VA).
The irony was, eventually, these two Russian RMs faced each other in the  game. The story ended with a funeral.
Claded heavily in politics that you may choose to disregard, since the mindless history does repeat itself.
