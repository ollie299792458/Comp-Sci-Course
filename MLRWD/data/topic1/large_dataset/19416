I have seen many amazing performances in my lifetime - including other RHCP - and from some of the other greatest bands in the world.  But, the performance by John, Flea, Chad, and Anthony (in no particular order, except I am a guitar player) is what musicians in every genre of music strive for - harmonic perfection.  It touches your soul to see this concert.  All of these grown men have endured tragedy, addiction, pain, and suffering, which only made them stronger.  Their music is out of love - it is the bond that makes them all incredible parts of a majestic whole.  Close your eyes and simply listen and feel the music first - and then open them and watch the visual, which only adds another layer to what has already touched you.  This 'band' is held together by something far greater than a recording deal or f*$king reality TV show - it is the bond of human compassion, mutual respect, and brotherly love. In their music, it is a harmonic convergence - resonating at a frequency that only our inner souls can connect to, not our conscious self.  I cannot describe in simple words what this music has done for myself and my family - it is simply and truly magical.  My beautiful 2 year-old son (the smallest, yet biggest RHCP fan) falls asleep to it in my wife's or my arms every night...and will not accept anything else.

On a personal note, thank you for choosing to live John - your soul was destined to rise again and grow from your pain and touch others at the depths that they cannot understand.  We are all blessed to hear your beautiful energy through each note you play...

To all of the RHCPs - shine on, and thank you so, so much...
