Superbad is American Pie updated for the generation of teenagers raised on Internet porn. It's very funny despite being very foul and filled with sexually graphic references, allusions and talk about penises and vaginas.

Superbad feels very true to life at moments because it does a great job of capturing the most painful aspects of being a teenage loser while managing to turn the losers' stories into winning ones.

The movie encapsulates a single day in the life of Evan, Seth and Fogel by following the three on an adventure that consists of getting the booze, getting to a party and getting laid. The cast of characters they encounter along the way provide any number of laughs. I was particularly enamored of Fogel's adventures with two of the most unlikely policemen characters I've ever come across.

Superbad did a great job of creating suspension of disbelief and managing to make me feel a little queasy all the way up until near the end. White knights still exist and movies can still end with the hero and heroine walking off into the sunset. Superbad is a little more complicated than that but if you were a painful and awkward teenager like I was you will probably find something to relate to in this movie. If you are offended by vulgarity and obscene speech this is definitely not the movie for you.
