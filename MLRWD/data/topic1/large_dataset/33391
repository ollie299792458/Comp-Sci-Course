<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304696612">Red River</a> is arguably one of the greatest Westerns ever made. To wit: the start of the "Red River" cattle drive - the iconic "Yee haw" scene - was excerpted and included in "The Last Picture Show" (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827902">The Last Picture Show: The Definitive Director's Cut (Special Edition)</a>).

The cast of Red River is fabulous, and they did their own stunts. Well, Joanne Dru wasn't called on to do much physically, but the boys had some tough riding to do. Even Montgomery Clift, who I don't generally think of as a rough-and-tumble actor, has a knock-down/drag-out, duking it out with the Duke - yeah, it was a fake fight, but they each spent some fair amount of time rolling in the dirt. (I personally love the river-crossing scene, where Walter Brennan drives the chuck wagon through the water - a non-trivial maneuver. The inside-the-wagon shot over Walt's shoulder is immortal.)

A must-see for anyone interested in a serious study of American films. Truly, they just don't make 'em like this any more.
