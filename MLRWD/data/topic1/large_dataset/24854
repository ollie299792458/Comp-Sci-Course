After recording all the Mater shorts on our DVR, I was delighted when they finally put out a comprehensive DVD of the whole set. Now I don't have to go searching through the DVR for the individual shorts, and explain to a hysterical toddler how some of his stories mistakenly got erased.

Is this DVD short on content? Yes. But the price is worth it to me to have all the shorts in one place. And the quality is excellent. Even though Owen Wilson is absent from these shorts, the replacement voice actor does a great Lightning McQueen and there honestly isn't much of a difference. My toddler son is obsessed with Mater and Cars, and all these shorts are adorable. I will say, however, that he finds one of the two new Tall Tales - Mater Private Eye - a little scary. It's also in black & white, which little kids don't really appreciate, although I did like the film noir touch.

Although there isn't much by way of bonus content, personally I love watching the Pixar staff stories and learning about the process and how these stories evolve. So what little content there is is enjoyable. All in all, this is totally worth it for the Mater fan in your household!
