Yngwie is the neoclassical guitarist of all time, but he is far from being innovative .The orchestra certanily creates a different approach to Yngwie's musical vision and moves to higher and more emotional grounds.

The concert is awsome; the concept is unique, but Malmsteen's solos sound exactly the same after 4 songs. Ok, that is his style; but he doesn't have to play tatatatatatatatatata up and down every time. I think Yngwie is awsome, but just look at him now; playing the exact same thing like is 1986.

His success has declined and projects like these are great opportunities to show the level of musical maturity a 40-year old musician should have by now.

IF YOU WANNA SEE THE SAME GUITAR SCALES FOR 84 MINUTES, THIS IS GREAT. I bet nobody would like to see a movie and listen to the same dialogue over and over......

NEOCLASSICAL GUITAR VIRTOUSOS ARE GREAT, BUT THEY ALWAYS,ALWAYS,ALWAYS GET LOCKED UP IN THE SAME PHRASES.

YNGWIE, man, could you please GROW UP!!!, YOU ARE A JOKE TO THE GUITAR COMUNITY NOWADAYS, LEARN FROM RITCHIE BLACKMORE, LISTEN TO HIS SOLOS WITH YOUR HEAD, DO YOU HEAR TATATATATATATATATA EVERY TIME?
