If there is one good thing to be said about Mel Gibson; its that he associates himself with very unique movies that are usually quite good.  Breaveheart was probably the first big movie that looked at English colonialism in Europe.  Likewise this movie, which he purportedly funded himself, is probably the biggest movie out there about the experience of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans.  The "native" characters are played entirely by actors and actresses of Native American descent.  And they speak the correct native language for that time and place; Quecha.  Set right before the arrival of the Spaniards, the movie also shows the complex world of Central American societies at that time, such as the religious beliefs, social organization, and accomplished skills in construction and architecture; all done without metal tools or parts!  Like other Gibson movies, there is an abundance of inter-personal violence, most of it quite realistic and bloody.  Underlying this visual spectacle are story themes rehashed from hundreds of other movies.  These include the trials of the main protagonist, who, though injured, outlasts and kills of most of a hunting party chasing him down.  This latter chase scene is quite reminiscent of many Rambo movies.  Of course he does this to save his pregnant wife and son; which is a storyline found over and over again, including in a previous Gibson flick; The Patriot.  Overall, this movie is quite good; it puts the audience in a world few of us will ever think of, let alone heard of.  The special effects are top notch, as are the action scenes.  The story-line however, is something to be improved upon.
