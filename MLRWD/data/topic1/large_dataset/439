This season three box set is very poorly done, the discs freeze and skip.  Some parts of the films freeze so much, its like watching and old fashioned slide show.  I love Columbo, Peter Falk, and the episodes from this season are some of the best, but there is no excuse for such poor quality in these DVDs.  The first season box set is excellent, in the second season they didn't come with as nice a packing-but still fine.  This set has lousy double sided disks, and the cheapest packing yet.  I sent my first box set back for a replacement, and the second set was worse than the first.  I have pre-purchased all these Columbo box sets before their release; I will not do that again.  I probably won't buy anymore Columbo seasons till I feel confident they are made of proper quality for the price.  I have purchased five dollar junky DVD's in WLMart's discount bin, and they are better quality than this!!  I have sent this set back for a refund, I guess I will see if I can find these used on VHS since I know that will play better, even if the tracking is bad.

Oh and one more thing, I gave this a one star rating but really this should get 0 star rating since the quality is so bad.
