Ten years after I first saw it in the theatre, I'm about to pull out my DVD for my annual screenings (almost on a continuous loop) beginning a few days before and ending a few days after Thanksgiving.  Who needs the Thanksgiving Day Parade when you can watch Home for the Holidays?  This is one of my holiday favorites and a staple every year at Thanksgiving.  The script is unique, the performances spot-on, and the soundtrack is classic (from Nat King Cole and Tom Jones to Rusted Root's impeccable cover of Evil Ways).  The actors deliver spectacular individual performances, all of which are praiseworthy--- my favorite may be Robert Downey Jr's outstanding portrayal of brother Tommy, which may be my favorite role of his in any movie, Chaplin notwithstanding--- right down to the smallest roles of the beleaguered co-passengers in the airport.  This movie, above all, makes me feel that our modern American family, however wacky they may be, however much our parents make us nuts, is really just that--- the modern American family.  And it's okay to be wacky, because family (however it's defined) is just that.  And we love them and they love us.  The movie makes a point of asking "What's the point?" several times, only to be told there is none.  But the point is that we keep our sense of humor, we love our family, and we accept that we'll probably never understand them-- or they us.  Just have fun, have some turkey, and have some love.

  I love this movie.  It makes a great pairing with Love Actually as Thanksgiving ends and Christmas begins, if you want to keep smiling and feel the holiday love.  Happy holidays!
