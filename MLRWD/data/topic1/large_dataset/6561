For the most part, I have never gotten into the Western movie genre, although I did enjoy "The Searchers".  So I had my reservations in renting this movie, but did so just to see why it won so many awards and the praise of critics.  And now I understand why this is such a decorated film.
"Unforgiven" touts two great characterizations.  Gene Hackman makes you loathe him as the prideful and sadistic sheriff Little Bill who rules with an iron fist of justice.  But the Clint Eastwood character, William Munny, is even more interesting.  He portrays an once infamous outlaw, who has softened under years of aging and family responsibility.  Had this film been about William Munny in his youth, he undoubtly would have been the bad guy.  So on one hand, as the "good" guy of the film, you don't want to see him become a killer again, but on the other hand you really want to see him kill the bad guys.  It's a great examination of the moral dilemnas in killing, something rarely offered in this kind of film.
If you're looking for a great shoot 'em up cowboy flick, then steer clear of this one.  Otherwise be prepared for a treat of moral amibuities, beautiful cinematography and Clint Eastwood & Gene Hackman at their best.
