Where does one start with this gem from Harrison's HandMade Films production company?  On the surface, "Withnail and I" drowns viewers in an unending wave of brilliant dialogue and photography that finds resonance with all the eccentricities of life.  I can think of multiple occasions where I've personally echoed Richard E. Grant's call for booze while seated amidst posh surroundings.

-Maybe I should have threatened to purchase the establishment and install a jukebox to liven up all the stiffs.

-Oh well, sod the Wellingtons.

Beneath the delirium inspired banter and gorgeous photography lies the insatiable need for direction in a world outfitted with trivial forks in the road.  Mainly written as an auto-biographical response to his days as a struggling actor, Bruce Davison condenses that untapped sense of frightful wonderment into a non-linear epic that converts even the most irrational Holiday into an unmistakable need for order, security, fulfillment.

Feeling trapped in your apartment.  Fishing with guns.  Demanding animal flesh for dinner.  Roaming around the green fields of Cumbria.  Demanding to know why onions have been poisoned.  Throwing yourself into the road.  Walking through the zoo in the rain to say goodbye.

From the outside, an initial reaction may be to change gears... but all of this chaos culminates in an amazing journey where you're left wondering "what really happened to Withnail and Marwood (I)?"

An absolute gem.
