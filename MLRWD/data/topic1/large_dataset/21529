The fresh faces are in abundance with Asthon Kuthcer and Brittany Murphy front lining this light comedic affair, however the movie seems to try to draw most of it's laughs from an overabundance of pratfall and stooge-like physical comedy.  Though it works in places, too much of a good thing can be too much of a good thing.  Most of the sight gags seems to involve noses and faces and blows to the noses and faces.  You see it the first time as Murphy gets pegged by a Kutcher-launched football on the beach, you chuckle.  You see it the 10th time and you groan...there the blow to the nose gag again...let me set my stopwatch...in 5 minutes we can expect the next one.  It gets predictable.
With that said, "Just Married," can be enjoyed as a light rental.  It has great scenery of Europe and the two young actors can be pretty enjoyable at times feeding off each other's manic energy.  In the running commentary featured as an extra on the DVD, we hear Kutcher call up John Kusack and Cameron Crowe's movie, "Say Anything," as inspiration.  And that's where the merit of this comedy can be weighed.  Next to, "Say Anything," "Just Married," is a flat honeymoon.  It just won't stand out years from now as a movie to be remembered.
Director, Shawn Levy's instincts pays off letting his actors ad lib scenes with some of the movies most enjoyable moments coming with the zany interplay between Kutcher and Murphy.  Though I'm not sure this would be one to buy, unless your a big fan of light comedies, I'd say it would be a good rent if you didn't have anything else in mind to watch.
How does it end..."I'll never tell.."
