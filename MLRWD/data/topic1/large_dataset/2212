This video is incredibly good; I have had the tape version for years.  What musician wouldn't want to be on that stage!  I liked everything and have been an Orbison fan for years--a James Burton fan for equally as long.  To me, the very best number on this, at least it's on the video tape version, is the last one. They don't announce it, its not in the credits, and I've never been able to find it anywhere else.  It would seem that it is called "Dream You", as those are the main theme words.  Not only is Orbison incredible, but so is Burton.  He takes off on an improvised lead solo that only Burton could create, with that slight mix of country blended with rock.  He covers the fretboard, scaling octaves up and down, making it look easy and totally natural, which it is not, and this I know because I learned how to play it myself from watching and listening to the tape. I think its one of my favorite lead guitar licks ever. I  wish I could find a studio-recorded version of that song, and find out if Roy wrote it.
