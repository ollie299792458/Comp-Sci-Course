Just watched the film and here is my take on it.

The movie reminded me of Faust. Here is the problem with it. Great Actors, Creative, Imaginary Director but it lacks heart. Tim Burton also struck out in my humble opinion for the same reason with, Alice and Wonderland. All fluff and no heart. Watch Big Fish or Edward Scissorhands and you will see what I'm talking about. Even Sweeney Todd and the Nightmare Before Christmas had heart and a pulse.

I'm a Big fan of David Lynch, Luis Bunuell and other surrealist filmmakers and the school of thought is, touch the audience or frazzle their minds or do both. This film did neither. I even think Mr. Gilliam missed the mark when he went dark in Tideland. Mr. Gilliam was spot on though with The Fisher King (Lots of heart) The formula is actually simple, get us to care about these characters and then take us on an emotional head trip. Unfortunately, this film never gets us to care about the characters.

If Mr. Ledger (an incredible Actor)was still alive the movie would be a bomb and rightfully so (Sorry Mr. Gillian but you can do much better) The fact that this is Heath Ledgers final film and Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Collin Farrell are in the movie will save the reviews and get people to rent it. Even though this is officially Heath Ledgers last film, I think his role as the Joker in the Dark Knight was an awesome way to say goodbye to his fans. RIP Mr. Ledger.
