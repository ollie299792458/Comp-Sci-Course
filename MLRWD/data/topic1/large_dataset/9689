I was recommended this DVD by a fellow U2 fan, and I have to say... he was SOOO right about this being an awesome movie! In the 1980's, U2 was on top of their game. The bigscreen gave audiences all over a chance to marvel in their greatness. However, not everybody got what the band was trying to do at the time. The album RATTLE AND HUM was a record "made by fans," as Bono puts it. The movie showed how great the band truly was, but rubbed people the wrong way as they played with top musicians B.B. King and covered Beatles and Dylan songs. U2 was not trying to show they were rock legends like Elvis or Bob Dylan... yet, through the years and through watching them in the movie, you can see how they will emerge as legends. Now presently, U2 have proven themselves as one of the very topmost bands in the rock pantheon whether everyone wants to admit it or not. This movie is truly a window into THE HYPE of when U2 was first making it HUGE. The best I think, was even yet to come. (See: Elevation Live from Boston!)
