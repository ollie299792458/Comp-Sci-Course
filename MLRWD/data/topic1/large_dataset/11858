Here is how I knew the movie was funny-- I went in thinking it would be funny; expecting it to be funny; hoping it would be funny and WANTING it to be funny. Turns out-- it WAS funny.

Jim Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan a human interest TV Reporter in Buffalo, NY at a crossroads. In a bit of life parallel maybe (wanting to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor while being wildly hilarious??), Nolan's high ratings and beautiful girlfriend Grace (well played by Jennifer Aniston), are not enough as feels he is due something bigger & better as he awaits a possible promotion to station anchor.

In a wildly funny, angry & poignant moment (we all have been there) Carrey's Nolan angrily lashes out at God -- and the Almighty (HILARIOUSLY portrayed by the ever-suave Morgan Freeman) responds, endowing Bruce with all of His divine powers. And from there, the movie just takes off with Carrey given free-license to be a comedically-selfish almighty.

Shenanigans at the station, romantic-goofing around with Grace & potty-training the dog, all lend to another fine outing from director Tom Shadyac who let Carrey run amok in Ace Ventura as well as Liar, Liar. Its a winner, and at only 1 hr 40 mins, leaves you wanting a bit more, which in this case, is a good thing.
