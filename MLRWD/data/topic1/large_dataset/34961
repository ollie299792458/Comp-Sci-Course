This movie starts out very well, but it weakens toward the middle, and the ending is poor.  The brother and sister team worked very well together, and came off as being very real and natural.  The creature in the film was very well done, also, and I highly commend the actor who carried out this role.  The gargoyle-like creature was terrifying to look at, especially when he was carrying his ax, and I would have liked to see more of him in the film, as the special effects were quite good.  What was really lacking in this film, though, was background information on the creature. All through the movie I wondered if the creature was a gargoyle, something unique, or what, but  no background was given in the film. Some may say that this unknown element added mystery, but I felt that it left gaps that weakened the storyline. More spooky background information from one of the townspeople in the movie would make a sequel more interesting than the original, in my opinion.  I wouldn't rank this as a very scary film, but it had the potential to be terrifying.
