I was floored with how good this video was!  I saw it at the library and my first thought was it was denigrating to put such a spiritual theme into a claymation form of presentation.  But then I thought, "What the heck, the kids might get something out of it and maybe it will keep their attention."  Since I could check it out with my library card, it wouldn't cost anything to try.  But when we got home and started to watch it, I was stunned.  It was emotionally moving, spiritually uplifting, scripturally accurate (as others have pointed out, and I agree; moreso than other cinematic depictions I have seen), AND it was incredibly insightful.  There were scenes portrayed that I have read many times, but upon seeing them in this movie for the first time gave me a new (and possibly more accurate) way of looking at events in His life.  I just looked at my wife and said, "Who would have ever thought this could be SO good?"  I'm buying it tonight.  And to every person in the world who takes Christ seriously, I say God has, in my opinion, worked another Miracle of sorts through those people who produced this film.  (Whether they know it or not.)  Buy it for your personal library.  Buy copies for your friends.  You will not be disappointed.
