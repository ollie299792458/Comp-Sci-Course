When I heard this movie came out in the theaters, I was a little unsure that I would like it.  But, after seeing parts of the old Hairspray movie with Ricki Lake and Deborah Harry, I didn't like that version at all.  But, when this one came straight to video, I just had to rent it to see for myself.  And I am glad I did.  Seeing John Travolta dressed in a body suit to be made up like a woman was the funniest part of all and seeing him dance in the outfit.  And Michelle Pfeiffer was even awesome looking too.  Here's a bit of trivia for you..what do John Travolta and Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie both have in common?  ANSWER: They both starred in Grease movies.  So Michelle and John have both been in Grease and Grease 2.  To me, this is Michelle's 2nd musical she's been in, and I think John's been in some others.  And Nikki Blonsky who plays the lead character Tracy Turnblad she the most awesome voice when she sang.  Queen Latifah rocks in some of her musical numbers.  The dance numbers were incredible.  And Christopher Walken does a singing number with John Travolta.  After renting, watching, now I want to go and buy it to my musical collection.  I would advise you do the same. This will be one you won't want to pass up.
