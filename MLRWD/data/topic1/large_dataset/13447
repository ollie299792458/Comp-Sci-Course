Why can't they make movies like these today?... Movies like these don't just have humor, but they have characters the viewer cares about and remembers, and romance. These are really lighthearted romances with great characters, and funny and clever dialogue. This set is one of my all time favorites!

Pillow Talk (my absolute favorite) I would give it 6/5 stars (even if that sounds a bit cliche)...I simply love the ending scene when Brad (the hero) carries Jan (the heroine) all the way to his appartment, talk about sexy!

Send Me No Flowers, another great movie and a favorite of mine, I would give it 5/5 stars... And while it is a comedy, the story at it's heart here is very profound and a testiment to true love.

Lover come back is also a good romantic comedy but the weakest movie in this great set, I give it a 4/5 stars because while I enjoyed it, I didn't like it as much as the other two.

I love this set of movies, and I always find myself watching them from time to time... and they are a teasured part of my keeper shelf! Timeless...
