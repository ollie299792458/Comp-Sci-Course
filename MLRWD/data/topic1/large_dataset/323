This movie is Cusack doing Cusack, not Cusack doing Poe. If you can make it past the godawful first act where Cusack's portrayal of Poe is so offbeat it's almost moronically clever, you might actually like this flick. While Cusack butchers the memory of one of America's best-loved poets in a movie directed by the same guy who brought us Ninja Assassin, the sleazy ass goatee and faux-drunken shouting fits make this amusing mess tolerable.

***Spoiler Alert***
The Raven does not take off until the copycat killer's pendulum slices an unsuspecting victim's torso in half, a moment that will make any Roger Corman fan smile with glee. The inclusion of cartoon gore, a hot chick with a rack that looks great in a corset, and soap-opera worthy dialogue will appeal to ADD kids whose Red Bull infused minds could never handle the 1845 epic poem. The director had so much fun, he lets the killer best our hero in an inevitable climax that ends right where our journey begins. Fortunately, someone from the production department must have intervened to cut this stupid tale short before it sets itself up for a sequel that would do a similar disservice to Jules Verne.

In the same way that Vin Diesel copied Arnold with his entry into the bad kiddie movie genre (2005's "The Pacifier" vs. 1990's "Kindergarten Cop"), Cusack brings us a campy rehash of Johnny Depp's opiate odyssey, "From Hell." I liked both films for the same reasons: intricate Victorian set pieces offset by very gothic undertones. What "The Raven" fails to capture is Poe's underlying addiction that served as the blueprint to his real-life demise. "From Hell" portrays this to a maximum effect through its opium-addled anti-hero, Police Inspector Abberline. The Raven as a whole, is a fun ride. Just make sure to leave Poe fanboyism at the bottom of a bottle of Brandy.
