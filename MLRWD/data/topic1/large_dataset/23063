I wish I had access to the INSIDE of the DVD box before I bought it.  The outside is FALSE advertising.  "A New American Classic."  NOT!!  "Astonishing.  A Story full of tension (that's right, and it was mine when the stupid film ended abruptly) and slow-burning suspense."  It was slow burning alright, but not with suspense . . . with frustration.  The story was going nowhere, the characters were going nowhere and it ends so abruptly and senselessly you are left looking over the entire package wondering if they forgot to put the second disc in there.  Inside the DVD package is a lengthy 5 paragraph review of the movie by someone named Richard Hell, leader of a punk band. ??????? Seriously?????  If I had read that review, I would realize that this was a waste of money and time.  He calls it a "judo movie" (What the heck is that?).  He tells you that it's nothing like a western and the reason it's not filmed in the usual wide-screen, but boxed screen format is somehow symbolic of the limited views that women had when they wore those prairie bonnets on their heads.  I SWEAR, IT'S TRUE!  He then admits that the characters don't talk much and when they do it's hard to understand them.  YUP, we had to use the English subtitles because they obviously couldn't afford sound editing (or microphones).  I'm sorry Richard Hell, but you can try all you want to make the serious shortcomings of this film seem like the director intended it for artsy fartsy purposes and only the super cool will really "get" this movie, but I know better now and hope to spare others from wasting 104 minutes of their lives on this.  Oh brother!
