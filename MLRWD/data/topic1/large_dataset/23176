I really wanted to like this film due to the incredible cast. Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta Jones. But something was missing and that would be excitement and hoping one feels when watching a romantic comedy. This is not even a romantic comedy but more of an attempt to show the world how shallow celebrities and Hollywood is. John Cusack is one of the most charming and likeable actors and he is resorted to a role that makes him seem pathetic. The beautiful Zeta Jones is a high profile celeb witch and yes she plays the role very well but I hated her character and was sick of all her of complaining. She lacked the poise and grace that she usually has when seen at awards shows. Billy Crystal is just annoying as the agent trying to get the 2 back together. The only saving grace is Julia Roberts. She is as charming as ever and I really cared about her and hoped that in the end she would win in the end.Hank Azaria, Seth Green, and Christopher Walken are great in their supporting roles and were far more interesting then the leads. A predictable story and unlikeable characters make this film something is wasn't suppose to be. It should have been a feel good romantic comedy that turned out to be an annoying, unsympathtic film that tried to bank on it's first class cast.
