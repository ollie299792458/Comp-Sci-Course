SPOILER WARNING!

I, as a filmmaker, was not expecting much from the latest sequel to Child's Play. Usually whenever a horror movie moves into space, or involves a rap artist, that's usually the all-time low. Well, I began to watch.

First thing off the bat is the first person perspective dream sequence that alluded to Hitchcock's Psycho, and Halloween. I enjoyed this, especially when the father falls down the stairs, which was a great use of this technique.

But right before things got too serious, it's revealed at the very beginning that this movie is going to be taking jabs at itself, it's actors, and everybody involved.

I hate rap music, and I hate rap artists trying to be actors, and beating up our horror icons (see Halloween: Resurrection). Redman's performance was brilliant, as he played himself trying to score, and make it big with his acting career, which he is taunting by mentioning it. Also, he's trying to score with Tilly, a commendable goal. His delivery of the line: "I had a vasectomy as soon as I got into the biz," was inspired, as he paid no heed to Tilly's sadness and continued eating spagetti.

Glen's gender confusion was also incredibly well thought out. Glen kinda looks familiar, doesn't he? If you said David Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust era (which is when he took his androgynous to the extreme), then you read my mind. Especially funny, is that he even has the British accent.

The funniest part of the movie, though, goes to Chucky as he chops through a door and fails to deliver a famous quote that I was almost certain he'd say. Left me laughing for days.

Looks like the ending of the movie returns our anti-hero back to his solo career, answering many prayers of fans of the original Chucky. Right when I was starting to get used to the idea of a comedic Chucky.

What I loved most about this movie is that Chucky's family reminds me of my family. Slightly twisted, but there's heart. It's a heart-warming family values movie with blood, and guts.
