I bought the CD but came to it via the YouTube videos (q.v.). I like to watch the one and listen to the other depending upon my happenstance. Either one is...well...spellbinding.

I lost track of Rob for a couple of decades after Procol, mainly because I did not like Jim Dewar's vocals. I know. I'm a minority of 1, but there it is. And yet, all has worked out fine. It's as though today and for the past 5 years Rob has been tracking right towards my home and I finally opened the door. And frankly, other than Robin's now classical rock guitar, what has really brought me into the fold is Davey Pattison's vocals. (Well not just his vocals - I like to watch him sing too). It probably makes sense as he and I are both wee Scots born in the 1940s. I like looking occasionally at guys right in the eyes without having to crane my neck upwards.

So Okay enough of all that. Here's the deal. Get...This...Album...CD...DVD. Whatever. Get it for your grandchildren for this is legendary stuff. This is what it is all about in R & B rock. In his 7th decade Robin has become a master and The Man. Forget about Clapton and all that claptrap about him being God. Robin Trower is God if anyone is.

I think you will be spellbound too.
