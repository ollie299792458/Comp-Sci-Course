When this first came out I was around 3 years old!  My memories were hazy  but fortunately I was able to catch in on a reissue around 20 years later.  The action set-pieces are nothing short of visually spectacular, as Disney  was always on the cutting-edge, years ahead any other studio.  One sequence  in particular, when the characters cling for their lives to a piece of ice  SLIDING down a mountainside following a landslide, I believe inspired a  similar (if not as logical) scene in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM  (Spielberg has long been a huge Disney fan!).  My 2nd viewing revealed  that, like some Roger Moore 007 films, the plot is strung along so thinly  between action scenes at times it's hard to recall how and why the  characters got where they are!  And I'm not entirely sure, but based on a  footnote in the Verne novel THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, I believe the book this  is based on is actually titled "CAPTAIN GRANT'S CHILDREN".  (Anyone who knows better, please let me know!)
