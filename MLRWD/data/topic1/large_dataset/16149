If you're into 3D, you're in for a big disappointment. The story was lame, the 3D effect WOW factor hardly reached a 3 (ranging from 1 to 10, 10 being best). I didn't see any eye-popping candy at all. The movie had such high potential, but failed due to lack of story line and the blain attitude of the movie.

In my opinion, rent or wait for late night TV to watch. I am disappointed in this movie because I am a strong advocate for today's 3D version and the movie and the 3D effects should be a lot better than it is.

Overall rate: 2/5
3D WOW factor: 1/5
Eye-popping candy: 1/5
Audio: 3/5
Story line: 2/5
Acting: 2/5

This movie has so much potential, but falls short of delivering the goods.

In my opinion, one should think about renting before buying. At least you can test the waters before buying the pool.

I bought the 3D blu ray because I am a strong advocate for the 3D technology. I experienced this movie in 3D first hand on a high-end 3D system with a 7.1 channel sound system. In my opinion, it is best to watch from a friend's house or renting it before buying.
