Godfather 2 was the peak, it had the flow of story. The actors fit their rolls.
Godfather 3 lacks the continuity, it has a jerky story and the rolls appeared to be forced. It's as if actors were hired and rehearsed to play in "My Three Sons" and found themselves in Godfather 3.
The (too many)flashback scenes were poorly blended into the current day adding to the inability of the movie to keep me riveted.
By the time it was half over I found myself anxious for it to end. Helicopter assault? Was that supposed to appeal to 13 year olds? Seems more appropriate in a "Lethal Weapon" or "Die Hard" movie. GF, I thought, was supposed to be serious, grown up entertainment.
Michael Corleone falling out of his chair into the dirt? I know the message it was supposed to send but really, no one else in GF or GF2 ended so disgraced, no one.
The movie makers may have been in a greater hurry to end the filming than I was to see it end. My copy of Godfather 3 went into the trash, good riddance to pathetic film making.
