The most obvious association we have with blue is depression. In the three colours of the French Republic, blue stands for freedom. Trois Couleurs : Bleu is about both. More precisely, it is an exploration of what personal freedom means, and if we can find it in a social context where we cannot live without relationships. 
The female character of Bleu is Julie (played by Juliette Binoche), who is part of a car accident where her husband and daughter both die. The husband was a famous composer, and was working on a piece for the European Union's inauguration : his co-worker is in love with her and becomes her very temporary lover. As in "The Sweet Hereafter", the accident is not a focal point made to display special effects, but a motor of narrative. Julie desires to start a new life where she has no more links to anything. 
While it is laudable to once again see a moral balance being drawn, it is tiring to see how much movie-makers want to make their characters start from a position of over-independence, instead of over-dependence. About a Boy is another good example. Nevertheless, Blue provides an elegant philosophical exploration of the same issues, superior in most ways to the latter movie. 
In some ways it is also spiritual : not only in the beautiful esthetics of the movie or how it shows the interconnections people's lives, but it is also hard not to compare Julie's attempts at complete detachment with the most moderate eschewing of attachment as proposed by Buddhist doctrine (indeed, the ending of Bleu could be interpreted as supporting this moderate view).
