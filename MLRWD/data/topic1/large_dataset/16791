Like everybody says, it's Karen Black's film, although George Kennedy and Machine-Gun Heston do a pretty good job of almost crashing the film through their own disasterous talents.
'Airport 1975' stars a few screen legends - Gloria Swanson (needs no intro), Dana Andrews (pilot of small private plane and big time movie star from 'While the City Sleeps,' 'Laura,' 'Tha Fallen Angel') and Myrna Loy, whose majority of spoken lines revolve around the subject of alcohol (a major nod to her 'Thin Man' series with William Powell).  Magic.
Best line:  George Kennedy, while clinging to the outside of an emergency vehicle that's speeding down the runway chasing the landed plane:  "he can't stop her!!"  (Why he couldn't ride in the cab of the truck, I'll never know).
Also, contrary to popular belief, Charlton Heston did not lose his mind shortly after becoming president of the NRA.  He lost it in this film.  When he finally gets aboard the 747  - a plane Karen Black has been flying with no experience for the past hour - he gets right into the whining about 'back-up systems' and isn't sure whether the 'wheels are locked' and . . . oh, it goes on.  Hard to believe she bothers to walk off the plane with him at the end.
A film to see, particularly for Chuck and George's over-the-top acting.
