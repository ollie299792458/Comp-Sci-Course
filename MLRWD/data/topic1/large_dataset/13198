I had been waiting a long time for a special edition of Four Weddings and a Funeral to be released, and was very pleased when it finally came out 12 years after the film's theatrical run.  The extras make this a much better product than the bare-bones DVD that has been on the market for years.

Still, I found the "making-of" documentaries slightly arrogant and self-congratulatory.  The film snippets used in the featurettes were sped-up such that the characters' voices sounded noticably off-pitch.  The deleted scenes were quite short (almost blurbs, really) and did nothing to illuminate the film.

Most distressing, however, was the lack of care that went into the film's transfer to this DVD.  Both picture quality and audio were sorely lacking.  The screen was marked throughout with dust spots and blemishes that drew my eye away from the action, making this DVD picture slightly worse than the VHS copy I've been using for 10 years.  Moreover, absolutely nothing was done to improve the audio.  Some parts - including the opening song "But Not for Me" - actually sounded worse than on VHS.  What this great film deserved was a full digital treatment.

Fortunately, it's low price makes it worth purchasing for the extras alone.  Just don't give away your old copy, because the picture is probably better!
