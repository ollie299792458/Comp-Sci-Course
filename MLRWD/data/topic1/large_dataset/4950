What is it about "badness" that attracts us so much? Why does it seem like our favorite movies are mob, gangster, and criminal movies. Not just because these types of movies allow action that cannot be seen in other movies, but the "bad-boy" type allows us to see a side of society that is not often witnessed first hand, in this way we believe we acquire a knowledge of crime and we are satisfied with good entertainment.
Quentin Tarantino' "Reservoir Dogs" surely brings to us a highly entertaining, crime movie. In this movie the director never shows the actual heist, instead chooses to show events before and after the robbery, to reveal each character's personality. The following thrilling events involve backstabbing and treason, guns and blood, (like in the "ear" scene).
Also included in this 2 disc set are a widescreen version and a standard version (i find having 2 formats useless) many interviews, many commentaries, many special features, with a cool menu (all of Tarantino'sfilm have cool, interactive menus). This movie provides great entertainment and an insight into human behavior. Have Fun.
