Have you ever watched a movie where you begin to think if the actor's real personality is actually like the personality of his character??  Well my friends, that is the feeling that this movie delivers.

Edward Norton is a highly underrated actor who delivers a mind blowing performance in this film.  The actors performance is so real, it's actually kind of hard to believe that they are NOT truly racists.

The characters in this movie portray what neo nazism in the real world is really like.  They have no mercy and no remorse for the actions they commit, and at one point, one action gets Norton thrown in jail.  While in jail he realizes that he could get along with all races, and that he could be friends and not fiends with everone.  The problem is, while he was in jail, his little brother was out getting himself involved with the nazis, and so a whole bunch of flashbacks happen in Norton's head while he's in jail.

Overall, this is one of the saddest but yet most disgusting movies I've ever seen, and it even brought me to tears at the end of the movie (only other movie that did that to me was "Armageddon".  American History X is an epic movie to share with the ADULTS of the family, because this movie is VERY, VERY VILE!  = why it wasn't in theaters.  But, it changed the way I watched movies forever, and it sure gave me a higher perspective on neo nazism.  It's a must have, buy it now!
