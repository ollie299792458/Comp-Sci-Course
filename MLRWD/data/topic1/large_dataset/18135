Knowing full well that the movie going public panned this movie, I still wanted to see it, just because. So going into it, my expectations weren't all that high, and I can truthfully say I wasn't disappointed.
To set the stage, college professor determines that the Earth's core has stopped turning and that the Earth is thus doomed in approximately 1 year. U.S. government assembles crack team of experts and misfits to tunnel to the Earth's core and fix things. The makings of a classic quest drama with a sci-fi slant. Unfortunately, amid the character sparring, techno-wiz-bang science and special effects they just could not pull off the concept. 
To start with, even with a healthy ability to suspend reality, there are just too many flaws to make this movie believable (I can believe the trip to the core, but all the evidence of poor planning that the movie uses as tension builders, just does me in). To continue, the stereotypical characters end up doing all the expected things, there just are not any twists or surprises. The special effects are good and if anything keeps you watching the movie it is that.
So why should you see this movie? Boredom; you have already seen Armageddon, Abyss, etc. 15 times and want something new; or, like me you just could not let it lie without a firsthand experience to form your own opinion of this movie. P-)
