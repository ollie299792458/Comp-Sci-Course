The first half of the movie is good. The energy is high--the incorporation of the typewriter with the music in the opening...bravo! Well--done... But trust me, it's downhill from there.

This is the most overrated movie of the year! The best it gets is the preview--all of of the good bits are in the preview. What follows Robbie's (James McAvoy's) "capture"--is depression--followed by more depression--then some hope--and then some more depression.

It also really annoyed me how that little girl still wore that same freaking barrett into her 20s and then into her elderly years!! Okay--that;s just retarded...

And the ending? Don't get me started on the ending! I felt completely jipped! I won't ruin it for all of the poor souls--who insist that even after reading this review--to still waste their precious time on Earth on this movie. But the ending sucks--it's worse then the ending of "No Country for Old Men." Yeah, it's that bad. No, I got it! I got it! It's even worse than the ending of "Contact."
