I love a good majority of Mel Brooks movies, but what brings this movie down is the fact that John Candy stars in it.  I don't know what there is about him, but I find him to be very annoying, and about as funny as a rubber crutch!  I don't have a movie in my collection with John Candy in it.  I think he was a very over rated comedian/actor.  Rick Moranis shines through on this one.  Supporting cast is up there as well.  Bill Pullman proves to me that he can do different roles, playing a somewhat comedian role on Spaceballs.  Somewhat humorous role in Lake Placid, and a serious role as president in Independence Day.

This is a great spoof off Star Wars.  Mel Brooks has put out some real good movies in the past, and he always seems to get the right people to play the right parts.  I remember seeing 2 of his great movies when I was in the service - Young Frankenstien, and Blazing Saddles.  Blazing Saddles has been butchered when it was shown on network television with all the editing, so owning a copy of this classic is on my to do list.  Spaceballs seems to be ok on network television, because it doesn't have the racial overtone that Blazing Saddles does.  I recommend most of Mel Brooks movies.  Even though I don't care for John Candy, I think Mel Brooks did well by putting him in this movie.
