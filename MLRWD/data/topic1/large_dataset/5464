I'm not going to review the actual show- there's about a million other websites that are better for that. I'm going to focus on the quality of the BR transfer.

Overall, picture quality is excellent. Visuals are crisp and sharp. There's a little bit of grain in certain parts- but nothing out of the ordinary for a TV show. I can make out a lot of the finer details that I could not see with TV broadcasts (stitching on clothes, intricate detail on props, etc...). Audio is phenomenal with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA track (quite rare for a TV show circa 1999).

Don't pay any attention to the reviews saying picture quality isn't up to par. I own well over 250 bluray movies/TV shows. Considering how cheap the season costs, I'd say this is without a doubt one of the best blurays I've scored.

You can tell Mill Creek Entertainment really put some good effort into this release. I can only say that for about 25% of my bluray collection.

Looking forward to the rest of the seasons :)
