A friend mentioned that I had to get this DVD. My wife is a big Pearl Jam fan and the friend has been to five concerts, so I thought it was a good idea.  I ordered the Blu-Ray in advance and thanks to Amazon for giving me a refund to the lowest price before it was released, that rocks.  Unfortunately the content just does not.  I get the Seattle scene thing, but it is amazing how little they speak of or show Nirvana and Soundgarden.  Being a 26 year-old from Spokane, Washington, it was interesting to hear about Mother Love Bone and go back and look at all the connections going on that I missed because I was too young at the time, but I had to really read after the DVD to figure out why Pearl Jam formed as it did.

The bonus content is absolutely weak.  I expected much more out of this material.  Really, all it was good for was a laugh to find a grammy in a basement, and as justification to download music for free because musicians' cribs show they don't even know what to do with the money.

Finally, the real problem is I don't feel like I know Eddie Vedder better at all.  Maybe he's just another mythic rockstar, but one learns nothing more about him im my opinion, other than he drinks wine all the time...weak.

If you're a big Pearl Jam fan, enjoy, but if not don't expect to become one based on this footage.  Seems like it could have been so much better.  Oh, also maybe its because its really based on a book (same title) I learned after the fact.  I recommend the book before this.
