To the reviewer who blames Amazon for the late release of this DVD set--you should be blaming FX. Yes, the Region 2 DVD set has been out in the UK for some time, but FX wants you to watch the reruns this summer and THEN buy this set. Personally, I think it's a bit obnoxious to withhold an American TV show while allowing it to be sold abroad, but...

On to Season 3. If you're thinking of buying this, you're obviously already familiar with the far-superior Seasons 1 & 2. Forget the horrible Season Finale exposing the Carver. Forget the idiocy of the plotlines. What spoils this season is the overall feel that the writers had no idea who these characters were, and what was happening to them week by week. Situations arise, never to be addressed again. Not one main character on the show acted anything like his or her previous self. Matt is suddenly a neo-Nazi freak. Julia and Gina in business together? Christian PROPOSING to Gina? Ludicrous.

But, whatever. They got me. I'll buy this in the hopes of catching whatever sparks I may have missed last fall.
