As one who was only 12 when Pulp Fiction was first released, and therefore, too young to appreciate it's significance, I have a great appreciation for the extras on this edition.  There are the usual items; director commentary, trailers (in multiple languages for international audiences), but there are also deleted scenes, each of which start with an explanation by Tarantino as to why each scene was cut.  And to sweeten the deal, the second disk also includes an episode of Siskel & Ebert from 1994 where the pair discuss the popularity and the significance of the film.  They compare and contrast Pulp Fiction with Resivoir Dogs, which at the time, was the only other film Tarantino was known for.  There is also footage from the Cannes Film Festival that Pulp Fiction won with ease.  Anyone who likes this film needs this edition of Pulp Fiction, not only because it is such a good movie, but because it carries with it all the proof anyone could ask for that this film is an achievement in pop culture history, and deserves a place among the classics.
