To express it in non-American political terms:

The movie revolves around 1990s students who, being middle-class with some conscience, agonize and cannot decide if they are good liberals or genuine leftists. By killing people who express morally and socially repressive views, they think that they have found a solution. Nevertheless, they are firmly stuck within the ideology of individualism (hence, the initial naive, or even stupid premise that if you eliminated Hitler, fascism would not have come about).

Finally, they are tricked and killed by a wily demagogue who, being himself a liberal in the 19th c sense (ie he does not advocate monarchy and accepts the trappings of a liberal democracy such as parliaments and elections), poses the same question that has crippled the US left for most of the century: free speech (notably, the movie does not problematize big media -- it's all an individual choice, right?).

You could argue the Clintonite intelligentsia lefty-liberal students get what they deserve from a fellow liberal on the rightist side of the spectrum. This is what makes the movie so amusing and appealing to all kinds of American liberals, whether on the left or on the right: is it a tragedy, a comedy or a farce?

We'll see the next round of this game in 2008, folks...and it won't be for the better of most of us, especially for the conservative pinkoes among us.
