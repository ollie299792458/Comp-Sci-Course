This movie doesn't have the modern technology to create the atmosphere. What it does have is talent and storyline that keep it a pleasure to watch.

I see that for the young children of today have a harder time with the movies split between the animated characters and the actors. But as the story plays out they get lost in the colors and music.

For me I saw this when I was young, and shared it with my own children. That was why I purchased 2 of the dvd's recently. One for each of my own children, to share one day with their own children.

Nothing can beat the talent that went into creating this movie can't be beat by today's technology. The song and dance scenes take you right along with the character development.

Check it out if you haven't seen the bed fly, the magically controlled small military stand up against the Nazi's (if I remeber correctly) to defend their small town.

Again Classics can't be beat,content is suitable for all ages.
