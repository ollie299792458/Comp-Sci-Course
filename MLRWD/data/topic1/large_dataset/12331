Maybe it's because I hate my job, but I think this is the most hysterical movie I have ever seen.  I watch it when I've had a "bad day at the office" and it cheers me up every time!  Maybe because most companies are alike no matter what their business, I would really recommend this to anyone who can relate at all to work related stress, not just to people who work in cubicles in an office.  After all, the rest of the workforce have jerks for bosses, companies that can't get their policies and procedures down, don't know how to communicate and think the morale in their staff is great when it's really in the toilet!  Additionally, I would recommend this to anyone who just likes a good comedy.  I use clips from this movie in training courses I provide at work, about what NOT to do to your employees and I recommend this movie to all my friends and co-workers as therapy for when they are taking an I'm "sick" of my job day off.  I also love that now that it's older the price is right and you can give it as a gift to work related friends.  If you haven't seen it, skip renting and just buy it, you will not be dissappointed.
