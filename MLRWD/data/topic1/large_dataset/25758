Perhaps you may have read somewhere from some cobwebbed film reviewer that the original The Thing from Another World was far superior to the remake: utter utter tosh and more indicative of the age of the reviewer! The Thing From Another World is the "ant in the afterbirth" compared to John Carpenters The Thing (who on earth would be scared by a lumbering bald man). When I first watched John Carpenters version I was left with the feeling that horror films couldn't get any better - I've since watched it about 10 times and still feel the same. Let's face it, are we ever likely to see such palpably physical, glorious and grotesque special effects ever again? Unlikely in this CGI age. Ennio Morricone's sparse and menacing score was also perfect for the film. It was unfortunate that it was released in 1982 at the same time as ET, but class will always tell over time and The Things performance in the DVD charts since it was released proves unequivocally that it is a fantastically popular film and one of the Great Horror Movies.
