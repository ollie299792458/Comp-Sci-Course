_Big Fish_ has a lot to offer: humor, romance, whimsy, drama... something for everyone.  The movie itself is like looking into a story book, or a mythology text.  The stories are so fascinating, so unbelievable that the viewer is immediately sucked in.
Tim Burton did a superb job directing the film, creating a nostalgic, almost other-wordly look at the life story of Edward Bloom.  The acting was spectacular as well.  Ewan McGregor captured the young charasmatic Edward, and Albert Finney (although he spends the majority of time in a hospital bed) portrayed a very convincing older Edward.  Billy Crudup gave a good performance as Will, Edward's son.  Unfortunately Jessica Lange, a wonderful actress, was relegated to a small role in the film, and did not get as much face time as she deserved.  Her younger self, played by Alison Lohman, received more screen time, and she proved herself to be a strong young actor with a bright future.  Another note on the casting: there were many notable smaller roles played by well-known actors.  Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito, and Helena Bonham Carter added great depth in their small, yet very important roles.
The beauty of _Big Fish_ is how it portrays love and family relationships.  Edward Bloom lays dying, while Will and his wife are preparing to become parents themselves.  The movie is beautiful, poignant, and heart-warming.
