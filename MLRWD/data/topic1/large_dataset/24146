Boy, and how that is the truth! I first saw "North and South" when it originally aired back in 1985 on ABC when I was 13--and I've been in love ever since...I've nearly worn my VHS copies out!

 Fans of North & South will be very excited to hear that on October 5th, 2004 Warner Brothers will be releasing the COMPLETE set (books 1, 2 AND 3):

 North & South (1985)--Building up to the Civil War

 North and South: Book II (1986) --During the Civil War

 Heaven & Hell: North & South, Book III (1994) --Post Civil War Reconstruction

 Book 3 was NEVER available until now--not even on VHS, and Books 1 and 2 were only available (until now of course) on VHS. So it's GREAT to hear that ALL 3 will be DVD in a 5 disc set (1392 mins). The set will feature a retrospective documentary, entitled "The History of North and South", featuring interviews with Patrick Swayze, David Wolper, John Jakes and other cast members.

 In that documentary you'll find these subjects:

 Focusing on: An Epic Story: John Jakes and David Wolper discuss the story and mini-series.

 The Hazards: James Read and Kirstie Alley talk about their roles and the Hazard family.

 The Orry's: Patrick Swayze talks about his role.

 A Time and Place: look at the period and the South.

 An Epic Production: Civil War recreations and the scope of production.

 Memories: Final thoughts from cast and crew.

 Anyways, I'll be one of the many to pre-order the series. ENJOY EVERYONE! LIKE THEY SAY: GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE THAT WAIT.
