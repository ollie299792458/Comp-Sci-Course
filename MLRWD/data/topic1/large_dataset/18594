The Fog is number one in my book. John Carpenter put forth his best effort with this under rated classic. I was 16 when this film came out and I made my mom take me to see it. My home town was very strict with it's "R" ratings. Needless to say I was on the edge of my seat. I have a VHS copy of this film but it's not the same. It can't capture the widescreen angles of the original film. The township of Antonio Bay prepares to celebrate it's 100th anniversery when it becomes known to the local preacher, Father Malone(Hal Holbrook)that this township was bought with the blood of a group of sailors who were lead to thier deaths by the six founders of Antonio Bay. "Six Must Die" says the little piece of driftwood. Once the fog rolls in hold onto your seats. One of the things John Carpenter has been known for is his use of the same actors. Jamie Lee Curtis was also in three of the Halloween movies. Films today go for special effects to get chills. The Fog gives them to you the way Alfred Hitchcock did it. With suspence. The scene where the dead sailors go after Adriene Barbeau's son is a prime example of this long dead style of film making. If a good horror flick without all the blood and guts is what your after then The Fog will give you your money's worth.
