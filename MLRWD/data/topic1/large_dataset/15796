You DO NOT NEED to take drugs to get an effect from watching this.  The result when sober is a sense of calm relaxed clarity, which is very worthwhile.  It is like taking a step back and clearing your mind of stress.

Now, if you should choose to combine this with Salvia Divinorum (which is totally 100% legal) or any mind altering substance (which may or not be so legal) you will be catapulted into another dimension entirely.  I learned about this movie after reading a webiste on the "Cyber Shaman" named Zoe7, author of a book called "Into the Void"  - google it if you like.  He described his experience with this movie on the webiste and I knew I HAD to try it too.  I had an amazing adventure.  Watching this movie is a visionary experience whether you are totally sober OR OTHERWISE :)

The strangest thing about this movie is the appeal they are going for, on one hand it definitely is a psychology/hypnosis 'meditation tool'that could easily be used in a professional setting on the other it is a 'spiritualized super psychadelic trip'.  Now, the latest thing in psychotherapy is using extacy to cure post-traumatic stress disorder, so perhaps modern Psychology and Mind Trippers have more in common that you might expect...? Hmm...

One additional note, there is nothing else even like this at all. I have seen lots of trip videos and this is a truly unique offering and very worthwile.  Now where did I put that Salvia? :)
