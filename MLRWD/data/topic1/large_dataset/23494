For years I have waited for this movie to be released on DVD and it has finally happened. I was only slightly disappointed due to the the "happy" ending being inconsistent with the rest of this lurid, twisted tale of murder amongst some carnival folk. If you can overlook the ending, this is a crime drame/film noir collection essential. It's a darkly told tale full of  low lifes, grifters, drunks and which is just the way I like my crime drama. And to hear Joan Blondell say "I'm getting top carny dollar" for her phony carnival act and when a man sinks so low  that someone can say "he'll geek"  make my viewing pleasure complete. The DVD has a beautiful, clear b/w print with great sound. There is commentary for those who like that sort of thing and a nice set of movie trailers of other film noir classics.

July 7, 2005: I just finished reading the novel upon which this film was based and have additional complaints about the movie's ending. It seems movie audiences in the 40's didn't like bleak endings so a "happy ending" was tacked on no matter how inappropriate it was with the rest of the movie. Read the book and you will see what I mean.
