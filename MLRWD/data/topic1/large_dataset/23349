I am a sucker for Criterion, I'll admit it.  If they release it, I'll at least want to see it, if not buy it, and their track record, in my mind, has them holding only one terrible movie; Walkabout, but other than that everything else they've dished out has been fantastic, Whitnail and I taking it's place on the list.

The description on the back was oddly misleading, I had no clue what to expect from the film, was it going to be more funny than scary, they make it seem as if the two are going to go at each other's throats, when this isn't really the case at all.

The story of two 20, Whitnail being almost 30, something guys sitting around doing absolutely nothing with their lives is, for the most part, a fairly common idea in film, but when done with the great wit and cleverness that W&I was given it makes it seem fresh and wholely entertaining.

I mention "creepy" in my title review because the cabin encounters between Uncle Monty and I were absolutely unsettling, I couldn't sit still while watching them, they made me that uncomfortable, as I imagined "I" was feeling as well.

The two main characters truly are the best of friends; they fight, they bicker, but in the long run they're there for each other, to help each other out.  So, when, near the end, "I" actually begins to gain some momentum to make something of his life, we're left with a rainsoaked melancholy Whitnail quoting Hamlet and walking off, leaving us with an open ending ripe with interpretation.  I for one thinks he kills himself, as was the original ending in the script, but, again, it's an open ending, anything could have happened.

Absolutely recommended.
