What can I say about this wonderfully strange film.  I think I may be the only person out of everyone I know that liked it!  Am I weird or something!  I just found the idea intriguing.  It's essentially the same  old "dead teenager" plot of the 80's, like every "Friday the  13th" flick but this movie is different.  From the very start of the  film you can tell it's different from the rest of the lot.  The credits are  creepy and a little eerie.  John Beal's powerful haunting carnival score is  one of the most brilliant scores I've heard.  Then you notice a name in the  credits.  Directed by. . .Tobe Hooper.  From this start, you know you're  going to be in for a hell of a ride.
Similar to "The Texas Chain Saw  Massacre" and "Eaten Alive", Tobe fully exploits the  backwoods sick-o carnies.  This is exactly the material that Tobe loves to  wallow in.  The one drawback to the film is that nothing REALLY happens  until like an hour into the film.  Tobe gets a little TOO preoccupied with  showing off the strange reality of the carnival world.
The film is kind  of scary and then also darkly funny, (I especially liked the addition of  "Tad". . .Those who have seen the movie, know what I'm talking  about).  
Overall, it's a silly, sick, demented funride that you and your  friends will love to watch on a boring Friday night.  Do a little MST3K  commentary to it, order a pizza and have fun with it.
