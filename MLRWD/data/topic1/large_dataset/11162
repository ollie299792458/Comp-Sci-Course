This movie is everything you would expect and hope for from a film having a title like "HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN."

It is really bad . . . intentionally as well as unintentionally.  I mean, the screenplay was probably written in one draft over the course of a few hours on cocktail napkins.  I don't even think they bothered to write any dialog for several scenes and just let the actors make up lines as they go.  This is especially apparent in a few of Rutger's rambling diatribes which make absolutely no sense at all . . . but that is realism, because the hobos you see muttering to themselves and yelling at passersby seldom make any sense either.  Photography and editing was top notch.  Acting sucked, as expected, with the exception of the protagonist, who is Rutger Hauer, and all he really needs to do is show up and be himself -- or in this case, a hobo with a shotgun, which probably isn't that much of a stretch.  Special effects were acceptable, but nothing spectacular.  Bloody, but not excessively gruesome and unfortunately no nudity at all, so it is good wholesome entertainment for the whole family including Grandma.

The only thing I really disliked about this movie was the villains -- but we're supposed to dislike villains so that's okay.  They were really despicable, especially the clothes they wore: school letterman jackets that were spotlessly white, and their dad wore a white suit and acted like the anti-salesman.  They were not very believable villains at all, and that detracted from my viewing pleasure and made me a little sad.

While this is not a life changing "must see" film, your life will indeed be poorer if you fail to see it at least once.  The best part of the film is a 10 minute montage of shotgunnings that makes Death Wish look like Sesame Street, and it is unfortunate that the whole movie could not have been like that.  3.5 Stars.
