This movie, in my opinion, is to the normal American Pie-ish teenage drivel that Hollywood spews out as Luis Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'or were to cinema in general.  The most amazing thing to me is that this film even got made, and it is worth a look just for that fact.  As I watch FGF I try to imagine the pitch meeting between director and studio....Just the idea that some studio exec thought that being in the "Tom Green Business" was a good idea in order to make a mass market film is somewhat mind boggling.  By all means experience this movie if you want to see something unusual...I can't tell if it's any good or not, because I think the point is that it really doesn't matter...I'm just happy someone got money to make this thing and I'm glad that it exists....I'd rather sit through 10 FGF's than any Forrest Gump, or that sort of treacle excrement any day....

Don't know if this review helps, but I'm glad to have my copy of FGF for those days when Million Dollar Baby just won't feed my Movie Jones!
