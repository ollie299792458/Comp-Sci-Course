This band has always been a point of contact between me and my father. He listened to them while they were big and Jim Morrison was still alive, he heard them on the radio the first time they played Light My Fire, and became a huge fan. He passed that on to me, took me to see The Doors movie by Oliver Stone when I was quite young, and always told me anecdotes about them.

I had the chance to get to this movie first and it made a magnificent present for him.

Anybody who likes the doors must see this documentary. Despite Johnny Depp's annoying voice; the material, the editing, the script, altogether constitute a beautiful tribute to this incredible band.

A lot of us may be "used to them" - you listen to their songs so many times, in so many places, that it seems like they are old news... no new songs, nobody with a this kind of sound is out there, or will ever be... well this documentary will make you rediscover The Doors.

This is the story of a train, full of energy, running at incredible speed, tragically headed towards a cliff...and still, it's a great ride.
