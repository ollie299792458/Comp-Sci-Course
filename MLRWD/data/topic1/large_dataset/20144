Not sure what I might have thought of this 30 years ago, but at 68, I'm feeling pretty dumb that I only just now got round to seeing it.

I was blown away!! Not since seeing the Broadway production of the musical, Les Miserables, have I been swept up in such a powerful presentation of the grace of God.

Having spent the past two days tracing down its origins, it is clear that there was an invisible hand guiding the various writers through which the life of Cervantes finally became Man Of La Mancha, the movie. Imprisoned by what was calling itself "church" in the days of the Spanish Inquisition, Cervantes, the sane man behind the mad man, Quixote, finds himself on trial on two fronts. In the dungeon, where the Inquisition has put him, he is put on trial by his fellow prisoners. He defends himself by becoming the crazy Don Quixote, the would-be knight on a quest with an Impossible Dream.

As his defense plays out, he must convince a very fallen woman, Aldonza that she is an incomparable princess. All she need do to make the transition is believe in the new name he gives her, "Dulcinea." To that end he dedicates his life. His having died to prove his unoffendable love, she sees the light, and in her seeing, transforms the others held in prison by the inquisition of that day.

In short, the Movie seemed to me to be vested with a meaning no sane person of this world intended. The original script can be found in Ezekiel Chapter 16.
