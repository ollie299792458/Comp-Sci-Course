This is an invigorating story about a long distance rider and his horse.  Hidalgo (meaning noble) is a mustang and his rider is Frank Hopkins.  The son of a Sioux indian chief's daughter and a calvary man, Frank struggles with where he fits in.  His indian friend calls him "Far Rider" because he rides far from himself.

Frank is challenged to enter the "Ocean of Fire"-a race 3,000 miles across the Arabian Desert through Syria, Damascus, and Iraq.  The host of the race (the Sheik) wants to prove that he has the finest equines in the world and that a mustang "pony" of mixed blood has no place in the ranks of the pure breeds.

Hidalgo and Frank accept the challenge and face many hardships in the desert.  The question becomes can sure will overcome breeding?

The movie exposes us to different cultures-the Indian as well as the Middle-Eastern.  The daughter of the Sheik, Jazeirra, also struggles to fit into her world.

Viggo Mortensen makes a good cowboy (although he goes a little heavy on the word "partner").  He is gifted with languages, and is a natural with the Sioux dialect.  He isn't acting when it comes to his love of horses.  He even bought the horse that plays Hidalgo.

Some say the exploits of Frank Hopkins are only stories, but in the movie Hidalgo they become real.  The horses, the cultures, and the value of determination make Hidalgo an excellent movie for children.
