Like another of the reviewers on this service, I was in the audience during the opening week of Heaven's Gate in Manhattan.  When I read in the newspapers a week or so later that it had been panned and was considered a  "disaster," I was puzzled.  I still am.  The most puzzling  comment of all that I have heard through the years is that the film is  "incomprehensible," or "has no plot."  I have no  earthly idea why anyone would say that.  Is it because we have become so  used to short films that don't require us to think?  The film's plot is  very simple and very easy to follow.  I don't know how anyone could be  confused by it. 
I'm also puzzled by negative comments about the acting.  I had always loved Kristofferson's music, but until this film I felt that  he was a lazy actor.  Heaven's Gate made me a fan.  The final expression on  his face, frozen in pain, is exquisite.  Christopher Walken, John Hurt, Sam  Waterston, Jeff Bridges, Isabelle Huppert, Geoffrey Lewis, and Richard  Masur are superb.
This film is a perfect comment on the Reagan years in  American politics, although it was released only a month after his  election.  The idea of government troops swooping down on the side of big  money has never been portrayed better.  To those who have never seen the  film, or those who inisist that it has no plot, I recommend that you rid  your minds of all prejudice, and become ready to watch a film that will  challenge the mores of American society.
