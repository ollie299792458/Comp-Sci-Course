Up front, I have to say I am a completest. It doesn't matter how many changes take place in a character's evolution, I gotta have 'em all! This first of two Doc Martin "features" (I'm assuming they were done for TV) based on a character in "SAVING GRACE" was popular enough to ultimately be reinvented in a delightful TV series in the UK. I enjoyed this volume 1(and Doc Martin volume 2, as they are named) very much. What can one say when my wife and I are unabashed fans of Martin Clunes? We had to see this before moving on to the 4 TV series of releases. Enjoyable but not something that goes on the shelf as "Gawd, this is bloody great!" However, that said, I do feel one should see this and it's sequel, before watching the brilliant series it inspired. Doc Martin volume 1 and 2 are enjoyable and a nice introduction to the beautiful little town the stories take place in. Let's face it. To make a series based on the character of Doc Martin, the changes made were necessary to allow for a format that would encompass character and personality development. Back to my opening sentence...I'm a collector and I must have ALL the Doc Martins. It just turned out nicely that this and the 2nd feature are enjoyable and even help one in realizing just how much the "changes" in the series make the character of Doc Martin GREAT! I guess I should also mention that the 2 Doc Martin features from the Australia company are wide screen (not full screen as noted on back cover) and beautiful. 'Nuff said.
