This story, written by Alexandre Dumas tells a tale that is as classic and contemporary at the same time as it likely was upon its release as a book in Paris in the 1800s. It is also a tale that almost anyone might find something of value in which to identify. There is innocence, intrigue, revenge, honesty, romance, devotion and narcissism among other personality traits, for good or bad, and clarity around some of the same topics and moral questions experienced by the many vivid characters in this drama. When innocent people go to jail as a result of corruption and a love of materialism, who is to fault? As sophisticated as life was in Paris at the time for people of means, it was rife with corruption.

The movie is excellently scripted, wonderfully acted, and truth is, I just can't watch it enough! Everytime I watch it I get something or see something else in the story that hadn't emerged in my mind earlier. Of course, there are several parts of the film that are my favorite-- if you'd care to know one: look for the Count when he introduces himself to French (Parisian) society with his "Greetings."

I recommend this film for people of ALL ages. If you'd like to experience what life was in France during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, I also recommend this movie. It indeed provides a good history lesson in addition to the moral lessons to be derived from the experiences Dumas captured so eloquently in this masterpiece!
