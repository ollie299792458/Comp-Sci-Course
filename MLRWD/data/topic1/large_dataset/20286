Read the title, that's all you really need to know going in.  And the cast is full of recognizable faces, led by Sylvester Stallone, who has been making these movies for over 25 years.  No, it's not perfect, but the movie does not have to be.  If you grew up watching the Rambo movies, Commando, Die Hard, Red Scorpion, Universal Soldier, Terminator, Over the Top, Predator, Lock-Up, or any of the other awesome cheesy 80s/90s action movies, this movie is what you need.  New guys like Jason Statham, who has filled the role of the 80s action star in present times, is one of the stars, and he too does not disappoint.  The rest of the cast is limited to supporting roles (Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Stone Cold Steve Ausin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews) or cameo roles (Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger), but they fit in perfectly too.

The special features are fantastic too, as the documentary goes into the creation of this movie, and the hardships Stallone had while doing so.  He broke bones, and bled to get this done, and did so by not just acting in it, but also writing and directing.  Other features include the Comic-Con panel in its entirety and a host of trailers and post-production featurettes.

I am also one of the few who thinks this movie is better than the sequel that just came out, so definitely give it a watch, you won't be disappointed if you go in knowing exactly what you are getting:  an 80s action movie made in 2010, by the guys who really know what they are doing.  Nostalgia never was this awesome.
