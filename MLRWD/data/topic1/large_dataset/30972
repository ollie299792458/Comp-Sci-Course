What a huge disappointment.  Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon are an outstanding team when it comes to the Bourne series.  In Green Zone they try to take that same formula and use an important issue like "Why we went to war" as a PLOT POINT.  Not only does it cheapen the entire film but the characters are all cookie cutter and the dialogue is even more cliche.  Add on top of that the director's usual frenzied, handheld style during action scenes (which usually works) but here it's almost impossible to tell what's going on.

What a waste of talent across the board.  Even Matt Damon's character has NO CHARACTER.  He's just some random rogue agent whose gone "off the reservation."  Why has he done this? Why now?

Basically, this is a lousy grade Z screenplay that they tried to cover up with A grade talent and it ends up being boring, insulting and disappointing.  Regardless of your politics, you'd be better off watching any of the Bourne movies again unless you put this on during a rainy Sunday and nod off to the non-stop nothingness on the couch.

Epic fail.
