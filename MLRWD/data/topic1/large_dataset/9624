There isn't much to say about this season or this show that hasn't been said already. I like the arc of this season better than season six: the concept of George's engagement hovers omnipresent in the background during the entire season, and I think it works exceptionally well as a comic medium (I am especially enamored with Susan's ultimate departure from the cast.)

Aside from the engagement arc, there are other works of comedy genius here that rival the best of the other seasons. "The Soup Nazi" has to be my personal favorite of the season, but "The Shower Head" provides the cast with wonderful opportunities for physical comedy (albeit through the unlikely medium of their hair), while "The Rye" and "The Cadillac" worked sublimely in combination. I found Michael Richard's character (and the Kramer-driven plotpoints) to become a bit more monotonous this season, but that may be due to the contrast with the exceptional characterizations from the other three principals.

Of course there are plenty of extras (I especially like the "Notes About Nothing" feature) all of which are worth watching. As always, this is a fabulous show, and should be in the library of any comedy lover.
