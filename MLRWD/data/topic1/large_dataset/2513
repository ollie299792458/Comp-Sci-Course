Irwin S. Yeaworth, Jr., the director provides us with a classic teenage schlocker with youth in rebellion versus a monster which resembles strawberry jam.  Owlin Howlin is classic as the suffering old man who first  encounters the meteor and is taken to the doctor by Steven (that was how he  was billed) McQueen and girlfriend.  The meteor contained the strawberry  gook and it ate the man up while the doctor wasn't looking.  It then ate a  nurse who had to come back to the office to help with lil ole man.  The  doctor was then eaten (surprise!) but only Steven McQueen saw this so no  one believes him, especially a cynical deputy sheriff whose wife and kids  had been hit in a car accident by teenagers some years ago (therefore, he  hates them all).  But the sheriff is kind and gentle and after a theater  projectionist is eaten (glomp!) by strawberry jam, the ensuing panic in the  theater causes the sheriff to go to the scene and now the teenagers are  believed.  I won't reveal the gruesome, too horrible to behold ending  (shiver) but I will state that this is one of the finest bad movies ever  made (its even in color).  It is a classic in its day and was remade in  1986 with the Steven McQueen type character killed off.  Excellent movie  and one that does not lose its zip over the years.
