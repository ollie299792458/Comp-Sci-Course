I think Spacey would have been better off simply making a Darin concert film.  The music itself is timeless, and Spacey does a credible job with it.  His backing orchestra is simply superb.  Despite the age problem, I am not sure that any other actor could do such a good job of mimicking Darin's moves.  The music performances alone are worth 5 stars...

If only the rest of this somewhat bizarre film could be thrown away.  The movie-within-a-movie.  That awful "young Bobby".  The Broadway-style dance numbers.  These things could all have been replaced with scenes that do better storytelling, or better explanation of Darin's motivations.  His "teen idol" phase, which launched his career, was poorly explained.  "Mack the Knife" was by far his biggest hit but except for (partially) performing it in the opening scene, there was no mention of it.  The other characters could have been much better utilized.

The commentary track shows that the things Spacey thinks I should care about, are nowhere near the things I actually _do_ care about.  He drones on and on about the "young Bobby" concept.  He's astonished that nobody notices that the dressing room set is always the same (to pinch pennies in an apparently very tight budget).  Huh?  Who cares?  He clearly needed other people looking over his shoulder and sanity-checking his ideas, instead of wearing all the hats himself.
