I'd been meaning to see these movies for years and I am extremely disappointed.  A couple months later, I don't remember what happened in Bleu.  I saw White a few days ago and laughed frequently - not at the humor but at the sheer absurdity of the plot developments.  This was some of the laziest screen writing I can remember seeing in a movie that was not an action movie.

For example, the main character, who is a hair dresser of all professions, double crosses a pair of mobsters he works with, on a land deal.  Not only do they not beat the s$#@ out of him, they actually pay him 10 times what he paid for the land - though a couple of minutes earlier they had said that they expected to make 3 times their investment.  Those numbers don't add up.  Sloppy, sloppy.  It also doesn't say where he came up with a shoebox full of money to buy the land. Did he steal it, save it, find it?  Leaving details like this out aren't artistic, they're just lazy!

Then he starts a big import/export business with this money and money from a friend but he misses Dominique oh so much.  So, rather than trying to win her back now that he's got his mojo back, he decides to fake his own death and go to Hong Kong and then frame Dominique for his murder - or something?  I wasn't clear what exactly was going on or what he hoped to accomplish.  And I didn't care in the slightest.  I just wanted the movie to be over so that I could do something more productive - like watch a sitcom.

Actors often talk about finding their motivation when acting.  Screenwriters and storytellers must do the same or they create plots and characters that fail at entertainment and symbolism.  This movie is rife with characters making decisions that aren't consistent with basic human motivations.

I don't think I want to watch the third installment.
