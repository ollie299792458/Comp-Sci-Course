This is an interesting Anime in that it is both the silly, funny style that is so prevelent in shows like Ramna and Tenchi Muyo, and the serious psychological war flick like Macross and Neon Genisis Evangelion.  The really interesting part is that Full Metal Panic manages to be not nearly so good as any of the Anime I just mentioned.

A lot of reviews for this Anime coin the words unorigonal and shallow.  Well...they are right.  The mecha, while being a more prominent aspect in later episodes, are basically nothing new.  The unorthadox guy and ill tempered girl combo is just as tired.  Full Metal Panic milks every aspect of its two stolen genre for everything they are worth too, trust me.  Any student of either silly anime or mecha/war anime will probably see direct rips from their favorite show in these DVD's somewhere.

After this brutal assault, some may wonder why I have given this DVD a 4?  Well...its hard to expalin.  Even though I scoffed frequently at the bad military lingo and obvious mis-understanding of war, I still was entranced by the combat sequences.  And even though I have never been a big fan of stupid funny Anime, I kinda enjoyed the short bursts of it intermixed with the more serious toned fighting.  I also give this DVD a 4 because I mean for it to apply to the entire series, which does pick up.
