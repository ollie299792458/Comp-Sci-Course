Some 13 years removed from its' opening, I remember how controversial the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman truly was.  People thought it was going to ruin the face of Batman forever...He had to have a certain look, people said, the way Christopher Reeve had for Superman.  By stars, Michael Keaton was a comic actor!!!  He was going to ruin this multi-million dollar production!!! How, people wondered, could this small framed, comic actor pull this off?  Not to mention hold his own against Heavyweight Jack Nicholson playing a role he was born for as The Joker???  How?  With subtle rage and supressed emotion.  Keaton managed to convey what Bruce Wayne really was; a fractured, tormented soul trying desperately to save his parents, himself, and the world...over and over again.  In reality, he was just as sick and twisted as the psychopaths and criminals he hunted, and he knew it...This is what Batman truly was, and Keaton pulled it off masterfully. What can be said about Nicholson as The Joker, except easily the best villian characterization we have seen on silver screen. Nice twist by having Bruce Wayne and Jack Napier contribute to each others "retreat" into their alter egos.  Tim Burton hits the look and feel of Batman, Bruce Wayne and Gotham City on the head.  The music of Danny Elfman and Prince are right on target.  Good, tight moviemaking...certainly a top 3 comic adaptation.
