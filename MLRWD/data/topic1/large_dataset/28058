I watched the blu-ray version of this film, and the picture is stunning. Color saturation, black levels and sheer image crispness make this movie one of the finest i've seen yet on blu-ray. As for the movie's story it's pretty simple. Washington is an atf-agent sent to investigate a bombing aboard a New Orleans ferry where he meets Val Kilmer's character. Kilmer's an fbi agent who is in charge of a top secret "surveilance" project assined to this case as well. It's pretty clear early on that there is going to be some time travel in this flick, especially with a title like "Deja-vu". But the director knows how implausible this premise is, and tries hard to pull the viewer into the emotional side of this bombing first. This works with a lot of help from Washington's conviction to a beautiful victim of the attack...or is she? All the little clues of her death & the case in general don't add up. This combined with Denzel's performance makes the viewer care. It makes us want to stop this thing before it ever happens. I could empathize with Washington's desperation to try anything to help the girl, and of course stop this 'terrorist attack'. It's at this point where the film draws you into the techincal side of how Kilmer's fbi-team accidentally figured out a way to witness the crime scene before it actually happens...hmm. Anyhow, there are some nifty action pieces a lot of which revolve around the premise that all the events leading up to the attack are intertwined. True, there are a few times where whats happening onscreen can be a little confusing. That's okay. The movie-goer is supposed to be in a flux at these times. It's all going somewhere, so don't overthink it. One could endlessly analyze all of the parallels of time-travel until...well, the end of time, (ha-ha)...instead, just roll with the premise of this film, and have fun. It's a typical good-guy/bad-guy action movie, but with a fresh approach to the genre.
