When I heard there was going to be a "Josie and the Pussycats" movie, I first though "oh, no!  NOT ANOTHER HANNA-BARBERA CARTOON ADAPTED TO SCREEN (The flintstones)!!!" but when I saw it with my friends on the first night of Spring Break, I was laughing the whole time out.  Here's the basic story: Josie (played by Rachel Lee Cook) is the leader of the band "The Pussycats" who her friends Mel (Tara Reid) and Val (Rosario Dawson) are also in.  But so far, there lousy manager and his annoying sister aren't doing anything to raise their music career.  Meanwhile, a major pop music Manager, Whyle (played by Broadway fame, Alan Cumming) just dumped a big pop boy band because they found out they had sublimital messages in there lyrics.  He then finds Josie and her pussycats, and signs them to Mega Records, who the owner, named Fiona (Parker Posey) was a High school loser becoming the world's most popular.  The team is then truned on each other when the messages in "their" songs brainwash Josie.  The three then must fight back against the evil corporation.
JATPC is an a hilarious mock of teen pop culture that everyone knows about (The boybands that are fake, pop artists that don't sing and, of course, Sublimital messages in song lyrics).  Athough the actors don't really sing (what, you really thought they did?)  they are great in the movie, espically Tara Reid, wom her charecter Mel is either a Dumb Blonde or a loving girl who loves everything.  Reid's fianc&eacute;e, TRL's Carson Daly makes a cameo in the film as, well, himself only controlled by the evil corp.  Also, for anyone who lives in Huntington Beach or Orange County, you will root when one of the Charecters says he went to Huntington High School.  Plus, the city of Riverdale is where the Pussycats live.  Great film for teens that love pop culture or just what a laugh!
