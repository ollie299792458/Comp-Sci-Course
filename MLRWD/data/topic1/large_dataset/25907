In a Summer full of surprises, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is another welcome one.  Overshadowed by PIRATES, TERMINATORs, and other expected blockbusters, this film never seemed to get the proper promotion.  Which in this case, may have been a good thing!  Without all the hype, I wasn't expecting much from a band of characters that I never cared for in their first incarnation.  Allan Quatermain, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, and the rest of the LEAGUE seemed like characters that I could do without revisiting.  Besides, X2 did a good enough job this year bringing a circus of comic book manifestations to life just a few short months ago.  Thus, once again, I was wrong with my prediction.  Don't get me wrong.  This film is far from perfect.  Some of the computer effects obviously needed a few more weeks to render.  But with that aside, LXG is one fast and fun time at the movies.  With Sean Connery in the lead, and "extraordinary" performances from those in line behind him, the action rarely lets up, the story is coherent, and it feels just like an updated version of the action films from cinematic history.  Catch the matinee!
