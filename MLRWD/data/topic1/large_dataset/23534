"Persuasion" is probably one of the most exceedingly brilliant Jane Austen screen adaptations to date. It is the story about a love that has known disappointment and is now quiet, cold and even a little bitter, but has never really died. 
The fact that "Persuasion" was made on a relatively small budget does not take away from the film. The cinematography is simple and very matter-of-fact which does not outdo the various locations in which the film is set. The main and supporting cast work wonderfully with a magnificant script written by Roger Mitchell. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth share a certain chemistry that works terrifically for the emotionally charged scenes which have little to do with dialogue and more to do with stolen glances. Sophie Thompson gives a stand-out performance as Anne's sister, Mary Musgrove, a hypochondriac whom nobody can stand. Her lines flow flawlessly out of her mouth.
Overall I would give "Persuasion" five stars. It is a film that requires patience because you'll grow to care so much about Anne and Frederick that it will be hard to wait and see whether or not they come together as they are so obviously meant to. Unlike other Jane Austen screen adaptations such as Sense and Sensibility which is a "louder" and more passionate romp through the 1800's (and just as good), everything about Persuasion is very quiet and subtle. The movie relies on the character's silences and facial expressions which often contradict their actions and words, and in doing so have made, overall, a very satisfying love story.
