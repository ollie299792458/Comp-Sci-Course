Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP (1946) starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall(right) is a very complicated film. It was originally shot in December 1944, a few months before the two stars married. THE BIG SLEEP was  based on the Raymond Chandler detective mystery of the same name. Warners  decided to improve THE BIG SLEEP, adding more of the snappy, sultry  dialogue between Bogart and Bacall (most notably, the horse racing  conversation). Unfortunately, while this made THE BIG SLEEP into a true  film-noir classic, Warners also decided to cut a few scenes from the  original (1945) version of the film to keep its length manageable, and the  result is a plot that, even after repeated viewings, is almost  incomprehensible. Six people are killed in the course of the film, and one  before the action begins. A few of the murders are easily explained, but  others remain a mystery, either with regard to the murderer, the motive, or  both.  Though most people could probably guess who did what and why many  come out asking, "So did that blonde one kill the first guy&#8230; why  would she do that?&#8221;  It is impossible to understand everything based on  what is given in the film itself. I have heard that reading the book is  really the only way to completely grasp the whole of the plot. However, a  movie is never exactly a representation of the book from which it is taken.  All in all it is a movie to watch at home on rainy night. I have seen it  once yet one should see it many times to understand the entire plot. A  pretty long movie by most people's standards and boring in parts. I  wouldn't write home about it nor would I see it again. perhaps it is due to  the fact that the film is in black and white which does not hold the  viewers attention or simply because the viewer does not understand what the  film is about.
