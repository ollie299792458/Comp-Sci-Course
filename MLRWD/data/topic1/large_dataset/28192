Wow, I notice different things in this series than I did when I was a kid watching after school in the 80's. Ward and June really talk to their kids and are sympathetic parents. I also noticed that Ward and June have a fun relationship, teasing each other and such. June is also a hands on mom and isn't afraid to pitch in and do work when the boys need help. Also, many of the episodes encourage entrepreneurial behavior or working for money.

My favorite, everyone makes fun of Beaver for selling water on one of the hottest day of the year, because water is free---until he learns the water will be turned off for several hours just when Wally and all of his friends are doing yardwork to earn money for baseball uniforms.
Aquafina anyone?

The relationship between the boys is sweet without being sappy as is the relationship between the boys and their parents. A few moments almost made me want to cry because they are moments of truth that I now recognize as an adult.

Brilliant! Honest real emotion portrayed in a sitcom is sadly rare in TV today as is the cleverness and simplicity of plot that makes this show great.

If we are ever blessed with children, this show will be in our home library.
