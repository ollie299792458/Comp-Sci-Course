As a fan of "Sex and The City" since the start, it has been interesting going back to this DVD of the first season of this HBO comedy series.  Having now wrapped its third season (and being catapulted from "cult" status to "it" show), this 2-disc set lets you experience these characters and appreciate how much they have developed over time. While this foursome might easily have fallen into mere stereotype, the writers and actresses have not made sure not to allow that to happen.  This is a smartly-written and perfectly-cast "situation" comedy.
I have not noticed any quality issues with this DVD set that others have spoken about in their reviews...but I will likewise admit to not being not enough of an expert being fairly new to DVDs.  The set also includes the wonderful "teaser" commercials for each episode.  The shows definitely hold-up on repeat viewings (an important aspect to me for any DVD/video purchase).
As the breeziest half-hour on television today (and the last couple of years), I recommend the "Sex and the City" set to any fans or the series or those who might not have HBO.  With the apparent success of this release, I look forward to future seasons on DVD as well.  Hopefully, this trend will continue and the traditional "network" television will release other series on DVD (though syndication rights might make that difficult).
