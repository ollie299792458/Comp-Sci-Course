If we sent this film to another solar system, and an intelligent species found it and watched (and heard) it, that civilization would have a very clear concept of what our planet and what modern human beings are all about without any exchange of spoken or written language. That is how simply and profoundly this film communicates its portrait of our world. I first saw it as a rental in the 80s; my Dad somehow thought it was a science fiction film. But as we watched it, we were absolutely mystified and awed. Yes, its message is obvious, but seeing this film one is confronted with the beauty of our world and the horrific excess of human civilization in a unique way. The Philip Glass score is wonderful and highly appropriate (I enjoyed his music in this setting far more than I ever did on its own), and the time-lapse sequences, particularly toward the end, are dizzying and bewildering. While one is struck by how dated many of the images of American society are - looking back on the early eighties - and one is aware that many environmental abuses have since been tamed somewhat, one also realizes that little has changed fundamentally in the past two decades, and that many things the film depicts merely hint at developments which are now seemingly insurmountable problems. A monumental film, and I look foward to the third part of the trilogy, "Naqoyqatsi," coming to theaters in October 2002.
