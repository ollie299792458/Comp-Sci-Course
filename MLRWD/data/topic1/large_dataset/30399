Better late than never, I guess.  When the show first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, I seemed to always catch it at bad time. I was on the way out, company showed up, the dog got out, etc.  Coupled wth the incessant commercial breaks on the afore-mentioned channel, it spelled disaster for my attention span.  I'd start to go along for the ride, but lose interest between commercial breaks that ran on and on.  Plus, as I recall there was a glut of Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargates, etc. at the time, and I was a bit cynical and burned out on sci-fi in general.  I didn't pay enough attention, and didn't give it a chance.  In short, I blew it!!!

Fortunately, I recently had an opportunity to sit down with disk one in this series and within five minutes of viewing the pilot episode, I was hooked.  It's sci-fi adventure at it's very best.  Mind-boggling, eye-candy special effects, wonderful and exotic characters, and something we don't get enough of in science fiction anymore-excellent acting and quirky, original story-writing!  This seres was produced in Australia by Australians, and it's obvous they enjoyed the creative freedom to cut loose.

I ultimately collected the entire series, and watch the episodes over and over.  Every time, without fail, they seem fresher and more original than anything on the tube right now.  I can't recommend the series enough.
