This movie is so refreshingly different I hardly know where to begin.
I applaud the decision not to have the horses talk. And Oh they didn't sing either! Thank goodness! There were no goofy sidekicks, no bawdy humor, no 'bad-guy-falls-to-his-death' and no mothers dying in the first third of the film. Our family was joking about what a certain big studio would have done with it if they were behind it.
The main antagonist is just that. He's not particularly bad, he just has his methods (I didn't like them and you probably won't either). I love the contest of wills between the two. Especially when you think Spirit has been broken -Right in the middle of the Colonel's speech you find out he isn't!
The blacksmith sequence is a scream and you find yourself cheering for Spirit.
Anyone who is around Spirit very much ends up respecting and accepting him as a horse who will not be broken.
The one part of the film that rather bothered me was a railroad camp part. I wondered if the filmmakers were anti-railroad or anti-progress. Our nation was literally built by the steam engine. In the director's commentary they explain they weren't trying to make a negative statement about railroads they were showing how it would appear from Spirit's perspective. Much as I like trains I would not want them laying rails in my backyard!
I love the cameos some of our national treasures (National parks)put in. This film is a feel good rendition of the old romantic image many of us have of the old west. It's like a beautiful animated painting that I will enjoy seeing again and again.
Definitely clean enough for the most discriminating parent to show his/her children.
