This is a fast paced movie from beginning to end. I think the only flaw was with the villains.  I didn't find them "believable." So, either they were bad actors or badly directed. In contrast, Kim Basinger, William H. Macy, and Chris Evans were superb in their roles.

This was my first experience seeing Chris Evans in anything; that is, anything memorable for me to remember the actor.  His athleticism, good looks, acting ability, and sense of humor were of five star caliber.

I felt that this was an excellent vehicle to show Kim Basinger's acting abilities beyond her roles in such popular movies as: "Batman," a James Bond thriller, and "9 and a 1/2 Weeks," etc. "Cellular" asked her to dig deep down inside herself, bringing out the true meaning of the word Actress. She was most believable.

William H. Macy once again proved there is no end to his talents. It was good to see him play a 'good guy,' unlike that which he played in "Fargo."  He was excellent in his role as a radio announcer in "Seabiscuit." This time he needed to be more athletic as a cop. He did well at that, and left me with a feeling of comfort knowing he was on the job.
