This DVD is for guitar players.  If you need inspiration...if you need to know what the guitar is capable of...this is the DVD for you.  If you like showmanship in a live performance...this is the DVD for you.

If you are a pop music fan that does not consider a piece of music to be real music if there is no lead singer...skip this DVD.  If you believe there is never any reason to become a vituoso guitar player...or if you think playing the same 3 cords over and over while repeating the same tired blues licks makes you a virtuoso...skip this DVD.  If you think a guitarist like Clapton standing in one spot for an entire show is the way to go...skip this DVD.

Vai is one-of-a-kind.  Most can't say that.  He moves, he grooves...and he still plays things that mortals cannot play.

I have an appreciation for showmanship in rock music.  You could make the case that's what rock music is all about.  Give me Hendrix burning his guitar, Elvis moving his pelvis, Pete Townsend smashing his guitar, KISS...doing all that stuff they do, Stevie Ray playing behind his back...and Steve Vai changing costumes and having a fan blow his hair. (Every band wears "costumes"...some just don't call it that.)  This is rock and roll...not church music.  You'd better be willing to put on a show.  I'll buy your CD and sit home if you offer me no reason to watch you play.  And don't just hire 20 dancers to run through the same dance routines I've seen a thousand times either.  Show me what you are really feeling out there.

I had no idea the camera work was so bad until I read these reviews.  What's the problem?  True, there are a couple of times I wanted to see what Steve was doing...but geez...it's over 2 hours...I get to see him plenty.

This is the one concert DVD I own that I will watch over and over.  Inspiration is cheap with this one.
