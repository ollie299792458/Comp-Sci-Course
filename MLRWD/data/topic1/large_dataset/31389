All the My Little Pony merchandise is heavily marketed to preschool aged children on Nick Jr. but these DVD's are far from appropriate for that age group. Why? Because the DVD's focus just a little too much on the evil aspect of 'good vs. evil'. My four year old, who is quite taken with the Pony toys, and is usually a pretty brave kid, was scared during nearly every segment that we watched. The themes are intense and weird, the imagery very scary and really, these stories are NOTHING like the cute little ponies you see in the commercials, where the emphasis is on doing their hair and going to the Pony salon etc.. If you think I'm exaggerating, check one out from the library first and then decide if you want to spend your good money on this garbage. I really think the manufacturer has a lot of nerve marketing these toys to the small children who watch Nick Jr. when there is NO WAY they could possibly enjoy these overly-scary, and frankly very bizarre DVD's.  My advice is don't waste your money. Stick to Dora, Blues Clues, Stanley and Ready, Set, Learn! for your preschooler.
