Nina's film is funny and treats the whole thing with a much needed lightness of touch - I just watched "Les Demoiselles de Rochefort" (also available at Amazon) - one of Jacques Demi's trio of bizarre, but highly enjoyable musicals, which has a similar lightness of touch but has a basically banal storyline (as does "Umbrellas of Cherbourg") centred on relationships.

One of the things lost in a lot of Ramayana adaptations (deliberately in order to underline the characters divinity) is this lightness - these are people we can barely identify with and the scale is always "EPIC" - but while Demi manages to turn the banal into something epic, Nina has turned the epic into something banal,& what they have in common is accessibility.

The other common factor is the independant spirit - Demi's films never spawned a culture of musical films in France and are considered unique in French cinema - I wouldn't even class him with the other New Wave film makers of his generation.

In the same way, Nina's film is a stand-out effort which cleverly captures the essence of a timeless story in a very contemporary, up to date, digital animation form, while retaining the economy of the folk art traditions which partially inspire it.
