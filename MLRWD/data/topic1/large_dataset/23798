The overall movie is fairly interesting, however, I would not qualify this DVD as 3D reference material.  for the first 5 minutes of this movie I remember asking myself "is this 2D presentation or the 3D presentation"? In other words, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the 3D effects the minute you put this DVD into your player. There were Also numerous instances of scenes which exhibited crosstalk/double imaging. In my opinion, there were far more instances of cross talk in this movie versus other IMAX 3D features than Deep Sea, Under The Sea, Galapagos, and Mummies (Secrets of the Pharaohs).  While Tom Cruise is firmly entrenched in the number 1 position on my "Celebrities Whose Behavior Indicates They Have Clearly Lost Their Minds" list, I have to admit he does a good job as the narrator.

I have to be honest, I'm not in a big hurry to watch this DVD again.  I also believe the $38 price tag hurts this movie.  If you are going to charge $38 for a 47 minute DVD then the 3D effects and the feature itself better blow my freakin' socks off.  Overall this dvd represents an "ok" demonstration of the potential of 3D movies, but if you want an impressive 3D IMAX feature go pick up Deep SeA or Under The Sea.
