While this may not be the Citizen Kane of the thriller/horror/suspense genre, it was a highly effective, suspenseful film. I've seen some reviews on here that tear this movie to shreds, but I don't see any reason for that. Do the characters always make smart choices? No. I would say they do some pretty dumb things.

SPOILER ALERT!
For example, why does the woman stay in the house knowing there is somebody in there with her??)
SPOILER OVER!!

But let's be honest, even real people don't make smart choices. And quite often, it is the dumb choices that people make that give many horror movies their suspense. And given the circumstances that are occurring, I think most people could be forgiven for making some irrational decisions.

Did it have a great ending? No, it wasn't "Halloween" or "Planet of the Apes"-great, but it was harmless. But I don't feel the ending completely sucked, either, like some other films (Cloverfield comes to mind.)

Was it slow? Yes, it was a little. But that is what builds SUSPENSE, people. Try watching The Exorcist again sometime and you'll realize (if you haven't already) that NOTHING remotely interesting or scary happens for the first hour and 15 minutes. But because you know what is coming, you force yourself to endure it. Which builds the suspense. And this movie isn't nearly as slow as The Exorcist (not comparing quality here, just pacing.)

What I loved about the movie was its realistic feel. It felt like actual people who are going through relatable issues in their life who are forced to deal with an out of the ordinary, but not entirely implausible situation. The fact that they make unwise decisions is REAL because in real life, nobody is prepared to deal with a situation like this (no matter how many horror movies you watch.)

This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.  A solid, B-movie thriller. Why hate on that?
