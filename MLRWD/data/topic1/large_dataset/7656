World War II produced a long array of military stars, i.e. MacArthur, Eisenhower, Bradley, Clark, Nimitz, Montgomery, Rommel, etc. But for sheer animal magnetism and bravado, none could overshadow Gen. George  Patton.
What endeared Gen. Patton to his troops was his willingless to  expose himself to the line of enemy fire, unlike other "office  generals". That he pushed his troops almost beyond the limit of human  endurance is without question. But that could be excused by his belief that  aggressiveness in the battlefield saves more human lives in the long run  and hastens the end of the war.
George Scott's portrayal of Gen. Patton  was of monumental proportion, it was an actor in his element. From the  general's gentle side and diplomatic tact when he was in his best behavior  to his thunderous, manic explosion when he was at the height of his fury,  Scott got it all! No one could have done a better job portraying the  unpredictable, egoistical, brilliant general.
The realistic recreation of  battle scenes and the accurate depiction of war characters, like Gen. Omar  Bradley and others, make this film a must for historians and history buffs  alike, and put this film in the list of best war movies ever made.
The  only irony of it all is, Gen. George Patton, a true warrior in the  tradition of the samurai, had to die in a "non-warrior" way  - -  - a paralyzed and pitiful figure in a hospital after a car accident when  the war was practically over.
