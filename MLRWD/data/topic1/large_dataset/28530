I gave Blonde Ice only 3 stars, primarily due to the fact that the picture quality of the DVD was very disappointing - especially after reading that this DVD release had been restored. Perhaps some scratches and lines were removed, but the picture is not very sharp. My guess is that the source material was taken from a 16mm dupe.
The film moves quickly as our leading lady, Leslie Brooks, manages to kill off three men within a few days. Robert Paige plays her boy friend who is straight man to her unbelievable and outrageous manipulations. Her blackmailer has to be even dumber than her boy friend. He knows she murdered her husband, but he still arranges to meet her in a very isolated place, on a dark and foggy night. Goodbye Charlie! And so it goes...With no real evidence to accuse her of any of the murders, her confession is total nonsense, but it leads to the last line and the best line in the film. I chuckled out loud! I don't want to spoil the ending, so you will have to check it out for yourself.
