Believe me when I tell you, this film is WAY too long. The filmmaker follows this singer around with his camera. It's got "student film" written all over it. If Becker had whittled this down to 20 minutes, it would go down much, much better. But as it is, it loses inspiration and gets dull for long stretches. As far as the music and singing? Not all that good. This would have been a much better film if the director had chosen a more interesting troubadour; instead you have to put up with a dry, dull old man. Not compelling at all. He should have looked harder for someone to profile. Surely they're out there.

Note the sudden number of "glowing" reviews for this pathetic film that appear above mine: they're all 5 stars and written by people whose review history - COINCIDENTALLY! - are all of 1 review. Hahahaha!! I guess Becker's "people" saw a REAL review of the film and quickly created accounts to fool everyone. I'm not some flack - I speak the truth. Buy this, and you'll be among those fools who's been duped out of his / her cash. Rent it, if you must.
