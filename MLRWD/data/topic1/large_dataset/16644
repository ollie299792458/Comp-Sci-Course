I'll probably always like the 1st HP movie best because of the innocence of the characters & sense of new wonder.  But I still enjoy all the others & the Amazon Marketplace price was good for this Ultimate Edition 2 ($19.48 incl shpg).  They are all so rich in details.  I always notice something new every time I watch them.  Price of the Ultimate Editions 1 & 2 dropped dramatically once 3 & 4 were about to be released (Reg $39.98).  I wouldn't pay more than $20 each for these Ultimate Ed sets but the case & other extras, like the Photo Book, are BEAUTIFUL, so long as you have the shelf space knowing there will be 6 more after these 1st two.  Discs 1 & 2 (of 4) are rather redundant, Theatrical version & the Extended version.  Disc 3 has interesting set details but sort of annoying having to click-click-click everywhere (interactive exploring).  I myself DO enjoy all the bonus featurettes "Creating the World of Harry Potter", this has Part 2: The Characters.  I like the interviews & behind scenes productions that are put together in a way that's more than just an after thought to sell as a Bonus disc.  But if you the type satisfied w/ the single Blockbuster-type DVD, there are plenty around for $5-10.  Oh, one tip about Harry Potter movies.  If you haven't read the books (like me) & find parts of the films that don't quite make sense, Google some H.P. blogs.  There's usually an explanation.
