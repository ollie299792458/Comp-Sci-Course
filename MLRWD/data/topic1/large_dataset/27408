This is a powerful, disturbing movie.One of its opening scenes show the idyllic life the main character Sol Nazerman, the Pawnbroker, lived before the Nazis murdered his family. There is a beautiful scene in slow-motion of children romping happily on a lawn, of great domestic happiness.

 The shattered life of the survivor Nazerman begins to fall apart on the twenty- fifth anniversary of his wife's death. Rod Steiger plays the Pawnbroker and his performance is a most brilliant one. We see a character so disturbed so angry so locked in himself so unable to communicate with others or accept their affection. Steiger is absolutely convincing .

What I found a bit difficult was that the reactions he has to his suffering correspond with Anti- Semitic sentiments. So one old Anti- Semitic hate- teaching about Jews is that they will give up everything for money. Nazerman trusts in the film , only money , and as Pawnbroker is cruel to others. I too did not like the implication ( if generalized) about his replying to the horrible evil done to him by being unkind to others. That is, I am not bothered if it remains on the level of one character and one story. I am bothered how people might generalize from this.

This film is relentless and in a way merciless. But it is an exceptionally gripping and good one.
