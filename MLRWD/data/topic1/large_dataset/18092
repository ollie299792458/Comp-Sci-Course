I picked this up to watch and then read some of the reviews on Amazon about it.  Thank goodness I ignored what most of the naysayers had to write about this one.  I found it highly entertaining, fast paced, and in its own weird way, a sweet story.  The people that say the daughter is a brat, I don't know where they got that from.  She is a naive, slightly goofy 17 year old who at the last minute realizes she got herself in some deep trouble.  She treats her dad (Liam) with respect, and yes, her dad is protective and a bit behind the times, but he is exactly what a dad should be.

  And about the violence and body count.  Yep, Liam kills some people.  But each of his 'victims' was tied into the sex slavery business and knew exactly what was going on.  Plus, most were trying to kill him too.  The bad guys didn't mind killing innocent ones, so  they shouldn't have been surprised when their time came.

  Some complained about the pipe scene and the shooting of a wife (I don't wanna give too much info away), but if you actually watch the movie, listen to the dialogue, those scenes made sense and worked fine.  Sure, if you missed a few lines of dialogue about why the woman got a flesh wound, then it would seem a bit harsh.
  I watched this with my teenager, yeah, it was chancy I guess, but she enjoyed it and wants to see more adventure movies.  It had a few bits of dialogue she didn't need to hear, but was otherwise pretty clean, except some blood here and there.  This did not bore us like Mall Cop and Bedtime Stories.  Those 2 movies were L-A-M-E.  This one was Cool LIAM all the way.
