To say Schindlers List is a cinematic achievement still degrades this film. Spielberg put all of his heart behind this and it really shows. From the acting, to the directing, to the scarring images of the concentration camps, this is without a doubt a landmark achievement. The ending is just about the saddest ending ever. You will let a tear out of your eye, even if you are a hard hearted old man. Oskar Shindler (Liam Neeson) is a very rich man, stuck in the middle of the holocaust, as a Nazi. He took every cent he had to make sure that over 1,000 "Jews" would not die at the hand of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi. He literally went bankrupt just to save the lives of these people, who did nothing wrong, but because of their relegion were massacered in the thousands because that ignorant S.O.B Hitler wanted to rule the world. To see this and not weep should be a sin. I hope that everyone else feels the same way. I absolutely cannot wait for this DVD to be released, (hopefully it will have a ton of extra features).
