The Godfather Part II has the rare distinction of being arguably the best sequel ever made, and one of the very few that is every bit on par with its corresponding original film in the franchise. The two films compliment each other by having a little something the other does not. For classic scenes and an inspired storyline, something that comes to someone in a dream perhaps once in a lifetime, the original rightly excels as an iconic masterpiece; for a dark political web of intrigue, a distinct, duplicitous villain and acting from Al Pacino that positively drips with subtext, Godfather II sticks in the craw in the best possible way.

The young Al Pacino was often exemplary, and his performance here should be required viewing in acting school. Pacino's take on Michael's  muted mental and emotional turmoil and the subtle power of his projection of this on to the screen is a special magic rarely achieved by others. One can't help but suspect that the presence of Pacino's mentor, Lee Strasberg - of The Actor's Studio - had somehow fueled his prot&eacute;g&eacute; to greater heights than he had thus far reached. Indeed, the final confrontation between Michael and a lecturing Hyman Roth illustrates this beautifully, and is perhaps one of the greatest examples of an actor really performing while saying nothing.

Great performances abound: Robert De Niro is of course perfectly cast as a young Don Vito, and the supporting roles are all so well played that it's difficult to find one that shines above another. Character acting abounds in a locomotive of a plot that gorgeously showcases some of the darker side of human nature, as Godfather II might, just might, be a smidge more noir than the original.
