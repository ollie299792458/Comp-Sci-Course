I am a huge Argento fan and I cant figure out why.

The man has some pretty good ideas in his films but usually poor acting,dubbing & budget sink them right from the start.

I think his work is fit to be remade by someone who understands & sees Argentos brilliance as clearly as a fan.

I think Argento should be allowed complete creative controll & final cut of any remake someone may do.

The Card Player is supposed to be a sequal to The Stendhal Syndrome however I dont see how.

Other than the charactor of Anna played by two different actors no reference is made to the previous film.

The Card Player is about a killer who plays high stakes poker with the police online.

Unlike previous Argento films most of the violence is done off camera aiming more for suspense.

Good news is Argento is less than a decade behind current film makers within this genre.

Also the dubbing is minimal and not too noticeable & the acting is pretty solid.

Bad news is that its all been done b4 and to greater effect.

In the end Card Player may only be suitable for a fan of Argentos work but dont be deceived by the countless negative reviews floating around the net.

This movie is hardly the train wreck some want you to beleive.

I was mildly surprised by the turn this legendary director has taken with this new entry.
