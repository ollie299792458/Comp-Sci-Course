I DVR'd this concert (in hi-def and 5.1) off of INHD and have watched many times.  The concerts they have shown have been identical to the DVD's of the same name so I'm assuming the same will hold true on this release.  (DVD has a few MORE songs than concert shown on cable- see below)  This show is about two hours long with the combined bands starting together for a few songs, then EWF, then Chicago, and then combined again for the last three or so.  I bought concert tickets for later this summer after seeing this.  The sound quality is superb which now I understand as it was produced by Image who did the first Eagles and Steely Dan DVD's, and always have superior production.  The DVD also has a DTS track.  As far as the performance, I think 1+1 >2.  I have the Chicago Soundstage DVD and the EWF Live by Request and this is better than both.  Chicago particularly benefits as their energy level is much higher here than on the solo disc.  EWF's influence adds more hipness, funk, and energy to Chicago's more ballady style.  I really disliked the Peter Cetera fill in (bass player) on the Chicago solo disc as he used vibrato that was irritating, but he doesn't do it here and sounds much better.  The Maurice White fill-in has also changed for EWF and I think the new guy does a better job too than on the Live By Request disc.  Overall, a real fun show to watch and all the horns will sound great on a good sound system.
