Traitor is a well-done film about terrorism and international espionage. Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce star. Pearce plays an FBI agent while Cheadle apparently plays a member of a Middle Eastern terrorist sect. On the other hand, he also gives hints of being a spy for US Intelligence operating way under cover. This dichotomy is one of the strong points of the film. Cheadle joins in efforts to bomb the US Embassy in Nice, France and follows that by being a member of the operatives planning to bomb 50 buses on Thanksgiving Day in the US.

Cheadle's character is Samir Horn. Born in the Sudan, he sees his father killed by a car bomb. He goes on to be educated in the US, joins the US military, serves in Afghanistan, and then appears to join the side of the terrorists. He is a devout Muslim, and Cheadle does an extremely good job of depicting Horn as being torn between doing what he must to work his way to the leaders of the terrorist movement while at the same time following his true belief in the teachings of the Koran.

The film has excellent action scenes, and both Cheadle and Pearce do fine jobs in their performances. The characters move to various areas of the world, so the film has a good look to it. The Special Features included with the DVD don't amount to much. One short deals with the stunts and special effects while the second feature shows the film's exotic locations. I did not listen to the audio commentaries by Don Cheadle and Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff.
