This, quite simply, is the greatest zombie movie ever made, and my personal favourite ever since I first saw it when I was 10, and it was still banned in the UK, so I was very happy to see this released on blu-ray.
Zombie has been immortalised thanks to the fantasic transfer, it really does look this good, crisp, clear, colourful, I could go on.
Forget all these new over-hyped zombie rip-offs, there are a lot of loyal fans who will prefer the modern genre and won't appreciate the work that went into Zombie, but this movie is head and shoulders above them, they just don't make them like this anymore, Fulci is a genius.
Superb soundtrack, interesting characters, cracking gore scenes and a good plot that keeps you hooked throughout, and wait until you see 'those' zombies, very convincing complete with worms crawling out of eye sockets, we have a splinter through the eye, a zombie attacking a real shark and the legendary resurrection sequence near the end, and so much more.
Zombie is still making fans the world over after 30 years, so that tells you a lot about Fulci's masterpiece, so if you've never seen it, go and get this blu-ray version and see it for yourself. A gorehound classic that rightfully earns it's place in the horror hall of fame. 10/10.........
