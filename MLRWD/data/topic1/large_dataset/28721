I saw the DVD in the store, so I picked it up. Big mistake. I had never heard of it before. I wish that were still the case. It's one of those classic cases where Halloween time sparks the release of horrible (not horror) movies.

There are two things that stand out to me:

1) It's totally implausible and

2) Does she ever stop crying and whining ?

The things that happen in this movie, and there is not a lot happening, just don't make sense. They get to the rest stop and the guy disappears, we don't know why. Though if I knew how emotional that actress would become, I would have left too. The cop / park ranger guy is an insult to the police force. Even to the guys from Police Academy. Oh yeah, and after she blows his brains out, um, twice, he just simply disappears. "Oh you missed, shot me again !" Yea.

Moments like this are happening throughout the film. She is sitting in this nasty bathroom, contemplating on what to do, while she could quite easily be skipping down the highway. Better hitch a ride with the demented creep family, with two weird Jewish boys and a deformed Mini-Me. Huh ? Excactly. Oh wait, the boyfriend is back, and still alive, but without a tongue. That will definitely hurt their relationship.

I wish somebody would have cut out HER tongue. Because all she is doing for 90% of the film, is crying. I assume the actress was following the directors pointers to look frightened and distressed. But somebody should have told her that whining, whimpering and crying for 90 minutes of screen-time is rather annoying. Even if somebody bites off your finger.

Writing anything more would give this film too much attention. Like most of the others have written before me: Stay away. Trust me, you would rather have dinner in that Rest Stop bathroom, than to waste your prescious life on this ridiculous pile of stupidity.

Amen.
