I was a bit apprehensive to view this film.  I'm gay and Italian and I was quite worried that an attempt to portray a combo of both in merely 85 minutes would result in a glut of over-done cliches and caricature-like stereotypes.  I also think that movies that focus upon the traditions and idiosyncracies of various sub-cultures often pigeonhole their respective population into a long list of unfair expectations and prejudices.
Fortunately, Mambo Italiano pulled off the impossible.  It poked fun of tradition while allowing the viewer to realize that tradition and culture can be tortuously binding and limiting.  Where this little film also succeeded was in its juxtaposition of the old and the new.  The young progenitors of culture are usually the ones who break new ground, who shed the excess and limiting traditions for new, more progressive ones.  But, at the same time, as traditions become entrenched in our adolescent minds, they often become so set in adulthood that they have fossilized into our subconscious.  We do things without realizing that we are doing them.  Mambo Italiano presents this fight.  Some of the characters move on.  They live in harmony with their own culture but not limited by it.  Others succumb to the claws of their predecessors, out of weakness, fear and even comfort.  These results are inevitable in any true subculture.  We persist.  We succumb.  We endure.
I recommend this film to anyone, especially those of ethnic backgrounds.  It's never heavy-handed.  It's sometimes too outrageous.  You'll smile.  You laugh.  You'll be frustrated.  But, most importantly, you'll be entirely satisfied by this quaint and almost poignant Italian feast.
