This Film is, to put it quite simply...Magic! It offers a winning combination of drama and comedy, a certain realism that is only acquired through good dialogue and silence. Excellent characters, fantastic acting and wonderful settings.

It tells a story of 3 individuals bonding for no other reason than necessity of human spirit, one (Finn)is on an introspective search dealing with a change  in his life and the loss of a friend, (Olivia) is also dealing with loss and change and is trying to escape her reality and (Joe)happens to be at the right place at the right time and really has nothing better to do than make friends and bring the 3 together...the film shows the inner sensitivity we all have as well as the need to escape from what hurts us, combined with that is the innocence that we are all capable of tapping into when we realize life is what it is...you'll watch it again and again on rainy days or nights you're not quite sure what you're in the mood for...it's a keeper! One that makes you think and makes you laugh but most of all makes you look honestly at

yourself!
