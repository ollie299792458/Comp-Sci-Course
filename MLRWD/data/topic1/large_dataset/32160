Dinner For Schmucks is a remake of the French film, The Dinner Game. It stars Steve Carell as Barry Speck, and Paul Rudd as the main character, Tim Conrad. In the movie, Tim has to get a promotion at his job so he can impress his girlfriend, Julie. His superiors decide to have the promotion hinge on how well he plays their "dinner for schmucks" game, which involves bringing weird people to dinner to make fun of them. If Tim can find the weirdest person he wins the promotion. After he and Julie decide that it's best not to attend the dinner, Destiny sends Barry into the street where Tim is heading home. He gets hit and the drama begins.

Steve Carell dishes out one of his greatest performances I've ever seen. His character is always getting into trouble, but maintains lovability throughout the film. Paul Rudd does a perfect job realistically keeping his character's cool where I'd have already lost it and gone insane. The more recent films Paul Rudd has been in usually have a message, which this movie does as well (that was a bad way to say that). Keep an eye open for Zach Galifianakis's performance as an IRS worker who's hobby is mind control. Watch out for the eccentric artist that Jemaine Clement plays. That's a warning not a recommendation.

This movie has a great plot and cast, but doesn't live up to the original story or use most of the cast as they usually are in other movies. Don't get me wrong this movie is hilarious, touching, and has a great message. Dinner for Schmucks is nothing more than a really great comedy. Definitely see it.
