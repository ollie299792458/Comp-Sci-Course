This is one of Newman's best.  "The Verdict" and "The Hustler" are a couple of his other movies that I would rate as being in the same class.  But then I like the great majority of his movies.  He's  really a national treasure.
To me the movie is about the old school  morality of the father, Melvyn Douglas, who believes in human decency,  responsibility towards others and the community, love of the land, etc.  versus Paul Newman (the son) who only believes in looking out for #1 (a  truly modern American).  Douglas tells Newman to the effect that, "You  don't give a damn. You only care about your own appetites and that makes  you unfit to live with."  Very good writing by McMurtry.  Excellent  cinemaphotography by Wong.
I thought Patricia Neal was quite good and  very sexy.  When I first saw it I thought she was a bit  "middle-aged."  Time does change your perspective.  I thought  Bryan de Wilde gave a very good performance as a slightly spoiled,  sensitive ranch kid.  In the end Newman comes up with the prize, but like  so many "victories" in our world, you're left questioning as to  what he has really won.
A masterful piece of movie art.
