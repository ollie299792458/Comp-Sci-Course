As I read these bad reviews of this movie, I realize how lazy some film-watchers are these days.  Living in a generation that grew up watching movies, I would think that by now people would want to see movies that challenge them a little, and not simply spoon-feed them their entertainment.  I understand that people go to the movies for the simple reason of being entertained, but how long can the same old movie formulas entertain you?
It's refreshing to me to see directors like P.T. Anderson make movies because they feel passionate about the story they want to tell, not because they want it to fit into a neat, rehashed package to sell to a braindead audience.  There are beautiful images and ideas in this movie that take you on an emotional ride for 90 minutes.  The fact that Mr. Anderson makes a movie like this with his heart, knowing it won't make as much money as your average Adam Sandler movie, is reason enough to give it a try. But above all, Punch Drunk Love is an original movie, which is something we don't see enough of these days.
