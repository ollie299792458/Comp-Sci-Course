Ok, here's an interesting one, mask of Zorro, hmmm, well, I dunno it only has Antonio Banderas and Katherine Zeta Jones AND Anthony Hopkins. Its only made under the all seeing eye of Steven Spielburg and directed by the guy who bought us the best bond in recent years, Goldeneye&#8230; I dunno&#8230;.
Are you kidding, this film is class!
The Cast is sizzling, the story is exciting and engaging and the action sequences are just cool! The plot tells of an ageing Zorro (Hopkins) who passes his skills and &#8216;foxy&#8217; moves onto a man he feels can except the responsibility (Banderas). Robbed of his beloved daughter by his nemesis Hopkins sets out to find vengeance in true Zorro style. The stunts are truly brilliant, one scene where &#8216;new Zorro&#8217; jumps over horses is rip-roaring.
The entire movie has a Speilburg feel, you know when you can just feel that extra touch of class, almost as if its just right. The music helps but is nothing spectacular, what is spectacular is Katherine and Antonio together. They have a great chemistry which is born from a combination of their ... appeal and their charisma. True Hollywood combination which must be revisited soon.
Unlike Entrapment (with no offence to the masterful Sir. Connery) Zorro doesn&#8217;t ever think about just relying on Zeta&#8217;s &#8216;charm&#8217; Instead it focuses on a grand romantic tale stretching across generations and nations. Its all told in an epic battle of good against evil.
The DVD is slick, the sound can be revved up to the level which this high octane movie deserves. Crisp picture and ample menues make this DVD worth the purchase.
