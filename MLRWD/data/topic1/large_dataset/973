Just got my Honey West DVD set in and I have to admit this DVD set rocks. Brings back great memories of the mid sixties and Anne Francis is smoking hot. Sure the dialog is dated, the action can't match today's standards with all it's special effects, the episodes are just 30 minutes long and the episodes were filmed in black and white, but all those drawbacks is what gives this series it's whit and charm. There is something special about the way detective dramas were written in the 1960's. Quite a bit of the dialog reminds me of James Bond's "Dr. No" and "From Russia with Love"-simple, straight forward and to the point. (just the way I like it). Then there is the 30 minute episode length (well more like 20 something, but you get the point). Having this short time frame, allows the viewer to sit down and watch an entire episode in sort of fast motion. The plot is set, a few twists are thrown in and Honey solves the case. It's simple, it's clean and it works all the time. Finally, there is the black and white filming. Some folks out there can't stand black and white and deemed it outdated and not worth watching. I say hogwash; this medium has stood the test of time and in my book adds a touch of class and visual beauty to this series. I could go on and one and talk about how cool it is to see those great automobiles from the 1960's speed across your TV set or those classic commercials from Wesson Oil or Mabelline. Oh, and did I mention Anne Francis is smoking hot? Anyhow, as you can tell I REALLY like this set and highly recommend you buy it. The transfer from film to digital is outstanding in quality and makes this even a better visual experience than when it first came out 45 years ago. Honey West set the stage for future television detective hits like Moonlighting and Remington Steel, quite an accomplishment for a series that lasted only 2 years.
