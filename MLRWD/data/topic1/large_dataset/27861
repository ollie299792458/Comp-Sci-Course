"Blow" is Ted Demme's epic about George Jung's (Johnny Depp) rise from a fourth rate marijuana dealer in California to become the primary distributor of cocaine in the United States.  While Ted Demme clearly slants the story to portray Jung in a very sympathetic light, the film is nonetheless smart and entertaining.  While Jung's story is interesting enough to keep the average viewer glued to the screen, it is the casting and well-crafted performances that made this one of the best movies of 2001.  While Depp is sensational in his portrayal of Jung, his supporting cast really carries the film.  Ray Liotta is solid in his portrayal of Jung's hardworking Massachusetts father and Cliff Curtis is convincing in his brief appearance as legendary Colombian Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar, but the surprise of the film is Paul Reubens' brilliant portrayal of Derek Foreal, a gay, flamboyant California hairdresser that gives Jung his start and eventually becomes his secret "California Connection."  Unfortunately, the path toward greatness is halted halfway through the feature with the introduction of Penelope Cruz as Mirtha, a young Colombian girl whose wild ways seemingly go hand in hand with Jung's lifestyle.  When first introduced, Cruz seems perfect for the role, but as the film progresses and Mirtha slides deeper into cocaine addiction, Cruz's performance becomes unrealistic and ridiculously obnoxious at times.  Fortunately, the other actors and the intriguing plot are enough to push the film through this rough spot and despite Cruz's on-screen debacle, "Blow" leaves the viewer entertained and satisfied.

As a side note, Demme, who became an outspoken proponent of drug legalization and Jung's freedom after the movie's release, later died after overdosing.
