The Tintin graphic novels follow an unlikely protagonist: a mile mannered, sharp-witted young reporter.  There are about two dozen of them, artfully drawn, with a recurring cast of colorful characters woven through various tales. The books have been translated in 50 languages.  200 million copies have been sold around the world, but, oddly, not many of these are in America.  That makes Tintin something of a rare gem here, and he's part of my family culture.  I worried that Speilberg would spoil the magic, ruin the brand.  Somehow, he didn't. At all.  The film is brilliant.

Not only did it capture the tone, pace, and geographic sweep of the novels, it also caught so many details -- facial features of minor characters, body posture, personalities, villains, props, gags, cameo appearances, gestures, curses.  It is all there.  The motion capture style made it almost lifelike, but clearly not.  Just like the novels.

It's as if the books had come alive. Another clever adventure with colorful characters in foreign lands half a century ago.  Nice to see so many old friends, looking good after all these years.
