I agree with others that this is an excellent movie--Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, are wonderful, etc.  I saw it first in a movie theatre when it first came out, and found it's tragedy very painful to watch, yet compelling due to the quality of the film (and actors).  In later years I have tried to watch the movie several times on VHS or TV, and tried to read the book as well.  I can watch and read hour after hour of true crime, but this story, either in book or movie form, is perhaps the most depressing piece of work I've ever encountered.  
First of all, the tragedy of the holocaust is unspeakable except for the fact that it must be spoken about.  That element of the film, displayed through Sophie's horrific experience unfolds slowly through painful flashbacks throughout.  Second, the tragic personal choice she is forced to make--which of her children will be killed--speaks for itself.  Thirdly, the tragedy of her lover's mental illness, so poingnant as we watch others with the same or similar illnesses today--homeless, untreated, misunderstood...so many perishing alone in our cold and drug-laden cities.  Superior intelligence, it seems, fuels the tragedy by giving the false impression that the victim has the ability to have more control over the disease than he/she actually does.  And finally, the ultimate depressing element of the film was the hope that both Sophie and her lover tried to cling to; displayed in bursts of reverie, joy, and engagement in life...like the final emergence of a hand grasping a slippery float, before it sinks.
Perhaps others can tolerate this movie better than I, but it struck a haunting chord that has never left since I first viewed the movie.
