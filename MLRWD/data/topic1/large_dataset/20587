I won't lie, on my list the Lord of the Dance is on top and it is not going to move... Riverdance is awesome,  I just like the dance acts and Riverdance has a lot of other stuff going on. It's more of an international dance show than Irish. There's everything from American Tap to Russian and Spanish dance. And then there's a lot of singing and music without the dancers. Yeah, it's the story of Irish dancing, I just happen to enjoy the Irish dance scenes a lot. And the more the better :)

Also, I saw the Riverdance with Michael Flatley first therefore nothing that comes after that can be as good :) It's just something in him that I don't see in any other lead dancers including Colin Dunne. He's a great dancer and the dvd deserves the 5 stars, no question. It just doesn't give me the goosebumps and the ear-to-ear smile I get when watching Michael Flatley dance. I do agree with the previous reviewer that Flatley lately has some ego issues going on, but I compare everything to the original Lord of the Dance and I haven't seen any Irish dancers enjoy being on stage as much as Michael Flatley in that one.
