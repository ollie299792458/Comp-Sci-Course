Can't I give more than 5 stars? Well...
I just tried to make 5 fimls list of my all time favorite (You know how difficult it is). Cleverly, I tried to choose 5 top movies which will stay in the list whatever happens instead of trying to choose solid five. After five filmes popped upt,  I shut the door quickly. Here is the five (No order).  
Ben-Hur
Chinese ghost story (I)
Jesus Christ Superstar
My life as a dog
The good, the bad and the ugly
The greatest Ben-hur has everything. Don't you agree? Epic, romance (not ugly though), history, God, chariots(!), battle at sea, revenge...but most importantly, everything was handled very well unlike the other so called epics. This is a real full range movie, greatest of all greatest. What can I say more? Well, here's my personal story though.
When I was a little boy, there was no VCR and my dad used to make me jealous by saying he and his girlfriend (turned out to be my mom, surely) watched it at a theater which had biggest screen in our country at that time.  I'd have to wait until 1982. Until then I had to be satisfied with a book of ben hur which was not that great. When I finally got a chance to watch this, I was a middle school student. Wow! I still remember the excitement when I saw a poster of Ben-Hur. The day, though, I was late due to some reason which I cannot remember. When I entered the theater, the scene of  underground prison scene was going on. Roman soldiers realize their prisoners (Judah's mom and sister) are SICK as I still remember so vividly.  I cannot believe it was 20 yrs ago...  This movie easily deserves the title of THE GREATEST. You would agree with me.
