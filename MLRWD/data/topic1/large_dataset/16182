Let me start off by saying that I don't have any of those "fancy" channels on my television - just the extended basic cable package which is just fine with me as I don't usually soak up hours up hours of tv at a time.  That being said, I do have Netflix which has opened many windows for me and allowed me to view shows that air on those "fancy" channels to which I do not subscribe.

One of these shows is Shameless.

Wow.  I was hooked from the first 30 seconds of the intro in the pilot episode where they're all standing outside by the huge bonfire and Frank is telling a snippet of information regarding his children, friends and neighbors.

Shameless is a one of a kind show - there is nothing else like it out there.  It's a raw, gritty and face paced `dramedy' based on a struggling Chicago family trying to make ends meet while the father, William H. Macy, is an out of control, narcissist alcoholic and the mother is missing in action.  The eldest sibling of the 6 children, played by Emmy Rossum, is the head of the household and does her best to keep things together, while the family goes buck wild in their day to day excursions.

This show is wonderfully cast and I think each and every one of those cast members does a phenomenal job portraying each of their characters.

I would highly reccommend Shameless to anyone looking for something different in their life.  Something with some pizazz, some spunk.  Just don't be surprised by the offensive and sometimes disturbing material you will see.
