AMC network's next original series, The Killing is based on the wildly successful Danish television series Forbrydelsen and tells the story of the murder of a young girl in Seattle and the subsequent police investigation. Season one will consist of thirteen one-hour episodes. The Killing ties together three distinct stories around a single murder including the detectives assigned to the case, the victim's grieving family, and the suspects. Set in Seattle, the story also explores local politics as it follows politicians connected to the case. As the series unfolds, it becomes clear that there are no accidents; everyone has a secret, and while the characters think they've moved on, their past isn't done with them. The first episode when the parents found out that their daughter died made me tear up, wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

I personally like the series so far, it's kind of different but familiar. While the first season is based on the murder of a young woman I'm watching to see how it will unfold and were they will take it, if there should be a second season. I don't watch AMC network alot but after watching this series, The Walking Dead, Made Men and Breaking Bad I'm slowly becoming a fan of the network and it's series.
