Two weeks ago I went into a large electronics store and they were giving away a free DVD with the first 2 episodes of 24 season 2 as a promotion for the boxed set being released. I had never watched the show, but it seemed really interesting to me. One night I threw in the free DVD and watched the 2 episodes. From that point on I was hooked.
A couple days later I was home from work sick and I asked my wife to pick up the entire season 2 box set. By the time I felt better and went back to work I had watched the whole thing. I now wonder if I could of watched it on TV having to wait a whole week between episodes.
All in all the entire season was excellent. My only complaint would be the story line with Jack Bauer's daughter, Kim Bauer. About half-way through the season I found her storyline to be so unbeleivable that I didn't really care what happened with her. However the other story lines were so good it didn't really matter. 
If you are a fan of the show, you don't need this review. If you have never seen the show and are thinking about purchasing it - do it! I highly doubt you will be disappointed.
