Tim Roth gives an excellant portayal as 1900, born on a passenger liner on the first day of the new century.  He grows up in the bowels of the ship until one day he wanders into the ships ballroom and sits down at the piano and plays like a maestro.
The film deals with the people he meets, fleetingly as they reach his destination and his struggle to come to terms with the realisation that there is a big new world at the end of the gangplank.
It has the feel of one of the sixties epics, but using the sound and cinematography of the 21st century to create a rich, deep feeling of being on board.  Sometimes the film seems to drag, but as we are brought up on a diet of films with explosions incredible special effects, and quick cut scenes it is refreshing to see a film that is both,interesting and uplifting.  And if you enjoy good music, especially piano you are in for a treat.  Not sure how popular this was in the States but I found it in the bargain DVD bin and haven't yet found anyone who has heard of it.  Watch it, rent it, buy it but sshhh, let's keep it to ourselves.
