A number of other reviewers object that there's not much new here and/or that they don't care for the style of the presentation, the history is insufficiently detailed, or that some of the footage isn't totally relevant to the narration.

All justifiable criticisms. However, the substantial content of this four-part series is absolutely on the mark.  Of course it doesn't go deeply into details: it's only a few hours long!

I'll say this much: crucially, the information is true and absorbing. If some of us know the  facts already, there are millions of kids who do not have a clue and need to be told. History Channel's "The Third Reich" will tell them the essentials of Hitler's Evil Empire in a gripping and memorable fashion.  Obviously there is more to tell.

I recommend "The Third Reich," particularly for high-school and freshman college use as an introduction to the subject. The presentation is dramatic (maybe even a little corny for us grownups, but it's still just a matter of taste), the color film (most of which is very well chosen) brings it all to life, and, most interestingly, the story is told almost entirely from the point of view of German citizens. You get a feeling of something sinister developing right before your eyes as an entire nation slowly and deliberately makes itself indescribably insane - and scarcely notices.

The fact that 300,000 German Jews applied for U.S. visas just before war and only one was granted by the State Department is, all by itself, a springboard for discussion. When the Nazis allowed some Jews to leave the country on the liner "St. Louis," neither the U.S. nor Canada would allow them to land.  The ship was turned away. The passengers wound up back in Europe, where most all died in the Holocaust.
