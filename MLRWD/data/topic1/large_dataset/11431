Film is a seperate medium and you should never attempt to directly copy the original written work. The book will always be better, because ones imagination personnalizes the experience. 
This film is top notch and Nicholson is flawless. Young Danny Lloyd is also superb. I read a review where they thought the kid was a downer. Since Danny is privy, from the opening, that evil exists in the hotel, then I would expect him to be terrified and depressed throughout the film. I think it would not have worked for Danny to be a little giddy, when his world is crumbling down. Take a look at Danny's expresion when Scatman is killed and he's hiding in the kitchen cupboard. Priceless! Kudos to Kubrick and Danny Lloyd for playing it correctly throughout.
Another complaint was the pacing, as many thought that the film dragged. I can only assume that you've grown up with the modern blockbuster, action film. You have not acquired the patience for a film to develop tension and suspense. Oh well, there'll always be plenty of "Pearl Harbor" type films to dull your mind with.
My favorite scene is still the one between Jack and Mr. Grady in the bathroom. The tension created is incredible and it's also the point where the audience sees the connection of Jack's character to the hotel.
It's a great film with a marvously tight script, superb direction, perfect pacing and terrific ending. My only minor complaint would be the awkward acting in some of the secondary scenes. Duvall could have been better and Scatman looked uncomfortable at times.
The new DVD remastered version is very good, with a great 5.1 surround mix. Turn it up!!
