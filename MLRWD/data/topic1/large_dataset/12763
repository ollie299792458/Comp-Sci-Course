This DVD, together with eating smarter, has helped me lose weight.  The DVD is laid out so it is easy to follow and learn and takes you from beginner moves, through intermediate and than onto the most challenging.

There are genera lessons at the beginning of the DVD outlining Pilates principles and also the history of Pilates.

Each of the sections has their own main instruction area.  In this Karen shows you each of the moves and how they are modified to make them easier.  Moves that appear in easier levels become less modified as you advance and additional moves are added.  Having the lessons like this was nice so when doing the routines the focus was on working out and not teaching -  reminders and cues in the routines were there but unobtrusive.  Very good cueing and pace.

Then there a selection of routines to choose from.  If you do the moves like she explains you definately feel the workout, even on the easier level.  I have been using this DVD for awhile and moving into thee second level and it is nice to have it all on one DVD.
