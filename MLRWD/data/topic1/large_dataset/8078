Admittedly, in my short thirty years, I've seen many terrible movies but this one stands above the rest. With precious little to do with the original franchise or plot, the story mainly details the mundane lives of a family living in and trying to help run the day to day upkeep of an apartment building. it might make a good plot for a rom-com or perhaps a typically forgettable hollywood kids movie. But no. Sadly, this plot is borrowed for a film that was supposed to take place in an entirely different country and seemingly, in total ignorance of any of the original premises which formed the story. In short: this film has almost nothing to do with any of the Grudge (or Ju On as it's originally known) films. This said, a better film to check out for those who enjoyed the first two films would be the original Japanese films Ju On and Ju On 2. You can easily locate both of them on YouTube under these exact search titles or, if you are the sort of person who (like my husband) demands nothing less than surround sound and letterbox featuring, you may be able to find both of these titles for relatively cheap on YesAsia.com (just search under the exact names given) a pretty good place that sells Asian media. In conclusion, for those who have already seen the aforementioned films, yet another film worth seeing that has recently been added to the Ju On franchise is
"Ju On: Girl in Black/Old Woman in White". It is a fascinating film which gives another look at Japanese culture as well as a satisfying addition to the series. Again, you can find these on YouTube as well as YesAsia.com (Taiwan sells them cheapest and often, region free. Though a region free DVD player is easy to get online these days.) Lastly, don't bother with this film unless you are hankering for some utter trash that leaves you in total despair about the future of the American film industry (joke, there).
