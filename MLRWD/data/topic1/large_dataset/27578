Back when I was in high school, wrestling was all the rage back then, the brutality, the immaturity and hot girls in very little and I loved it. But now wrestling is unexciting and sometimes dull but ECW was way different then imaginable. They had matches that were exciting and adrenaline rushing that left you on the edge of your seat.

This pay per view is considered a classic amongst hardcore wrestling fans, every match could have been a main event caliber match, even without champion Shane Douglas fighting. My highlight matches are Sabu/RVD vs 2 Japanese wrestlers, high risk and extreme, Sabu is one of my Idols in life (see him with Terry Funk on Born To Be Wired and see why) Another was Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome, back and forth action with great table spots. Bam Bam Bigelow vs Taz in a Falls count anywhere match with one of my favorite ends ever. And the Street fight with 3D versus Tommy Dreamer, Spike Dudley and the Sandman in basically a weapons galore, table filled and ladders that were not meant for that purpose. Basically for people who want to relive why they liked wrestling at the first place or for those who want a great wrestling brutality view like me. Doubt the WWE version of ECW will be anywhere as good as this back in the day.
