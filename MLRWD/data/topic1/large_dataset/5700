I'll try to keep this short. If you've read the other reviews, you know the premise of the show.  It has received  many accolades and some awards. But you know what, there are many really good shows out there now, and it can be hard to keep up with all of them. So if you are still undecided as to whether this show is worth an investment of your time and money, I hope this helps.

If are an avid fan of the Sopranos and The Shield, you will love Breaking Bad.

Do you remember how both of those shows would, at their very best, leave you staring at the screen, with your heart pounding, saying to yourself "Holy S---"?  Well, there are moments like that in Breaking Bad.  Like  the Sopranos, it effectively mixes dark comedy and violence.  Like The Shield, it has episodes and plotlines that are incredibly intense.  And like both of those shows, it features a protagonist leading a double life. The performance of Bryan Cranston, like those of James Gandolfini and Micheal Chiklis is one of the finest ever seen on televison.  Your move.
