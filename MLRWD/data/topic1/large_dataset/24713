Ok, I couldn't bring myself to rate this movie lower than 5 stars. I LOVE the movie, Bobby's music (and I'm 28 years old), Kevin's singing, acting, dancing, and directing. It was a very engaging, enjoyable, and moving movie, and it now ranks as one of my absolute favorite Kevin movies. Kevin is my favorite actor. I love the fantasy musical sequences!

I would rate the DVD lower than 5 stars though because...where are the "Exclusive Bonus Musical performances by Kevin Spacey?" I was so excited to see this special feature listed here since I couldn't go to any of the shows he did around the country (you should've come to New Orleans, Kevin! My grandmother met Bobby Darin in New Orleans, by the way). I'm extremely disappointed that there is no concert footage of Kevin singing live. All we can do is hope and beg that a DVD of one of his concerts is released or that a Spacey Director's Cut of Beyond the Sea is released with tons of extras including concert footage. Deleted scenes would have been nice, too! Putting all of this aside, you should buy this movie! It is excellent and something the entire family can enjoy! I also own the must have soundtrack of Kevin singing Bobby's best songs. Keep on singing, Kevin!!
