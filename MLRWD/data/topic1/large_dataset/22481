i loved this film since the day it arrived in limited screen release back in 1996. i had never read an Irvine Welsh novel and wasnt quite sure what to expect. The only sense of British humor (including the great emerald isles, scotland and wales)i had seen in film before trainspotting is probably a fish called wanda. of course these two films are worlds apart from one another and an entirely different brand of comedy. the parts you are supposed to laugh at have you in gutwrenching hysterics and the parts intended to be a little more gruesome you're practically having to turn your head from the tv screen.
the characters are beautifully illustrated and are very true to the characters presented in Welsh's novel. Renton (played by Ewan McGregor when he was still wet behind the ears) is the narrator and main character. he is surrounded by friends who share the same ambition as him, looking for their next shot of heroin. the things they find themselves doing are inconceiveable to the sober mind.the emphasis is the world that heroin creates and most certainly stops itself from glamorizing its use. the setting is a very dismal and gloomy Edinburgh, Scotland which is ideal for the storyline. 
the thing most intriguing about the film is how you find each of the characters to be likeable and endearing in their own unique way. the world of "junkie music" is woven ingeniously into the film which clearly makes the two soundtracks an ideal accompaniment to the film. all of the performances are memorable and it created a new genre of filmmaking to come out of Great Britain. Visceral, hard edged, truthful and gritty are the words that will lean heavy on you once you've seen this film. Supposedly, Welsh is in talks currently to make a film out of the novel Ecstacy and should be out sometime next year. more scenes of pharmaceutical use and sheer pandemonium. Cant wait!
