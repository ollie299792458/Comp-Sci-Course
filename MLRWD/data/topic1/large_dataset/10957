I think this is a product for those that are Dr. Who fans and you just can't get enough of anything to do with The Doctor.  There are complete episodes BUT NO complete story lines, so you kind of have to take that for what it's worth.  Some of the Hartnell episodes are sound only.  That's a little tough to go through, but still fun.  I do not regret getting this as I consider myself a pretty good fan.  I'm not overboard, but not a casual fan either.  I enjoyed seeing what some of the missing episodes were like and was able to distance myself from having closure on each story line.  There are three different versions of these lost, rare episodes available, and this is the best because it includes all of the episodes currently available.  There is a copy of each of the first two Drs. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVEG">Doctor Who - Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years 1963-1966</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVEQ">Doctor Who Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The Patrick Troughton Years 1966-1969</a> and this copy of both combined <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVF0">Doctor Who - Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years and the Patrick Troughton Years</a>.  This copy contains everything on both those first two and then a few extra episodes found after that.  So, I'd recommend this over the others if you are a fan.
