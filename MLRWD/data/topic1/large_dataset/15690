This is in my opinion, the best since the first. The previous entry was a big slap to the face. The second and third were ok, but the third failed when compared to the second. The newest brought back what the original started and in full force. The effects were top notch and that is always a plus. The acting was pretty decent as well.  For starters, the producers took time to put some very thought out death scenes in full effect. You can tell that this movie was not just slapped together to cash in on the franchise like The Final Destination was. When I heard the news of a 5th Final Destination was in the works, I had to roll my eyes and brush it under the rug. I decided to pick up the Blu Ray as a simple impulse purchase, and I am glad I did. I loved this film, it was intense from the very start. I am watching it again now for the 3rd time. Even if you are unsure of the franchise after the last few entries, give this one a watch, it is the best since the first and even ties the first in with this one. This is A+ entertainment, and a must see if you like the franchise. This one is actually a prequal to the original so I would say to watch this before the first film, then things will fall into place when watching the original.
