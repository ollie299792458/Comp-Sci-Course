The critical acclaim for this movie was unlike any given to a G-rated attraction in many, many years. Kenneth Turan described it as "the closest to perfection ever achieved in the making of a movie". Dozens of other reviewers believed that it was the first time a film had matched the charm and inspiration of the first Walt Disney movies (Snow White, Pinocchio, etc.)

This attention is wholeheartedly justified. This is a remarkable movie which should take its place with The Wizard of Oz and other family perennials. What is truly marvelous is that the filmmakers have enough confidence in their story that they believe it can stand alone without the "wacky sidekicks" and phony Broadway type musical numbers that plague today's children's films. This story concludes in a way so touching that it left tears in my eyes in a theater for the first time  in my adult life.

It was wonderful that it received a special effects Oscar, but it was a crime that one was not awarded to Chris Noonan. His direction resulted in the staging of scenes of such charm and visual poetry that they, in their own sentimental way, leave images as memorable as those from Ford, Hitchcock and Scorcese.

 This is the first movie that my wife and I saw together, and I really think it is that once in a generation movie that can create an atmosphere of love for anyone seeing it together.
