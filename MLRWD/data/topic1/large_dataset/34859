I, like so many others, have been a fan of The Waltons since the first airing of The Homecoming. I never dreamed at the time that I would one day be sharing my love of this show with my husband, who didn't own a tv in the seventies, and my children, who weren't born until the mid-eighties. It has often amused me that the biggest detractors of this show almost never have actually watched it. My mother, who never watched it once, has always said,"Ugh! The Waltons. A bunch of goody-two-shoes and that stupid John Boy and that ugly thing on his cheek." I was privately amused when my son, whose name is John (after a grandfather, not John Boy)actually was born with a small mole on his left cheek so his Gramma had to "shut up" about it!(unlike Richard Thomas, my son plans to have his removed when he is fully grown!)Anyway, many of the best life lessons my husband and I have tried to model and impart to our kids have been backed up by issues on the show! I can hardly wait for the Second Season.
