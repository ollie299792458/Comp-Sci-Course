Sonja: You were my one great love.
Boris: Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dead.
Sonja: What's it like?
Boris: You know the chicken at Tresky's Restaurant? It's worse.

There are those who think that Woody Allen is a genius.  The only people smarter than those people are the ones who KNOW he is a genius.
But seriously folks, this film, Love and Death, is Woody Allen's favorite movie of his, and I must side with him on the matter.  This film has everything that everyone could possibly love about Woody (the slapstick, the one-liners, the genius undertones) without any of the things that many people don't like about Woody (the heavy-handedness of something like "Interiors", say).  This is his funniest movie, but it is also rife with serious analyzations about Life, Love and Death.  Such things as "If Jesus was a carpenter, I wonder what he charged for bookshelves?"  You just can't get any deeper than that.
The history here is the funniest ever portrayed, and the fickle hand of love and fate is evident with every brilliant brushstroke of Allen's gentle, humorous mind on the canvas he paints with his words and visuals.  To see this film is to yearn to see it again.
Be good to yourself, and to all mankind.  Buy this movie.  Own it.  Watch it 2 to 4 times per year.  Then, when you meet Death in the afterlife, you can say, "Hey, I know you...!"
