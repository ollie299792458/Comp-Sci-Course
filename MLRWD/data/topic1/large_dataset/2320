Push has its detracters, but not here.  I'm waiting for the sequel myself -- getting Cassie's Mom out of Division. (I'm waiting for the prequel, even -- Nick and Kira running bush league cons at Coney Island!)  Dakota Fanning steals every scene she's in, and with the possible exception of Maggie Siff, may be the only full-time working actor on the DVD.  It's amazing to see a film with this subject matter that isn't bogged down in left-over Twilight Zone cant about the self-punishing nature of psi.  These kids (including the old woman on top the building and the ink-stained scholar on the yellow boat) revel in their abilities, and wish they were much, much better at them.  They need to be.  Division, which shares the same dream but a far different end, is better than they are.  Far from not suffering these witches to live, we can celebrate their lives entirely steeped in the ambience and philosophies of the Orient.  Hong Kong has never looked grittier or prettier, even counting that stupendous walking soliloquy in the rain from Ghost in the Shell.  I don't think I've watched an SF movie more, with the exception of Them! and Blade Runner, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Close Encounters, and Alien(s).  Push delivers.  I mean, who can think of Bleeders, for crying out loud?  Watchers, with all their foibles, feel absolutely right because their errors are based on the right quantum stuff.  Pushers are, I'll admit, a bit of Old Hat -- e.g., Isaac Asimov's Napoleanic tyrant, The Mule, from Second Foundation, could realign an assassin's loyalties with a glance and so takes honors as the archetypal Pusher.  Sniffers are... predictable, true, but... THIS banal?  Push has humor.  I like lots.
