The viewer gets little idea of what the lives of Sinatra, Martin, Davis, Lawford and Bishop (he is barely seen in the two-hour film, though admittedly he was a minor member)were actually like.  Yes, the movie is  about the "Rat Pack," but this aspect of these performers' lives  was only a small portion, while here the viewer is given the impression  that these shenanigans are basically all they did during the early 1960s.  (Frank, Dino and Sam all recorded extensively and Sinatra did found a  little company called Reprise Records in 1960, making several fine albums.)  The Kennedy connection is exaggerated to an unbelievable degree: although  Sinatra was a friend and supporter of JFK, going so far as to honor Joe  Kennedy's wish of asking golf pal Sam Giancana to muscle some West Virginia  votes in Jack's direction, this subplot carries far too much of the  film--but, of course, sensationalism is what draws many viewers in.  Mantegna and Cheadle are superb as Martin and Davis (though Dino gets short  shrift), but Liotta, though a fine actor, is NOT Sinatra by any stretch of  the imagination.  Admittedly, there probably is no actor capable of  capturing even a glint of Frank's charisma, personality or  talent--nevertheless, this fact detracts from any "realism" the  movie many have.  And the movie is stifled by the producer's inability to  use any of the original music, killing any true atmosphere that could have  been achieved.  (Viewers unfamiliar with the original recordings may enjoy  the movie to a higher degree than "Pack" fans and Frankophiles.)  The earlier TV miniseries, SINATRA, starring Philip Casnoff, who was  officially chosen by the Sinatra family, makes for better and more accurate  viewing.  (Too bad this movie doesn't have Mantegna and Cheadle.)  --Scott  Allen Nollen, author of the forthcoming SINATRA AT THE CINEMA (Midnight  Marquee)
