I just finished watching the second movie in this set this morning.  I thought I had seen all the episodes when the series played on tv, but there were several that were new to me.  This show is amazing and I really enjoyed the historical accuracy in it.  I am a history buff and I savored every single minute of it.  Even the life messages that each episode contained are as true today as they were then.  I was surprised to learn that many of the predjudices of today were also around back in the late 1800's.  I guess some things never change.  My set came in a square box with Jane Seymour and Joe Lando on the front and back.  What I especially liked was the fact that I could read what each episode was about before I watched it.  The only disappointment for me was the fact that the Reverand Johnson remained blind to the end of the series.  I thought surely he would get his sight back.  I have purchased several tv series and this is the only one I watched completely from beginning to end.  I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  There is something for everyone from love scenes to frontier fights.
