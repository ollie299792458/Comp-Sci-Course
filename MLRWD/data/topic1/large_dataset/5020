I've seen a lot of reviews panning this movie. I understand the perspective of these reviewers. Generally, they find this type of movie too light-hearted and shallow. They expect a movie with some teeth and action and reality driven (Oh, what "Survivor" has done to us!) Well I have to admit, I go to movies to escape reality, not face it. Life is heavy-hearted and deep enough for me. This movie fits the bill: it's a total escape from reality. And if you take it for what it's supposed to be, you can have fun with it. I did.

Harrelson and Brosnan play off each other very well.  Brosnan is understated, at times maybe too much, while Harrelson as an FBI agent is miscast.  Salma Hayek still can't act, but then again in this movie she really doesn't have to.  The story is predictable, the plot line breaks occasionally, and the acting occasionally is phoned in.  But the scenery, including Hayek, is breathtaking, and the trip away from reality is fun and humorous, with enough suspense and intrigue to keep me interested.  It's a piece of fluff, but if you understand that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.
