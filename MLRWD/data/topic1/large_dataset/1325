This is the 3rd adaptation of Jane Eyre I saw. I liked this one more than 1983 and 1996 versions, because the characters were very likable, and the passion on screen was moving. Some reviewers found Ciaran Hinds stiff; I  disagree. He was a wonderful Mr. Rochester, as was Samantha Morton a  perfect Ms. Eyre. This is something you would want to watch over and over  again, if you are a romantic person, preferably an Austenite. However, the  adaptation is really loose, and important details from the book are  omitted. So if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, or watching the  movie to avoid reading the book, this is not the one. 83 version is very  loyal to the book, but they are almost reading from the book. 96 version is  generally loyal, but the omitted parts are the romantic parts, so where is  the fun? This one is the best one I have seen until now, but I will keep  looking for a miniseries that includes all the main details, and brings the  passion in the book alive. (I am not obsessed with loyalty to the book in  general, but Jane Eyre is a perfect book, and I miss all the parts that are  left out.)
