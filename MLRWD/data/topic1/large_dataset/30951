I haven't read the book yet so I have no pre-conceived notions except that there is a pair of pants.  Someday I will read it and if it changes my view of the movie, then I'll update.

The movie was well done, great acting, scenery and directing.  Each of the four girls was given enough development so that you feel as if you knew them and grew with them.  They each had a situation that they had to grow through, yet they all kept connected together with the pants.  None of them were perfect but they all supported each other, "warts" and all.  It was overall pretty clean, very little language, no nudity and only one implied sex scene.

I appreciated the fact that the girls weren't bed hopping, and that the only one who had done something - had mixed feelings about it.  In the end, the girls learned a little more about themselves - each taking a risk of their own.  Their relationships together grows stronger through their struggles.  It's the kind of group of friends that most of us long to have!
