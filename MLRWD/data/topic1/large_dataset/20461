The first time I saw this movie, circa 1969, I was disappointed.  I felt it was melodramatically presented, in black and white, and in two hours it was an injustice to the novel's power and grandeur.  The actors did not  seem to measure up, or buy in, to the characters they portrayed.  This  movie review, thirty years ago, would have rated "The  Fountainhead" as, at best, two stars.  It was a definite embarassment  to most Ayn Rand devotees at the time.
The five star rating I give the  movie today, thirty years and numerous viewings later, is a very personal,  indivdualized one.  Through these eyes,  "The Fountainhead" is  enormously moving, well-cast and very well portrayed, if you're the kind of  person who relates to: (1) the struggle between integrity and conformity in  our private and business lives  (2) the travails of entrepreneurship  and  perseverance in the face of spirit crushing adversity  (3) the belief that  there is definable difference between good and evil, and that it is really  possible for the former to prevail.  
Several of Gary Cooper's scenes as  Howard Roark are profoundly memorable:  (1)  when he refuses money from  Peter Keating after showing him he was down to his last few cents  (2) when  he walks out on the munificent offer from the bank board to build a  mutation of his bank design (3) the party scene when Dominique discovers  the quarry worker she had obsessed over was Roger Enright's architect,  Howard Roark.  
There's more.  Great camera angles, strong dialogue from  the supporting cast, especially Ellsworth Toohey.
Summarily, the  director, screenplay people and actors did a magnificent job within the two  hour confines of making a riveting movie.  But if you're looking for a  verbatim reproduction of the book, or you have an aversion to Ayn Rand's  message of individual creativism and freedom, this one's not for you!
