It is fantastic that one of the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever to be made is finally on DVD. "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution" is an underrated classic. Based on Nicholas Meyer's novel, Dr. John Watson (Robert Duvall), concerned for the health of his friend Sherlock Holmes (Nicol Williamson) during one of the great detective's bouts of cocaine addiction. Watson is able to lure Holmes to Vienna where he meets Sigmund Freud (Alan Arkin) who helps him overcome his addiction and leads them on one of the greatest adventures of their lives.

Despite the fact that this story goes against the original Sherlock Holmes canon, it has much in store for Sherlock Holmes fans to enjoy. The greatest asset in the movie is Nicol Williamson as Holmes. Williamson one of the most underrated actors to play the world's greatest detective. Despite the fact that he looks nothing like the character depicted in the Arthur Conan Doyle originals, Williamson's performance is marvelous. Alan Arkin and Robert Duvall both turn in good performances as well as does Vanessa Redgrave and Laurence Oliver - who plays the Napoleon of Crime, Professor James Moriarty. Aside from the brilliant casting, the production values are fantastic. Ken Adam, production designer, has outdone himself creating the Victorian milieu wonderfully, and the costumes are fitting the period.

In all, this movie is a fantastic Sherlock Holmes adventure. Supported by a great cast and a driving musical score, I highly recommend this underrated classic.
