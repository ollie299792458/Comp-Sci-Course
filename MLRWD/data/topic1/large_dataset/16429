In a way, it's a pity that the Black Hole came out after (and because of) Star Wars as this movie, like so many others of the times, tried to be in part another Star Wars. And in that it fails miserably. And sadly, the Black Hole also tries to be another 2001: A Space Odyssey-- and in that, it also fails.

The problem was that Disney had a really great idea but executed really badly. I don't often use the word cheesy to describe anything because I think that word is over used by people who don't appreciate the effort that goes into the special effects of any time period compared to this one now. But the Black Hole's SFX *were* cheesy: while some were brilliant, too many were people and things hanging on wires that could be seen or less than great animation. Too many of the effects look sadly like they were made on a $1.98 budget.

Yet some of the model work for the spachsips were incredibly well done and some of the set designs were superior to anything up to that time. It's this combination of the really great and the incredibly lousy that makes this film hard to say that is a bad film. because in many ways, it isn't; it's a very good film bogged down sometimes by crappy special effects and bad direction, but overall the film surpasses it many bad parts to become something very enjoyable and worth watching. I only regret that while the widescreen version of this movie is fairly cheap, the full screen version costs twice as much! What's up with that?
