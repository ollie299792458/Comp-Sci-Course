While I wouldn't go as far as calling Drew Barrymore's Danielle a feminist, this is a refreshing, sweet take on the classic fairy tale.  A must for anyone who enjoys romantic dramedies or pretty period pieces.  This is both.
The overall theme of this movie is sweetness and idealism.  It's got it's share of villains, but the real challenge for Danielle is class conflict - this is a true 90's Cinderella.  To their credit, the issues aren't done heavy-handedly.  Things fit together with the plot and characters, and if you can succeed in ignoring all the philo-babble, this is a great movie to relax with - after all, you know how it ends.
The disparate accents of the multi-national cast (American, Scottish, French, Dutch, British) grate a little, but eventually, this gets lost in the lovely French scenery and particularly expressive faces of actors Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Anjelica Huston.  While the characters have been a bit updated and fleshed out, they hold few surprises.  Danielle/Cinderella is a free-spirited (but chaste) go-getter with heart and her Prince is pretty dull until he meets her.  They discuss philosophy, education, and social responsibility.  Um, this isn't your grandma's Cinderella.
Some changes: The stepsisters figure more prominently in the plot and they're both scene stealers (notice how opposite the sisters are in every way).  Also, no magical elements, but we get Leonardo da Vinci instead, which is a nice touch.
A good, entertaining movie that works for everyone - highly recommended.
