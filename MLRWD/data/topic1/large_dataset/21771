"Sweet Smell of Success," the Lancaster/Curtis team-up of 1957, is a brilliant little piece of work, underappriciated as a classic film but widely praised in many circles and by fans of twisty, biting noir. The script (co-penned by Ernest Lehman of "North by Northwest" fame) is very, very dark and lets no one off the hook. The characters are all sinister and manipulative, but the film itself shares a strong moral center and the consequences of J.J. & Sidney's actions are greatly taken into account during the closing moments. Entertainment Weekly's TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL-TIME listed the film at #49 and said it was the type of movie "you stumble upon late at night on cable tv." And they're right: I happened to flip by TCM at 2:00 am one night, caught the opening titles of "Sweet Smell of Success," and sat riveted for the entire running time. 
It's great, really great. One of my favorite films, and even though the DVD itself is medicore to say the least (CRITERION! HEED MY CALL!), it holds a special place in my DVD collection.
