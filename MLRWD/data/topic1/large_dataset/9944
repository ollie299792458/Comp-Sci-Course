In 1995, action fans rejoiced.  James Bond was back and just as fun as ever in GOLDENEYE.  This time around, 007, played by Pierce Brosnan, is filled with shame over the death of his counterpart 006 (Sean Bean), believing he was responsible for 006's demise.  Suddenly Bond is wisked into a war involving a stolen Russian missile launcher named Goldeneye, meanwhile being pitted once again against the Russian general (Gottfried John) that killed 006.  Brosnan is arguably the greatest thing to happen to Bond since Roger Moore; he's every Bond in one, combining Sean Connery's strategy with Roger Moore's humor, George Lazenby's human side with Timothy Dalton's dark side.  Brosnan is truly what the Bond franchise was looking for.  The film also features a very nice score by Eric Serra; adventurous directing by Martin Campbell; and an action-packed script by Jeffrey Caine & Bruce Feirsten which also features plenty of humor.  GOLDENEYE goes beyond the standard Bond flick, and ranks highly among the most entertaining well through it's 130 minutes; action/Bond fans will not be disappointed!
END TITLE: May not be gold, but action fans won't want to miss it
