Seriously.

Walk into a freezer and sit there for a couple hours.  It'll be more entertaining and less painful than Whiteout.

Predictible, uncreative, unresearched, inconsistent...  Kate Beckinsale IS hot, but her performance was unconvincing.  I'm a US Marshall, but every time I see a dead guy I have a flashback every five minutes - her character was sent to Antartica for a REASON -> that reason is because she's S-T-U-P-I-D. "Why are there bullet holes in the plane?"  "How come the pilots stopped breathing?"  "Why did the plane rittled with bullet holes and with both of it's pilots dead crash?" "Is it possible for ANY surgeon or medical person to have been trained to give stitches in the same manner?"  "Why does my kitties breath smell like kitty food?"  That's about the depth of the MYSTERY in this movie.

Tom Skerritt was actually the best performer in the film - and that says something.  Respect to Tom.  Infact, I'm tempted to end myself right now the same way Tom did...  by saying, "Duces to this lame movie!  I'm going outside to freeze to death rather than participate any further is this farce!!!!"
