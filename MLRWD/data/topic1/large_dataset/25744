This couldn't have been released in theaters.  I couldn't imagine it.

If you find that you have to watch this movie, here are 3 points of advice:

1. Get control of the remote to fast forward through the long pointless scenes and the almost never ending static shots.

2. Watch it on a large TV.  Apparently they blew all of their money on leasing the Hummer and didn't have enough left over for a zoom lens.  There are plenty of static long distance shots where it's a mystery as to where one is supposed to be looking.  Hint, watch for movement.

3. Bring something else to do while it's on.

I wasn't actually able to take watching all of this thing, so maybe I missed the "good" stuff.  I can say however that ending isn't part of the possibly missed good stuff.

This movie made me feel a little guilty.  After watching this, I think I owe Eragon at least another star.  There was some nice scenery it that one at least.  The amazon scale should go something like 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 stars in order to properly rate the trash.

If Blockbuster had a "Pointless" section (between Mystery & Romance of course), this movie would be in it.
