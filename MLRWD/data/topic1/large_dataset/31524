Caught this the other night on Cable...

Now I don't want to seem like I am always bashing the Karate kid franchise but they honestly "milked that cow" til it was dry. I am surprised they didn't come with a part 5 with Miyagi's nephew or next door neighbor in need of "discipline" because he was getting beat up by the "Crips" or "bloods" gangbangers or something...then again that would make an interesting NEW story hmmmmm?

This "Next Karate Kid" was really boring (I don't understand how some viewers are giving 3 stars and have the word "boring" in the same summary.

Hilary Swank looks really young with her bangs an all(I don't know if this was her first movie but you can tell that she was an "authentic" actress in training)She did pretty good..in a silly role.

Pat Morita as always does a exellent job...with what he has in terms of script. But the movie just seemed like De ja vu. Tons

of the dialogue and scenarios were just too much the SAME thing as the first Karate Kid. I don't know too many high school tough guys who go around picking on pretty girls...most of the time they are "Picking" them up.

The "tough teens" were too old to be highschool students.

They did NOT need this version girl or guy.

I kept repeating to myself "god this is stupid",

I forced myself to watch the rest because I like to finish

what I start. Stupid ending...I waited it out for nothing.

This could have been one of those "Disney TV movie of the week"

things but no, for the sake of Pat Morita's career they pushed it in the theaters. They tried to appeal to the new "90's" generation but no one cared.

Please no more Karate kid sequels or spin-offs.

This movie is already being used for "landfill fodder".
