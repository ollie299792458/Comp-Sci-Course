I have loved this show ever since I was a kid. I remember watching in every summer during the 80's, and I had no idea the show was old by the time I watched it. I immediately feel in love with it, and I remember it had another one of my child hood heroes in it at the time Lee Majors from the Six Million Dollar Man and The Fall Guy. This is not to take away from the rest of the cast I grew to love them to, but Lee Majors is who drew me to the show. I am now a Father with a Wife, and two kids and I still love westerns, and I have been showing them every great western show I can find on DVD I grew up watching such as The Big Valley and they love it, but they were just as disappointed as I was that only Season 1 and part of Season 2 had been released! Come on Fox you have had long enough to release this, and if you wont do it for me at least do it for my kids so they can enjoy a little piece of entertainment history before their all grown up. I also want to ask one question even though I doubt anybody from the studios ever read these comments, but I will ask anyways. "Why do shows like this get released in Region 2 before Region 1? I frankly don't understand it. The shows were made in America first and enjoyed here in America first by Americans so why don't they get released here first for Americans the original target group of these shows to enjoy? I just don't understand the reasoning behind the studios decisions it seems completely backwards to me!
