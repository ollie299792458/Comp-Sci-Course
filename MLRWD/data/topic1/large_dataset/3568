the cider house rules has become a wonderful addition to my list of favorite movies in the past year or so.  you can imagine, then, what my anger was upon coming across one of the reviews that is posted.  the opinion of the writer was that there were absolutely no underlying issues in the cider house rules.  the only one apparent to them was the issue of abortion.  whatever happened to the incest?  a daughter is impregnated by her father in this movie.  did this person miss the part about leaving home to find yourself? and what about the most important theme of all? 'RULES ARE CONDITIONAL!'  to say that this movie promotes abortion and is offensive to people who are against it, one suggests that 'the sixth sense' is offensive to people who don't believe in ghosts and 'star wars' is offensive to people who dislike science fiction.  please.  abortion is only used in this story as an example of one moral that can be thrown away in extreme circumstances.  the movie shows to the people who watch it (as opposed to those who compare it to their own moral code) that rules can be broken, and if they are all applied (like the 'cider house rules') they can become rather ridiculous.  it merely encourages people to look outside of the strict moral code that we imprision ourselves in, and discover all that we may have missed.  i find the opinion, that the entire focus of this movie is on abortion, an insult to other movie-goers who may have been more than astounded by the way the MAIN theme of the cider house rules is presented.
