I remember when this first came out. I was a kid.

As a kid, who had never read Tolkien, I found it somewhat entertaining and it left off at a cliffhanger.  It was not until I was older when I realized two things 1)no one had ever done Tolkien before (other than Rankin Bass) and 2)no second part would ever be made.

Upon its own merit, it's not terrible. Bakshi who enjoys using rotoscope technology and reused stock animation did an okay, yet annoying job.  The one thing that really takes away from the film (and once again, realized when I got older and read the trilogy) was the character of Samwise Gamgee.  As this character was drawn as a pathetic comic relief character instead of the very brave stout honest character that he turns out to be I am more angered by this portrayal than anything else.

Peter Jackson was right to cast Sean Astin in this part where he's entirely believable and stalwart throught the entire trilogy.  I have a hard time picturing Bakshi's Samwise as the same individual that would not only kill Shelob but to also carry Frodo up Mount Doom.

Given that Bakshi was the first to attempt this story and the only person before Peter Jackson to tell the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as well as some of The Two Towers, he gets an extra star for his effort.
