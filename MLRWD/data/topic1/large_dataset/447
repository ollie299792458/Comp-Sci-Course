I am VERY glad I didn't spend my own money to watch this.  The fight scenes could've been very cool, and sometimes they are (notably the scene with the UFC guys in the cage), but normally they are edited so poorly and in that "MTV" style, that any build up of tension or momentum and rhythm of the fight is lost in the constant cuts.  The worst of this is the finale, where 3 fight scene get about 20 seconds of time per cut, and one fight scene, between the two women, not only has no dramatic reason for being there, but is completely unbelievable.  Give us DMX's last fight, then Jet's, and don't assume that we have the attention span of 6 years olds hopped up on a whole box of Frosted Flakes.  Maybe if we had the chance to really get into these individual fights, they would've been as cool as they seem to want to be.  
As for the plot...well, I really think they knew they had a paper thin plot, thus why any major plot points don't happen until the last half hour of the movie, long after most viewers have lost interest in what those diamonds are, exactly who the bad guys are, so on and so forth.  In action movies, it's all about pacing, both in plot and in the action scenes.  This movie has none.  Another waste of Jet Li.
