What we have here is a movie with a minimal, video game style, plot, second-rate acting and cheap CGI.  Another review referred to this movie as a "disposable adolescent" fantasy, I couldn't agree more.

I came away from this film wondering why, with all the good Science Fiction books on the market, any group of people would decide to invest millions of dollars making this movie.  Then I checked and discovered it did make a small profit.  Some part of my faith in humanity died.

As I watched Ultraviolet, I kept thinking that I was looking over the shoulder of someone playing a video game, and it does appears to have been created for the young male, game playing audience.  If you like seeing a young attractive woman, Milla Jovovich, in tight pants engage in stylized (The Matrix) style combat, this film is for you.

Perhaps this would be a good dollar rental on a slow night with high school or college friends, but as a fan of serious Science Fiction, I cannot recommend it.

Verdict: Maybe a dollar rental, or just skip it.
