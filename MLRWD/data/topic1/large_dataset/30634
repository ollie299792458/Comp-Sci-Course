Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young woman who is given a good sum of money to take to the bank so a customer can purchase a home, while on the way to the bank suddenly greed takes over and a chance to start a new life appeals greatly to Ms. Crane so she decides to take off in her car with the money. She purchases a new car, has a banter with a sheriff who stops her on a road, then Marion decides to stop for the night at a hotel, The Bates Motel. This is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is well troubled shall we say, even after a dinner with Norman Marion still stays the night and this is where the famous shower murder scene occurs and Marion meets her untimely end. The rest of the movie has a private detective search for Marion (only to meet his own sad end) and Marion's sister (Vera Miles) decides to also look for answers.

Director Alfred Hitchcock truly made a great classic here, while it was made in 1960 it does still old up today thanks to Hitchcock's style and ability to show both creepiness and care when it comes to his actors. Perkins is absolutely fantastic as Bates, Leigh does well as Crane and the rest of the performances are also quite good. The shower scene was fantastically done as Hitchcock took special care to make sure no nudity or knife wounds were shown, just did the cuts and shots so well to make sure it still chilled you without being violent.

What's great about "Psycho" is you can appreciate how Hitchcock was able to play on a lot of people's fears and how there no bad action goes unpunished (hence the greed of Marion sadly leading to her end in the hotel). Also Alfred turned the horror/suspense franchise into an art with this film that few have ever been able to recapture. The build-up and conclusion are also very well done and its one of the few movies I can pull out of my collection and watch, just to enjoy some good classic film making. **** out of 4 stars.
