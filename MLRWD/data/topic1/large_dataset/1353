This is the first High School Musical ever to go to a movie theater and I wasn't really shocked when I heard that in the summer of 2007 right after the release of High School Musical 2.  I did know before even viewing High School Musical 3 that was probably going to be the last bow for this class in the High School musical series I only say that because I have just recently heard there will be a fourth film, but with almost none of the original class. Right off the bat this film just looks pretty.  Director Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job on making this look like a musical movie, it just looks very pleasing to the eye.  The story really surrounds the theme of moving on and the fact that things change once one leaves high school, friends depart, and most heartbreaking some love relationship die.  For Troy and Gabriella High School Musical's Tony and Maria from West Side Story [Blu-ray] that reality is coming to ahead.  This is more difficult for Troy just because he really doesn't know who he is. A theme that we have seen before in the first two films but he has never really dealt with it before.  Like it or not, Troy's story is relatable in the idea that most if not all kids don't know who they are or what career path they should choose and the world isn't going to stop turning just so you can decide.  Zac Efron did an amazing job in terms of balancing the emotional scenes, with the romantic scenes, with the comedic scenes.  He and Vannessa Hudgens gave their characters closure which I think every fan wanted to see.  There is more music and dance numbers in this movie than the other two films combined and it is probably in my opinion the best of the series.  Now, if you were not a fan of the first two films do not buy this movie, but if you were you will not be dissapointed.
