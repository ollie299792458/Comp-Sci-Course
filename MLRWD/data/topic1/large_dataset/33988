To begin with, I did enjoy watching this movie, but there were quite a few issues.

The main issue is that you just don't care: you don't care when anyone gets killed, you don't care when Tim is tortured (by the way, he did NOT start bickering with Franken; and his shirt must have had at least one tiny speck of dust on it), you don't care when Rachel/Ellis is being humiliated, you don't care when her family and friends are gunned down.

The only character I cared about remotely was Theo, and I loved his scene when he shot Van Gein. Johnny de Mol was great in that.

The next issue is that I can pretty well guarantee that this movie would not have been made, say, 20 years after the war. The whole "nice Nazi officer" concept would have been ridiculed in the Netherlands, let alone a big romance between a Gestapo highup officer and a Jewess. It's a fantasy, and a badly done one --- Rachel/Ellis must have a stomach of steel: you could skin a live puppy in front of that woman and she wouldn't move. I don't know if this was intentional or just lousy acting, but it kind of detracted.

The next issue is that none of it really made any sense, and sometimes it just went too far: I mean there is NO WAY she got that painting back up on the wall before M&uuml;ntze walked in. The movie was full of problems like that.

The torture was minimal --- the scene lasted less than 2 minutes. In certain scenes, there really wasn't enough blood (really, if you kill a guy via firing squad, there is going to be blood). It also was annoying that you already knew that Ellis/Rachel was going to survive it all, and that the whole movie was basically all a flashback --- any suspense that the movie might have had was defused completely.

I did enjoy watching the movie, but it was definitely below my expectations.
