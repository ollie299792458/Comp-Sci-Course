This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Admittedly it is not very historically accurate (it glosses over some of the more unlikeable aspects of More's character, and leaves out some major things [like his other dozen or so children]), but as a film -- screenplay -- piece of entertainment, it is utterly magnificent.

The acting is flawless.

The script is amazing, with many wonderful bits. (I could listen to the "This country is planted thick with laws -- man's laws, not God's laws" speech a thousand times and never get tired of it.)

The cinematography, costuming and direction are gorgeous.

The DVD transfer is fine.  While the extras are lighter than in many films, the documenary on More is very interesting, and there are 3 subtitle options (English, French and Portuguese), and 3 audio options (2 English, one very well done French track.) A commentary track might have been nice, but its omission isn't enough to influence firm my 5 star rating.

If you've never seen this movie, do so.  If you've seen it before and love it, buy it at a VERY reasonable price..  (And, if you've seen it before and hate it ... well ... don't.)
