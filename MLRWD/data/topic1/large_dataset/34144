I first saw this film when I was about 13 or so. At the time I was growing to be a true classic film fan. The performances in this film are wonderful, I think the roles were well cast. The film balances drama and comedy far better than any film today. Exceptional for a film about the possibility that a husband who has run off with someone else. Films today about relationships tend to just be about screaming and overly dramatic events. I don't think a film like this could be made today.

The film uses flashbacks and self reflection to tell the story. Most of the action occurs in the past. Each of the women looking at her relationship and trying to see if there are clues the implicate her husband as the one who has run off.

There is the obvious flaw of the film portraying the issues in each marriage as being solely the woman's responsibility. I didn't take a star off for this, because it is a reflection of the time the film was made.

The DVD I received when I bought this a few years ago was in great condition. I think this film was restored. The picture is nice and clear, not grainy or choppy as is the case with some of the classic film DVDs I have seen over the years. The extra biography on Linda Darnell is interesting as well.
