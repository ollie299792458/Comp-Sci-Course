Originally released domestically on video in a heavily edited version titled UNSANE, this Argento masterpiece is finally available in a widescreen, (almost) uncut version running 10 minutes longer than UNSANE.  [Japanese laserdiscs include about one or two seconds of violence not  present in the domestic video release.] The incredible crane shot, where  the camera creeps along and up a building into the apartment of the  killer's next victim, has been restored, as well as the shocking,  well-staged blood-spattered dismemberment axing.
Many of the usual  Argento elements are present: plenty of red herrings are tossed into the  story to conceal the killer's identity, dream-like flashbacks may or may  not supply clues to the mystery, and there are elaborate, sometimes  disorienting camera angles and remarkable visual imagery that are inherent  in all of Argento's work.  
Sure, some of the dialogue is stilted, and  some of the acting is a bit wooden (it's seems that Daria Nicoldi's voice  may have been dubbed (or perhaps it's just some stiff acting)), but for me  this never detracts from the suspense or beauty of the film.  If you like  beautifully lensed giallos with some graphic violence and mounting  suspense, and can forgive some bad performances and dialogue, then you'll  probably enjoy TENEBRAE.
