"Cheyenne" Starring: Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie the greatest Western ever to come across the Television Screen. At 6 feet 7 inches tall and built solid as a rock no one messed around with this Cowboy. He was handsome, soft spoken, quick witted, slow to anger but quick on the draw Cowboy. This show produced by Warner Bros. was an hour of pure western entertainment.

Clint Walker pounded on the bad guys from Sept. 20, 1955 through Sept. 13, 1963 with 108 one hour black & white episodes. Cheyenne was a fictitious adventurer in the days after the Civil War.  Cheyenne worked as an Army Scout, Ranch Foreman, Indian Fighter and part-time Lawman.

Clint Walker created one of Television's greatest Western Heroes, and "Cheyenne" was and still is one of the most popular Western Series ever to air on Television.

All I can say Heaven has smiled upon us by releasing this Wonderful Western. Thank You Clint Walker & Warner Bros. and whoever else is responsible for releasing this great Western. Please release the rest of the series along with all the other Warner Bros. Classics.  I hope to see Lawman, Bronco, Maverick, Sugarfoot & Colt .45
