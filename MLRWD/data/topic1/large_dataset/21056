Much better than the first "House of the Dead". This movie proves sequels can be better than the original, even if it isn't that good. I mean, it could NOT get worse than the first one. Contains all the requisite gore and blood of a zombie movie, has a plot and the acting is not horrid. For a TV movie this is a pretty ok effort. Somewhat following what happened in the first movie, a team of special forces (for killing zombies) infiltrates a college campus believed to be ground zero for the zombie virus. Their mission is to obtain a blood sample from patient zero in order to create an antidote. The film explains how the first one ties in to the current story and we even get one of the characters from the first movie (who had allegedly died, guess not).

Emmanuelle Vaugier seemed to have created a new acting method: the tired acting. Somehow she always appeared bored and tired, in every scene. Victoria Pratt is always a nice addition to every sci-fi movie and her acting was better than all the other actors. The movie presented situations that proved to defy logic: from being surrounded by zombies and not getting a single scratch, to zombies being electrocuted, yet will not die by a shot in the heart, and finally, the end (without giving it away)...honestly, how does one survive? Still, the movie was entertaining, better than a lot of zombie movies out there. I wouldn't mind watching it again.
