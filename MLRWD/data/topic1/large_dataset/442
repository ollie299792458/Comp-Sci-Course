I just received my copy of THE FLIGHT OF DRAGONS, and I am glad Warner Bros. offer it on AMAZON, so overseas customer can get their hand on it!

Recorded on DVD-R, image quality is more or less VHS quality, but certainly better then the copy I have, which was recorded to DVD-R from my old VHS tape. The problem I have is the 10 minutes chapter skip instead of chapter mark on the proper interval. If I could do a better chapter mark on my Pioneer DVD/HDD recorder, they should be able to do better then me! Kind of sloppy here! Of course, I won't expect a widescreen edition, since it was released in US directed to TV in the 80's.

I also not sure what with the warning regarding the disc will only play back on "PLAY ONLY" DEVICES. If my DVD-R copied from VHS tape could play on all DVD drive, why should DVD released by a big studio have such problem? Kind of silly and irresponsible, isn't it?

Anyway, the copy I received is able to playback on both my Pioneer DVD/HDD recorder, Panasonic Blu-ray/DVD player, and both my iMac and MacBook DVD drive!

Still, I am glad that it finally out on DVD. With THE LAST UNICORN, 2 of the best animation Rankin/Bass ever produced!
