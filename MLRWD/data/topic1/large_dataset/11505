I can't emphasize enough how much I love this film!!  I'm just wrecked to hear it didn't do well in theaters, and that there's no date set for dvd release!  *befuddled*

The Brothers Bloom is incredibly quirky, occasionally to the point of being surreal, with a score that sounds a bit cabaret or vaudevillian, mixed with a twisted circus.  It suits the film to a T!  The effect of the elder brother spinning yarns throughout, in a somewhat poetic manner (the younger finding this exercise absolutely exhausting and nerve-wracking!) made it easy to follow the Brothers' mindset:  they twist reality through their cons, and the world seems to easily bend to the stories.  When things go awry, however, strangeness is amplified.  The bizarre becomes quite normal, especially because the mark they choose introduces herself as an epileptic photographer who, having virtually no social contact in her life, is awkward and collects unusual hobbies.

Another reviewer described it as Ocean's 11 meets The Royal Tenenbaums.  That's cute, but still doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film.  I felt a bit of a Burtonesque (or Gorey) touch to it, as well.  The cinematography was beautiful (breathtaking at times!), and exquisite drawings that were used in the Brothers' plans added so much to beauty of the film.

If you enjoy films more than a little off center, you will surely enjoy the Brothers Bloom!
