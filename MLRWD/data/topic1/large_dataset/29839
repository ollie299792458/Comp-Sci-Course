Okay, everyone has talked about how great the story is and how engaging the actors are. Let me say some good things about the director's commentary. This was Bonnie Hunt's first movie as a director, and it's clear that she's tickled with it. It's also clear that she used to do standup comedy and hang with Second City.
These commentary tracks seem to be pretty informal affairs. It can be a real chore to sit through one unless the speakers know how to entertain the audience. Hunt does a fine job. She gets a couple of running gags going, like her strategy to save production (hotel) costs. She has a few pointers for "film school" people. She points out every friend and relative in the production, who has speaking parts, why others don't, and so on.
Incidentally, Hunt also talks about how they crafted the screenplay and the film. She talks about how they set up particular characters, fought the studio to leave things in and why, and point out the payoffs when they come. She was also frank about some tough decisions she made about cut scenes.
Overall, I found Hunt's commentary entertaining, informative and, well, charming.
