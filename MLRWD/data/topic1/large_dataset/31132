I just got done watching the DVD and couldn't have been more frustrated and disappointed during the viewing. Once again, the NPG has found away to screw things up.
I put in the DVD and pressed play and could not believe how grainy and blurry and unclear the picture was. The close-ups were fuzzy and at times Prince was unrecognizable in the long shots. ( I have some bootleg VHS tapes that are clearer than this DVD). Also, the audio is only in "Dolby Digital". You know what that means? It means that what you are listening to is coming out of your left, right, and subwoofer speakers. That's it!!!! I don't know about the rest of you, but I have a full home theater system and would have appreciated listening to the music in at least 5.1 Dolby Digital if not DTS.
Compared to the Rave DVD, there is no comparison. Rave was crystal clear and recorded in DTS, and when I play the DVD, my whole house rocks! It is superior to this DVD in every way.
Prince, how could you have [messed] up such a gem like this DVD? The music was great, Sheila looked ageless, and you are still the greatest ever.
I just expected much more than I got...but than again I've said that frequently about your music the past 8 or 9 years.
