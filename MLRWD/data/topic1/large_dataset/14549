That's the best way I can describe it. 
I never watched it when it aired, was kinda glad when they took it off and never missed it, until now. It just looked so dumb when advertised that I figured the show had to be empty. But it wasn't at all. There were some really solid episodes. I do admit, the show is weak in certain areas and probably 4 instead of five stars, but the entertainment vector is still very high.
Scenario: In the near future, the military uses a biotechnology company called Manticore to create super human DNA by mixing it with shark, cat, wolf, etc. and then raising the children created to become super-soldiers (hence some matrix like abilities). While escaping, half of the child soldiers are killed and the other half are on the run forever. Dark Angel lives in Seattle, and with the help of "Eyes-only" is trying to find the others who made it out. Eyes-only is a philanthropist crusader (the son of a rich man) who teams up with Angel for mutual benefit. Social services have broken down after "the pulse", an electromagnetic weapon that reduced the United States to the Stone Age overnight. As a broke, ex-super-power, there is debris in the streets and military checkpoints everywhere. So, basically there's the future angle, the apocalyptic angle and the bio-engineered super human angle, which is nice. And, there are some great, ruthless bad-guys that are actually smart and do some very clever things to get back their "kids". All in all, I was really impressed. The writing and characters are truly solid, the budget lacked a little but the imagination made up for it. It's a shame we'll never get more.
