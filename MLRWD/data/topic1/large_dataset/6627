So let me be the first one to tell you this is one cult classic flick that will scare you well most of you, those who will admit that it did. if you like supernatural thriller films then this one for you, it all begins with a daughter of a scientist that has strange dreams of Girls & Guys being murdered in a weird way . there's a pair of Ladies in high school that call themselves the sisters that are accepting a new recuit in the group , but first she has to pass their childish test. will she survive? rent it to see  it's PG For mild Language & strong violence , Mild brief nudity in one scene. It stars Adam west ( Batman fame & one lady that was in better off dead as the singer of the band & now voices cartoons namely tommy of the rugrats Elizabeth Daily. so enjoy this one dark night haaaaa if you can stand it . :) this is a real horror movie not a one passing as one

Highly Recommended for a Good Scare .

Ummm I really think Archor Bay should've got One Dark Night than this company it's only half  restored,  there are some dirt and scratches left which take away from the enjoyment of watching this film plus a frame jumps, but the colors are bright better then the vhs version which was faded. the case that it comes in also is'nt best .
