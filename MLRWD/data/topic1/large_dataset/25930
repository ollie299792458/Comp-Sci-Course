Genre director Tobe Hooper has made a couple of great horror films (TCM, Poltergeist) and a whole truckload of average ones (TCM2, Mangler, Crocodile).  It&#8217;s a sad thing when the last notable great film you&#8217;ve made dates back to 1982 but that has been Hooper&#8217;s career so far.  One thing I respect with the guy however is that he has never abandoned the genre that made him famous in the first place and has not shied away from splashing generous amounts of blood on our screens.  Given his recent celluloid history, I wasn&#8217;t too sure about his reworking of &#8220;The Toolbox Murders&#8221;, a trashy 70&#8217;s flick that was never any good in the first place and whose sole claim to fame was that it just happened to be one of Stephen King&#8217;s personal favorites.

The Lusman Arms Hotel in Hollywood, CA provides affordable rent in a historically overpriced market.  Many of its tenants are wanna-be actors and models in search of the California dream.  Truth is the place is a real rathole: paper-thin walls with holes in them, brown water shooting out of the faucets, crack whores, drug dealers, smudge & grime everywhere.  But if you&#8217;re in Hollywood and forced to live on a budget where else will you go?  For Nell (Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven, a young couple in a transitionary phase of life, the Lusman Arms is their best option.  But Nell is starting to find the place to be awfully noisy.  It soon becomes apparent to her that the power drill noise she keeps hearing is used for more than just repairs and that tenants are disappearing at an alarming rate.  Who&#8217;s behind these toolbox murders?  The sleazy manager, the creepy repairman, the pimp next door?

&#8220;The Toolbox Murders&#8221; is argually the film us horror nuts have wanted Hooper to make ever since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Hooper goes straight for the throat here, delivering a grimy 70&#8217;s style horror exploitation flick short on brains but high on brutality.  Gore fans will love the inventive kills as the killer shreds with a full arsenal including a hammer, nailgun, power drill, buzzsaw, pliers, screwdriver, the whole works.  Angela Bettis is absolutely stunning as the lead, able to switch from looking calm, to annoyed, to panicked, to determined.  You wouldn&#8217;t expect great acting in a film like this but she pulls it off, just as she did in &#8220;May&#8221;.  Admittedly, &#8220;Toolbox Murders&#8221; is nothing we haven&#8217;t seen before but yet it&#8217;s exactly the type of picture us horror fans want to see.  Hooper manages to keep the sleazy  vibe of the original film intact while injecting it with a new supernatural bent.  Thank you Tobe Hooper: Not only did you prove to me that you still have it as a horror filmmaker, you&#8217;ve also given me a renewed appreciation for my apartment building!
