poor video transfer, and a 3D gimmick requiring you to purchase a $99 viewing machine set-up from a questionable vendor are the things that were a huge disappointment for me when the video arrived in the mail.  i personally enjoy the 50's style anaglyph 3D movies, and thought that was what i was getting.  no such luck -- have to buy a weird 3d machine with bulky glasses on a cord from a vendor elsewhere in order to take advantage of the 3D aspect.  as corman was the king of camp and gimmiks, i was wanting to see the movie in 3D to enjoy it in the corman tradition....  no such luck.  am stuck with a poorly transferred video version of his classic film, distributed from what looks to be a very low-budget dvd company (wrinkled and warped DVD plastic cover it came in what not impressive either).  i wish amazon.com would have pointed the 3d aspect out on this page, which they haven't -- didn't have any luck on imdb either.  buy at your own risk -- sorry roger corman!  hope to find a better copy somewhere else...
