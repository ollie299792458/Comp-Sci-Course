This film blew me away. Movies are my hobby, I live in a moderately small city (e.g. population 115,000). A movie is almost the only option for a teenager here. So I've seen my fair share and beyond. My friends and I have worked and do work at theaters so I got to see a lot of movies for free. This allowed me to view movies I wouldn't regularly pay for. I had not heard anything about Femme Fatale when I saw it at the theater. Not knowing what I was in for, this movie blew me away. My good friend and fellow reviewer Kyle Marcum made a far better analogy than anything I've thought of thus far so I will just use it and credit him for it. The analogy being that of the Sierra Mist Commercials, "Yeah it's kind of like that." It is the best way to make you realize the feeling of refreshment I had after experiencing this film. I was so happy to see a film in which the writer/director had courage enough to include everything thing he/she did in this film. It is about time that someone really pressed the envelope to include these sometimes-essential elements for a suspenseful film. In the end there is no doubt in my mind that this film will blow you away! I give it the maximum stars available.
Two thumbs up!
