"Madly...not at all," the original French title of Colombani's opus, is much more apt, for therein lies the clue to this tale with a tantalizing twist.  The winsome Angelique first appears peeking out from a profusion of hundreds of vivid flowers, a kaleidoscopic, psychedelic, Walt Disney burst of glorious technicolor redolent of Easter and Alice in Wonderland. With Bambi eyes aglitter, the gamine persuades the florist to deliver a single flower to her beloved, a married doctor about to leave his wife for her.  Outside the shop, the adventure begins as the deliveryman on his moped takes off for the doctor's office while Angelique on her svelte bicycle whirls off in the opposite direction.  We follow her through charming Bordeaux as she bubbles on ecstatically about her Loic, obsessively draws and paints his portrait over and over, receives a prestigious art scholarship, meets with her lover at a reception, tries on a wedding dress, plans a romantic trip, all the while pursued by an obsessive medical student who idolizes her despite her love for the doctor.  As the plot unwinds, Angelique finally falls into a coma signalled by a whirlwind of scenes from her immediate past, culminating in a return to the beginning of the film.  Once again, she persuades the florist to have the rose delivered. Outside the florist shop, she once more mounts her bicycle while the deliveryman mounts his moped.  But this time, we follow the deliveryman to Loic's office.  From then on, every scene is juxtaposed to the corresponding scene in the first half of the film as seen within the doctor's frame of reference. Not a detail is missed as we are cunningly led behind the mirror to relive the past events from a totally different perspective, so familiar yet so different.  And what a shocker it is.  If you enjoy a clever, cynical and cruel plot, lucent cinematography and flawless acting, this is for you.  Brava, Laetitia Colombani, for a suspenseful tour de force.
