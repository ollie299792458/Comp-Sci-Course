I really wanted to like this movie.  I'm a HUGE Sly fan and I love NASCAR. (yes, I know this is CART/Formula 1) The plot was a rehash of well...a dozen other movies and some of the dialog was forced, corny and uncomfortable...much like Michael Scott from the Office.  If you can get past the plot and average acting then you're left with the racing action.  While I'll admit some of the special effects were gripping I couldn't enjoy them because they were so unrealistic.  As many others have pointed out the type of fuel used doesn't burn yellow it burns clean and blue.  There is NO way that downtown race could or WOULD ever have happened.  Oh and back to the plot.  Are we really expected to believe only two people were capable of winning from week to week AND that Carl (Burt Reynolds) was ready to fire a kid who WON FIVE RACES in his rookie season?  You have got to be kidding me!  You can win the darn championship with only one win!  It's about the points (at least in NASCAR it is.)  Anyway, the movie was just bad, bad, bad...I wish it wasn't. Again I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. :(
