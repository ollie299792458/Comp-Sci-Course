This movie is a cheesy wannabe-Clancy mess for the first two thirds, and a cheesy wannabe-Die Hard 3.  Nicole Kidman is just doing unbelievable stuff for a nuclear researcher (commanding combat helicopters?) and George Clooney is a cocky, jerky, undisciplined and unprofessional colonel.  His job function is never really clear, but they pitch him as a generic "James Bond" type maverick-superman-agent.  He knows everyone in the world and is making phone calls to president, prime ministers, and generals every three minutes... and he is also apparently the highest ranking military official in the universe, as he spends most of the movie bossing around generals, police chiefs, nuclear engineers, Russian spies, and commando teams.
The pace of the movie is overly busy and rushed, with far too many scenes taking place in bustling intelligence offices, with people shouting things like "FAA is on line 9!" "Pentagon thinks it may be terrorist related!" "The FDA needs respons STAT!" "Call Clark at Wilkins--he'll need to know!" "Get those reports ASAP!!" "Mark, Norad is on the phone!" ... and so on.  Imagine hearing this dialogue for about 120 minutes and you've got the idea.  Pass on this... go for Die Hard or a real Clancy movie.
