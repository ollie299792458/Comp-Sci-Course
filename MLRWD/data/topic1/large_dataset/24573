"Happy Feet" is one of my all-time favorite films for its beautiful animation, wonderful music, and powerful environmental message. There was nothing more that needed to be added to the tale of Mumble Happyfeet, the dancing penguin. So, you can imagine my dismay when I heard that there was a sequel in the works. I've ranted and debated about this sequel in various blogs all over the place, and I can safely say that I both like this film and have issues with it.

Good Aspects of this Movie:
1. All your favorite characters are back, even if it's only for brief cameos.
2. The animation is even better than the first!
3. You will fall in love with the characters of Sven and Erik.
4. The musical numbers play with some new territory with a great original song and even opera.
5. Less environmental "preachyness," as some of you called the first one.

Bad Aspects of this Movie:
1. Too many pointless subplots that distract from the main story (the krill and Carmen are primary examples).
2. Soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first film's.
3. A waste of Sofia Vergara. She only has seven lines!

Main point: If you've seen the first movie and really like it, check this sequel out. It's not as bad as a lot of people say it is here, but it's not as good as the first one. If you haven't seen the first film or just know it's not really your cup of tea, just stay away.

Also, the bonus features even on the bluray are bad. There's virtually nothing interesting to do. This is the same qualm I had with the first film's features though, so go figure.
