At first I thought this movie was going to be downright stupid. Finally I rented it and eventually bought it. Eight Legged Freaks is about the townspeople of Prosperity, Arizona who are attacked by suppoosedly "Mutated" spiders that took in toxic waste from their food and grew large and escaped from an exotic spider farm.

From there the monster spiders are beginning to eat dogs and cats (not great for the feline and canine lovers) and sneaking into people's houses and businesses to feed. Now the whole town has to fight back before each one of them is picked off by orb weavers, jumping spiders, spitting spiders, trapdoor spiders, and a tarantula.

 What I liked about the movie was the detail of the spiders. Nothing too fake looking. Everything especially the jumpers were extremely realistic looking for a movie. The whole movement and placement of the spiders was also nice. They didn't just all attack at once like most monster movies. Some of them laid back and did some funny things if you watch carefully. BUY IT!
