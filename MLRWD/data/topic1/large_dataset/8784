First of all, Rushmore as a movie is spectacular.  This is one that no one should miss.  It's filled with drama, laughs, friendship, confrontation and much, much more.  Ever since I saw the trailer for Rushmore back when it  was first released, I wanted to see it.  When I did, I was thrilled.  It's  just such a wonderful film.
Ok, now onto the DVD.  I would like to say  that I own 71 DVD's (including the Criterion Rushmore).  I have no  reservations in saying that this is the finest DVD in my collection.  If  every DVD is done this well, the world would be a much better place.  This  DVD has more 'special features' than 10 other DVDs put together.  Also, the  picture is beautiful (16x9 enhanced) and the sound is spectacular.  You  just can't possibly pack more goodies onto a DVD.  It can't be possible.  I  have never seen such a wonderful job on a title before.  
I take my hat  off to Criterion for this disc.  They have outdone themselves this time.  Plus, there couldn't be a better movie to accompany such a fine job.
If  you are a fan of the film, do yourself a favor and GET THIS DVD.  Don't  settle for the regular version; you'll be kicking yourself for a long time.
