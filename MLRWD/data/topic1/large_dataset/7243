I'm rewriting my review of this excellent film today, 3/7/2011.  I agree with the reviewer who thought that, perhaps, the Johnny Depp fans were expecting something completely different and weren't really open to what was presented, and, maybe this was responsible for a lot of the rather negative reviews.  Me?  I like Johnny Depp, but don't think he's been given much for roles.  Maybe, like Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp might someday have something to say and be able to say it.  In the meantime, it's probably best he just attempt to do what he's told to do to his best ability, even if it is just a lot of crap that some CEO wants for his multi-million dollar bonus.  After all, Bush or 'Bama, CEO's become accountable for what is done and what is not done; when they seem to have the reins.  Multi-multi of billions of dollars stolen and, I know, let's just concentrate on a 7-11 hold-up and put that poor SOB in prison for the rest of his life!  It's so much more manageable.  And, I know, let's just blame billions of dollars in new home computers each year on a few high-school kids; who are so very difficult to locate.  Huh?

Having just seen this film, again, I've uprated it from a four to a five.  That this film is a psychological thriller, I whole-heartedly agree. I think my problem with another reviewer is that what-else-should it be? I liked, "2001." I liked Tarkovsky's, "Solaris." And, I liked Soderbergh's and Clooney's, "Solaris," remake. I liked Andrew Niccol's, "Gattaca."  I liked "Bladerunner" and "Close Encounters."  This film was and is very appropriate and illuminating in our time.  As "Sci-Fi Horror," it puts the "Alien" and "The Terminator" series to shame.  Perhaps, it is the best video sci-fi since "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Star Wars."  That this film is not available on both Blu-ray and DVD, instead of neither, is a grave injustice to our children, our world and ourselves.
