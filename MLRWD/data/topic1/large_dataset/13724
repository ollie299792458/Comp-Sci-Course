First, I am amazed, really! Amazed at the depth and breadth of the criticism of this movie. I have never seen a review of a movie that evoked so much deeply felt emotion both pro and con, but mostly con, and, to such depth of feeling. It is truly inspiring.

Hundreds of reviewers were so moved by what Luc Besson, via Milla Jovovich did in creating this piece of interpretive entertainment that they could not control their rants till all of their feelings, both religious and intellectual were revealed.

If movies can be art and art is a means of challenging the intellect then this movie obviously is a success regardless of what, or perhaps even because of what the critics have said.

As for me, I am a huge fan of Luc Besson and now, after The 5th Element and The Messenger, Milla Jovovich as well.

Only Stanley Kubrick, to my knowledge, has a body of work with such diverse and excellent examples of his vision revealed through film.

I loved the Messenger, but perhaps for reasons that many didn't or couldn't, which is to say, I didn't take it as a literal biography of Jeanne D'arc. It seemed clear when it was named The Messenger and not "The Life and Death of Joan Of Arc". But, perhaps that's just me.

I thought Milla's performance rivaled and reminded me of the young Ingrid Bergman, (For Whom the Bell Tolls). I go so far to say that I was surprised when she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for her work. Seriously.

I suspect and hope that M. Besson will continue to challenge and entertain us for many years to come.  I further suspect that Milla will continue to be a talented actress that is unfortunately relegated to rolls of the super-heroine of the ultra-violent films that she has succeeded with so well.  I hope to see her in more rolls that reveal her talent in more benign but revealing characters.  Still I doubt she will ever achieve the heights of provocation that her Jeanne did in "The Messenger."  But then, who could?
