This is the extra-obscene version of this odd holiday film about a safe-cracking duo who pose as Santa and his elf to rob stores at Xmas.  Bernie Mac & the tall actress from Gilmore Girls have supporting roles in this story.  Will the boozing, sex fiend burglar (Billy Bob Thornton) redeem himself for a neglected, hapless child?  What about his midget partner and the midget's asian bride?  Will Bernie Mac bust their plot or muscle in on it?  This story has some original twists and of course lots of foul language, while it tries to have a warm heart below the surface that shines in the end.  Sadly, this was John Ritter's last film role, where he plays a small role as a manager at the targeted store.  The main flaw in this movie is that there are all warped characters, and many viewers will be unable to sympathize with "Santa."  Traditional Xmas films aim at leaving a warm feeling in your heart, while this film aims more at luke-warm, in my opinion.  For something really different, this film is worth watching.
