"Carrie" is one heck of a movie. It's horror and drama all wrapped up in one. Sissy Spacek plays the timid Carrie White, a girl who is tormented by her classmates, and abused by her religious fanatic mother,  Margaret (Piper Laurie). No one likes her, except for her gym teacher Miss  Collins (Betty Buckley), but after a terrible prank in the girls locker  room, one of the pranksters, Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels sorry for what  she did and asks her popular football player jock boyfriend Tommy (William  Katt) to ask Carrie to the prom. He agrees and for once, the audience is  happy for Carrie, seeing she is having a great time at the prom, but the  evil Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) decides to pull a prank on Carrie that  proves all too deadly. This film is fantastic. It is a cross between drama  (the first half) and complete horror (the second half). The weird thing is,  you really do feel sorry for Carrie! The way she is tormented by her  classmates and her mother is awful, but the viewer knows about her new  "powers" and she really makes use of them during that prom! By  the way, in case anyone is confused by this, Carrie was imagining her  classmates laughing at her, they really weren't. Based on the novel by  Stephen King, it spawned numerous imitations and was followed by a sequel  23 years later.
