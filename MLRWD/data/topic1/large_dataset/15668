This is a good example of why it's not a good idea to remake some movies.  Slapping a woman, which might have been acceptable in 1975 Italy, isn't going to fly as well in the 21st century.  Can anyone say HUMAN RIGHTS?
Remake or not, this movie could have been made without the physical abuse.  And it would have been an excellent opportunity to show true heroism--a man who's man enough NOT to hit a woman who's treated him badly.  It's a shame.  The actor is so handsome, too.  But that shot his character's appeal all to heck.  Hopefully, his next role will be more heroic.
As for Madonna, I'm surprised that such as strong woman would appear in such a demeaning role.  Unfortunately, her character didn't grow much in the end.  If she had, she would have been strong enough to figure out how to fix her marriage or else get out.  Instead, she wimped out.  Where did all that octopus-spearing strength go?
Finally, Madonna's gauntness is a excellent example of why women over 40 ought carry an extra 10 lbs.  Have a cookie, Madonna.  Better yet, have two.
