My kids watched this movie one hundred and one times. I have it memorized. Well, one day it saved a life.

My dog, Keesha, was expecting pups, and a few days early, she had the first one on my son, Kyle's bed. He was shocked and surprised, and didn't know what to do. I was out shopping for groceries. The father was asleep in front of his newspaper.

That first pup didn't move, our dog wasn't the best mother, and she didn't take care of it. My older son, Joel, upon seeing the lifeless, wet pup - and having watched "101 Dalmatians" so many times - knew exactly what to do!

He took the pup in a towel and rubbed it, bringing circulation to the wee babe's tiny body. Just like he saw the dad do on the movie! And it worked!

Four more puppies later, the mom and all the babies were in good health. thanks to my smart son and this movie!!!  Thank you Disney!

PS - I guess I should add - it is a nice Disney Classic movie - every house should have one or more. good story, good fun!!
