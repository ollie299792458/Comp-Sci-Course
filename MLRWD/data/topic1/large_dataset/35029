He gathers the old carstealing team and go steal the cars. But there is only one way to dothis, boost the cars in 1 night.  THE DVD --- The dvd is great ihave no comments about it. If you want the best version of the movieon dvd buy the region1. The menu of region1 looks far more better thenthe region2 version.  CONCLUSION --- This is a great dvd for the carlover. In this movie you see the newest cars been stolen. There is onescene that bothered me from the movie. You see Randall"Memphis" jumping over a lot of cars what looks reallyfake. But the rest of the movie was great so i still bought it.
