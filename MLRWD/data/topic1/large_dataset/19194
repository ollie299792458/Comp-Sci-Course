Not sure why I picked this film, but it turned out to be a much,much better movie than I would have guessed from the title and cover artwork. While definitely an action film on the surface, and a violent but well-done one at that, it works on several other well-balanced planes as well, maintaining its sense of intrigue, suspense and tension throughout. It's anything but ordinary. It's impossible to explain why without revealing some spoiler alerts, and since the slow unfolding of the story's complexity, the back-and-forth of the on-going, personal war between the gang boss and special police unit supervisor that is mirrored in the cat and mouse of the two moles, and the well-acted character development of the two primary characters are its key enjoyable elements, I won't spoil it for others. Let's just say it's a very well-written, directed and acted film that sets up a kind ot Tinker, Tailor double-mole intrigue plot, each mole clearly a danger to the other, trying to serve their boss without getting caught themselves, and manages to pull the whole thing off to a surprising and emotionally satifying denoument without ever falling into either cliche or melodrama. Really pulls you in and keeps you there. It doesn't rush. The sub and back stories, create well-developed and multi-dimensional characters, even the bad guys, that you get hooked on and care about. Quite surprising and unusual but believable ending that itself lifts the film to yet another whole plane in its final moments. Definitely worth the time. If someone doesn't spoil it for you, and you're not put off by having to read subtitles, you'll be very pleasantly surprised!
