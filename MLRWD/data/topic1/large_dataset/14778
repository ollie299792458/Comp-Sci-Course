The third season of the gripping drama Nip/Tuck is now available on DVD. The third season definitely started out with high drama. As the season begins, Christian is dealing with the trauma of his attack from the Carver. The emotional scars run much deeper than the physical scars. Sean has his own trauma to deal with-Julia is seeking a divorce. Christian on the other hand makes step toward matrimony by proposing to Kimber. Personal problems aside, time comes to deal with the patients. The first major case of the third season is that of a morbidly obese woman whose skin becomes fused to her couch.

The third season of Nip/Tuck is as dramatic and intense as previous seasons. The ongoing storyline of The Carver continues with Christian even being suspected of being the Carver at one point during the season. The obese lady on the couch made headlines for Nip/Tuck due to it's ripped from the headlines nature but there were other ripped from the headlines procedures explored during the shows third season. The surgeons also pursued giving a woman a face transplant.

The personal and professional drama of the third season were as important to the show as the patients.

Nip/Tuck Season 3, the DVD box set, features 15 episodes on six DVD's with a running time of 723 minutes.
