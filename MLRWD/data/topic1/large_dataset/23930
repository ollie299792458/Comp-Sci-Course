I bought this used in a video store today and the tape freezed up on me 2/3 of the way thru the movie. I am now ordering the DVD on Amazon because I opened (read: broke open) the videotape up in a futile attempt to fix the problem and see the end of the film tonight because I was so enthralled by the story. Drat, I couldn't fix it.

Yes, the story builds a bit slow, but this is a really interesting story based on a true WWII attack. Without giving away the plot, it is highly believable that a minor character, an Indian national was working with the Nazis against the British because he saw this as a way to get independence for India - and/or vent his hatred of Britian. What the Nazis would would have done to the dark skinned Indians had they won the war is another story. But even if you don't know that piece of history, you can get the story (ok, you know it now). The story flows. I can't wait to see the ending and how all characters resolve their issues - as well as how the attack goes down.
