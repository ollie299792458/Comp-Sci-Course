While it doesn't have quite as cohesive a plot or reach the depths of characterization achieved in Kang's 2004 masterpiece, "Tae Guk Gi," the whole fascinating WWII odyssey of Jun-shik Kim makes "My Way" an exquisitely unique film. The irony of how the Korean Kim--ably played by Dong-gun Jang, who also starred in "Tae Guk Gi"--is forced to labor, fight, and ultimately expected to die for a succession of three not-so-different nations, none of which are his own and none of which inspire any particular loyalty, is not lost here.

Despite some abrupt transitions and a few unlikely details, the general cinematography is excellent and, particularly during the Siberian segment, includes some very arresting scenery. Without distractive moralizing, the film touches upon a number of different themes such as that of individuality over nationality and, most importantly of all, how the bitter enmity and competition between Kim and the aristocratic Japanese officer Tatsuo becomes a friendship when they are faced with using their common ability (running) to get home (another important motif in this film).

Over the last three decades or so, the general movie-making trend has been to portray war as starkly and realistically as it can be shown on screen. "My Way" is dominated by scenes of men being blown apart and run over by tanks; in this regard, it outdoes any American effort such as "Flags of Our Fathers" or "Saving Private Ryan." Thus, one of its biggest strengths could also be its biggest weakness: The pervasive battle footage is disturbing to the point where it's just plain hard to watch. .  . but isn't that how it should be?
