ok, i will start with the truth:
i.dont.read.the.manga.
there, i said it.
BUT i watch too much anime.  really. i should probably stop.
so therefore my opinion matters (dangit)

Now, on to the review -

just kidding, i am not going to spew my opinions at you, but i will say this:
this is kind of good.  i mean, i looooooved the first series and everyone and their mom blabs on and on about how this one is sooo much better and its truer to the manga and yippy yah doo dow etc.
the first series (watch that instead or at least first) is a little slower paced and has a little less action, but it has an immeasurable amount of story and emotional drama, twists and reveals.
this one kind of throws everything at you and doesnt give you a reason to give a crap about any of the characters.  it is pretty though.  and the action is awesome.

i cant write out what i want to say exactly, but...if youre a fan of the first series, this is a neat addition.  if youre just starting out on this story...i dont know, i would say skip this incarnation.
