One of the last great movie westerns, Richard Brooks' marvelous BITE THE BULLET looks simply spectacular in high-def, with Twilight Time's Blu-Ray flawlessly preserving the dimensions of its original Panavision aspect ratio -- and the gorgeous scope cinematography of Harry Stradling, Jr.

Gene Hackman, James Coburn, Candice Bergen (in a subplot that doesn't provide much of a payoff), Ian Bannen, Ben Johnson, and Jan-Michael Vincent are contestants in a turn-of-the-century, 700-mile cross-country race that takes its toll on both participants and their horses. The plot is familiar, but the performances and Brooks' direction make the material fresh, aided considerably by scenic locales and an outstanding Alex North score.

While "Bite the Bullet" is humorous and entertaining throughout, the film also feels like a sometimes-uneasy mix of old-fashioned filmmaking with `70s "realism": the graphic scenes of horses breaking down are powerful, and give the film an edge that earlier Saturday matinee-type fare lacked (it's a credit to Brooks that the horses in the film were, according to him, not injured by the stunts shown in the picture).

As long as you're prepared for the occasional disparity in tone, the picture is just marvelous, featuring a rousing (and satisfying) ending, great southwestern locations, and appealing performances by a game cast. From one of Hackman's best roles to North's scoring, "Bite the Bullet" is a Blu-Ray must for western aficionados.

Another phenomenal presentation from Sony's Columbia vaults, "Bite the Bullet" looks dazzling on Blu-Ray: the DNR-free, 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers fine details, lush colors and exceptional clarity. Even better, the film's original mono recording has been brilliantly remixed to a 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack that enhances every aspect of North's score far beyond the limited parameters of its original audio. The trailer, Kirgo's booklet notes, and an isolated score track, assembled as always by the great Mike Matessino, put a cap on one of the year's best BD catalog titles to date.
