This is an incredible, serious, and beautiful film.  The imagery is astounding and often thought-provoking.  The music is also great and matches the film very well -- if you like Peter Gabriel's "Passion" (the instrumental soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ), you will like the score for Baraka.
I disagree with the reviewer who said that Baraka is just an imitation of Koyaanisqatsi.  If you'd bother to read the credits, Ron Fricke (the creator of Baraka) was also responsible for ALL of the filming for the -qatsi trilogy (which includes Koyaanisqatsi).  Baraka is a different kind of movie, with a different, more subtly communicated message.
Baraka was shot in the (very expensive) 70mm format, which yields a very high quality picture, especially when transferred to DVD.  Ron Fricke is a master of the 70mm format, and he actually designed many of the camera rigs used in Baraka (including the very high quality time lapse footage).  Give Fricke some credit for having learned something in the almost 10 years since Koyaanisqatsi was filmed.
If you are expecting vapid, New Age eye candy, this is not the movie for you.  If you want a beautiful film that will change you, a film that you can watch again every 6 months without getting tired of it, then buy this DVD.  I have the original DVD (very hapy with it), so I can't say whether the film transfer quality in the Collector's Edition is on par.  Maybe one of these days I'll buy the Collector's Edition and see which one I like best.
