This is somewhat different from the other Jackie Chan movies that I have seen.  For starters it's basically a romantic comedy with martial arts added.  The humor is pretty foreign to us westerners, but is pretty funny nonetheless (the boy who buys Bu an "engagement oyster" for example, and the scene with Bu in the fridge was pretty funny too).  But additionally its more than that.  It's also about the nature of rivalry, emnity, and eventual friendship between Chan and one of his business competitors.  The film manages to capture a certain depth of human nature which is unusual in the genre.

The fight scenes fall into two categories.  The first are the classic Jackie Chan type fight scenes.  These include the boat scene, him taking on the four goons with baseball bats, and so forth.  The second are the scenes with the American street fighter which are of an altogether different variety and something I am not used to seeing in his movies.  Here we see some cross-over between western boxing and kung fu, beautifully choreographed, with plenty of surprises.  These scenes emphasize fair play, respect, and sportsmanship.

The film is well worth watching, and is suitable for family viewing.

Both Jackie Chan and Shu Qi play their roles very well.  Highly recommended.
