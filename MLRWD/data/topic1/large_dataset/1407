The film gets straight into it and within minutes you are up to date with the current ongoings in johannesburg. I really, really enjoyed this film as I do love sci-fi movies. But I do think there is 1 unanswered question straight from the start which contnues to the end unanswered. It begins with a spaceship hovering over johannesburg, however when the movie ends the question still remains - why did they come! Anyway apart from that small niggling curiosity what can I say.... Exceptional. CGI is excellent, the main actor says F**k alot, and then theres the advanced alien weapons... yes advanced alien weapons, which eventually we get a taste of what they can do....all of them. And to top it off, advanced robotic body armor, with all the trimmings.

The movies storyline is basic enough, aliens arrive, we take them in as refugees, exploit them, one man gets infected and begins mutating and it then revolves around that.  I got the blu-ray version and I have to say it is well worth it. I gave this film a 5star rating as it has all of what I could ever want.... aliens - on earth, spaceships, advanced weapons, excellent CGI and most of all, in all probability.... a sequel !! And possible a pre-quel !!
