Even though this movie is definitely not for children, watching this movie was a life changing event for me when I first saw it and it still speaks to the young boy inside of me every time I watch it now. What can I say? The art is fantastic and the stories are funny and definitely fulfill the childlike fantasy in all of us to become something bigger and better than ourselves. I believe that though we all grow up we shouldn't stray too far from the child in all of us, or for me, the adolescent boy in all of us, and this movie definitely helps with that. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a nerdy little kid in his bedroom who suddenly gets hoisted to another dimension where he is a strong superhero and gets alot of chicks? Also, I believe that Taarna the Tarakian may be the sexiest woman ever to be created by an animator's pencil. So, definitely buy this movie. You will not be disappointed. To boot, there is a beautiful score written by Elmer Bernstein, one of my favorite Hollywood composers along with a soundtrack featuring artists from Sammy Hagar to Black Sabbath to Cheap Trick and Grand Funk Railroad. If you like this movie, you should definitely look into Heavy Metal Magazine, from which this movie is based. The art in this magazine is impeccable and the comics are highly entertaining. I would look into finding some back issues along with getting a subscription. The comics from the 70's and 80's are definitely some of the best.
