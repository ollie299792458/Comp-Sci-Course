Set in the future of 2078 off-world, the film opens with a haggard Col. Joseph Hendrickson (played by Peter Weller.  While perhaps not his best performance, Mr. Weller is more than up for this Sci-Fi fare.  He lacks the intensity you saw in films Laviathan, and Robocop.  No matter.  Anchored by the beautiful Jennifer Rubin, and Roy Dupuis, the film has more than enough acting talent to make any film-goer eager for more.  The story carries enough weight to keep you guessing, and has more than enough intrige.

Roy Dupuis is great as the sometimes over-the-top worrior/screamer-android.  To turly see his range, view his performance in the film Bleeders (with Rutger Hauer).  Roy is definately an actor I would like to see more of.

Jennfer Rubin.  What more can anyone say.  Super-model turned actress.  She is beautiful, smart, and a complete joy to watch.  While her role in this film requires much less of her talents, She does make the film worthwile.  She more of her in The Wasp Woman, or The Crush.  At her best in each film.

For all Sci-Fi fans, Screamers belongs in your collection.  Great Sci-Fi fare that does not rely on million dollar special effects to complete the story.  The human story is what matters here.
