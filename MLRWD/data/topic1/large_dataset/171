This is the worst of the five adaptations of Pride and Prejudice that I have seen. The main faults are the script, the direction, the miscasting of Greer Garson and Maureen O'Sullivan and the costumes.

The first two flaws result in Lord Olivier, otherwise a very authoritative actor, not knowing if he is Mr Darcy or Bertie Wooster and winding up vacillating in the manner of Jekyll and Hyde! One minute he is a monocle-twirling upper class twit and the next a reasonably intelligent Mr Darcy making friends with Elizabeth, then the snobbish fop again, letting her down. This bears no resemblance to my favourite and frequently read book.

Greer Garson, clearly older and with a classical and calm beauty, should have played the serene, just Jane not the lovely, lively Lizzie. This part should have gone to the much more vivacious and pertly pretty Maureen O'Sullivan, who actually has the dark, sparkling eyes which Mr Darcy describes as "fine" to the chagrin of Miss Bingley. The dramatic dynamic of most scenes between the two sisters and many between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, is thrown askew by this reversal of roles.

The costumes are not only horrible and overdone but completely wrong for the period. They belong in a Victorian melodrama not a Georgian comedy of manners (not mannerisms as this often is.)

I was happier with the last part of the film, Olivier seemed to have control of his character by then and it was closer to the book. The director was better with The Firefly, which I quite enjoyed. However it was Pride and Prejudice, not a weak story needing violence and equally sickening sentimentality to keep going, so I have given it three stars. If, unlike me, you only  buy one version not all of them, don't buy this one. The 1995 BBC/A&E adaptation is infinitely superior.
