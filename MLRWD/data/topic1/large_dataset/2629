I used to think everything David Lynch produced was gold (including Dune) but now realize Lynch, aside from bits of "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet", "Twin Peaks" and "The Straight Story", is primarily a pretty weak avant-garde filmmaker and an even worse Hollywood director.

His ability at sound design is superb and when his intuition is working, it's admittedly fascinating, but you can only go so far on intuition.  "Dumbland" is a good example of this talent gone awry, or astray. It's reminiscent of his worst (and generally his shortest): - "The Alphabet", "The Grandmother", "The Amputee", "The Cowboy and the Frenchman", "Industrial Symphony No. 1", "On the Air", and "Rabbits" . . . "Dumbland" is a bad joke that plays and stays like a bad joke.

It's hard to reconcile this with the same imagination that gave birth to "Twin Peaks" (at least the first season), but here it is . . . I left Lynch behind with my adolescence for a reason, much as I have been left behind by "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive".

From what I have read / seen of "Inland Empire" it appears that the dreck continues to accumulate.  One can only hope that Lynch will deliver himself from the wreckage of his career by producing something as audacious and electrifying as "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Twin Peaks" once again, or at least something as human and transcendent as "The Straight Story".  Like a Dylan concert, when Lynch is on watch it and when he's off, watch out.
