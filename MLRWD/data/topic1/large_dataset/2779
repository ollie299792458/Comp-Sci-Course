I've always been a fan of the movie Scarface. One day, a group of my friends and I were thinking about memorable scenes from various movies. Most movies have one or two memorable scenes.  Scarface has a BUNCH!  I can think of 10 monster scenes from this movie at a moment's notice.  I've bought this movie on VHS, LaserDisc, DVD, and now Blu Ray.

When I buy Blu Ray, I look for new information about the making of the movie, and I look for really hot deleted scenes that were cut from the movie in order to maintain an R rating.

With Scarface, I guess all of the hot scenes made it into the Directors Cut, and they weren't so hot.  And I was disappointed that more wasn't said about the making of this classic movie. The Blu Ray release of Troy is my benchmark for additional information on the making of the movie.

So, while I love this movie, and the Blu Ray version has marginal picture quality improvement, I'm glad that I didn't pay $20 for it.

It did contain a copy of the original Scarface movie starring Paul Munni, as I recall it.  I have not finished watching that version.
