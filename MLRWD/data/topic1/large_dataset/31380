Hombre (1967)

Hombre (1967) staring Paul Newman as John Russell is one of my favorite westerns.  It is based on the book by the same name written by Leonard Elmore.

In it Russell a blue-eyed white raised in part by a white man, then by the Indians, inherits a house in town.

He boards a stagecoach and tries to sit with the Whites inside, but the Whites don't want to have anything to do with him.  He is asked to ride up top (kind of like sitting in the back of the bus).  Later on the stagecoach is robbed by several white men and a Mexican.  Russell manages to shoot one of the White men and recover the gold stolen by the Indian Agent riding inside the stagecoach.  The Whites are only too glad to walk with Russell now, but wouldn't ride with him before.

*************SPOILER ALERT******************************

In The end Russell kills the banditos trailing the party and the Mexican asks with his dying breath, "What was his name"?  He'd been calling him Hombre up to that point which is Spanish for Man.  The Mexican thought of Russell as a Man even if the Whites did not.
