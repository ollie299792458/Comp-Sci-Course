Long ago, a janitor named Cropsy was burned horribly by a bad prank that went wrong leaving him disfigured. Five years later, he comes back to the same camp where he worked as now he seeks revenge with a huge pair of shears  which he uses to cut his victims in pieces with it but can the campers survive a vacation to hell?

Entertaining and gory to the max slasher movie that is one of the most overlooked slasher movies ever! Tom Savini's make-up effects are mindblowing even by today's standards as i think he is the master of all make-up artists. The film co-stars Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander before their major film careers, there's some incredible graphic violence such as the infamous raft massacre sequence with more of the gore that was cut out and restored on this DVD. The music score is quite chilling as well, it's not for the faint of heart but a must have for fans of "Sleepaway Camp" and "Friday The 13th" alike.

The DVD has some cool extras like two featurettes especially on Tom Savini's make-up effects, photo gallery and a trailer.
