This set is definitely a must have for any Bret Hart or wrestling fan!! The documentary alone gives you a behind the scenes look at The Hitman's entire career, in his own words. HOWEVER BE WARNED, the matches in this set were "hand-picked" by Bret Hart himself and it is clear that Bret was less then objective when selecting his "best" matches. Most of the matches included are with people that are close to Bret (Several matches with Owen Hart & British Bulldog). I understand why Bret would pick these matches, especially in light of his tragic losses, but they don't necessarily represent his best or most influential matches. The most noticeable omission from the set is his infamous title match with Shawn Michaels which led to his falling out with Vince McMahon and the WWE. It seems as though Bret agreed to do the set only if he could completely have control over its contents. This is pure speculation but it seems to me that if Vince had his say so, the Shawn Michaels match would definitely have been included. On a positive note, during the documentary portion footage from this match is included and Bret does talk about the events that led him to part ways with the WWE. All in all, this is still the most comprehensive DVD set on The Hitman and should definitely be a part of your wrestling library.
