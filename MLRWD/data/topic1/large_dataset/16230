Man, Dougray Scott looks sexy and intense in this movie! I loved him and the beautiful, swan necked, glamorous blonde Saffron Burrows. She's like a walking dream in all that war and gloom. The movie is fair to her character, and that's something you don't see every day. Those in the picture who look down on her are viewed with comtempt, as they should be.
I like the spy game and I think all the twists and turns are all very unexpected and keep you on your toes.
I do think, though, that they didn't have to turn Kate Winslet into the opposite of beauty just to prove that she can or to make the blonde venus more striking. Dressing her up like that distracts the viewer from the movie, by begging us to focus on how well she's pretending to be ugly - which may have been the very vain motive indeed behind that decision. You know, Kate not wanting to be seen as just a sexy actress and all that. No one denies her talent. One can be unglamorous without being horrid and in this case it just attracts the wrong kind of attention.
Absolutely worth watching.
