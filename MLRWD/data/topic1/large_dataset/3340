I have loved this movie since I was a child, because it has incredible visual effects for the 80's. This movie was panned by the critics, but I feel that any true DC fan or fan of the superman legend must own it. The plot is interesting and the villains are a big hokey, but I found Helen Slater's performance of a visitor to earth, new to her powers absolutely captivating. The flying is so real, because Slater truly acts the way we all imagine we would if we suddenly had the power to fly. Her performance is amazing, the effects are awesome, and the story is unique. It's a true spin off, but it ties into the superman legend quite masterfully.

  Plot: Kara is the cousin of Kal El (Superman) living in a sister city to Krypton called Argo city. Argo city is powered by two great objects, one of which is called the Omega Hedron. Kara and her mentor Zaltar lose the Omega Hedron, which condemns Argo City to slowly dying from lack of oxygen and power. Motivated by guilt and a sense of Responsibility, Kara steals Zaltar's spaceship and travels to earth where the Omega Hedron has fallen into the hands of an ameteur witch named Selina. Selina uses the Omega Hedron to fuel her spells and become all-powerful. Supergirl must track down the Omega Hedron and take it from Selina before Argo City dies.
