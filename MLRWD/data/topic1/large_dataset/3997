When I was a little kid, Psycho scared the living daylights out of me. It didn't make me afraid of showers so much but afraid of lonely roadside motels.  Psycho is the forerunner of the modern horror movie. If not for  this movie, we wouldn't have all the other movies such as Halloween and  Scream. I just watched this with my girlfriend the other day. She was  totally blown away. She gasped and covered her eyes and had her mouth  hanging open when she discovered Norman's secret. I noticed a few people  put some bad reviews of Psycho on here. Now they have a right to their  opinion but come on! Psycho has terrible acting?  Give me a break! If this  isn't good acting then what is?  Besides there are only a few bad reviews  of this classic movie. As much as these unenlightened people want to  denounce Psycho they cant erase the fact that it has stood for 40 years now  as a classic thriller. Now the majority isnt always right but when it comes  to movies they usually are. And if Psycho is a bad movie with terrible  acting, then how come EVERY single professional critic I look up gave  Psycho their highest rating? Even Leonard Maltin did who is a very picky  critic. Sorry, Negative Nancys but they didnt get to be professionals by  giving good reviews to bad movies. Psycho lives on. And if you dont like it  go watch I Know What You Did Last Summer.
