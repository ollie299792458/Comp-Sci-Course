This was an okay movie as sports movies go.  It was enjoyable to watch the support Cain and most of the teammates gave the young man with Asperger's.  It was painful to watch the stupidity and outright meanness of teammates, one in particular, who did not support him.  I hate bullies, and this one was the worst kind.  I might have rated the film a 4 if the young man's Autism had been more completely portrayed.  I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I noticed that Shroeder's character always made eye contact with those he talked with.  I've worked as a one-on-one teacher's aide with boys with Asperger's for a few years now and the boys I spend time with rarely make eye contact.  Even when you lift their chins and tell them to look at your eyes, they always look slightly off to the side, avoiding your eyes.  There may be exceptions to the rule, but I feel that if you're going to make a film focused on a character with Autism, that character should be an example of the norm, not the exception.  I also feel that the movie did not display the characteristic "tunnel vision" or narrow focus aspect of Asperger's/Autism as a dominant aspect of the young man's nature.
