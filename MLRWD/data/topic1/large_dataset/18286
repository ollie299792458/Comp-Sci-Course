I always have this disconcerting bafflement and not a little bit of annoyance whenever I teach my "Comedy Unit #1" to my sophomore English students.  I wrap my "Comedy Unit" in a cloak of pseudo-science so that I can watch funny stuff while being able to justify it to the administration (should they walk in when I am showing a clip from "Young Frankenstein").  I make the students write a definition essay at the end, "What is Comedy?" as part of our state curriculum requirements. Anyway........we study the various types of comedy: slapstick, parody,satire, scatological, etc.  Then as an example of a movie that incorporates almost every type of comedy, I show "Monty Python and the..."  I still find it hilarious and as I watch it over and over again, I am struck anew each time when I see how smart it is.  Here's my question:  I see each year that the smarter the kid the harder they laugh.  I don't mean to sound elitist but my honors classes hoot and holler.  My "general" students, who are proud of having read "a" book in middle school, sometimes laugh at the slapstick and then there are a significant number who mutter the whole time, "This is so stupid, why are we watching this? This is stupid....and so on." I start to get fed up after the first two mutters because:  1) They could be deconstructing *War and Peace* if I was in a really bad mood and  2) I love this movie.  I warn them ahead of time that they might not "get" all of the satire (peasant/king political debate) but how can you resist a line about a moist bit throwing scimitars at you  or a watery tart etc.  This movie is very, very smart and very, very funny.  Anyway, I propose we throw out the traditional IQ test and show this to high schoolers to assess their intelligence or at least intellectual potential.  How can you not love this movie?  Someone please tell me how to respond to those unfortunates who "don't get it".
