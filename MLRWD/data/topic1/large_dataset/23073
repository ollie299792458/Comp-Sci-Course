Michael Jai White is definitely handsome to me.  I've only seen one or two of his movies even though I am a big martial arts fan.  This movie changed all that.  A friend brought the movie over and said "Check it out, give it back to me when you've finished watching it." So I watched it and then I had my daughter who's 20 watch it with me. She doesn't usually like these kinds of movies, but even she liked it.  Honestly, when I finished watching this movie the first thing I did was go in my bedroom, got on the computer and purchased it. Seriously, that's how good it was to me.

The added bonus for me is that Eamonn Walker was in it and I do like his work.  Julian Sands who I haven't seen a lot lately is in this movie as well.  This movie in a nutshell takes place in Los Angeles where ex-con (Michael Jai White) takes the underground fighting world by storm in his quest to fulfill a promise to a dead friend. I liked it because it wasn't immediately revealed why he went into underground fighting it takes a while before the reason unfolds so it keeps you engaged. .not to mention the awesome fight scenes.  I definitely recommend this movie!
