One brilliant choreographer, Jerome Robbins, and two brilliant composers/lyricists, Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, had the idea of modernizing Romeo and Juliet.  Instead of being the children of two rival families, the ill-fated lovers would be connected to two rival gangs; Tony is a disenchanted former member of the Jets, an American-born gang, and Maria is the sister of the leader of the Sharks, a gang of Puerto-Rican immigrants and rivals to the Jets.

This musical, of course, would have to deal with topics that had been off-limits in frothy, feel-good musicals; gang violence, racism/anti-immigrant predjudice, murder, and one scene of attempted rape.  In lesser hands, there is simply no way that a musical about the nastier side of life could have worked.

Thankfully, West Side Story was NOT in lesser hands, when it came to the people behind or in front of the camera.  The music and choreography were brilliant and did not detract from the subject matter or make it seem silly, and the performances/dancing were second to none.  If you have not seen this yet, by all means, you owe it to yourself, whether you are a fan of musicals or not.  It is, plain and simple, one of the best films that has ever been or will ever be made.  Feast your eyes and ears and keep the Kleenex handy.

Cheers.
