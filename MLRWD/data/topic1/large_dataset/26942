My mom bought this for me when I was pregnant with my first child. I thought she was crazy and this would be a load of bull. Then my son was born and I was desperate for anything to understand the crying, what I could do to help him. My son made the exact noises on the video and we learned to better read him. I lent the dvds out to a few friends in the years since and each one thought I was crazy (more their husbands) but each and every one returned the dvds with a hugely positive review stating they can better understand their child. Here's my interpretation of it- in the days/weeks/months following giving birth, anything that makes you more confident as a parent and a new caretaker is worth it! I believe that these dvds made me a more confident parent and as a result, my child became more relaxed since I was. I felt like I had some control over the chaos of newborn life, thanks entirely to these dvds. Yes they are pricey, yes you will have the ppl who don't want to believe. But for me, it was the best thing ever (besides my son of course).
