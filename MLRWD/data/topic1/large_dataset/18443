I recently bought all three of the DVD's. The first one teaches the sounds of the alphebet which is really cute. My granddaughter, age 5, who is in Kindergarden, knew her ABC's but not her phonics.  Within three weeks of watching these dvd's she is reading short little books and wanting to spell!  These are her favorite dvd's that she requests to watch as soon as she wakes up.  She would wake up in the morning, when spending the night, and start sounding things out and then ask to watch the dvd's.  She is so proud of herself because she is able to sound out words and read.  She is so excited about reading when four months ago, when I moved to be close to her, she hated school and wanted nothing to do with reading because, as she told me, it was too hard.  Now she can't wait to crawl up by me and read the scholastic books I bought for my other granddaughter (whom I am rasing.) The granddaughter I am rasing was reading at age 4 (She was reading to her preschool class and they kids thought she was amazing, she is now in First grade and reading at a Third grade reading level).  Phonics is the best way to begin to teach reading, before sight words, and increase your child's self-esteem and give them a head start so they know what is going on when they get to school.  Lots of praise from the parent also helps to encourage them that it is important.  Leap Frog DVD's are excellent tools, if not the best I have ever used!
