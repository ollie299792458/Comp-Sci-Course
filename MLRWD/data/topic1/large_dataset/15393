I am an Allman Brothers Band fan from back in the Fillmore East days where I saw them close the place. Over the years I have grown to love the guitar play that became the soundtrack for some of the times of my life. Thus I consider myself a sort of expert on the band as much as a fan can be. Recently, like others I am sure, I was put off by the departure of Dicky Betts and sub conscientiously relegated the band to the back burner. Then one night I decided to checkout "Live at the Beacon" figuring I might like it. The show hit me like a ton of bricks. The Band has rejuvenated itself. The performance level of the band is as good as it has ever been. The return of Warren Haynes combined with Derek Trucks creates a tightness and a flow that has to be seen in addition to being heard. The band continues to excel live with the new material creating a dimension never before reached. For you purists, like myself, the usage of the horns is an enhancement that supplements the listening experience without overpowering the sound. The disc 2 bonus stuff featuring the acoustic rehearsal of "Old Friend" just added to the overall quality of the set. If you have enjoyed the Allmans in the past you will love this DVD.
