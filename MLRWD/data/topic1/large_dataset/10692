What can I say about a movie that has had everything said about it?! Everything good, that is. I can only rehash and re-glorify the greatest war movie I've ever seen!! Great characters, gripping story, and memorable music. What more could you want?
 It's been told an re-told on here so many times, I can't say anymore than anyone else on here.
 POW's, desperate for any way to escape (which includes trying to mingle in a crowd of Russian prisoners in the beginning. SO GOOD!!!), are restationed at U-know-where. Little do their German capturers know what a mistake they have made, bringing together the finest escape team ever! (in uh, my predijuiced opinion!!).  Filled with action, drama and a fine dose of soldier guy humor, this movie can never be over-watched!
 'Cooler King' Hilts, Big X Bartlett (the major mind behind this big dig...), Danny 'Tunnel King' Volinski and so many more characters you just have to care about!!
 I just can't, and really shouldn't bother trying to exalt this movie to it's fullest, because it's already been done! This is back when REAL men were actors, (ugh, 'Hilts', 'Danny' and 'Hendley'? All portrayed by hunky men? Can you find guys who even look a millimeter as handsome as those guys did these days?!). Can any fan of GE picture Tom Cruise playing the part of 'Danny'? Oh the picture bring riotous laughs. Brad Pitt as 'Hilts'? Heaven forbid. Those guys are all wimps. Take a look at this movie, besides the fact that this story and the whole entire thing is better than anything you find today, the men depicted are real manly men, not these fairies parading around. But besides my dislike of those afore mentioned stars, just read the other reviews, you'll understand by the time your done, you shouldn't be sitting here reading this!! BUY THE VIDEO!!!! Nearly zilch for bad language, and nothin' towards violence, this is just a fantastic film.
