Barry Henley lacks the presence of Edward James Olmos, Gina doesn't have as big a role as the character did in the series, and I missed Izzy, but there's a lot to like for fans of the original "Vice" tv series. Director Michael Mann has updated for the new millennium with heavier weaponry, cool gadgets, and a better story than he could show on tv almost two decades later. Would have been nice if some original cast members could have had cameos or reprised their roles.

Detectives Sonny and Rico are undercover (a la "Smuggler's Blues") to catch a drug kingpin and a leak from their side of the fence. Sonny gets in over his head with the beautiful dealer Isabella; Rico and Trudy (a couple in this screen version) deal with their relationship as lovers as well as fellow officers and Trudy's kidnapping by enemy bikers.

The story itself is great, the production values of course exceed anything that could have been shown on tv in the 80s, and anybody who likes crime and suspense movies will be entertained by "Miami Vice." Fans of the old series won't find much, if anything, to complain about.

The updated "In The Air Tonight" on the way to the showdown was a nice touch that old fans will appreciate.
