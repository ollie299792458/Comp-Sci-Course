The Fox and the Hound, Disney's 24th animated feature length film, reached new strengths. The studio went for a topic that many people overlook- The importance of friendship in a darkness where in reality, you're supposed to be enemies. The story is based on Daniel Mannix's novel of the same name. Although it's slightly along the same story line, the book is in fact quite different from the Disney film. The book focuses on Tod's life in the forest, and is told through his and Copper's point of view. Unlike in the movie, Tod and Copper never met and never chose to form a friendship at a young age. Amos Slade, a hunter and Copper's master, has Copper trained to be a hunting dog to catch Tod. This part is similar in the movie.

The Fox and the Hound has some of the Disney studio's best artwork and animal characters. It balances out action, comedy, adventure and romance. It's one of Disney's rarer films, along with Song of the South, and should be viewed by anyone who loves the idea of a strong friendship.
