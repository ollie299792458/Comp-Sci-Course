If you're a fan of the original Blair Witch Project, please don't bother ruining your day by watching this one. It's just a waste of money for the producers. I really can't believe that someone can ruin this great idea that we see in the original. The original idea of filming only from the character's point of view is almost complitely lost; and even the scenes where we see this technique, it's so stupidly filmed. And what's with all these naked scenes; we never saw them in the original and it was still great, because we actually didn't care about the sex, but about the fact that we were scared of something that we couldn't see or touch. During the film, and after that (for days in my case) I was scared to go out alone at night, and I'm living near a wood, so imagina my fear...
As a conclusion I just want to say that if you really want to see Book of Shadows- Blair Witch 2, you should do it. You'll see some of the techniques used in Memento and Blair Witch Project, but actually it's not something that you can waste around hour and a half of your life for.
Apologise to those who may feel offended by this review, but this is my point of view.
