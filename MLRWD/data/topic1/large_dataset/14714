That is the question a lot of my friends, family, and co-workers asked me after having seen this movie and not realising who had written it. Being a Stephen King fan and loving the book, I had to see this movie. And it was worth it. It is better than Shawshank Redemption (My dads words as Shawshank was his favorite movie until The Green Mile).
Tom Hanks is remarkable as always, but the real pleasure of this movie was no doubt Michael Clarke Duncan who was incredible. He showed he can cover a wide range of emotions and played the role as perfect as King had written it.
There are some gruesome, funny, and lighthearted scenes throughout that make this movie one of the best I have ever seen. This movie is a keeper and I definitely recommend this for all (as long as your of age).
There was only one bad thing about this movie (though I didn't let it hurt my rating) and that was the Widescreen version. It takes up 25-35% of the sreeen with black on the top and the bottom of the screen. As I am finding out, most DVD's seem to come this way. Why is that?
But this movie now. You won't be disappointed.
