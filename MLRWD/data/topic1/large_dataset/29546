I first watched This is England after the video case caught my eye at a local rental store.  I fell in love with the film and now consider it my favorite movie for both what it does and doesn't do.

This is England is one of the greatest efforts I've yet discovered to completely capture a time and place.  Admittedly I'm an American who never visited 1980s Britain, but the film's gritty yet poignant visuals of urban decay and anti-authority fashion make This is England's self-contained world fascinating and engrossing.

The story of Shaun coming of age in a time and place where love is scarce and comes in sometimes horrific forms is fascinating and told with remarkable restraint.  Beautiful performances make every character, no matter how minor, believable and fascinating.  Shaun comes of age in a way that displays his own turbulence while never losing sight of the ugliness of those already living in the adult world of war and hatred.

This is England is ambitions without being overly contrived.  It tells a small story very well, and takes a very un-pretty idea and makes it immensely compelling.
