I reluctantly bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend as I knew she was going to make me watch it- I wasn'y thrilled with the idea, but I hade her watch LOST, Dexter, Breaking Bad and Fringe with me (and she ended up liking them all), so I didn't really have too much to argue against. I owed it to her to at least give it a shot.

I'm glad I did. It's actually a good show. I have some nitpicks, but I have to accept the fact that it is a musical and look past them (specifically the football episode). We haven't finished the season yet, but we're halfway through. Love the dialog and characters. My only complaint isn't with the quality of the show- but the Blu-ray menu's. They take FOREVER to load. I'm sure there are tons of reviews mentioning this fact, but I still have to rant about it.

In the end, it's not too much of a hassle- just boot it up 5 minutes before you think your gonna be ready to actually watch any episodes. It's a minor inconvenience, but I'm an easy one to forgive-and-forget when it comes to little things like that. It's not enough for me to deduct a star. Although, if I could, I would deduct half of one though!
