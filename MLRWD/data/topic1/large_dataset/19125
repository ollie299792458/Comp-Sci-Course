Okay, yes. The original mini-series is sacred; it was brilliant. But Final Battle, though the writing and depth was not quite as refined as that of the original, was undeniably entertaining. Firstly, we get a continuation of Willie's (Englund) story, which, I admit, was the initial reason I started by now expansive V collection. The secondary story involving him and his girlfriend, Harmony, was endearing and a nice break from the other dramas and action-packed sequences.
Then we meet Ham Tyler, who looks and acts like the bastard child of Jack Nicholson and Hugo Weaving. I was completely in awe of this guy, and he was almost instantly by second favourite character, only a hairs-breadth below Willie.
As far as Sci-Fi goes, it's a great, entertaining series that I recommend with a passion. It's among the greats, like the first three Star Trek series, the original Dr. Who's, Space:1999, and the like.

Definitely check this series out, it's a must have for any Sci-Fi fan!
