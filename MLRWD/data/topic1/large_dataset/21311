This film is such a pleasant surprise!

It is so real and relatable.  I was so invested in the characters that it was disappointing that it had to end.  There is so much left to explore!  The modern American woman finds a modern French man so refreshing compared to her American dating experience.  He is much more fulfilling to be with because he is straight forward, passionate, and accepting, almost to the point that she wonders if she is special to him.  We still don't really know the answer to that!  I think the sequel could show us that he still has plenty to teach Nora, that she is special and a match to him, something he knew instinctively.  Maybe we can learn he is a little broken in some way too and Nora fulfills that part of him.

I also like the message that not all European men are pigs.  Julian seems like he might even be ready to settle down and focus all of his energy and passion on Nora. The ending is a brilliant scene, it appears so simple, but because we have seen Nora's journey we realize what a comfort and life changing moment it is for her.  The modern woman surrenders to knowing she can trust and love.
