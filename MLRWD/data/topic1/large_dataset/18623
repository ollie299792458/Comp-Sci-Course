About two years ago, I sat in the first row of a hushed and silent theater watching a stage play titled RABBIT HOLE. This is a very sophisticated and powerful story. Sophisticated in that it doesn't ask you to merely cry for what is obvious tragedy - the accidental death of a 4 year old - It asks you to understand the now dreadful existence of that child's parents and to see through their eyes. It doesn't hide behind cheap emotion. The family's pain is there, in front of you for all to see and the mother and father are barely dealing with it. they don't run around in sackcloth and wailing and weeping. But they aren't living life. They are still in the depths of sorrow and mourning. They walk like real people. They joke like real people. But they aren't living. There isn't a stunning revelation that brings understanding and reconciliation for any of these folk. Nothing that brings sudden forgiveness and returns meaning to life. This is slow, earnest progress out of the depths and as honest a character study as you will ever see. One of the best drama I've ever seen on stage or screen. Well worth it.
I was happy to see this drama live onstage and I hope to see it in the theater or on disc.
