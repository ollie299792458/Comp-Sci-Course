From its beginning in the sleepy Minnesotan town of St. Rose, Minn., Drop Dead Gorgeous is an utter hoot.  Kirstie Alley and Denise Richards are luminous as the conniving, evil mother and daughter who are committed to  winning the town's beauty pageant at all costs, even blowing up one of the  contestants on their tractor!Kirsten Dunst is the perfect foil to the  antagonists, and MadTV's Will Sasso makes a hilarious turn as the town  "Retard."  In leser taste, but still amusing is the  Japanese-American family that has adopted a contestant to better assimilate  into the native culture in spite of the protests by their own japanese  daughter.Kirsten Dunst's trailer trash upbringing is another amusingspot, s  all te characters seem to converge on a point of pure insanity toward the  end.Look for Kirstie Alley's classic "Swan" Monologue at the end  of the film, as well as the SWAT team ending!A zany film that got far less  attention than it should have last summer, it is the superior  faux-documentary.  Blair Who?
