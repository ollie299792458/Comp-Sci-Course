Unfortunately, the only thing that out ranks seeing the musical on screen is seeing it onstage. I've gone to New York twice during my middle and high school years, and was part of my high schools cast when we put on the musical my senior year. Nothing will ever beat the thrill of seeing this musical come to life in front of you, the powerful voices of Val Jean and Javer, the pain of Eponine, and the determination of the students.

I found the movie to be excellent when I came across it on CPTV, and tried to find a blank tape to record it. Unfortunately that is lost, so I am going to buy it on here. The movie did an excellent job of going through all of the songs and included some scenes from the play, including set changes and parts of the songs that they would come to perform. The most spectacular part of the movie comes at the end with the Val Jeans from around the world come through the audience and onto the stage singing- "Do You Hear The People Sing", each in their native tongue. It is amazing how you can still get the feeling from the songs lyrics even through a different language. For anyone who has seen and loved the musical onstage, this is an excellent movie to remind you of the thrill of the musical now that it has closed on Broadway.
