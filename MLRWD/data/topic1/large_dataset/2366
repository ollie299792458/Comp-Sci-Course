In this movie about a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, a down and out guy looking to stay at a friend's house after a rash of bad luck.  What he doesn't expect is that he will be drawn into a murder plot involving two competing mob bosses, The Boss and The Rabbi.  When they ask him to commit a crime for a debt he doesn't owe, Slevin has no other option but to comply or lose his life.  I think you can guess which option he chooses.

This film has an all star cast including Morgan Freeman as the Boss, Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, Lucy Liu as the nosy neighbor of Slevin's friend, and Bruce Willis as a hitman with no remorse.  I've never really thought much of Josh Hartnett as an actor, but this film changed my mind.  I guess there's a lot more to him than 40 Days and 40 Nights.  His pairing with Bruce Willis, as in Sin City, was perfection and the two together are downright dangerous.  I would definitely recommend this movie to the same sort of people who enjoy movies like Snatch and Pulp Fiction. It's fast-paced, occasionally violent, and big on flashbacks, but worth every second.
