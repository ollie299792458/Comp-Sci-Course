Fiddler On The Roof is without a doubt the best ever musical! It has great actors, cool characters, unforgettable songs and fun plots. It's great how Tzeitel and Hodel convince Tevye to let them choose who they marry. And all of the songs show feelings, some are happy like "Miracle Of Miracles" or "Tradition" and some are sad like "Far From The Home I Love". Some of the characters are really funny like Yente, or very serious like Golde. And there are a lot of funny parts in the movie, like when the lesson of Laban cheating on Jacob was "Never trust your employer", or when Motel's 'new arrival' was a sewing machine, although he and Tzeitel did have a baby. And the dream the Tevye pretends to have is absolutely hilarious! But some parts are very sad, like when Hodel is forced to leave her home to see Perchick, or when the Jews are forced out of Anatevka. All of these are reasons why I liked this musical, and I think you'll like it too! I recommend this to anybody!
