Even if you thought you knew that corrupt politicians and greedy corporations were intimate bedfellows who deceive and take advantage of an apathetic and disconnected public,  perhaps, like me, you went about your daily business and shrugged it off as if 'that's just the way it is'. HOT COFFEE is a brilliant expose that shows us how the disgusting business of politics, greed and corruption isn't about THEM, it's about US.

This film is not just about the McDonalds coffee case (We see that at the time, McDonalds had over 700 cases of burn complaints from the coffee served in their restaurants and we also see the horrific burns suffered by the 79 year old woman,  how the press manipulated the case and the woman was made to look like a gold digger) but also explores the stories of individuals who were negatively affected by so-called tort reform laws.

I wish every American would watch this film to understand how their views have been manipulated and their legal rights have been hijacked by the concerted efforts of highly paid corporate lobbyists.
I have shared the links with everyone one I know and everyone they know. And will continue to do so.
