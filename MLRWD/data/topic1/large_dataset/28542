The first Fast movie I saw was #4 and only because my son begged me to go.  The movie grabbed me from the opening shot, and didn't let go until the close.  I literally found myself trying to catch a breath at times.  Of course, I immediately had to go out and buy the first three.  #1 was so good I couldn't believe I'd missed it for all these years.  #2 was very good with at least one of the original cast and the addition of a couple of other good actors.  #3 was nothing like the others, but was, for what it was, watchable.

I couldn't wait for Fast Five to open and was not disappointed at all.  We are huge Vin Diesel fans and love the Rock, so this was a real treat for us.  We've actually seen it twice at the theaters and will probably go at least one more time.  And I just preordered the DVD.

No matter how you see it, though, sit through the credits for a real surprise!

If you love good action movies, no matter how improbably they are (and really, anything else is just real life, isn't it), don't wait to see this one.
