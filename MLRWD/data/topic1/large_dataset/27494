This video is a good introduction for those unfamilar with the ID/Evolution debate. Certainly the information contained here is not enough to have a deep understanding of the issue, but it does take the time to make some points quite well. I recommend Darwin's Black Box by Behe for those further interested in the microbiological problems with evolution.

I find it interesting how many evolutionary scientists fail to address substance of the miriad of problems posed here and elsewhere. Instead, they respond my denegrating any who would question evolution as "unscientific" or worse. Frankly, healthy scientific theories and healthy scientists thrive on intellectual debate. If the arguments posed by those who question evolution are so amateur, why not just refute them? And if you can't, maybe you should question your own intellectual honesty. Science is not about a popular vote, or political correctness; it is about reason and evidence. There are so many fatal flaws with the theory of evolution, it is time that honest athiests consider the possibility that there just isn't a good answer to the question of origin at this time. It is not necessary to believe in creation, but please stop grasping on to this outdated theory like your life depended on it, or produce some substantial responses.
