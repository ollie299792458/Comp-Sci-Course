Narc is the brutal story of two cops both with violent past mistakes and have something to proove.Jason Patric gives the best
performance of his carrer.I'm glad he got this part because he
is terribly underated.His character Nick Tellis is an ex-under
cover narcotics officer you see why he gives that up in the beg-
gining of the movie in a very violent,and horrifying chase scene.
Well he gets a chance to get a desk job but he has to go back on
the street along with the brutal,profane Henry Oak(Ray Liotta)in
also probably his best performance he plays the role to well.I
can't beleive he was looked over at the oscars oh well.Oak and
Tellis are great together as a pair of outsiders so to say trying
to solve the crime of another slain narcotics officer who was
also Oak's partner and a good freind of his.So for Oak this isn't
a case it's a quest to find the killers of his partner and he
doesn't plan on reading them their rights.Tellis begins to suspect Oak and soon finds out secrets Oak doesn't want him to
know and The story slowly unfolds in it's bleak,unforgettable climax.Narc is the best cop movie of all time and it's a good
watch for mystery buffs.Now this movie is hardcore full of brutal
violence,Profanity(constant),drug use,bleakness,and just almost
a loss of hope nothing good really happens to any of the characters as you'll see
