This made for TV movie obliterated what made HIGHLANDER: The Series so absorbing. Wooden performances, a cheese filled storyline...This was the death knell and the most pathetic attempt to cash in on what was an incredible series.

When I sat trying to watch this I just kept going "What?" and "Oh no they didn't!" and "this sucks (fill in your own expletive here)"  I tortured myself by watching it all the way through and believe me it was torture. I still have trouble believing this was made...oh wait I forgot (see my first comment in this review).

The character of "Joe Dawson" (played by Jim Brynes) was the luckiest person in this movie. He died. All of the other actors probably wish they had, especially as the sheer inanity of this blatant exploitation tasked the endurance of even the most faithful of Highlanders legions of fans. Of which I still count myself. I can't even see this movie enjoying "campy movie" status of Highlander III. I guess I can survive this.

PS: The only good thing I can think of concerning this movie was the camera work.  It was excellent.
