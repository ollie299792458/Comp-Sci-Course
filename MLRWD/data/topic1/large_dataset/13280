ANGRY RED PLANET was made in the grand old time of filmmaking where you didn't need to pay attention to logic, just as long as you had a fun story. A group of scientists embark on the first expedition to Mars and are immediately set upon by native beasts.
WHAT WORKS: The effects -- though cheap -- are quite fun. The giant germ is handled very seriously. The red tint to the film is actually kind of clever. The characters are good hokum fun. Surprisingly, this is one of the first films to feature a woman as the main heroine...though she still screams like a banshee and faints at the sight of an alien.
WHAT DOESN'T: Rather than the dessert it is, Mars is portrayed as a world full of lush fauna and bizzarre creatures. Some are good, most are cheap. The rocket is about twice as big on the inside as it is on the outside. None of the spacesuits have faceplates. And what's with that giant bat-rat-spider-crab?
Anyway, this is one of the great sci-fi films of the fifties. Not the best, just fun.
