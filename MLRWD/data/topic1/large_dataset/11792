The Good -- I enjoyed the twists and turns of this mystery. Don't let it's slasher movie promotion fool you. This is a mystery with some slasher trappings, but it's not the teenybopper killfest one would expect.

The Bad -- While I enjoyed all of the twists, there came a point where they were too much. Twist after twist became a gimmick that this movie turned out to be. An enjoyable gimmick, but nothing that's going to keep this movie out of obscurity.

The acting was typical of early 21st century young adults: bad.

I'm also a fan of the idea of rumors and their impact, something that was touched on, but not fully exploited here. I wish the movie showed more instances of the initial rumor influencing on a more widespread scale instead of telling us so-and-so wasn't happy about it.

The Ugly -- The entire plot hinged on the main character showing up in the first place? Or would the antagonist find another patsy? I'm not sure the antagonist was that smart and if he was, why would he formulate such an elaborate scheme?
