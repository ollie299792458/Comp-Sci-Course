I'm a devoted "Downton Abbey" fan suffering through the hiatus and thought "The Pallisers" could help fill the gap. Oh, it did, it did - and then some. The well-written series is not only a good story about a fascinating family living in a fascinating period, it's also a good (painless) education in how the British parliament (and connected society) actually work. The production values are tops, even though it was made in 1974 - good, deep color, good sound (except when I trip up on those English accents and idioms), gorgeous costumes, fine acting. I enjoyed the series so much that I immediately watched it for a second time! The series comes with a companion pamphlet reader, and I recommend the viewer read the first 8 pages before watching the series. It's a good idea to read the Glossary of characters and terms after each episode, to reinforce your memory of each character (just read the ones you've seen to avoid spoilers). I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys and appreciates a good BBC series and likes the feeling of not only seeing a good show, but also learning something valuable at the same time. (Now I'm eager to re-read the Anthony Trollope books that are the basis for this series.) Note: I bought this series for about $42 during a special sale. I advise waiting for a similar sale.
