"Potemkin" is a giant among film classics, and deservedly so.  Even without actors' voices, it immediately pulls one into the sailors' world, where they are fed rotten meat (a doctor tells them it contains only "maggots not worms", so stop complaining already!).  Those on "hunger strike" face punishment, and in an altercation with officers a sailor is killed.  In Odessa,  where they have anchored, villagers mourn with the sailors. Then, Czarist soldiers, in a scene repeated in films from "Triumph des Willen", "The Untouchables", "Brazil" Woody Allen's "Love and Death", and "Revenge of the Sith",  storm the Odessa Staircase, throwing baby carriages, and others to the wind.  (By the way, there is no evidence such an event ever happened; this is an allegory to the Czar vs. the proletariat or any "David vs. Goliath").

This is not your everyday, overacted silent film.  Instead, it is reminiscent of the method acting we will see soon from The Actors Studio in New York...only logical, since the Studio's founder, Stanislavski, hales from Moscow and borrows from Chekhov, as surely these actors did.

The DVD is wonderful.  It is accompanied by a lovely score.  The "documentary" at the end is fun, too,  if only for its goofiness, as an antique American apologia for Communism.

This package is a great bargain to introduce you to a towering classic.
