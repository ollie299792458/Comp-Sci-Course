There's something about Mary has been know for its classic scene where Ted's (Ben Stiller) gets his zipper stuck with his, well lets just say Frank and his beans and the hair gel scene, which you've must of heard of you know where Mary's hair is all spiked up, if you don't know how her hair got like that you have to watch this film. The story takes as Ted is in love with Mary in high school. But the incident happened which then she moves to Florida without saying goodbye to Ted. He is still in love with her after 13 years, so then he hires a detective (Matt Damon) to find her. The detective then falls in love with Mary, which the detective gives Ted false information about Mary. Ted then still has a crush on her, which he still goes to Florida. They then find many people who are interested in Mary. It is a hilarious comedy which if you haven't seen, its a must see.
The DVD includes great special features. It shows when Ben Stiller won the Best fight award with him and the dog at the Mtv movie awards. This also includes the theatrical trailer and 13 TV spots. It also includes the AMC backstory, which is great, and videos and interviews with the cast. It also shows the origin of the movie of how it came all about. There is much much more in this DVD which you should buy. The commentary with the Farrelly Brothers is hilarious. I also though they should have kept the alternate beginning, which is in clay, but its really cool. They give you 2 options to watch the movie, the theatrical version and the extended version with 15 minutes of never before seen scenes. There are interactive menus, which are in clay that are cool. It also shows 43 minutes of behind the scene footage. This is a must get if you really love the movie.
