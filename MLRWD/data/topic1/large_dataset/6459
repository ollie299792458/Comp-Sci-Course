Director Luc Besson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802519">The Professional</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">The Fifth Element</a>) is a person who is more impressed by artists who recreate their dreams than those who try to relay some specific message. So I think to truly enjoy this little gem of a film, you need to step back a bit and see the forest rather than concentrate too closely on the trees.

The setting is Paris, France and the choice to shoot it in black & white is perfect. The beginning of this fairy tale starts out like some twisted version of Frank Capra's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062J00S">It's a Wonderful Life</a>. Andr&eacute; (played by Jamel Debbouze) is a Jimmy Stewart that's clearly several rungs lower on the moral ladder. Like George Bailey, Andr&eacute;'s own plan of suicide is thwarted by instead instinctually saving the life of an undercover angel who jumps off the same bridge before Andr&eacute; has a chance to.

And so we meet Angel-A or as she says Angela (Rie Rasmussen - who was Brian De Palma's Veronica in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000897EA">Femme Fatale</a>). Rasmussen is perfect as the vampy angel and brings a delicious human element back to these creatures that have been elevated in status to virtual infallibility in recent portrayals. This angel smokes like a chimney and wears a tiny black dress that accentuates her mile-high runway model legs.

The world that Andr&eacute; created through all his lying, cheating, and scams gone bad, is closing in on him fast. Angela has her work cut out for her. Before she can get Andr&eacute; out of his jam and safely away from the loan sharks, Angela needs to get Andr&eacute; to think differently about himself--a rebirth of sorts.

One thing I've learned from seeing this and Luc Besson's other films is that he has an uncanny knack of combining unique visuals and oddball romantic pairings into really enjoyable films.
