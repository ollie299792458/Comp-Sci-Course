I've loved horror films since I was 5 (that's going on 50 years now), and this film has the cold-fingers-grabbing-your-gut effect that is sadly missing from so many contemporary horror films. And I'm not talking about torture or sadism; though our villains are not very nice people, this film does not engage in the pleasure-in-cruelty that makes certain films (like Audition) unwatchable to me. It's certainly gory, but it's authentic, thoughtful and believable horror, with characters who aren't cyphers. If this is typical of French work, I'm definitely going to be seeing more French horror films.

Ms. Testa out-Jolies Angelina Jolie in her beautiful-yet-grittily-real depiction of Yasmin, the fugitive who is the film's protagonist. With her beautiful and vulnerable face and Gallic passion of her character, Testa is amazing in what may well be the most physically demanding role I've ever seen an actress play. You have to see the film. It's not that she does a lot of stunt work, though there is enough of that. But you can feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins during this film and that's what makes her so effective.

There is also legitimate creepiness in the pregnant daughter of the house, who is mad past all help and who tries to "help" Yasmin understand the family's plans for her.

If you like horror films, this is quite an effective one.
