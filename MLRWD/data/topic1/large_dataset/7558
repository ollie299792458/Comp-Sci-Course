I got Beginning Jazz Guitar to go with the others in the series which I already have: Intermediate, Mastering Chord/Melody, and Mastering Improvisation. Beginning Jazz Guitar and Intermediate Jazz Guitar both have A (chords and Harmony) and B (Improvisation) sections. The two more advanced books cover these two topics in greater depth. The A + B approach is effective and also allows learners to choose what they want to concentrate on.

The A Section in Beginning Jazz Guitar starts from a very basic situation and covers basic chords and string sets, triads, extended and altered chords.

The B Section deals largely with major scale fingerings and briefly with modes from the major scale.

There are also some excellent notes on technique, practice, and soloing.

There are various etudes and tunes to play which match the teaching points.

The accompanying CD has 38 tracks to listen to and play along with.

This is in my opinion the best series available for anyone wanting to play jazz guitar and understand easily what it's all about. Beginning Jazz Guitar is probably the best book of its type by a master jazz guitarist.
