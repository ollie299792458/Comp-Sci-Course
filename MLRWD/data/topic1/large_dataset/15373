I've read the 22 reviews that exist as of this writing (june 2006).  I am so glad the the majority of reviewers have appreciated this amazing film from Spain.  There are plenty of spoilers in the reviews and I wouldn't want to rob new viewers of the joy I had in the story unfolding.  It was a beautiful, well-acted gem from a country that seems to have it more together than here in the United States (I guess nearly 30 years of Almodovar movies will do that).

This movie is not only worth watching but its worth purchasing.

And as for "robotsloveme" who hated this film -- I can understand why robots love you.  Because anyone with a pulse would find you insane -- that's the only way I can understand your SO UTTERLY missing the point of this movie.  Was it dubbed wrong for you or something?  I'm fluent in Spanish so maybe I got the original voice.  But your calling this an insulting film for gays and AIDS is ridiculous.  Utterly stupidly ridiculous.  It made me think you must have watched a completely different film then the one I own.

For everyone else, trust the absolute gushing love that the GRAND majority of reviewers have bestowed on this special special film.
