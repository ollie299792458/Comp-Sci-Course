The day after I saw this movie I had to find out who directed it; turns out it was Harold Becker who's actually done a few good films.  This, however, was miserable.  The actors' performances were so wooden and walked-through I had trouble believing it was a major theatrical release.  Travolta was just okay, and from Vince Vaughan to the major police character, the content and delivery of the dialogue was awful.  Not to mention the implausibility of the plot.  This entire small town--as well as a seemingly intelligent woman--has completely missed the makeup and background of this stranger who wanders in and immediately becomes its most famous, richest citizen.  It pained me to see Steve Buscemi wasted on this movie; and I think you could see in his performance that he was just going through the motions (which is still better than anything else here), maybe wondering what he was doing there.
And by the way, what was with the dubbing over of some of the profanity with less harsh words, on the VHS?
