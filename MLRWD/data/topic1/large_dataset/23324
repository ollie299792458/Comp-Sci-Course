Nabokov gave us a classic novel.
As deeply as was possible almost 40 years ago, Stanley Kubrick, James Mason, Peter Sellers, Shelley Winters and Sue Lyons, in 1962, brought to the screen at least a taste of the flavor of  this haunting tale of obsession and outcome.
At long last, Adrian Lyne  has broken the final barriers to a true presentation of what lies behind  one of the the forbidden doors of the human psyche. While performances by  Frank Langella and Melanie Griffith were slightly stilted, Jeremy Iron's  portrayl of Humbert was masterful and truly exhibited the emotional  "roller coaster" Nabokov intended for this character. No less  impressive and charming was Dominique Swain's Lolita. Her performance  embodies Nabokov's intent to show the effects of such a total obsession as  Humbert's on the transition of a girl to a woman. Swain pulls this off with  total aplomb. The final scenes between Humbert and Quilty far surpass the  1962 efforts of Mason and Sellers.
This is a truly delightful film with  perhaps moralistic lessons for all of us. It should defintiely be on any  film lover's shelf.
