All I can say is wow this movie is fantastic maybe one of the best black comedey/horror ever created.One thing comes to mind when seeing this movie good acting (shocking) very good acting helps round out this awsome written script. I will not bore you with the story since there enough reviews here to tell you. However I will explain how you must buy this dvd. First off the picture quality is awsome (not perfect) look like it was filmed 5 years ago.The audio tracks are amazing there is DTS (which is awsome) the dolby digital 5.1 which is great an isolated score 5.1(I dont know anbody who listens to those) the commantary which is funny and not boring. The extas are plentiful but when compared to the LOTR no contest LOTR beats it, but this was before LOTR and is still pretty impressive. The extended scenes are good but were probly cut for length reasons (by the way there is no commantary on the extended or deleated scenes) the deleated scene is not that good and is good that is what cut out. the only thing bad about this movie is the rip off theme to psycho in the beginning (why they did it I dont Know) BUY THIS NOW you wont regreat it and if you do come over and reanimate me.
