My second husband was 20 years my senior when he took me to the "Artsy" theatre to watch Henry and June.  I was a University graduate in Chemical Engineering, but he did not warn me about the content. I had never seen two women kissing. So, when the Lesbian scenes came on the screen, I hid my eyes until he told me it was over.

Now as a mature woman, with more literature and experience under my belt, I highly recommend this movie, if you have a high libido. Initially I was unaware that Henry was Henry Miller, a writer.  That still did not ring a bell.  It was not until my Neurologist told me that Henry Miller was an ex-patriate in France circa 1917.  He lived on the streets, frequented the whore houses, and stayed with friends whenever possible.  His wife, June, was a social worker back in Brooklyn, New York. Eventually, Henry Miller's novels would be published in Europe (first in France); however, it would not until the sixties in America that a landmark case on obscenity released his novels for publication.

About 1930, Anais Nin, a wealthy woman, whose husband Hugo, was a writer in her own right and was working on a project about D.H. Lawrence.  Her husband was a banker, and she found his crowd boring.  So he found Henry Miller and a friend of his and brought him to dinner.  This is how their friendship and affair began.

Anais met June on the few times she visited France.  This was how she began her affair with June.  I think she was also having an incestuous relationship with a male cousin who was madly in love with her.

Anais wrote the book Henry and June, and asked that it not be published until Hugo's death.

I liked the cinematography and the acting.  I wondered why people did not make mention of Uma Thurman playing this role when she became famous - you cannot fake kissing another woman on screen. The movie was edgy and old looking. I also found it to be true to the book.
