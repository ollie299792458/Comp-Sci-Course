An avid fan of Robocop, I was really excited when I finally found and bought the Criterion Collection of this classic sci-fi film.  Unfortunately, upon watching it, I was very disappointed.  The main reason I was disappointed was that the extra footage that was cut from the theatrical release brings their respective scenes down rather than enhance them.  My main concern was for the editorial flow of the scenes, which was hampered by the added shots of violence.  Unlike the director's cut of Natural Born Killers, for example, these added shots of strong violence seem to have just been thrown back into scenes that already worked very well on their own.  There was apparently no sound re-editing, because the scenes feel VERY rough in terms of audio, and you can even hear where certain sounds are looped in order to fill the newfound soundtrack gaps in the extended scenes.  The print quality of the new shots doesn't match the original cut shots as well, and in terms of the editorial flow of the scenes, the new material just drags them down more than anything else.  On top of these things, the new footage really doesn't add much to the story at all.  The meaning the filmmakers were intending to create (which is expressed in the commentary section of the DVD) with the ultra-violence was already apparent to me with the theatrical version.  This DVD would be great if both versions of the film were included.  I'm going to sell this one and get the theatrical release version.
