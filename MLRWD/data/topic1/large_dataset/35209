Dead space has been an interesting series, from the first video game to the movies to the books. Now the review is on this movie.

CGI:

Not the best out there, but pretty well done and gruesome. I really enjoy how the blood splatters really give it a creepy scene, especially on the little girl. The ship looked pretty decent as well as the lava. Can't expect much from a cgi movie but nontheless it was truly believable in my mind.

Story:
Storywise, it was good but felt a lot like vantage point. The story deals with four characters telling their side of the story and telling what really happened. Overall it was pretty decent to see what they could come up with.

Overall:

I could go on a lot saying all these facts on how the movie can be either good or bad, but really it depends on your own personal thoughts. I would suggest a rental if you don't like how the story is told but it isn't a bad movie for me. Of course with greater technology and better stories one can argue. What I find a bit disturbing and out of place is the product placement of dante's inferno within the movie. Not only do they talk about the game without saying the name but they also mention the movie.

What I didn't like of the movie is how everything got explained rather quickly. The voices could have been picked better but it was very believable in some scenes while others will make one go say "really?" The movie will differ from tastes by people but to each their own.

In my opinion this movie gets a 4 out of 5. (rental highly recommended)
