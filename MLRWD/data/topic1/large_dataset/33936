"Edward Scissorhands" stands as Burton's most sincere and striking films to date.  He goes far beyond the screen in this work however, into creating a mythic cycle for the youth cultures of 90's and on.  His focus on the outsider motif and archetype is extremely clear and vividly portrayed, set on a story that is at times both whimsical and filled with an existential fury.  Edward has become a powerful symbol in the minds of those youths lucky enough to view this film during the turbulent time of adolescence this film portrays.  Edward embarks on the accidental Hero's journey, down "into the dark" of middle class suburbia, and returns essentially beaten, but hardly defeated.  The story of Edward could be the story of Prometheus, if Prometheus had been a geek.
Overall this movie is like having Camu and the brothers Grim speak at the junior high.
Don't let the symbolism get to you though, its a wonderful movie in itself, which is the true test of artistic integrity.
