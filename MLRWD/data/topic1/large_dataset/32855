Inspired by the pre-existing song of the same title, the movie Singin' In the Rain builds that slim idea into one of Hollywood's greatest musicals, and indeed one of its finest films of any genre. It had been many years since I last watched the film, and I was eager to see the difference made by a high-definition restoration. As expected, the resolution was significantly improved. The image was very clean, but the 2002 DVD release was also excellent in this regard. The only real surprise for me was that I found the lengthy "Broadway Melody" dance segment to be relatively enjoyable, whereas I had previously considered it to be a dull spot in an otherwise constantly entertaining film.  I still found the long, slow Cyd Charisse portions of Broadway Melody to be a drag, but this was not due to any lack of talent on the part of Miss Charisse.  There was also one small jump cut in the first of the two Charisse dance sequences, and I wondered if this was an editing error, or if it was necessitated by print damage.  The same anomaly was on the DVD.

The beautifully crafted film, with its three star performers showing such cheerfully convivial camaraderie, is a perfect example of Hollywood fantasy.  In fact, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds lived in fear of Gene Kelly throughout the filming. Still in her teens, Miss Reynolds was assisted in practicing some of her dance routines by Fred Astaire, who found her crying on the set.

Gene Kelly had the physical prowess to perform virtually all of his stunts in the film, but was not permitted to do so due to the risk to the production in case he was injured.  Therefore he had a stunt double for some scenes such as the leap from the trolley into the car driven by Miss Reynolds.

For a nearly perfect experience of the magic of Hollywood, it would be hard to find a better example than the 2012 release of Singin' In the Rain on Blu-ray.
