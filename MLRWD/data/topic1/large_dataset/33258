WOW...that's all I can say.  I've been waiting for this one to come out on Blu-ray for quite awhile...and I can truly say, it was worth the wait.  Finally, this movie looks like it did in the theater...the colors, details and clarity are amazing...This movie has never looked good on VHS, Laserdisc OR DVD...Finally Blu-ray does it justice. Kudo's to FOX for giving this such a nice treatment. I just bought my copy and watched it all the way through...was only going to watch bits but got caught up all over again in the magic. I even put in the DVD and jumped back and forth to compare...and there just wasn't anything to compare...the Blu-ray blows the old copy away.  Just watch the scenes of Do-Re-Mi or the Church Wedding scene and be amazed by what Blu-ray can do...the details in the church are stunning...every detail from the carpet to the candles and gold backgrounds just stand out perfectly...looks as close to the print I saw in the theater last year as I've ever seen...For all those that think only new movies can look good on blu-ray, just look at how wonderful this 45 year old movie looks!!! If you have any doubts about this one...Don't...Run right now and pick it up...you will be glad you did.
