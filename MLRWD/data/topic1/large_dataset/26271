It's great to finally see The Right Stuff appear on DVD as a special-edition.  The sound and image quality is awesome, much better than the LD.
This is one of the greatest achievements in film, depicting the birth of the space program.  It's difficult to think of anything wrong with the production.
The cast (many of whom at the time were not A-list caliber) is top notch, especially Ed Harris as John Glenn and Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager.
The beginning, which chronicles the breaking of the sound barrier, is excellent.  One particular scene has Yeager staring down the X-1 while on horseback; almost as if two living ceatures are involved in duel.  The Oscar-winning score by Bill Conti brings tears to my eyes every time, especially the breaking the sound barrier and the final coda, which ends at Gordo Cooper's historic orbit.
Director Philip Kaufman (just look at his resume; what an incredible career, with Henry and June, Unbearable Lightness of Being and Quills among his films), brings a humanness and respect to his characters, and dots the script with bit of humor and tenderness as well.  He depicts the Mercury astronauts as heroes, an aspect that unfortuantely has gone away.  These men (and their wives) pushed the envelope to it's capacity, went to the top of the pyramid.
We live in a time in which we no longer look up when a plane passes overhead, where, instead of real people risking their lives to further technology and science, our heroes are born out of comic books or the sports pages.
The Right Stuff is truely a very special film!  They don't make 'em like this anymore!
