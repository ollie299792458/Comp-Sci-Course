This film has the most morose premise imaginable - the heroine, Ann (Sarah Polley), is informed by a stiff-lipped doctor she has just a couple of months to live and hence the rest of the story is based around how she deals with this stark reality.
Ann however does not even break down in front of the barely empathic GP, she somehow holds it together and begins her list of things to do before she dies. Her resilience is almost unbelievable, in fact many would question whether such a reaction to imminent death would be possible in real life. However in the context of this film it works because Sarah Polleys performance is that good that she makes palpable what would otherwise be ludicrous fantasy, such as her ability to keep the horrible fact she has advanced cancer from everyone she knows while calmly pursuing her final list of goals.
In fact the whole cast is superb. Her affair with a man she meets in a laundromat (Mark Ruffalo) is very brief however entails some of the most powerful drama I have seen in a film. Thankfully the film does not depict her very last days as it would be too much for the viewer to take, who like me will be completely in awe of Ann or perhaps repulsed by the selfishness of her affair and the fact that she hides the truth from those she loves. Instead of feeling drained by the emotional trauma that Ann endures the film turns out to be one of the most heart-warming ever.
