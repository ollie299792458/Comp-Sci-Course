I just want to tell all the guys out there to get over their macho egos. This is an excellent movie that has probably been rarely seen by anyone over the age of 13 or not of the female gender. Yeah so its marketed to that demographic, that doesn't mean its not a qaulity movie. I would just like to proclaim proudly that I am a 20 year old male and I enjoy this movie to no end. I remember hearing "3 Small Words" on TRL when the movie came out and liked it. But, like most people who aren't 13 year old girls I thought "I can't let anyone know that I like this". I just forgot about it until I happen to see it on a movie channel. I watched it for about 20 minutes and thought "this is actaully funny, smart, and entertaining." It didn't hurt that I was a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, either. Then I remembered hearing "3 Small Words" and just as I did the studio scene arrived and I heard them play it and thought "there is no way I can live without this movie or soundtrack any longer." So without seeing the whole movie I went out and purchased the DVD and the Soundtrack. Yes, I braved the strange looks of the cashiers and never looked back. Upon seeing the whole movie and hearing the whole soundtrack, I was hooked and proceeded to watch and listen to them incessantly. Rachael, Rosario, and Tara turn in great performances and Alan Cumming steals the show as Wyatt Frame. Breckin, Alex, Donald, and Seth are hilarious as the boy band DuJour and Parker Posie plays the perfect arch-villian Fiona. This movie is laugh out loud funny and whip-smart with an intriguing and original plot. The only thing stopping you from enjoying this is your tough guy image. Its okay to admit you love this movie. I am proud to say that I do!
