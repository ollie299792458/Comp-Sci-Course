My initial viewing of "Righteous Kill" left me wanting something more then the standard cop-with-a-twist-formula-flix.  After two more viewings on DVD, I just can't say enough nice things about it!  First off:  DeNiro and Pacino...what more do you really need?  These two could sit around and read the yellow pages and it'd be entertaining.  But, because they are DeNiro and Pacino the expectation level is pretty high...at least it was for me and I would assume many others.  The acting and subtle nuance between these two really makes this film quite good and it works.  Although, "Heat", was a much finer film, "Righteous Kill" is a much more satisfying one, in that we get over two hours of these two great actors playing off each other and it is quite enjoyable.  Also cast is one of my favorite character actors, Brian Dennehey, who delivers a solid performance.  Also look for the sexy Carla Gugino in another fine role as the CSI agent who begins to stumble onto the killers path.  I give this film a definate thumbs up and encourage all to give it a look.  "Righteous Kill"  is a righteous movie!  I rate this DVD release at four stars because great film and very nice extras.  Go see it!  Hey I'm talkin to you!
