I went into watching this blind, trying to know as little as possible so I could just watch and enjoy. At first, I felt like I didn't like, or care, where the story was going but the further I watched the more interested I got. Also, the last 30 minutes or so makes the whole trip worthwhile. Don't want to spoil it at all, but it's something we haven't really seen much of in Resident Evil cannon but I think we all wish we did. (hint.. B.O.W. throwdown)

But anyway, the atmosphere of this movie feels like recent Resident Evil games, taking place in a eastern European war zone with B.O.W.s in the mix, and includes RE main characters Leon and Ada. Ada, as usual, is running around in the background helping Leon while looking out for herself as well. Also there are B.O.W.s from RE 2 and RE 4. Leon's probably my least favorite character from numbered Resident Evil games but it didn't take away from enjoying the movie.

Like I said I don't want to give any story away, because taking anything out of context of the way it's presented just sounds odd but when you watch the movie, it all makes sense in the end; and the end is totally worth the time spent. Also, if you're any kind of fan of Resident Evil, you shouldn't even be questioning getting this. Buy, watch, enjoy. Then go get Resident Evil 6 if you haven't already.
