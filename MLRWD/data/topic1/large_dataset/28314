This is the same old movie you have seen over and over on tv (it used to be a late-night tv staple)...but this ISN'T the print you have seen --

The Criterion print is painstakingly recreated and is crystal clear and sharp, especially on large screen tv's. The black and white photography has been adjusted and is rich and deep. Blacks are black, whites are white, and grays are beautifully rendered in digital grayscale. Stars are apparent in the black sky overhead - long washed out and gray on older worn-out tv prints. The boiler room sequences look crisp and recognizable, unlike the long blurry reels on older worn-out prints.

Sure, it costs triple what the bargain-bin version costs, but you will be richly rewarded with this amazing print.

There is an interesting "Making of" video attached as an extra -- it shows interesting home footage of the making of the sets, and the magic of the movies that put drowning sequences filmed in a 4 foot deep millpond into the stunning images you see in the final movie. A fun look at the world of special effects in 1958.
