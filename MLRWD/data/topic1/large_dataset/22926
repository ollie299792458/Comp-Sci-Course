Although this 1972 Oscar winner is regarded as one of Bergman's supreme masterpieces, it didn't involve me as much as another of his films (which most critics regard as inferior), namely 'Autumn Sonata' (1978). Maybe it was the superb performance of Ingrid Bergman in that film which made the mother-daughter relationship more credible, or perhaps the contemporary setting. Here the relationship between the sisters didn't gel for me, although all the performances are very fine. Liv Ullmann is better in 'Autumn Sonata' though, I feel.
I'm glad I watched it but I doubt I'll return to it again. Needless to say the cinematography is marvellous, of course, and Criterion's anamorphic transfer is wonderful, with no damage to the negative and all the colours (with red predominant) vivid and natural. 'Autumn Sonata' was good but this is outstanding.
As usual I viewed it in the original Swedish, but for once the English dubbed soundtrack is recommendable as it was done with the original cast under Bergman's supervision.
In some ways the highlight is the 52 minute interview with Bergman and a long time collaborator. His intensity comes over powerfully. A great extra.
