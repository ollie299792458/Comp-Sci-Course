When I heard the original CD of this show I felt lost and confused; the music seemed bland, the story and characters were confusing-so I gave up on it. However, watching the show on DVD had me riveted to the seat with  intense awe like a great movie.
The whole show, to me, was about choices  and chosing (two seperate things). It is about why George chose the people,  style and sacrafices in his painting "La Grand Jatte" and how the  choices made affected his life and if they were wrong or right. And while  George had choices to make about the painting, Dot had choices to make  about George and their life (act 1) and George (II) had choices to make  about his fledging art life (act 2). 
The concept also gave an insight to  art appreciation. Since no one really knows if the people in the painting  are related to Seurat, we are shown how to believe they may be.What is the  painting about?
The DVD production is wonderful. Great picture, sound,  cast, design...!
This is a 5 star story and will no doubt be watched  again and again by me.
