After Bender's Big Score, my expectations for this second Futurama movie were pretty high. I'm happy to say it lived to all the hype. The jokes were just as good as any original Futurama episode, and the main plot was just as good as the first movie's plot. I really don't get why everyone seem to hate it completely, to me it was just as good as I hoped it to be.

As of the special features, there is some very interesting items. Here's the list:
- The main feature commentary - Haven't got the time to listen to it, but apparently, it's pretty good.
- The Lost Adventure - A 30 minutes long episode made specifically for the video game, featuring the real Futurama cast. Very good and very funny. I haven't had time to listen to the Lost Episode commentary either, I can't say how it is.
- Storyboard Animatic - Not the best bonus, but still somehow interesting. You'll see for yourself.
- Deleted Scenes - Some of them are very great scenes, so much that I really don't get why they're not in the movie's final cut.
- David Cross eating popcorn - Voice actor David Cross (who plays the role of Yivo, the Beast With A Billion Backs "shklimself") talks about his character while eating popcorn.
- Blooperama - Quite funny video of the cast at "work".
- 3-D Models - How some of the elements of the movie (for example, the anomaly) are made commented by the animator. Again, not the best one, but still interesting)
- A Brief History of Deathball - A tiny feature about certain elements of Deathball, how they were made. If you have two minutes to waste, why not?
- Bender's Game sneak peek - A great teaser to what seems to be an awesome third movie.

The DVD cover is great, well made (only, it's easily destroyed. To manipulate with care), the video is beautiful and the 5.1 audio is great. This DVD movie is definately worth buying.
