After reading all of these disgraceful and untrue reviews, I decided I'd post my own. Some of you may think "Is he serious." Actually, I am. I am the biggest "Showgirls" fan in the world, and I am writing this to bring this movie justice.

 This box set is actually a joke, because it encourages a mockery of the film, especially by including the Fool "David Schmader."

 This film is for people who are positive, who love art, who are crazy/wild, who like to dream, and who understand what a good flick is. It includes some of the best dancing, great make up, beautiful women, a really great storyline that ends with a very good moral, signature dialogue that will be stuck in your head, really nice shots, and "Elizabeth Berkley". Who knew Jessie Spano could dance like that. She did a brilliant job.

 This film will inspire you to hang on to your values, and it truly provokes. Don't listen to what everybody else is saying. Men have NO TASTE!!! Judge it for yourself, and WATCH IT ALONE!!
