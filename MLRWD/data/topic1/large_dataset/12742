Nice boxed 2 DVD set.  Luckily the cornerstone Claude Rains feature is on the single sided disc 1 and plays perfectly.  You've all seen the film and this edition is a keeper.  Unfortunately, disc 2 is double sided containing "The Invisible Man Returns," "The Invisible Woman," "The Invisible Agent," and "The Invisible Man's Revenge."  The good news is the disc only locked up once.  Double sided discs must be handled as if they are rare coins. "The Invisible Woman" is a rather witty B comedy and is sharp and clear.  However, "The Invisible Agent" is a World War II melodrama featuring a cavalier loose cannon of an agent who endangers his coherts with his stupidity.  The trailer, however, is quite entertaining!  "The Invisible Man Returns" is a bit tedious, but the picture is clear.  "The Invisible Man's Revenge" features a case of unsympathetic characters, a mad scientist, and a demon dog.  Even the hero has no qualms marrying stolen money.  However, this is a great package for the money!  Even in the clinkers, we see old studio actor friends.  "The Invisible Man" and "The Invisible Woman" are best of all and the balance is an interesting bonus.  Collect them all!
