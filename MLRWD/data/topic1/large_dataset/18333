We all know the story, so there's no point in my discussing that here.  As a movie, this version stands as positive proof that some remakes are just as good as -- and sometimes better than -- the original.  Leaving behind the small-town setting of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0782009980">earlier B&W version</a> from the 1950s, the locale is changed to a large city, San Francisco.  Some interesting changes were made that lent it a hipper feel, and, of course, the acting style is completely different: the dialogue all sounds so much more natural.  For enhanced chills, more of the transition from human to pod-person is revealed, accompanied with an eerie sound of a heartbeat and swooshing circulation.  It's a good movie, preserving what was best in the original and making some creepy alterations.  So those of us who owned the DVD of this version were very disappointed when we played it on our BD players.  Expecting at least a half-decent upconversion, we found instead that the picture was a wriggling mess.  Even worse, the picture was shrunken down to a letterbox presentation.  I found it unwatchable, so this movie needed a BD upgrade in a big way.

The simple report is, the BD image is patently superior to the DVD edition.  After making a comparison, I saw that some minor image cleanup has taken place, removing flecks from aging.  If any DNR went into it, it wasn't done to the extreme of sacrificing details.  It also appears as if little or no sharpening was applied, which is a good thing: sometimes these older movies can become a mess once every defect from age is brought into bold relief.  The color palette has remained natural, fitting for its noirish intent.  However, taken in total, the improvements don't really POP OUT at you, like they often do when you first see the Blu-ray of a favorite movie.  At times, a soft, fine, snow-like noise is visible in some dimly lit scenes, but it's not consistently so, and I found it negligible in any case.  In all, the end product is just sufficient enough to make it worth the purchase, if only because the DVD edition is so horrendous.

So while it's definitely sharper than the DVD, it wouldn't be worth the PREMIUM price you see for other BDs, that have gone through frame-by-frame restorations.  It is, however, easily worth the $10 or so you can get it for here.  If you like this film, you might as well jump at it, as I don't think it'll get any better than this.

For extras, there are these featurettes: "Re-visitors from Outer Space, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Pod," about sixteen minutes, with a few words from the producer and director, with a few of the cast members pitching in; "Practical Magic: The Special Effects Pod," about five minutes long, explaining the special effects; "The Man Behind the Scream: The Sound Effects Pod," describing the sound design, about thirteen minutes long; "The Invasion Will Be Televised: The Cinematography Pod," about six minutes long, about the dark camera work.  There's also the original theatrical trailer.  The soundtrack comes in stereo or 5.1.

There is one very puzzling failure: The commentary track by director Philip Kaufman was not ported over to the BD.  For that, you'll have to play the second two-sided DVD (SD widescreen on one side, fullscreen on the other).  That's where you'll find the commentary.  Why didn't they put it on the BD?  Go figure.  It shows me that the manufacturer saw this merely as a quick fix to the awful DVD.  It's a sufficient, but minimal, effort.
