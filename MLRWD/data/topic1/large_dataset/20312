This movie is a must buy. The HD DVD quality is excellent, the transfer is beautiful and the audio is equally impressive. The movie earns 4 stars based on those merits. However there is one thing about this movie that utterly drives me crazy and this bothers me enough to not give this one a perfect 5 star rating.

The menu design is lazy and a complete step back to the bare bone DVD days.

I expect basic HD DVD functionality with my menu. I want to be able to access the special features from the pop up menu (the menu that appears while the movie is playing) and not have to stop the movie and then go back to the main menu because the pop up menu has omitted this feature (when every other HD DVD has not). Not acceptable.

I do expect a visually pleasing main menu with video clips playing under the menu, accompanied by a soundtrack - Like every other HD DVD. A static image with no music does not cut it.

This no frills, user not friendly menu is a huge negative. I hope Dreamworks does not tread this water any further. I wrongly assumed a quality standard had been set by the other studios. This is a step in the wrong direction for menu design.
