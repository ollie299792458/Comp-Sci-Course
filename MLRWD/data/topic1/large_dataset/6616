This movie is fantastic. It is dark and atmospheric without being depressing. The plot, particularly the last half hour, keeps you on your toes. I think we all have our own Rebecca, some standard we compare ourselves to, and that is the brilliance of the story. It gets you involved because you can connect with it.

Joan Fontaine is perfect as the lead character. There aren't many actresses who could pull off this level of shyness and awkwardness. What makes it more amazing is that she in incredibly beautiful. How does she get us to believe she could be so insecure when she is so flawless? Brilliant. I've never been a fan of Lawrence Olivier, but he makes this character work. If he had gone too far one way or the other, either sweet or boorish, the movie wouldn't have work. Judith Anderson turns in a top-notch performance as the psychotic Mrs. Danvers.

The Hayes Code got one thing right in forcing Hitchcock and Selznick to change the ending; it means you will still have a surprise in store for you when you read the book.
