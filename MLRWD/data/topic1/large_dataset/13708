Okay, so some people criticize this movie by saying it is not an accurate adaptation of the political and historical events going on at that time. Well, how exactly DO you intend to incorperate the (rather grim) history into a children's movie?
And that is exactly what it is: a movie for CHILDREN. It's supposed to be FUN, not teach you history. If you want to see a portrait for the political struggles in Russia at that time - go read a book about it!
Yes, the movie's characters are portrayed as black and white - the Romanovs are good, Rasputin is bad. Has it ever been different in Disney movies (yes, I do realize this is not a Disney movie)? Yes, maybe Lenin would've made a more logical bad guy, but Lenin didn't have magic powers (as far as that goes, Rasputin is the way more interesting character). Why yes, maybe they should have portrayed the hardships of revolution and the two years that the Romanov family had been held captive. Why YES, maybe they should have made Alexei a sickly boy and the whole thing utterly hopeless. It would have been more realistic and appealing to all you fine members of the politically aware adults. But no seven-year-old (as I was at the time I watched this movie) would be particularly interested in that kind of story.
As to my personal opinion, I love this movie. The songs ("Once Upon a December" is beautiful), the characters, the dialogue, the graphics, the mood, everything is just stunning. Sometimes it gets a little mushy, I suppose, as in the starting scene - but those parts are easy to overlook when viewing the wonderful whole.
