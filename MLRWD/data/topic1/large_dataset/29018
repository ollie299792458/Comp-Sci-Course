In my opinion, these productions are the best visual versions of Jane Austen's novels -- by which I mean they are closest to the content of the novels themselves. This is due partly to their being four to five hours long, and therefore able to include almost all the characters and plot of the novels. But more importantly, these versions resisted the temptation to change the characters and plot to inject modern points of view -- a temptation that few of the recent spate of movie versions have been able to resist. In particular, these productions preserve Jane Austen's delicate sense of irony, which is such a large part of what makes the novels enjoyable. Everything in the productions contributes to their success: the superb acting, the costuming, and the locations. Translating a novel into a visual production can never be done perfectly, but these versions I believe come as close as is possible to providing a cinematographic experience similar to the literary experience of reading the novels.
