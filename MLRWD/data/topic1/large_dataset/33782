There've been some great ones, but to me, nothing can surpass "Dirty Dancing" as the sweetest love story of the century.  The theme is age-old, a depiction of a maturing college-bound young woman, Frances  "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey), who falls seriously in love with  her dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze).  So, what makes this  film so different?
First released in the eighties, I loved it, but didn't  fully appreciate what Grey had gone through to pull it off.  Professional  dancers, instructors, recently told me that at the start of film  production, she was a good dancer --- but that's all.  However, through  intensive daily training and mind numbing determination, she became, in a  matter of months, a world class dancer --- a near impossibility.
  It's  Grey's personal attributes that come shining through as Baby depicts a  beginner who has exactly one week to master the elusive Mambo.  The scenes,  some hilariously funny, others poignant and touching, are accurate and  wonderfully portrayed.  I mean, it's not just the script that makes a great  film: where would Casablanca be without Bogart ---- or The African Queen  without Hepburn?
  You can't help falling in love with Baby, she's so  fresh, so vivacious, and, in the finale, dances so beautifully that your  heart is captured forever.  Everyone I've met who's seen the film loves it  and all own both the DVD and the CD soundtracks.
  If you haven't seen  it, do so now --- you won't regret it.  It's a film you'll watch over and  over, one love story that will never grow old.  (DVD)
