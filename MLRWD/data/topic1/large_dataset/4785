Heard the buzz about this one weeks ago (LOVE the promotional poster). The theatre in NYC was 90% full, 2 or 3 people left in the middle of it, but not me. I like to watch the envelope get pushed.
The film seems to be an essay on "psychologically broken" people
finding each other and muddling thru "normal life." Practically
everyone on screen has had some form of emotional crippling which
keeps them isolated from everyday society. But this is far from a
"downer," because amidst the angst, there are subtle laughs -- the strange behavior can make you chuckle at the oddest situations... 
I hate to give away too much plot, but if you enjoy movies that keep you thinking while it plays with your emotions AND challenges your ideas of acceptable behavior, give it a shot.
The acting is fascinating, with the female lead (Maggie Gyllenhaal) giving off sparks of extreme courage -- not many women would have taken on a role like this.
I loved Cronenberg's "Crash" because it was a psychological spinning wheel:you could never clearly predict what anyone was doing or thinking. This runs along the same lines.
Did I like it? I was in its spell, following it wherever it went,
and most importantly, I was never bored (a lot like "Mullholland
Drive")--so yeah, I liked it. Would I see it again & again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Only to the adventurous -- most regular moviegoers would find this perverse/silly/pointless
or just plain "bad." (Believe me, it is none of those)
Throughout the film, I kept thinking "I can't believe a movie like this came out of Hollywood !" It's someone's dark little secret fantasy put up on a big screen for all to see, and the girl's final close-up may sum up the filmaker's message in a nutshell. "Yeah, and what are YOU looking at....?"
