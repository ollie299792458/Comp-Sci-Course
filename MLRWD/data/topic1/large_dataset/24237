I have read all the reviews and accept 99.9% of what has already been said.  This DVD recording of "Rusalka" is truly, "A work to die for!"

I, too, bought this film because of Renee Fleming; having heard her Hymn to the Moon on various CD recordings.  As for Dvorak, familiarity with his symphonic works were always impressive.  The great surprise was the powerful score of Dvorak' Rusalka---almost Wagnerian.  Wagner's influence on Dvorak is very much evident; yet Dvorak retains his individuality.  Opera and any music for that matter which makes one think, ponder, and emote is worthy to be called great music.  Opera, of course, holds the trump card because it embodies all art forms. Dvorak's score powerfully holds the continuity of this work.

 And WHAT ART in this production of Rusalka!  Just to see and hear Renee Fleming  sing  Rusalka's Hymn to the Moon alone on stage in this magnificent setting is worth the price of the DVD.

5 Stars are not enough to honor all those involved in this production.  I'm still pondering and emoting.
