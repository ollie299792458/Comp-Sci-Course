As much as I think it's a great movie, thanks to the sensitive directing of Wayne Wang (an Asian American male), the biase against Asian males bordering on racist stereotypes simply comes through. I can empathize the venomous comments by some Asian males here, but I think it's going a bit overboard. Even though stereotypical caricatures are often based on partial truth, I find the cheapskate jerk Asian American husband portrayal the most troubling. Oddly, most Asian guys are the opposite when it comes to money. The husband, by all accounts even though Asian, is really embodying western values of individualism and legalistic formal contracts rather than the Asian traditional emphasis on community, sharing, and personal trust. I can understand the historical premise behind the negative portrayals of wife abuse and concubines by Asian males, but there is no basis to use an Asian male as a cloak for the sins of western values.

The last part of the movie is beautifully done. Wayne Wang's directing and cinematography is superb and Rachel Portman's melancholic scoring adds so much to the emotional catharsis. When June says "cheah cheah" (which is so fitting as a sign of love and respect for the two "elder sisters") and starts breaking up .... that's where I break up too!

I must end by saying that even though my race and gender gets knocked a little bit by the negative portrayals, both justified and unjustified, this is a must see chick flick for any human who has an ounce or more of universal love within them regardless of race or gender! A 5 STARS MOVIE!
