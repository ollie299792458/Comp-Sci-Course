[The VHS is full screen,
 whereas the DVD is widescreen]

A thoroughly enjoyable movie.

Blend together a very good screenplay,
a very good cast realizing very good characters,
direction by the great Alfred Hitchcock
and an excellent score by the great John Williams
and how can you go wrong?
You can't and you don't.

This movie does not have the same psychological
gravitas of some of Hitchcock's other mystery
and horror movies.
It is more on the lighthearted side with a good
sense of humor and it fires on all cylinders.

There is a couple (man and woman) who are kidnappers
for a payoff in jewels and a couple running a scam
as psychics who become private detectives.
The detectives are looking for the kidnapper jewel thieves
because the man who is a thief is being sought by a client
of the "psychic" as the long lost heir to a fortune.
The detectives will earn a substantial fee for finding
the heir who does not want to be found for obvious reasons.
That's where the fun and excitement begins.
Enjoy.

[complaint: I have the VHS and there is a trailer
preceding the movie that gives away too much;
it is nice because it includes an introduction
by the man himself,
but it ought to be after the movie]
