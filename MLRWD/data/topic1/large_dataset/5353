This was surprisingly WAY better than I thought it would be! I know this type of comedy is a dime a dozen...But this one really DOES stand apart.

I think it has the same feel as 50 First Dates, They even have Jessica Alba working at a similar place that Adam Sandler worked at in 50FD-
Working with those CUTE little penguins- They just added MORE charm to the movie in my opinion.

The story line goes something like this:
When Dane Cook is a little boy in the beginning of the film, A little girl puts a hex on him that he will never find true love, that every female he is with in the future,will meet the man of her dreams AFTER being with him.

Well, needless to say, when word gets out about Chuck's good luck, a bevy of women stalk him to get him to sleep with them-and he does :)
When Chuck falls for Jessica Alba, Of course he can NOT sleep with her, for fear of her finding love with the next guy,

Chuck's adventures will leave you laughing!
It's raunchy, funny, and a love story, too. I am so glad I gave this movie a chance.
