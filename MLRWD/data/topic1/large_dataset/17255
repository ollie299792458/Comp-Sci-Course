Hitchcock has crafted his most cold film and for hitchcock that means watching it and making your own plot turns in your own mind only to be blown away by what unfolds on the screen! This film has everything, from the opening featuring Bergamn at her seductive best to Grant in all his charming swagger the car ride Hitchcock sends you on with the duo is heart pumping voyerism at it's best the whole film feels like your right there with them in every room feeling the same heat and paranoia they feel as they try to infultrate nazi secrets and unhatch a most sedious plan. Hitchcock has so much faith in Bergman's sexual ease he allows the other men in the film to fight over her with intelligence instead of fists the movie turns into a Freudian game of chess between Grant's and Raines' characters good versus evil in the ultimate grudge match-a woman's affections! At the end one man has the ultimate move and it's checkmate! But watch the final scene and the suspense that is built as the couple descends the stairs it's as if there were more stairs on the way down then the way up-infact there was!
