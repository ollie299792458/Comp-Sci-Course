This is exactly the kind of film I've been waiting for Jody Foster to do.  I always knew she had this well-hidden comedic side.  In addition, Gerard Butler makes a great Scottish Indiana Jones!

Again, Amazon has done a nice job summarizing the film, so not much of that here.  This is just a special film to me because I just love how this family friendly film intertwines fantasy, adventure, relationships and love into one clever package.  Gerard Butler does terrific double duty as Abigail Breslin's father and Jodie Foster's alter ego who gives her the courage to face her fears to save Breslin who has been separated from her father on their island, which has been "invaded" (another clever storyline).  Foster must get over her fear of the outside world in order to get to Breslin's character on that isolated island and those moments when she battle with herself and her alter ego (Bulter) are the show stopping moments for me.

The films sparkles with originality and heart.  I was delighted by the performances and left smiling when the closing credits ran.  This film may not delight all though.  It is an awkward mix and bounces around wildly as if the writer and director had forgotten to take their A.D.D. medications, but for some, like me, that is the charm of this film, but for others, that can grate on one's nerves.  It's a matter of taste.

Although just a bit too uneven at times, I completely enjoyed this film.
