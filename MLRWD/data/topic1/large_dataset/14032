I know this movie isn't exactly life-changing and it doesn't attack any real *issues* in the world, but if you're looking for a fun comedy that will have you laughing so hard you're practically crying, The Hot Chick is it.  
Age plays a huge factor for the audience - I'd recommend it to teenagers and people in their 20's, but anyone much older or younger will probably find it repulsive or confusing.
The basic storyline is that Jessica, this stereotypical popular girl, accidentally switches bodies with a disgusting man (played Rob Schneider).  She overcomes a gazillion challenges while trying to get her body back and Rob Schneider should really be commended for his acting.  Sure, this sort of character isn't going through any extreme mental drama, but it isn't as if normal teenage girls act just like her, either.  Every nuance of over-superficiality is purposely there to make the audience laugh, and I can honestly say I was rolling on the floor with by the end of the movie (whether it be the first time I watched it or the tenth).  
While almost every scene contained something hilarious, my favorite was when Rob Schneider and three other girls were having a pillow fight and s/he doesn't know her/his own strength and ends up practically throwing the other girls in the walls and knocking them out.  Whoever was Anna Faris' stunt double did a fantastic job.
Overall, it's just a fun, happy romance/drama/comedy/action/etc. that deals with a wide variety of teenage issues, from accepting one's culture (as seen in Ling-ling, one of the girls in Jessica's clique) to parental marriage trouble.
