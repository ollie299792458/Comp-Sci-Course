When I talk to people about this movie, as here, now, as I try to write about it, I "freeze up"...become wary of "saying too much" and spoiling it for someone who has not yet seen it...I also become emotional, and always get the aching lump in my throat that heartbreak brings.

I will keep this simple, but still try to convey the level of drama and also the heart-stopping, breathtaking BEAUTY of this film.

A scarf, fluttering in the breeze...shadows flittering on the dimpled, golden, sand.....

The War...A Nurse...Archeologists...Spies...Africa...Middle East...Planes...Guns...Love...Betrayal...A Patient...Secrets Withheld...Revealed...Recovery...Discoveries...Losses...A Will to Forget...Italy...Remembrance...Tragedy...Revenge...Heartbreak...Great Bravery...Love...and Endings...

For ONCE, I can truly say that I have seen a movie that DID totally retain the book...at least one felt that it did. An awesome achievement (and a tremendous salute to Michael Ondaatje's fabulous book...one of the finest reads ever.) Lots of Love, Care, and Effort went into getting everything right about this movie. It Truly DID deserve the many Academy Awards that it garnered.

One of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen, it is an absolute finalist for the best cinematography, EVER. Music, Costumes, Acting, Editing...all these things are of the very highest order.

It ranks right up there with the "Great Ones" like "Lawrence of Arabia", "Bridge On The River Kwai", "Dr. Zhivago", and "Casablanca".

You owe it to yourself to see this fabulous movie...and, it belongs in every respectable personal film collection...it is a Great Work. ~operabruin
