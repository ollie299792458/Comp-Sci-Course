This may be the perfect combination for a fun VCR or DVD movie.
Adventure, suspense, humor, great writing, a cast that clicks with a director that helps them click, and a situation not often seen in a movie--Spies who have married and have a baby. They are not allowed to retire due to circumstance, but the baby goes with them -- at least most of the time. Compared to this, Spy Kids is a real disappointment.
The villians do not have to be that believable for this movie to be enjoyable. The main villain could have been better. The secondary villain -- Morte -- was good.
What man with a new baby in a strange city has not wondered what he would do if a couple of thugs tried to mug him?
The best parts of the movie are the small scenes and situations, not the main climax. 
This is a movie to sit back and enjoy. And the lines really ARE that funny!
"You took our baby into a knife fight?"
"It was a fair fight -- two against two!"
"Don't worry about my wife. Jane is a master of martial arts I can't even pronounce."
"Kill the light." He does.
I am glad it is now on DVD.
