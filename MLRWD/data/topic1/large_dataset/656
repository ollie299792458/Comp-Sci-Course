I was recommended this by my sister as I could no longer use a gym.  I have never stuck with DVD's before as I find them a little tedious, time-consuming and (being rather inpatient) they take too long to show a real differnece.  Not this one!  The muscle tone you achieve in just 3 workouts is amazing!  I lost an inch in a week and my bottom half is now smaller than my bust...after 2 weeks!  The mix of excercises from pilates, yoga and even ballet techniques keeps it interesting and the instructor is clear, concise and has a fabulous body so is a real inspiration.  There are 5 10minute sections and you can mix-and-match all of them or select 1 or 2 per day depending on time available and fitness level.  Because each area actually works the entire body you don't need to do the entire 50mins.
The instructor gives easier alternatives for most exercises, however, this is not for someone looking for an easy workout...it's pretty tough! Most people I speak to who have done pilates classes or DVD's say they didn't feel like they'd had a workout, but this is different. It makes you sweat quickly and continuously and keeps heartright at fat-burning level. I literally felt like I couldn't take anymore of an exercise when she switched to something else.
Buy it and I'm SURE you won't regret it!
