This film has always been one of my all-time favorite movie musical classics; I think I was about 12 when I first saw it in a movie theater--long before multiplexes and hi-tech special effects. Now my 7-year-old granddaughter would like to enjoy it as well, having seen a couple of numbers on youtube. Unfortunately, the "Region 2" designation was not mentioned on the purchasing site, and when I tried to play it on my American DVD player, I got a "region error" message. Gene Kelly's dancing and dashing sex appeal, Donald O'Connor's dancing and comedic timing and Debbie Reynolds's dancing and fresh vitality--not to mention the original and pitch-perfect singing of all three--made for a perfect musical comedy ensemble. Gene Kelly's classic performance of the title number never gets old. Just make sure the disc is a "region 1". The only clue to this potential deal-killer is a tiny (nail-head tiny)icon on the back of the jacket, hidden among the credits, of a stylized world globe with the region number inscribed in the middle.
