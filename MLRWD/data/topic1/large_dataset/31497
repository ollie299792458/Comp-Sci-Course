...even without gratuitous sex and graphic violence. It has been almost 12 years since I first saw this movie, and I can still watch it today with great interest. The acting is superb, the dialogue convincing, and the plot intriguing. Director Tony Scott sets up the antagonism/contrast between the two main characters from the beginning. And each subsequent scene advances the building conflict until it reaches a boiling point when they disagree on how to handle an incomplete communique. Washington and Hackman give Oscar-worthy performances as Executive Officer and Captain. One of the most believable performances I have ever seen in a movie occurs just before the Captain is first relieved from duty. The movie is worth buying just to witness this confrontation!

And the co-stars are no acting slouches either. Stellar performances are given by James Gadofini (sp?), Matt Craven, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen, Rocky Carroll and Danny Nucci. There are not many movies my husband and I agree on -- he likes action and violence while I like action but not 'graphic' violence -- but Crimson Tide is one that we have both enjoyed over the years.
