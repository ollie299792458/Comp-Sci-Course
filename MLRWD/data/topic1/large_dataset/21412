I saw this film years ago on T.V. and it tickled my insanity bone no end.  Quite simply it is a classic to end all classics, from the first moment you meet the four man crew on a 20 year mission who are as dysfunctional as they come, to the Captain who's dead but not really dead because his head is kept alive and he talks to the crew, not mention the suicidal Bomb No: 20 that wants to end it all and has to be talked out of detonating itself every so often.

This is a movie that is an aquired taste, and you have to appreciate the tongue in cheek, the black humour and the total mickey of all things science fiction.

It is quirky, crass, rude and totally irreverent, this is John Carpenter's brilliant portrayal of life above and beyond.  The ending is superb with the bomb getting its wish to end it all, and a crew member finding out that there is nothing cooler in the universe than using the bomb as a giant skateboard.  Wonderful, wonderful pulp science fiction that is ludicrous as it is poignant.
