I rented this the other night after avoiding it for years because of all the bad reviews and comments about it being disgusting. After finally seeing it, I'm left wondering what the hubub was about.

I guess the rape was somewhat disturbing, but it's certainly not the first of it's kind in film. The rape scene in Deliverence is much more graphic and disturbing than the one in this one.

If somebody was expecting something along the lines of Mallrats, I suppose this movie would come as quite a shock, but still, I think the reaction some had is a little over the top. This is a dark comedy/drama, I guess my sense of humor is just off kilter enough to find the things the clowns mother was saying to him to be hilarious, and the vicious waitress was another nice touch.

Sure, Bryan Johnson is no Spielberg, but for a first time director with no real experience, I think he crafted a pretty entertaining little cult flick. If you're looking for a light hearted rom com, then leave Vulgar on the shelf, but if you like dark comedy, and quirky independent films with an interesting twist, give it a shot, you could do worse than this movie.
