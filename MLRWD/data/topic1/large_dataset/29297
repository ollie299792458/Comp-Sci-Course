Animal House is the wacky tale of the Delta fraternity at Faber College that just doesn't seem to fit in.  Instead of having sophisticated dinners with their pledges, they decide to throw a huge party and basically if you show up, you are in.  Once you pledge Delta however, you need to watch out because these guys could get you in a lot of trouble: from stealing meat from a grocery store, getting you in trouble with the dean, angering your ROTC leader, forcing you to steal your brother's car, and ruin the homecoming parade.  If you can't keep up, it's better for you to find a frat that is a little more refined than this group of delinquents.  This movie is a non-stop laugh fest in which you better not eat or drink because you will end up choking or spitting it back out.  A definite must see every week or so because you will never believe what these guys will do for a good time and it causes you to have one as well.  When it comes to showing Animal House at parties there is almost no competition because partying is all that the guys in Delta want to do.  I haven't met a person that didn't like Animal House and if I ever do I would automatically assume they are a nerd because that means they either have no sense of humor or don't like to have fun.
