Absolutely LOVED and identified with this movie! 
I was "there" -- on many a Thanksgiving Day, on 6th Avenue watching the Macy*s parade, just a few years after this eternally delightful movie was filmed. And when I was little, everything, especially Santa, was breathtakingly real. No matter that I froze my little tail off standing on 34th Street and 6th Avenue for hours (starting at 7 am, so we could get a good view of the parade!) -- on each and every Thanksgiving Day, my heart was warmed by the floats, the merriment, and....especially, Santa.
So naturally, while watching this movie, I almost felt like I could look into the crowd and see....me!!! I can really relate to this movie!!
The casting was perfection! From the unbelieving shop owner and his reindeer props, to the innocent little boy on the witness stand, from the bustling crowds in the street, to the interior of the typical (for that era) NY apartment building, the cast of characters and the sets were totally realistic. 
And I loved the little girl played by cute little Natalie Wood -- hey back then, when I was 5 years old, I even WORE outfits just like hers!!!
What's NOT to love in this movie!!???
Although I never chanced on this movie until the 1970's (which left me and my "little" sister awestruck), I have watched it faithfully every year since then. Each time I see it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time over and over again -- this movie still speaks volumes to me.
The funniest part of the movie (to me and Sis, anyway!) is when the Macy*s executive's wife (who is totally snockered) answers the (old, heavy, cast iron, just like my grandma's) phone.
And the most breathtaking part of the movie-- well...is that really Kris Kringle's cane there, over in the corner?
This movie should be "required viewing" in every grade school.
