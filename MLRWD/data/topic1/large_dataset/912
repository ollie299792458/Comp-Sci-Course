Control ****

Sam Riley plays a convincing Ian Curtis, so that is a plus, but from there that is really it. So if that is it then why am I giving it a full four stars, well because he is really really good, and really the saving grace of the movie. The movie is based upon Deborah Curtis, Ian Curtis' wives memoirs of her teen age marriage to the lead singer of Joy Division upon until his 1980 suicide at the age of 23. The movie chronicles Ian's life from his mid teens through the birth of Joy Division and their albums Unknown Pleasures and Closer and ends with the his death. His epilepsy is featured here as the cause of his depression when really it was his meds. Also the movie makes it look like his marriage was most of the cause when once again the meds caused his personality change as well as marriage problems such as looking for the arms of another woman.

So while the film is based on an actual memoir it hardly follows it, and in fact for the most part is nothing like the memoirs twisting tales. But for a loose introduction and background on Ian Curtis this is a decent way to go.
