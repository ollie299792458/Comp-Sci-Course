I just watched the concert on NBC using my High Definition TV broadcast, and 5.1 surround sound audio.  It was absolutely terrific.

Every member of the group  sounded great.  Don Henley looked a bit heavy, and older, but sounded just fine.

If your favorite Eagle is Joe Walsh, this is the concert for you.
He sang more on this concert, and was great as always.

This concert contained almost every one of their hits, and left out a lot of their lesser known materials.  Don Henley mentioned in some of his commentary that they don't mind at all doing their hits, even though they've performed them hundreds of times, and in fact thinks they've improved the songs and their performances over the years.  I agree.  In my opinion, this is a better concert than Hell Freezes Over, and that was very good.

How many bands can you name that have a country sound and are as popular with rockers as well as country, and have been around over 30 years?

Just great!!!  By the way, the video and sound quality are top notch.
