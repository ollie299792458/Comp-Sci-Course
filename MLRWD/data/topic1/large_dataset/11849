Everyone knows the story of jaws and everyone has seen the movie...now get the DVD version.  Not only do you get a classic tail of a dangerous shark incident, you also get a digitally remastered version of the movie including rare interviews and never before seen footage that will blow your socks off.
This version of jaws ranks much higher then the original VHS movie.  The digital picture really makes the movie more life-like and believeable.  I have loved this movie all of my life and finally finding this movie makes the overall view of jaws in my mind a whole lot better.
I recommend this movie to anyone that has already seen the movie but hasn't seen this version of the tale yet.  I don't want to get you people confused making it sound like a whole new movie...but with the great technology that we have today, you, the people, are allowed to view this classic like you ever thought possible.  Honestly folks, you gotta check this one out.  You'll love it!
Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day!
