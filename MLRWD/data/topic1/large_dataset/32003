I was so happy to see that Amazon was offering this DVD. After listening to a David Chang interview and hearing his recommendation for this movie, I had to see what all the ruckus was about. This film is awesome. I was a little bit naive and didn't think to read any content reviews for it despite the NR rating, so when the first of many instances of bare breasts were seen in a particular scene I was a bit shocked, so be warned. Luckily that scene is conveniently skippable without missing anything else and there isn't any nudity after that until the credits roll at the end, and even then, it's a long focus on a baby breast feeding, if you consider that nudity. This movie is all about the Japanese love/obsession with food. The film is slightly quirky and after certain scenes I was a bit stunned, not knowing if I should be laughing or taking it serious, but it actually is really funny. The acting was great and the film's pacing was excellent as well, despite being sort of a montage that jumps back and forth with the characters. If you are passionate about food, you need to see this film. And don't forget to affectionately stroke the pork in your bowl.

The DVD doesn't come with anything but the disc and the case. I watched (and probably only will watch) the subbed version.
