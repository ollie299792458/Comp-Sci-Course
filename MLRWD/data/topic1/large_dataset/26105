The truth is I have no right to review this film, positively or negatively.  This is because "Lucky # Slevin" is one of the first films in a long time that I turned off before it finished.  I made it about 45 minutes before I couldn't take any more of the incoherent, covoluted story, annoying "clever" dialogue, and bland acting (from an all-star cast!).

Tarantino-esque this may be, but that becomes a problem when it's all style and no substance.  Staples of the Tarantino film--the fractured storyline and focus on dialogue--here are grating and uninspired.

What I could gather from the plot is Slevin (Josh Hartnett) gets picked up by some thugs and taken to a mob boss.  They claim his name is Nick, and he owes the outfit money over a gambling debt.  Slevin claims he is not Nick and has no idea what they are talking about, but that doesn't stop them from kidnapping him.  Once in the boss' headquarters, the boss offers a chance to settle the debt by killing a member of a rival family who lives in a "tower" he can view from his window.  Slevin quickly accepts this offer, without trying to prove his true identity.  Though this moment comes early, it was hardly the first time I rolled my eyes.

"Lucky # Slevin" may prove to be better as it goes along, but it will take patience to get there, and it used all mine up.
