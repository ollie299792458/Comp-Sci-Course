I really love this video.  I have a great deal of experience in yoga, and this video challenges me extensively, when I want it to.  If you're a beginner, you may find it frustrating and overwhelming.  It really helps to have a background.  So if you're new to yoga, this is still a good video, but PLEASE take the easier modifications and don't push yourself hard.  There is a lot of mind/spiritual elements that Shiva incorporates.  The workouts are long, but have adequate amounts of rest, as she gives breaks and long meditations.  None of the pre-set flows are very short, but if you need a quick workout, use the matrix.  This is the single most innovative, fun, and personal aspect of this video.  You can make your own workout!  But again, it helps to be aquainted with yoga first so that you can get exactly what you want.  Also, please note that her style is very much a flow/Ashtanga approach.  This is not Iyengar--standing, holding poses.  I've had the video for over a month and I still haven't gotten through everything.  It's easy to navagate through, and I personally find Shiva to be a very inspiring and relaxing instructor.  She's fabulous.  I wish I had bought this sooner.
