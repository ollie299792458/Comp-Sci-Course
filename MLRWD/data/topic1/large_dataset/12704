The other reviews of this film do a great job of describing how fantastic it is. But there's an important distinction between 2001 and 2010 that may  help you understand why so many people like it, in spite of it being  actually contradictory in filmmaking ethos to 2001.
2001 was one of the  greatest examples of what cinema (movies as art) could do. It was abstract,  compelling, engrossing and confrontational. It changed the way you thought  for a little while, and changed what many people thought movies could do,  forever.
2010 isn't cinema at all, it's a *play*. Everything compelling  about this, except perhaps the special effects (which, while awesome, are  tellingly static) happens between two people, through dialog. Two people  sit on a park bench and decide the fate of the Discovery. Two people argue  on the bridge of a soviet spaceship about the Monolith. Two people stand in  the middle of the high desert of California and trade cold-war secrets  about an alien encounter. And it's all *awesome*! Some of the best dialog  and acting wev'e seen in science-fiction. I can prove, using algebra, that  if you watch the first 10 minutes of this movie, you'll watch the whole  thing.
