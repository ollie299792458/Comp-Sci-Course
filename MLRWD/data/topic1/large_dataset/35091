The premise of "Dead Men Walking" is actually quite smart, in its simplicity: a "convicted killer" is placed in a maximum-security prison.  The inmate, charged with four counts of murder, was actually defending himself from four zombies, one of whom took a little nibble before being dispatched.  The zombie plague is not widespread yet, and is therefore not of knowledge to the general public.  The infected inmate, of course, quickly turns dead, moving smoothly into undead, and since the prison is under maximum lockdown, the zombie finds himself with a captive smorgasbord as inmates and prison staff fight to stay alive.

Overall, "Dead Men Walking" is a nice oasis in the desert of straight-to-video zombie flicks.  It's available on DVD, and The SyFy Channel seems to have a license with the film's distributors as well - I've seen it in the listings at least twice in the last six months, so keep your eyes peeled.  It's definitely worth a look-see for the fan that has seen all the "popular" undead films and is looking for something else to satisfy their appetite for destruction.
