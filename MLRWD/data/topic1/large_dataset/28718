I am still amazed that this film still looks and sounds as good as it does.  It is a solid entertainment and most of the dragon effects can still stand alongside any seen in "Lord of the Rings", as they were done by ILM.  One wishes that there was at least the movie trailer on this DVD, as it has no extra's to it.  Perhaps they will put out a deluxe edition some time in the future.  Those who write off early eighties fantasy films, (and there are a lot to write off!), as cheesy, really should take a serious look at this.  The only time one wishes the special effects were better is in the Dragon's offspring, where they dont have the believability that the main dragon has.
This was one of the last roles for Sir Ralph Richardson, and he makes the absolute best of it.  His scorcerer can stand alonside Merlin or any other.
The period detail is another plus.  being made after "Excalibur", (as well as some fine lesser known films of the 70's), the costumes and other effects have a wonderful believeability to them.
So, if your looking for a nice distraction in the fantasy film department, you really can't go wrong with this film!
