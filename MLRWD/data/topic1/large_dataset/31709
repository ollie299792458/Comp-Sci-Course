I reccomend this movie to anyone If you have been a long time fan of "The Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" sagas then you would like this movie that brings them both together and find it very intertaining. Freddy Krueger is a demon based monster that hunts and feeds in the fear of teenagers, the fear is what makes him stronger and gives him the ability to kill people in their sleep. Throught many movies in the whole sequal Freddy gets killed over and over again, but after making his killings. Jason Voorhees is the villan in "The Friday the 13th" who goes around killing teenagers in the real world. When he was younger he used to get pick on by the younger kids. he drowned one day and when he woke up from the dead, he went on a revenge rampage killing anyone who came to Crystal Lake. This movie was interesting because Freddy was to weak to hunt for kids, so he called Jason back from the dead so he could put fear in the kids until freddy was strong enough to come back. In the end of the movie one of the girls pulls Freedy out of the dream world to the real world where Jason is waiing for him to fight it out. So once agin if you have been interested in either saga then you would definatly find this one interesting.
