"Perfect" is an adjective not applicable to many films, but this is one of them. Lubitsch and Raphaelson pare down sex, wit, greed, and romance to their essences. There are no preachy moral or political messages here, no slapstick or toilet humor aimed at the lowest common denominator. L & R never talk down to their audience. They set the bar of wit, subtlety, and sophistication very high and respect us -- the audience -- enough to assume it isn't *too* high for us to get it.  That means some will *not* get it, of course, as the disgruntled one-star reviewers here show. Perhaps a "dumb and dumber" diet of Jim Carrey and American Pie-type movies has blinded them to real wit, humor, and acute observation of the human condition. For the rest of us, this is a smart, humane comedy that presumes its audience is smart and humane -- I can't think of a single movie comedy of the past decade you could say that about.  TIP reminds us all how much better and smarter comedy could be if today's filmmakers had even a fraction of L&R's craft, class, wit, and intelligence. TROUBLE gives modern Hollywood something to live up to -- now if they only WOULD try to live up to it ... LOL.
