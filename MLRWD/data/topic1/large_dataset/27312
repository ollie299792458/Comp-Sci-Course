I have removed my former "review" of this package due to my own error in complaining about "Boom!" not being included. It dawned on me afterwards that "Boom!" is a film from another studio, and is not owned by the studio releasing this boxed set. (I'm ashamed of myself for not realizing that immediately!!!!!) But, that doesn't let Universal off the hook for not releasing it! And, also for stating "Virginia Woolf" should have been deleted from this set to make room for "Boom!". Again, afterwards, I became aware of the supplementary material that will be inlcuded with "Virginia Woolf". That and, finally, the widescreen version of "The V.I.P.'s" will make this set a "must have". Taylor and Burton went directly from "Cleopatra" to "The V.I.P.'s", which was released while "Cleopatra" was in its "roadshow engagement" (playing only in selected large cities). Therefore, most of the world got its first view of Taylor and Burton together on screen in "The V.I.P.'s". Despite Taylor rarely being more beautiful, Margaret Rutherford, who won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for this role, nearly steals the movie as the delightfully charming, bumbling, Duchess of Brighton.

Now that the films in this collection are on DVD, when will the studio release the other Taylor films still to see the light of DVD day? Most notably the roadshow verion (already released on VHS) of "Raintree County", for which Taylor received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.
