I first saw The Court Jester as a young boy growing up in rural Michigan.  With not much to do, or watch, I quickly became a fanatic; I would watch the tape continuously.  About the sixtieth or so viewing the picture began to degrade and the audio started weaning in and out (the tape I had came from my grandfather and was already about five years old when I got my hands on it).  With a flair for preservation, and little knowledge of "Tape Stores", I decreed that I would only watch the movie once a year.  So for about six years I went with only six views of the film.  Then, on a rainy day in March I had a revelation.  I was surfing the web, which I usually only used for looking at girlie pictures, when I stumbled upon an amazing site called Amazon.com.  In an act of sheer genius the website had compiled a list of movies, books, and cds, from around the world and put them up for sale.  I quickly searched for "The Court Jester" and was stunned to find not only did they have a VHS copy but a DVD copy as well!  I pulled out my credit card and purchased it right there.  Since that date I have been enjoying The Court Jester, digitally remastered, and with dolby digital surround sound.
