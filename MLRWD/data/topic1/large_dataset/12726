Alex Whittaker, played by Paul Le Mat (MELVIN & HOWARD, THE BURNING BED), and three other gifted psychics are investigating rumors that the secret of life has been discovered by master puppeteer Andre Toulon, played by William Hickey (PRIZZI'S HONOR, THE NAME OF THE GAME).
But the psychics quickly discover Toulon's secret of death in the form of five killer puppets-each one uniquely qualified for murder and mayhem.
Tunneler has a nasty habit of boring holes in people with his drill bit head. Ms. Leech regurgitates killer leeches that suck her victims dry. Pin Head strangles his enemies with his powerful vice-like hands. Blade has a gleaming hook for one hand and a razor-sharp knife for the other. And Jester, the ruthless brains of the bunch, is absolutely merciless.
Together, they're an army of skilled assassins, diabolically programmed to guard the deadly secrets of the PUPPET MASTER.
Special effects wizard, David Allen (WILLOW, BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED), brings Toulon's killer puppets magically to life with the incredible flair that earned him an Academy Award Nomination for his work on YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES.
