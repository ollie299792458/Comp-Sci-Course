This movie is very cute, and airy on the surface, but it also illustrates the cruelty of high school. (If you don't recognize and remember this cruelty from your own high school, you WERE one of the cruel ones!) There is more to this film than you may wish to see. Or, you can just enjoy it for the fun on the surface.
Romy and Michele don't seem to have progressed far since their high school days, so they invent fake lives. Of course, when you invent a whole new life on little notice, there are bound to be holes, and you are bound to get caught, as they are. There are charming sequences from the heads of both women, of how they hope things will go.
By the end, if you step back and look, Romy and Michele have gone through quite a bit of growth. When you look at some of the people who were on the most likely to succeed, you can see that they simply stagnated. Those often labeled as most likely to succeed are those who peak in high school. It must be a sad fate to have the high point of your life so early. It was great to see some of what had been the popular clique outgrow their previous friends, and see the merits of those previously 'below them'.
This is a fun movie if you are already out of school, and may give some hope to those still in the grueling experience of high school. Life does get better, once you are outside of that artificial world of school.
