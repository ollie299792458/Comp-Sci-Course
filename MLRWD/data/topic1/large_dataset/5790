Burned-out FBI agent Jack Campbell (James Spader) has left LA and settled in Chicago.  Still tormented by the nightmares of a serial killer that has not been caught, Jack, tries to put back the pieces of his life, with the help of his psychiatrist (Marisa Tomei), but his life is about to take a turn for the worse.  
David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves) is the killer that got away, and he has followed Jack to Chicago.  He has a nasty game he wants to play, and Jack is the key player.  
Griffin will send Jack a photograph of each victim on the day he plans to murder them, if they are to stay alive, Jack must find them before 9:00pm.
As the game of cat and mouse heats up, so do the stakes, for Griffin knows what makes Jack tick, and the next victim may be someone very close to him.
"The Watcher" is a gripping thriller, that glues you to your seat from the first five minutes, and hurtles you through a twisted maze of madness.  Very few movies can give away the identity of the killer in the opening and still be suspenseful, but "The Watcher" pulls it off by creating an atmosphere of tension that never lets up.
James Spader is (as always) very good as the mentally scarred FBI agent, and Keanu Reeves takes a nice turn in the role of the totally deranged killer.
Exciting plot, suspense, action, and very good acting make this  a must own for thriller fans.
