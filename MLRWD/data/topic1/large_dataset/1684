I also just received this today.
I have yet to set aside the time to watch it entirely. But I had to write a review as soon as I could! 
No doubt about it, these are the 9 wonderful Storyteller episodes. (Hopefully they will also release the Greek Myths.) All I've been able to do so far is browse the menu and watch a couple of minutes just to see how it was arranged.  But of course I remember how spectacular these were. I saw most (if not all) of them on the Jim Henson Hour. It was a long time ago (I was only 10 or 11!) but these leave a lasting impression (especially "Soldier and Death") and I recall that I was heartbroken when the series was cancelled. I am really looking forward to reacquainting myself with these little masterpieces.
There are no extras on this DVD but, hey, who cares?  Just like any other DVD you have the option of selecting which episode to watch or to play them entirely from first to last episode.
I can't recommend this highly enough. I think it can appeal to everyone. Although I would use a little caution - as I would with the equally fantastic Dark Crystal &amp; Labyrinth movies - with very young (pre-school - 7 years) as they can be a little scary at times. My own 2-year-old daughter will just have to wait! :)
Just want to end in saying that Jim Henson was truly a genius and a great human being all around. Love his work. Not much else I can add that hasn't already been said here!! 
Get this DVD, it's a keeper!!!!
