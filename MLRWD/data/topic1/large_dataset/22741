I never cared much for "Alvin and the Chipmunks" as a cartoon show years ago but this movie is great! It's not one of "those" comedies filled with pratfalls and punchlines and a few "ha ha" points, but one which you can really keep on enjoying as you go along --and come out feeling "up" with the world! The plot was admittedly weak --but then we weren't exactly expecting "War and Peace" were we? The movie had great "flow," the cinematography was seamless and colorful, the live actors were more than passable, the animation was excellent, and Alvin and his cohorts were "alive" --and Funny! (It's said that the great vaudevillian and (early-) movie star comedian WC Fields didn't like working with animals or children because they would steal the show: these guys are so great had WC played with them people would've said, "WC Who?")  --Oh, and don't be fooled by the box cover showing the chipmunks dressed all "hip hop" intimating their music or "style" has been totally updated "thattaway" --in the movie they're all classic, bouncy "chipmunk," dressed like that for only a brief performance scene, and their music is also classic "chipmunk," but with a modern tempo which only adds to the enjoyment.  --We grownups liked the movie, the kids liked it, and even the cats got engrossed a few times --which says a lot!  Five Stars for the whole family!
