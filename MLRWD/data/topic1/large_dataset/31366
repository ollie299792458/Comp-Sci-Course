Based on the title of this movie, I thought this would
be a good movie.  The acting was good, but nothing was
happening in the first three quarters of the movie.

Perhaps the problem was that there was nothing new here.
The movie consisted of cliche after cliche about Nazis.
Yes the Nazis burnt books, yes the Nazis were trying
to create a strong nation with fertility programs, and
yes they tried to euthanasia the weak and the crippled
to reduce their health care costs to reduce tax burden
and create a stronger military, and yes they had
concentration camps.

After becoming part of the SS, the protagonist tried to
save his friend Maurice.  But this plot was much better
done with the movie Schindler's List.

The ending was so sudden that I was taken by surprise.  We
never find out what happened to Maurice.

If you like movies about characters and their feelings
towards each other, than you could rank this movie two
or even three stars.

Much more satisfying movie about Nazis is 'Inglorious Basterds'
with Brad Pitt (although very violent).  Granted I am comparing
apples to oranges here, but that movie was 'Good', this one
is not.  My humble opinion.  :)
