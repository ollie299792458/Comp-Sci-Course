Poirot is my new favorite. I have been terribly ill this year and I am disabled. I have had so much joy and pleasure from all of Hercule Poiriot's shows. To date David Suchet has made 65 shows-some regualar and some feature length. Without buying so many DVDs I read a great review in Amazon telling me to buy the Agatha Christie Classic Collection. It has 36 shows on it. All are 50 minutes each, roughly. I want to have all of Hercule Poirot's shows in my collection. The best way to do this I have seen is by buying this colection and the Agatha Christie Poirot: The Classic Collection Vol. 2 which has 9 feature length movies and also buying The Definitive Collection which has 12 feature length shows. I know own 57 shows. So, if you want to have as many poirots as possilbe wihout buying each DVD this is the best way out of what you can buy now. I did the reseach on this so this is how I know. I made sure when I bought each collection that none of them had any duplicate shows on them. The last 8 shows are on The Movie Collections 4, 5, & 6. Maybe they will put these on a collection. Poirot is what I watch when I cannot find anything on television and even then most of the time I would rather watch a  Hercule poirot show I have seen before than watch anything on television. All these channels on cable televsion and nothing of quality to watch. I hope David makes more shows. I just love them. Another great website is the agatha christie website itself. Love Poirot and cannot get enough. Each DVD in this colletion has 3 shows so you don't have to change the DVD so much. I know others are not crazy about the packaging; however I think its fine. Thank you for listening.
