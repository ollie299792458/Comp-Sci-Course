Disney's Mulan is a solid, well-crafted film.  
The animation is engaging; the new crew created a unique style and some truly breathstealing cinematic sequences (The horde of Huns rivals the wildebeest stampede from  Lion King).
However, the Disney musical format doesn't quite fly in  Mulan.  The numbers don't contribute anything to the otherwise epic Eastern  feel of the film (the best song is sung by... Donny Osmond?).  On the other  hand, I had expected to be thoroughly annoyed by Disney's penchant for  cutesy sidekicks, but found myself instead pleasantly amused and  entertained by Eddie Murphy's dragon character and his cricket  chum.
Beyond these small quibbles, what makes Mulan a  "purchase" film for me, is the strength of the characters and the  story told through them.  Aside from Belle, Mulan is the only Disney  heroine to fully hold her own without dependence on a "Prince  Charming".  Courage is the mainstay of all the protagonists in Mulan.  And the Hun villain was impressively wicked.  It's refreshing to see a  Disney film drawn from a source largely unfamiliar to Western viewers, and  aside from the minor gripe about the music, I highly recommend it.
