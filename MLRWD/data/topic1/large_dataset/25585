These rave reviews must have been written by the director's family, as this film is truly terrible.  Google any standard review, and you will get the real picture.

This ensemble cast is shamelessly wasted, and they cannot hope to save this absolute wastebasket of a script, where the old "fighting siblings" and "dysfunctional family" routines are stereotyped to the bone, and the comedic lines are close to something found in a 1980s sitcom writer's room shredder.

I actually felt sorry for some of these top quality actors, but cannot for the life of me understand why most of them would ever accept such idiotic roles unless it was as a favor. It only proves how famished Hollywood must be for stories.

This film pulls out every stale joke in the book and manufactures fake tension via almost wholly unlikable characters, save for the actor dad, his daughter and the lesbian couple - and make no mistake, the gay women are there only as an easy joke target. The story is 15 years behind the times in this respect.

The dinner table scenes are grating-on-the-nerves annoying, and the writer/director would have done better to burn his script and let the actors improvise. The Debra Winger character cannot decide if she is angry and uptight, or just a taunting moron, and the brat twins are not even close to devilishly bad in a funny way, but rather one dimensional punks in a stupid way.

Famke and Zooey:  hope to see you again - in work that you deserve.
