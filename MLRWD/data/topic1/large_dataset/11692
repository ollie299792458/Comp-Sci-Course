Seven Pounds is an outstanding and very UNDER RATED movie. Those who didn't like this movie probably have a limited understanding of what it means to show compassion towards other people.  From the special features commentary, that came with the DVD, the movie's concept was mildly based on an actual event. Seven Pounds has to be watched, not from a critical eye as to whether this movie achieved this or that, but, from the point of view of someone who is telling their story and you are the viewer. If you ignore the few negative reviews, and enjoy the movie for the compassionate theme it's portraying, you will have a better appreciation for life that transcends the daily problems we sometimes face. The chemistry between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson was great. The movie flowed well; and, the accompanying music enhanced the essence of the feelings being conveyed.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't let the trailer (for this movie) mislead you; the movie is not as suspenseful as it is made out to be; Seven Pounds is more about Love and Compassion.  I hope you enjoy the movie!!!
