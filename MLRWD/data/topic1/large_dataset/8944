Wouldn't you think that the studio that gave us the greatest of fantasies of it's age in KING KONG would have garnered so much more in financial kudos than they recieved ?  It seems RKO was to go the fateful route that Carl Denham took into obscurity and financial ruin.  After SON OF KONG, RKO released SHE and without the financial support needed for the undertaking.  It was to be in color and to include scenes of wooly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers and such but all was not to be as the budget was drastically cut.  Back again was Helen Mack from SON OF KONG and also starred Randolph Scott, which who's part was supposed to be played by Joel McCrea who played aside Fay Wray in THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME which was filmed during the production of KING KONG.

This DVD release honors the desire of Merian C. Cooper to release this film in color as it never was but done so now under the cooperation and direction of our beloved Ray Harryhausen, I'm sure as a tribute to the desires of Cooper himself.

Do not be put off by the "colorization" of this film.  It was the desire of Merian to be seen this way-we've just increased the budget a bit so we can all see what he wanted us to see.

RKO went away quietly with the Desilu buy out but will always be remembered as the studio that brought us some of the great films of the 30's, as we should not forget SHE, She who must be obeyed.
