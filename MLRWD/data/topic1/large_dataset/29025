SAW V gives us another piece of the puzzle. First off, I just recently found out that SAW III and SAW IV were running together but SAW V doesn't run in between them but it does give us an over view of what has happened since the first SAW movie and who has been involved with John Kramer, and how he manipulates people into helping him. Defiled Horror mentioned something about an extended version. I've looked through all, and I haven't been able to see any. Please enlighten me. As for the box, I believe it's got information on Hoffman in it, but a said we'll have to wait for SAW VI to see, just like we all had to wait and see what was in that envelope for Amanda. In response to Andariel Halo, I thought that the suspense was handled very well with the pendulum trap. At first we thought it was a trap set up by Jigsaw, but then when Seth didn't escape, we then thought it may have been set up by Amanda because of her inescapable traps, but then we learn later about Hoffman's sister and then the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together. I thought that the end was interesting, but it still leaves the autopsy of John to ponder. Unless it's going to start off SAW VI after Hoffman is found, because in SAW V Hoffman was found with Jeff's daughter Corbett but they never brought out John Kramer, Amanda, Jeff Reinhart or Lynn Denlon's bodies. So it will be interesting on where it will be going even though we know what has happened before.
