After I've read the comments other customers have made in regard to the tragic horrific experience that Emmett Till encountered, and what that mother of this young man must of felt, that no punishment was done to these individual racists is totally unjust and totally wrong and how I come to realize that racism is still prevallent in our fabric core of society in this very present day and age. With the uprising of race hate groups such as the arian brotherhood, the ku klux klan, and other seperatists groups which makes the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. become unfilled to envision an america that is not bound by color but by love for one another as the Lord above would have it to be and allow america to be a place of racial equality and respect for one another and something should be done about it to put an end to this serious issue with the United States the race issue, once and for all. I am about to purchase this video to add to my continually growing collection of movies and documentaries that I already pocess. I think it is worth the purchase and this video is very true and educational. I did hear and read about this case that happened back in 1955 in Money Mississippi. But this movie will give me more enlightment and a greater understanding evoling around this particular matter which is it's core problem is racism plain and simple.
