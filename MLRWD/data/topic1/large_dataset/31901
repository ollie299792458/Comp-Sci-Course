"Shame" has been billed as an "addiction drama," the addiction in this case being a sexual addiction. When I saw this film in the theatre, there was a vibe about the audience ... many of the people in the theatre were clearly planning on being titillated, shocked, or turned on by the film. Those people were probably disappointed since, despite plenty of nudity and sexual situations, there was absolutely nothing sexy about this film. Every time Brandon (the central character and sexual addict, bravely and hauntingly portrayed by Michael Fassbender) acts out, it's an act of desperation and a way of numbing the intense pain and alienation that is written all over his face.

"We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place," says Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, to her brother in one of the many desperate voicemail messages she leaves him throughout the film. The film's "elephant in the room," which is never spelled out explicitly but is obvious throughout every single scene, is that Brandon and Sissy were both sexually abused as children, probably by their parents. As adults, they are both hopelessly damaged. Brandon seeks constant, compulsive sexual gratification but is completely unable to have an authentic, genuine interaction with another human being. Sissy also acts out sexually, but, unlike Brandon, clings desperately and inappropriately to those around her, as well as self-harms (by cutting).

It's hard to give this film a "grade." Why? Because it's not a film that is enjoyable to watch on any level. Practically every scene is painful ... you're spending two hours watching two tortured, ruined human beings self-destructing. But at the same time, the film is beautifully shot and directed, and the two lead performances are outstanding. And the film succeeds on a basic level, by showing how childhood sexual abuse can destroy its victims.
