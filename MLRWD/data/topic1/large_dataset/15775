Like Malice (1993), this is a movie that the less said about the plot, the better. That includes any reviews here or elsewhere. None of the voluptuous curves in this movie should be revealed before its time. And hang in for the closing credits -- I didn't the first two times and they explain a couple of questions you might have.

Anyway, for those of you who wonder about such things, Denise pops her top. Neve doesn't. There's a brief second of frontal on Kevin Bacon.

No additions of extra footage could make this more fun. Only puts flab on a crisp, fast, fun, sexy thriller.

Digression: The settings are amusing to those of us from Miami, where this was shot. The idea is they're in a snotty Florida community like Palm Beach that shares a school district with the poorer rural-swamp community. And, for the high school, they did use Ransom Everglades, a school in Coconut Grove where your kid is out-of-place if anything on them is not legitimately designer made.

But the idea that this is anything but a major Florida city is kind of lost when they use so many significant, oft-photographed Miami sites and shoot them with long shots. The first of these shots is the opening credits, which pan downtown Miami, go out over the water, then close in on Ransom's football field. The "Hendon County" courthouse is actually the Dade County Courthouse in downtown Miami. And you kind of wonder, if this is such a small community, why is the county's courthouse in such a big-city proportioned downtown?
