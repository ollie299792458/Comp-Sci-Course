It was more than 16 years since I watched Dr. Zhivago on a Betamax.

I want to focus my review on how the quality and features of this double DVD Special Edition have somehow increased the joy of watching this classic.

Dr. Zhivago itself is a great story, with great actors, and that hasn't changed since it was first released in 1965.  It is still the same melancholic, romantic movie that should make you share at least one tear in the end.

Now, besides the plot and actors, I consider Doctor Zhivago has 2 main important elements: music and photography.

Musis for my was very important, and this double disc edition really has a great job in sound quality improvements.  If you loved it before, you will have enhanced music, much better and clear sound effects.

Picture also has been improved considerably, not only because of the format used on DVD's but also because of a great work done with picture enhancement.

Finally, the DVD comes with many extras, so even though I have seen this film many times, I always ended a bit sad in the end. But then watching Omar Sharif and other actors talking about the film, really made it for me.  I think the extras are really valuable content, if you loved this movie, you would like to know a little bit mor about it, so here you have it.
