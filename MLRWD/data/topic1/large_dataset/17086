First off, so many persons, Amazon.com included, moan about Redford's accentless--exactly which accent was he supposed to use: Highbury? Manchester, Bristol?  The Counties (one hour north of London)? .... But then he would fit the bill since the Counties are known for their lack of an accent!  Then again he should have said somehting like "bloody gut(good)."  Enough trivialities, my major qualm with this film is its portrayal of Women and Empire.  Its portrayal of women as participants is misconcieved, portraying Blixen (Streep) as the sole active female in the colony, which is absurd.  Nevertheless, the film does touch on a number of historically relevant issues, ranging from single-female migration to the colonies, to the archaic belief that women nurses executed their duty in the name of reason contrasted to Africa's superstitions.  Keep in mind that this is her story, with all of her biases intact.  (If the subject intrigues you an entire literature has bloomed in the last fifteen years.) Furthermore, Blixens return to Denmark is marked by a distinct severing of ties with Africa.  She may have Africa in her heart but Kenya's absebce is what draws out her story.  One question: what about the massive Afro-Carribean and Indian population of London today?  How did it get there?
