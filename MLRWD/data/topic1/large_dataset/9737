Four great movies for the price of about one. Can't beat that. I think most people are familiar with the content here, with the possible exception of Tod Browning's "Freaks", which may be the best of the lot. I do prefer the Frederic March ('32) version of "Hyde", but the '41 Spencer Tracey version has the benefit of getting to enjoy the considerable assets of Lana Turner & Ingrid Bergman. The Haunting is a classic that I seem to watch every year around Halloween w/o it getting "stale". And House of Wax, a classic Vincent Price performance. Its amazing how many people think Price just made horror films, but I've been noticing more & more here lately what a fine dramatic actor he was in non-horror roles, although he usually portrays a villainous character. Now , for all of the people that left 3 or less stars and whined about these movies being already available. Do you really think everybody bought these DVDs when they first came out? I think its pretty clear that the target buyer is the classic movie newcomer and people that couldn't afford to buy the individual movies. You gripe about WB just wanting to make money. Uh, isn't that a priority in running a successful business. Ever hear of capitalism? Four movies at this price is a bargain. I only wish that I didn't already own 3 of the 4 included here.
