In the sense that..well, I had never seen it until TCMs presentation of it, Feb 25, and had assumed, incorrectly as it turns out, that it was an overblown melodrama with little real merit. Johnny Belinda seems to me that it is definitely worthy of the term classic, largely because of Jane Wyman but also because of its outstanding camera work. Wyman demonstrates a great sensitivity with a performance good enough to suggest that she was under utilized all those years. Given the subject matter, and the time it was produced, there has to be certain leeway given. It is not a film made for children and an intelligent adult viewing it now would pick up on its many subtleties. Belinda is not a backward dummy, as is implied by the majority of the townspeople. Rather it is they who are backward ''blessed'' as they are with all senses, but blocked minds, hearts and souls aplenty. Now, if I have a minor quibble with this film it would be that the  great good fortune of motherhood for its own sake seems to be a whitewash for the crime perpetrated against Belinda. Are we to imply that having a baby, by any means, is the great absolver of sins? There is never any question of abortion, for instance. There is never any real examination about how Belinda feels about things, not until she is deep into the light of radiant motherhood. Still. It's a compelling and rather mystic film, and one that I imagine was quite controversial for its time.
