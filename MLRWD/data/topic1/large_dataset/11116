In no way a conventional horror movie, nonetheless, it is, alongside the Coppola `Dracula' and the `Branagh' Frankenstein, all brought out within a couple of years of one another in the early nineties, supposedly, part of a revisionist trilogy of that traditional staple horror fare.

Directed by Mike Nichols with a script by Wesley Strick and Jim Harrison (of Legends of the Fall fame), Nicholson is at his brilliant best as the jaded lead editor of a publishing house recently acquired by a billionaire asset stripper played in suitably predatory fashion by the excellent Christopher Plummer.  He gets the `shot in the arm' needed to fight back against the twin evils of rampant capitalism and cuckolding prot&eacute;g&eacute; Spader, who has more than an eye on Nicholson's wife, Nelligan, and his mentor's job, from an 'obliging' wolf, when travelling back from a business trip through the frozen wilds of a New England winter.  When asked to visit Plummer, ostensibly to be offered a `sideways' move but, in reality, a lower prestige job, he encounters Plummer's slightly wayward daughter, Pfeiffer, who plays her spoilt little rich girl part to perfection and who, initially at any rate, is only too willing to ally herself to Nicholson as a way of spiting her presumably negligent father.

There are, too, turns by stalwart Brit actors, Prunella Scales and Eileen Atkins and Frazier's David Hyde Pierce.  The movie has wit, irony, elegance and a superb and, by turns, lushly romantic and jazzy Ennio Morricone score: all this and some wonderfully amusing moments make for a truly enjoyable experience even if the label `horror' normally turns you off.
