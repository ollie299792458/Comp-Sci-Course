Yeah she is still Mariah Carey... the same Mariah that we all loved &amp; cherished back in the day &amp; I'm still her #1 fan. This film may be a little too late to show that she can act BUT the Glitter movie showed that Mariah can give veteran actresses a run for their money. Yes, I can give you alot of details that you can look out for so you can hate this film, like poor script(the Dice verbal buy-out of Mariah/Billie from her former manager failed to convince me that such thing is possible coz there was never a contract so the former manager really can't stake a claim to Mariah/Billie unless that verbal agreement was put into writing &amp; Dice could've have always consulted a lawyer to ask the former manager to back off since Billie is a famous star already &amp; she can afford to protect her status from a sleaze like him) &amp; yeah, poor visuals. They kinda concentrated on a lot of gloomy events &amp; trouble in Billie's life but let's all see the movie's plus side for all it's worth : 1) Mariah can act, &amp; SHE CAN ACT WELL , she's a natural, save for her consciousness on her teeth so she refuses to give a natural smile on-cam , 2) the movie was inspirational 3) the songs are good - those who thrived in the 80's era will appreciate the soundtrack 4) somehow the movie pulled an emotional plug on me, i cried in the end w/ what happened to Billie &amp; Dice's lovestory &amp; 5) the best thing is that, this is just Mariah's first solo-starrer! Let's all hope for the best in her upcoming movies. MARIAH - GO GLITTER !
