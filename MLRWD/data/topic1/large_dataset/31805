Okay, the mother goes ballistic and attacks someone she is interviewing on live TV.  She is fired from her executive job and is recovering, and during this time she plans a party for her son, and who else attends, but sheiks, ambassadors, and princes and kings from around the world.  Let me repeat, she was FIRED from her job for physically ATTACKING someone she was interviewing, and a short time later she is hosting a party for the world's elite, who all fly in from around the world?  Do the people who write this tripe expect us to believe this even for one second?

Then, when Charlie (Jennifer Lopez) finds Kevin (Michael Vartan) kissing a beautiful woman upstairs at this very party(sent upstairs to break them up by the over-the-top evil mother), she is not even irked enough to ask the simple question of "why were you kissing that girl?"!!!!  What planet are these writers from?  Because whatever planet it is, it certainly is not the third from the sun.

And when Charlie is walking the 3 dogs on the beach and Kevin surprises her with a coffee, she turns around, closes her eyes, and Kevin whispers into her ear for what seem to be several minutes.  During this entire time, her eyes are closed and she is not moving at all.  Obviously, the writers have never taken a dog for a walk on a beach when it is on a leash, let alone THREE of them!

First, I cannot believe this made it to a working script, but the fact that it was funded as a major movie is simply mind-boggling.  Hollywood needs to hire people whose sole job is to go around and say "Hey, wait a minute, don't do that!" before proceeding to waste money on films such as this.

The characters are not likable, nor believable, nor funny.  Add to this a poorly written script and what are we left with?  Answer: Monster-in-Law.

Ipecac is highly recommended for anyone who intends on watching this film straight through, though on second thought it is doubtful it will be needed after watching this rubbish.
