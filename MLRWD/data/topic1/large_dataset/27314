Joan Rivers : A Piece of Work really delivers.  If I have to be honest I was not always a fan of her work but truth be told I had limited knowledge of it. However, I have always been intrigued by her as a person.  Yes there are the constant jokes of extensive plastic surgery, etc. but I've always wondered what kind of person she was, when she wasn't on stage cracking jokes or commenting on the various fashion woes of hollywood celebrites.  Finally some of those questions have been answered!  This documentary was not only intriguing it was so well done. I have a new found interest in Joan Rivers, solely due to this film.  My distaste has been replaced by a fondness, something I never believed would happen, believe you me.  Watching her with her family and her staff I was able to see Joan Rivers for what she truly is - A Person!  Not only would I recommend this to anyone and everyone, I thank Ms Rivers for having the guts to put herself out there everyday working in a business she admittedly believes is truly unkind and unpredictable.  Thank you for your candidness (which is true to your reputation) and your drive to stay on top.  You have one more fan (besides William)!
