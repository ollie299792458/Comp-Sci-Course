"Charlotte....Charlotte....Charlotte," I can still hear the ghostly cries of Charlotte's name echoing through the Hollis plantation house.  Is it the voice of her dearly departed lover, John Mayhew? (played nicely by Bruce Dern). Returned from the other world softly calling for his dear Charlotte.  The harpsichord playing the soft and gentle song that he wrote for her, as he sings ...hush,...hush sweet Charlotte.  Was it Charlotte's father that murdered her beloved with an axe as he sat waiting for Charlotte in the summerhouse?  Or was it John's jealous wife, Jewel Mayhew (Mary Astor's final role, brilliantly done) that wielded the fatal blows?  Or perhaps it was Charlotte's own dear cousin Miriam (memorable performance by Olivia deHavilland) that hacked poor John to pieces?  Or could Dr. Drew (Joseph Cotton, seething with southern charm) have done such a terrible thing?  A southern gothic tale filled with chills and haunting atmosphere sweeps the viewer into a cobweb of mystery and suspense.  This is a classic cast of stellar performers who knew how to bring their audience into a story and keep them entertained until the very end.  "Hush....Hush, Sweet Charlotte" is filled with haunting atmosphere, suspense, and in one memorable scene, pure terror. Bette Davis gives her all, and then some, as the forever grieving Charlotte Hollis.  A southern heiress wrongfully accused of her lover's murder.  Agnes Moorehead goes over the top as kooky and eccentric housekeeper, Velma Crothers- her performance alone is worth the price of admission.  This film is among my personal favorite gothic ghost story movies.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of, "The Haunting" (1963), "The Innocents" (1961) and "Paranoiac" (1963).

**UPDATE!**  "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte" is now available in a fantastic 2-Disc Special Edition! Which you may buy either individually or as part of "The Bette Davis Centenary Celebration Collection!" Lots of extras and loads of fun!
